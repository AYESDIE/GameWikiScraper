In 2,800 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; emissaries arrived in Zul'Aman to help the Amani revitalize their empire and defeat the elves. To settle matters of leadership, they made Jintha, one of the Amani's most fearless warriors, the ruler of his people. Small Amani warbands began attacking the borders of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; before launching an all-out war against the high elves, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe outnumbered elves eventually allied with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. The Arathi host smashed into the Amani's southern flank on the outskirts of Quel'Thalas, while the high elves launched a counterattack on the trolls' northern front lines. Jintha remained confident in victory and considered the humans to only be a minor nuisance. He turned his warbands south, intending to quickly eradicate the Arathi and then refocus on exterminating the elves. He thereby unknowingly fell into the human king &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s trap. The Arathi army retreated south to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Fortress\"&gt;Alterac Fortress&lt;/a&gt; with the trolls in pursuit, while the high elves marched out of Quel'Thalas to harry the trolls' northern flank. After days of fighting in the Alterac foothills, the humans and elves revealed their secret weapon: the &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;One Hundred&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;, who combined their powers with the elves' sorcerers to create a firestorm that consumed the Amani army. Jintha was one of the first to be killed by the flames. Without their leader, the surviving trolls fled and were easily killed by the elves and humans, marking the end of the war."}

Jintha'Alor was built by the trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and named after &lt;a href=\"Jintha\"&gt;Jintha&lt;/a&gt;, a leader of the Amani in ancient times. It is the second largest city of the forest trolls, second only to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. It was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch tribe&lt;/a&gt; for many years and used as a fortress to sacrifice others.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Akil%27darah\"&gt;Totem of Akil'darah&lt;/a&gt; can be found here. Both the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; laid siege to the city, seeking to end the Vilebranch's incursions upon their land and claim vengeance for their fallen kindred. In the aftermath of this attack, the Revantusk took a step further and claimed the city for their tribe and the Horde.\nHistory.\nJintha'alor was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch tribe&lt;/a&gt;, where they often warred against the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; from within. They were ruled by &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Priestess%20Hexx\"&gt;Vile Priestess Hexx&lt;/a&gt;, a follower of the blood god, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. The Vilebranch would often prey upon the weaker Revantusk tribe to use them as sacrifices for their dark god, including one of the tribe's leaders, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Torntusk\"&gt;Elder Torntusk&lt;/a&gt;. During the attack that claimed Elder Torntusk, the guard captain of the Revantusk, &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%20Malkhor\"&gt;Huntsman Malkhor&lt;/a&gt;, was also captured. He was executed brutally, with his remains fed to wolves and oozes within the city. Adventurers of the Horde later came through and saved the Elder, killing the insidious &lt;a href=\"Hitah%27ya%20the%20Keeper\"&gt;Hitah'ya the Keeper&lt;/a&gt; to free the elder as well as avenge Malkhor.\nJintha'alor was also used to hold the &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sharpbeak\"&gt;Sharpbeak&lt;/a&gt;, captive. Adventurers of the Alliance aided the Wildhammer clan in freeing the gryphon so that he could reunite with his mother and father, &lt;a href=\"Sharpbeak\"&gt;Sharpbeak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keenclaw\"&gt;Keenclaw&lt;/a&gt;; the most powerful gryphons of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city was also the site of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egg\"&gt;Ancient Egg&lt;/a&gt;, a relic of Hakkar that was secured by hapless adventurers being deceived by &lt;a href=\"Yeh%27kinya\"&gt;Yeh'kinya&lt;/a&gt;, a follower of the Blood God. This egg would eventually be used to rebirth the Blood God himself. The altar at the top of the city was also used in an ancient ritual to create the &lt;a href=\"Mallet%20of%20Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Mallet of Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt;, which was used to summon the demigod &lt;a href=\"Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe Vilebranch continue to hold the city, though both the Revantusk Tribe and Wildhammer clan have begun a crusade to avenge their fallen as well as root the tribe from the city. The Revantusk tribe has claimed a small section by the entryway to the city, setting up a camp there with &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Torntusk\"&gt;Primal Torntusk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kotonga\"&gt;Kotonga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eliza%20Darkgrin\"&gt;Eliza Darkgrin&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Watcher\"&gt;Revantusk Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s. Down the road from the city, the Wildhammer have set up a camp including &lt;a href=\"Doran%20Steelwing\"&gt;Doran Steelwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fraggar%20Thundermantle\"&gt;Fraggar Thundermantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracker%20Yoro\"&gt;Tracker Yoro&lt;/a&gt;, and several &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Sentry\"&gt;Wildhammer Sentries&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vilebranch have turned from worshipping Hakkar to worshipping the spider god, Shadra, drinking her blood as they once did with Hakkar years ago. As the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; had years ago, the Vilebranch took over the nearby area of &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt; and prepared sacrifices within Jintha'alor to summon her. To aid this goal, they hid one of Shadra's tablets with &lt;a href=\"Morta%27gya%20the%20Keeper\"&gt;Morta'gya the Keeper&lt;/a&gt; and committed a mass suicidal sacrifice atop the city.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; curried favor with the loa, &lt;a href=\"Akil%27darah\"&gt;Akil'darah&lt;/a&gt;, after reclaiming her idol. This allowed them to teleport on the eagle's winds through the tiers of the city. The Wildhammer had returned with Sharpbeak, who was now grown enough to ferry travelers and reap vengeance for their previous capture. The Revantusk &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ongo%27longo\"&gt;Ongo'longo&lt;/a&gt;, was captured by the Vilebranch and kept in their fighting pit. Adventurers freed Ongo'longo, who went on a murderous spree of revenge on his way back to his people. By the end of the bloodbath within the city, the Wildhammer and Revantusk unveiled the plot to once again revive Shadra. The Wildhammers sought to prevent her revival, or at least kill her, while the Horde wanted to allow Shadra to be revived and slain so they could claim her venom yet again.\nThe Revantusk, however, claim the city for the Horde and their tribe, while the Wildhammer seemed to have no care for it in the aftermath of destruction.\nJintha'Alor digsites.\nThe Jintha'Alor ruins are a troll &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;. For &lt;a href=\"Survey\"&gt;Survey&lt;/a&gt; purposes, they are broken up into the Upper City Digsite, consisting of the uppermost two tiers, and the Lower City Digsite, covering the rest of the ruins.\nIn the RPG.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch trolls&lt;/a&gt; call this settlement home. Several smaller troll enclaves are scattered throughout the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "327552", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=327552", "title": "Jinyu", "text": "The jinyu are a race of humanoid fish-like creatures that live in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. They are an elder and wise race, looked up to even by the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;. Masters of the water, they have been known to stick their staffs in rivers and literally hear what the land is saying. The &lt;a href=\"waterspeaker\"&gt;waterspeaker&lt;/a&gt;s are an upper caste, spiritual leaders that use the river to listen to the future.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ankoan\"&gt;ankoan&lt;/a&gt; are descended from jinyu who left Pandaria long ago to hunt in the depths of the oceans.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe jinyu originated from &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s who were fortunate enough to live near the enchanted pools of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The magic of the pools expanded their minds and grew their bodies until they became one of the great ancient cultures of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. They worshipped the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s, and in return, the spirits offered them knowledge and guidance. For a time, there was peace. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt; particularly later became sacred to the jinyu, who now use its scrying pool to serve as their eyes and ears throughout the continent.\nIn the days before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, legend has it that all rivers flowed to Pandaria. Few were more aware of this than the clever jinyu. Over time the wisest of their people learned to commune with the waters of the river and listen for the future and news it would bring. These elders were respected by most races and earned their title of \"&lt;a href=\"Waterspeaker\"&gt;Waterspeaker&lt;/a&gt;s\". The jinyu also had a written language before the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;first mogu dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, though today it is not possible to understand it anymore.\nEmpire.\nIn time a &lt;a href=\"jinyu%20empire\"&gt;jinyu empire&lt;/a&gt; emerged, ruling all of Pandaria from the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. In the years before &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power, the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; clashed against the other races of Pandaria. The mogu fought against the jinyu empire in a battle that lasted forty days and forty nights. The power of the jinyu waterspeakers nearly defeated the mogu, but at the last moment they were slain by an &lt;a href=\"Haqin%20of%20the%20Hundred%20Spears\"&gt;unknown mogu foot soldier&lt;/a&gt;, who hurled the jinyu's own fishing spears back at them, piercing the waterspeakers' shields and deciding the battle. After this, the jinyu resistance ended. During the reign of mogu emperor Lei Shen, the mogu invaded the jinyu kingdoms and slaughtered all who opposed them. Afterwards, the jinyu were enslaved along with the other mortal races of Pandaria.\nThe jinyu took part in the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Revolution\"&gt;Pandaren Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, listening to the waters to divine where the mogu would first respond when the rebellion started. After the revolution, they apparently swore allegiance to the pandaren emperors.\nFeud with the hozen.\nThe jinyu have been at war with the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; for a very long time. Many thousand years ago, the Pearlfin tribe stood on the throne of all Pandaria. At some point the hozen approached them for help; the jinyu felt sorry for them and taught them how to survive. The jinyu gave them their trust, but over time the hozen grew strong and bold and began taking the land for their own, leading them to betray the ones that had helped them. Over time the jinyu experienced a waning of their numbers and influence, with Pearlfin Village now all that is left of their people. The jinyu appear to blame the hozen for the fall of their people and have been distrustful of outsiders and at war with the hozen ever since. Facing the hozen's \"dirty guerilla tactics\", the jinyu are outwitted by the hozen at every turn. The hozen are vastly superior on land, especially in areas with thick tree cover, but the jinyu have a strong advantage on or near water, allowing them to defend &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Village\"&gt;Pearlfin Village&lt;/a&gt;. The jinyu consider the hozen \"careless, filthy beasts\".\nThe source of this hatred stems from a betrayal suffered by the jinyu at the hands of the hozen during the war against the Thunder King. During the final battle against the mogu, the hozen betrayed the jinyu, believing that they would receive preferential treatment under the reign of the mogu empire. This betrayal ensured the jinyu's defeat.\nGreat Sundering.\nAll pandaren emperors began their reign by consulting great jinyu elders. When &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; was crowned emperor, a great &lt;a href=\"waterspeaker\"&gt;waterspeaker&lt;/a&gt; consulted the rivers and saw a vision of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Sundering, &lt;a href=\"the%20Monkey%20King\"&gt;the Monkey King&lt;/a&gt; went home and hurled &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%2C%20the%20Wanderer%27s%20Companion\"&gt;Fu Zan&lt;/a&gt; into a river in a fit of rage because his friend, Emperor Shaohao, had vanished. Eventually, he went to the river to retrieve the staff, but only because those waters were sacred for a jinyu tribe, and they could not remove it themselves-it was too heavy and still belonged to the Monkey King.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s encountered a jinyu named &lt;a href=\"Bold%20Karasshi\"&gt;Bold Karasshi&lt;/a&gt; and enlisted his aid in rescuing &lt;a href=\"Taylor\"&gt;Admiral Taylor&lt;/a&gt; from a hozen prison. After escaping their captors, the Alliance and jinyu prisoners seek sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Village\"&gt;Pearlfin Village&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20tribe\"&gt;Pearlfin tribe&lt;/a&gt;. After discovering that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has allied with the hozen, the Alliance group attempted to recruit the jinyu into the Alliance. After consulting with their water spirits and the spirit of the former jinyu emperor of Pandaria, &lt;a href=\"Rassharom\"&gt;Rassharom&lt;/a&gt;, the Pearlfin jinyu agreed to ally themselves with the Alliance. The Alliance group trained the Pearlfin in their superior military knowledge and arm them with weaponry. In exchange, the Pearlfin pledged their support in the Alliance's war against the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Fallsong%20Village\"&gt;Fallsong Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; was recently pillaged by the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; and asked adventurers to recover their stolen supplies and kill the leader of the raiding party.\nSome of the jinyu of &lt;a href=\"Inkgill%20Mere\"&gt;Inkgill Mere&lt;/a&gt; were corrupted by tainted &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; waters under the command of a sha-infused Elder &lt;a href=\"Shai%20Hu\"&gt;Shai Hu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Waterspeaker%20Gorai\"&gt;Waterspeaker Gorai&lt;/a&gt; asked adventurers to free what remains of his uncorrupted tribe from Shai Hu's tyranny, and help him cleanse the Mere's waters.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the jinyu wardens of the underground halls became corrupted and were fought by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, several jinyu could be found in &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;Boralus Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Bazaar\"&gt;Grand Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, selling their wares on the two islands. A hostile tribe of jinyu called the &lt;a href=\"Razorfin%20tribe\"&gt;Razorfin&lt;/a&gt; also could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Rotting%20Mire\"&gt;Rotting Mire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;Island Expedition&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCulture.\nPandaria is surrounded by and shot through with clear blue waters, and it is in these bodies of water that the amphibious jinyu flourish. In a sense, the jinyu maintain and cultivate natural water sources, even creating smaller streams with elemental magic. But the jinyu also exercise dominion over Pandaria's rivers and lakes that can bring them into conflict with other races. They regularly stop up rivers to create their homes and breeding pools, and the multifaceted dwellings they create aren't simple mud lodges \u2013 they are towns and camps that can extend beneath the water.\nJinyu society is caste-based. Jinyu are chosen for their roles (such as warriors or priests) at a young age, and final say in all communal decisions is granted to the elder jinyu in a tribe. While this rigid structure can seem constricting, the elders' roles are often deserved: they can speak and listen to the waters that flow throughout Pandaria, making them extremely wise and terribly powerful. Eggs are sorted early on based on the needs of the community. Many jinyu are cast as workers, diligently put to work building dams or other structures. Others are selected to be craftsmen and immediately undergo a rigid apprenticeship on hatching. Only warriors and priests are given access to the most food and finest shelters, and only the most successful of priests can ascend to the role of elder or waterspeaker. It is a taboo for the jinyu castes to intermingle.\nResourcefulness is a trait admired by the jinyu.\nJinyu pray over heirlooms or tokens of their dead in order to properly lay them to rest, and move on. &lt;a href=\"Hozen\"&gt;Hozen&lt;/a&gt; skulls are prized tokens among the jinyu. They use them to perform ceremonial rites, and the older the skull, the more potent its magic.\nJinyu assassins employ the &lt;a href=\"Ashwing%20Moth\"&gt;ashwing moth&lt;/a&gt; as both a portable decoy and a light source to reveal weak spots in their enemy's armor.\nWater forging.\nUnlike the fire and heat forges of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, the jinyu have mastered the art of water forging. They shape stone and metal by using the pressures and currents of water. Originally they would scavenge for polished stone and materials in the river. They developed an eye for the places that would provide the best quality baubles and rocks. Over the ages, they have learned to manipulate water through their magics to craft exceptional edifices of the rock and stone that defy rivalry. Their weapons and armor are as hard as any forged steel, and their walls often appear to be constructed without seams.\nStrider taming.\n&lt;a href=\"Water%20strider\"&gt;Water strider&lt;/a&gt;s serve an important role in Jinyu culture, acting as &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Water%20Strider\"&gt;mounts&lt;/a&gt;, a means of sending communications, and even family pets."}

When the Thunder King began to see all other races within his domain as servants, he launched a brutal campaign against the jinyu. Though they fought valiantly, the fish-men eventually crumbled before the might of Lei Shen.\nDuring one battle, the mogu fought against the jinyu empire in a battle that lasted forty days and forty nights. &lt;a href=\"Haqin%20of%20the%20Hundred%20Spears\"&gt;Haqin of the Hundred Spears&lt;/a&gt; countered their attacks and defenses and won the battle for the mogu.

He became one of Lei Shen's greatest lieutenants, and after his death, the spears were buried at his side.\nOn the eve of the jinyu's final stand against the mogu, they were betrayed by their allies, the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, who had secretly made a pact with Lei Shen. The hozen believed that in exchange for their loyalty to the Thunder King, they would receive preferential treatment under the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;'s reign (a promise that was never kept). This betrayal ensured the jinyu's defeat and created a vicious feud between the two races that would last for centuries.\nPearlfin.\nMany thousand years ago, the &lt;a href=\"pearlfin%20tribe\"&gt;Pearlfin Tribe&lt;/a&gt; stood on the throne of all Pandaria. They lost the throne when they were betrayed by their &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; allies. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled from the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the jinyu ruled Pandaria from the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rassharom\"&gt;Rassharom&lt;/a&gt;, Ancient Emperor of Pandaria, was a &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; emperor of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; in ancient times."}

Fleeing Roland's Doom, he made his way to Darkshire, where he bought a blank book from &lt;a href=\"Clerk%20Daltry\"&gt;Clerk Daltry&lt;/a&gt; and stayed a few days at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Raven%20Tavern\"&gt;Scarlet Raven Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, spending his nights writing in his journal.

{"id": "15423", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15423", "title": "Critical strike", "text": "Critical strike (often abbreviated as \"crit\") refers to 100% bonus &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; (twice your normal damage) that occurs as a result of an attack made with melee or ranged weapons. The chance to critical strike can be viewed in the character pane under melee stats and is affected by &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt;, critical strike, and &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s. Some classes have talents that increase the amount of bonus damage for critical strikes or talents that increase their critical strike chance. Attacks made by mobs can not result in a blocked critical strike, but this can result on a player attack. It can also be viewed by opening the character sheet, as well as the spell book and mousing over the \"attack\" ability. Notable about critical strikes is that any non-spell attack on a sitting target will always result with a critical hit.\nCritical strike.\nCritical strike is a &lt;a href=\"combat%20rating\"&gt;combat rating&lt;/a&gt; found on gear, enchants, and gems. Critical strike affects melee, ranged and spells.\nAgility.\nThe &lt;a href=\"agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt; you need to acquire 1% critical hit chance depends on your class and level. Keep in mind everyone has a base crit of 5% from agility. Only agility on gear adds to the base of 5%.\nEffect of increased crit or hit chance.\nBoth increased hit and crit chance have a kind of \"diminishing returns\" mechanic built in. A 1% increase of either stat will not increase the total damage output by 1%, but usually by a little less. Consider the following &lt;a href=\"Attack%20table\"&gt;Attack table&lt;/a&gt;:\n Damage = BaseDamage * ((1.00 - 0.02 - 0.05 - 0.05 - 0.05 - 0.25) + 2 * 0.25)\n = BaseDamage * 1.08\nNow the same calculation with 26% crit chance:\n Damage = BaseDamage * ((1.00 - 0.02 - 0.05 - 0.05 - 0.05 - 0.26) + 2 * 0.26)\n = BaseDamage * 1.09\nWe increased the total damage output by 1% of the base damage. Since the total output is more than 100% of that base damage, the actual increase in total damage output is \"only\" 0.93%. If the total output is significantly greater than the base damage, this percentage will be smaller, if the total output is below the base damage, the resulting increase will even be higher than 1%.\nWhat's better, +hit or +crit?\nIn principle they are equal. Which is better depends on circumstances. An increase in &lt;a href=\"hit\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; rate will usually yield a constant level of damage, whereas a high crit chance gives a spiky, more random damage distribution over time. An important factor is whether there are procs related to either hits or critical hits. Also, both ratings have caps (which are not fixed to a certain % but rather depend on multiple factors such as hit chance and enemy's level). To hit can only be used to counter the base chance to miss (5% for one or two-hand users without any off-hand weapon, and 24% for dualwielders), whereas the crit chance cannot become higher than available space for hit chance. If a dual wielder attacks a target with a high chance to dodge or parry the attacker can lose crit chance because the attack table is full. (See the \"Crit Cap\" section below.)\nFor example, a dual wield in a raid, attacking from behind, with a 0 chance to hit, you have a maximum critical chance of 40%. Any additional critical chance increase is wasted. This number might seem high but take into consideration talents, potions, buffs, procs and skills that increase your crit rate to 50% or more, these are wasted.\nFrom a raiding perspective, your miss chance increases by 3% (so 8% and 27% - base of 8% for special attacks) and increasing your Hit to at the very least cover your Special attacks is seen as more beneficial than increasing your Critical chance. After you have hit that level, you can focus more heavily on Critical Chance. \nCrit cap.\nWhite-damage attacks made by a player against a mob 3 levels higher have a fixed 24% chance of being glancing blows.\nTherefore, with no +expertise/+hit gear on, and no talents or racial abilities that increase Expertise or the chance to hit, attacks by a player against a target that is 3 levels higher have the following &lt;a href=\"Attack%20table\"&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; from the front:\nAttacks against mobs made from the back cannot be blocked or parried. Losing those values from the chart makes the \"combined hit + crit\" entry appropriately larger.\n\"Players\" cannot dodge, parry, or block attacks from the back.\nIt is not as bad if the same character attacks the same mob from the front with a two-handed weapon:\nThis is a 40% + your +hit + 2x your Expertise bonus crit cap.\nFinally, consider attacking the mob from the rear, where the mob cannot block or parry:\nAll these crit caps could have been increased by increasing your Expertise (0.5% increase per point from the front, 0.25% increase per point from the rear) and by +hit (1% increase per percantage increase in your Hit chance).\nDual wield full raid buffs example from the front:\n +0 hit +50% crit: 6.5% dodge, 14% parry, 28.0% miss, 6.5% block, 25% glancing blow, 20% crit \n = 30% of your crit rate did nothing\n +6% hit +40% crit: 6.5% dodge, 14% parry, 6.5% block, 22.0% miss, 25% glancing blow, 26% crit \n = 14% of your crit rate did nothing\n +15% hit +31% crit: 6.5% dodge, 14% parry, 6.5% block, 13% miss, 25% glancing blow, 31% crit, 4% hit \n = no +crit was wasted in this example \nDual wield full raid buffs example from the back:\n +0 hit +50% crit: 6.5% dodge, 28.0% miss, 25% glancing blow, 40.5% crit \n = 9.5% of your crit rate did nothing\n +6% hit +40% crit: 6.5% dodge, 22.0% miss, 25% glancing blow, 40% crit, 6.5% hit \n = no +crit was wasted in this example\n +15% hit +33% crit: 6.5% dodge, 13% miss, 25% glancing blow, 33.0% crit, 22.5% hit \n = no +crit was wasted in this example\nDPS implications.\nHit is very important due to the crit cap. The following shows the difference in white damage between various stat options:\n Assuming 30% crit and +0% hit from the front, its\n 6.5% block for 70% damage\n 20% crit for 200% damage (impale doesn't work on white-damage attacks!)\n 25% glancing blow for 70% damage\n 48.5% miss, dodge, or parry for no damage\n per swing its an average of .065 * .7 + .20 * 2 + .25 * .7 \n = 62.05% of your damage per swing\n Assuming you add +5% hit, the numbers become...\n 6.5% block for 70% damage\n 25% crit for 200% damage\n 25% glancing blow for 70% damage\n 43.5% miss, dodge, or parry no damage\n so per swing its an average of .065 * .7 + .25 * 2 + .25 * .7 \n = 72.05% of your damage per swing\nEnhancers.\nVarious items can be added to your equipment (or imbibed) to increase your chance to critically hit."}

They can take the form of sheep, seals, boars, or helboars. Critters usually wander around the map during the battle or stay in concentrated areas. They can be attacked and killed by player units and will not fight back. Alternatively, as an in-game joke, rapidly clicking on a critter multiple times will cause it to explode and die. A unit may also be transformed into a critter by a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29%23Spells\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nCritters can be targeted by spells. While this seems pointless at first glance, casting spells such as &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29%23Spells\"&gt;Flame Shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20II%29%23Spells\"&gt;Death Coil&lt;/a&gt; on them can be useful in certain situations.\nComputer players do not deliberately target Critters.

{"id": "15353", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15353", "title": "Crocolisk", "text": "A crocolisk (sometimes referred to simply as a croc) is a six-legged, amphibious, reptilian predator found in coastal waters that bears much resemblance to a &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt; or the real-life .\nBackground.\nArchaeologists believe they may be descended from the &lt;a href=\"diemetradon\"&gt;diemetradon&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. After studying the crocolisk species for several years, the famed angler &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle\"&gt;Nat Pagle&lt;/a&gt; determined that baby crocolisks are mostly harmless. Crocolisks are powerful amphibious predators common in most regions of Azeroth, attacking unwary adventurers sailing their waterways. Crocolisks are usually found near bodies of water such as rivers, marshes and lakes. They exist naturally in both fresh and saltwater environments, preferring to remain close to land. They are found in the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; (such as the elusive &lt;a href=\"Sewer%20Beast\"&gt;Sewer Beast&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe crocolisk's hide and meat are prized by hunters, but the beast is ferocious and seldom taken by surprise.\nRumors exist of very old crocolisks that have grown to enormous sizes. The beast known as &lt;a href=\"Manglemaw%27s%20Mother\"&gt;Manglemaw's Mother&lt;/a&gt;, however, grew extremely large despite the fact that she can't have been over a dozen years old. This was due to the runoff waters of the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Power\"&gt;Pools of Power&lt;/a&gt; flowing through the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, which is also what allows the vegetables that the &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt; grow there to reach humongous sizes. According to &lt;a href=\"Yan\"&gt;Yan&lt;/a&gt;, \"the odd giant crocolisk every now and again is really just a side effect\".\nDue to the corruption emanating from &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, some of the crocolisks living in the Wetlands have gained poisonous bites.\nAs a hunter pet.\nCrocolisks are a family of &lt;a href=\"Ferocity\"&gt;Ferocity pets&lt;/a&gt; and are tamable by Hunter starting at level 10. They can through use of their &lt;a href=\"Ankle%20Crack\"&gt;Ankle Crack&lt;/a&gt; ability reduce an enemy target's movement speed by 50% for 6 seconds. This ability can be very handy in &lt;a href=\"PVP\"&gt;PVP&lt;/a&gt;, and may even have a few &lt;a href=\"PVE\"&gt;PVE&lt;/a&gt; uses. There are nine different skins available for crocolisk pets. Most notable is , available only to &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt;, and the rare black crocolisk , who can only be tamed once summoned as part of the &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Pit%20of%20Scales%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Pit of Scales (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrocolisks are however not very popular as a hunter pet. They were known to make a hissing noise when they sit still, much to the annoyance of some hunters. This was removed, but first impressions didn't bode well. They became more popular after a model update in Cataclysm.\nIn the RPG.\nThey are massive in length and covered in thick, rough scales that run from the end of its tail to the tip of its maw. Mottled green in color with yellowish fangs, the beasts are supported by six squat legs with webbed feet, each of which ends in short, black claws.\nThey are proficient swimmers, able to surge forward with bursts of speed that often catch prey by surprise. They prefer to feed on relatively defenseless prey, such as small, aquatic creatures or larger land creatures that flounder when crossing bodies of water. However, crocolisks never hesitate to defend their territory aggressively from trespassers. A crocolisk usually lies in wait, submerged near the edge of a body of water with only its eyes and nostrils showing. When it spots prey, it charges to the attack. It lacerates the victim until it bleeds to death, then drags the corpse back to its watery home. Crocolisks become stealthy while they are in the water. Further, a crocolisk can lie in the water with only its eyes and nostrils showing, and can hide as long as it remains motionless."}

The &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;nation of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, was described as being located on the island, outside the city of Dalaran itself. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; besieged the island during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and the region was later attacked again when the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; invaded Dalaran in search of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe island first appeared in ' and possibly appears in ', as well as being mentioned in the novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\". However, it does not appear in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\"; Dalaran is instead depicted as a city-state on the shore of Lordamere Lake, and the Violet Citadel is located inside the city rather than on an island outside it. Cross Island has not been mentioned in any other sources since.\nSpeculation.\nIn \"Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness\", a stretch of land connects Cross Island to Lordamere's southern shore, which would technically make it a peninsula, however, this is most probably because no bridges are included in the game.\nIn \"\", the northwest portion of Cross Island may possibly be visible in two of the level maps (&lt;a href=\"Misconceptions%20%28WC3%20BloodElf%29\"&gt;Misconceptions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Dark%20Covenant%20%28WC3%20BloodElf%29\"&gt;A Dark Covenant&lt;/a&gt;). Although not clearly recognizable, it still seems to have remained cross-shaped, but other level maps mentioned below might suggest that its southern shore was transformed into a moat. It is possible that the southwest portion was seen during &lt;a href=\"Under%20the%20Burning%20Sky%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;Under the Burning Sky&lt;/a&gt;, the southern portion was seen during &lt;a href=\"The%20Siege%20of%20Dalaran%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;The Siege of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and the southeastern portion during &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins%20of%20Dalaran%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;The Ruins of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;."}

They tend to fire slower than bows, but cause more &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; on a hit. They are similar to &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;s in use. Character stats are applied the same way for each type, although the item stats will be different from item to item.\nUsage.\nCrossbows can be used by &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. Naturally, given it is a weapon, crossbows are used to cause damage. The different classes will however use crossbows a bit differently.\nRogues and warriors can wield crossbows, but they can't use any melee weapons when wielding one.\nHunters are perhaps the only class which \"truly\" uses crossbows; that is, uses them as weapons instead of just enjoying the stats. Before &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, which caused hunters to use &lt;a href=\"focus\"&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, there were crossbows made purely for hunters; one example is &lt;a href=\"Truestrike%20Crossbow\"&gt;Truestrike Crossbow&lt;/a&gt; which used to have &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt; on it, boosting the hunter's mana. Given how hunters could have a greater use of a crossbow than rogues, crossbows were still considered to be hunter weapons.\nAs hunters use crossbows as weapons, the attack value of a crossbow becomes very relevant to them. The perhaps most important stat is the &lt;a href=\"weapon%20speed\"&gt;weapon speed&lt;/a&gt; which somewhat determines how much damage a weapon is capable of generating. The faster the speed, the more but weaker attacks - the slower the speed, the lesser but more powerful attacks. Generally, the latter is the most favorable. As mentioned on top this article, the weapon speed on crossbows is usually slower than on guns and bows.\nThe fastest crossbow in the game is the &lt;a href=\"Frigid%20Crossbow\"&gt;Frigid Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;. The two slowest are the &lt;a href=\"Steelarrow%20Crossbow\"&gt;Steelarrow Crossbow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashjre%27thul%2C%20Crossbow%20of%20Smiting\"&gt;Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting&lt;/a&gt; - the latter was one of the most powerful weapons in pre-. Notably, these two also are the slowest ranged weapons in the game as of patch 5.1.0.\nAcquiring and upgrading.\nThere are several ways to acquire a crossbow. Like all other weapons and armor, they can be:\nThere are also different ways to improve your crossbow:\nThe availability of crossbows is more limited than the availability of bows and guns in World of Warcraft."}

Combined with its central location and the &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; flight routes, the Crossroads offers access to nearly all Horde outposts in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. As such, this small crossing is usually the first place you will see large gatherings of players outside of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crossroads &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt; is considered the &lt;a href=\"Graveyard%23Default%20graveyards\"&gt;default graveyard&lt;/a&gt; for Horde players, much like the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; graveyard for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players.\nDespite having only few lodgings, the Crossroads is a busy bustling trade center. &lt;a href=\"Merchant\"&gt;Traders&lt;/a&gt; enjoy shouting their wares and interests. Just past the settlement, there is a burial area that the Horde members visit to pay their respects to the dead.\nHistory.\nCataclysm.\nThe day before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; hit, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces streamed from &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the town.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a large Alliance army advanced on the Crossroads in an attempt to capture it and cut off &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Horde forces were sent to stop them.\nShadowlands.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, Crossroads came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. It was defended by the town's inhabitants, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nPvP.\nIn addition to the numerous Horde players that gather there, Crossroads attracts its fair share of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players as well. Within striking distance of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and the port of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; to the east, it is not uncommon to find an all out war happening outside one of the entrances of Crossroads on a daily basis. Larger scale Alliance assaults tend to occur during peak server population periods (between 4 PM and around midnight).\nThe area outside the inn also serves as an informal practice ground for PvP, and offers a good place for lower level Horde players to cut their teeth, as these are skills that they will likely need when facing the Alliance in more sparsely populated, remote regions later on.\nIn the RPG.\nCrossroads serves as a hub for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; activities in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and provides them with flying mounts as well. &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; is found south of this settlement. Crossroads is run mainly by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, though it is populated by &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s as well, and there are several &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; working with the Horde here. The village's leader is &lt;a href=\"Thork\"&gt;Thork&lt;/a&gt;, an orc who is concerned with defending the town against the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;. Crossroads is a helpful stop-off for any Horde adventurers traveling through the Barrens and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; members would be wise to avoid it.\nAlthough the hostilities between the Alliance and the Horde are in full swing in the region, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; are considered fairly unthreatening, for that reason &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was able to convince Crossroads' guards that he was simply there to learn about &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; ruins in the area and move on, and even though he got a few dangerous looks, the Horde tolerated his presence.\n&lt;a href=\"Nara%20Wildmane\"&gt;Nara Wildmane&lt;/a&gt; resides here, and because the settlement is in close proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, she keeps track of the comings and goings of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s in the area."}

{"id": "13081", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13081", "title": "Crowd control", "text": "Crowd control (often abbreviated to CC) refers to spells and abilities which limit an opponents ability to participate in a fight. Crowd control abilities can be divided into two distinct categories: loss of control abilities, and positional control abilities.\nLoss of control abilities are such that when used, the target loses the ability to participate in a battle (be it an NPC or player). They are essentially taken out of play for the duration of the controlling spell. Positional control abilities, however, do not remove control over the unit but may hinder it in some other form (target may still use its abilities to an extent).\nAll raid bosses are immune to all forms of crowd control. Elite mobs may or may not have high resistance to, or be immune to, specific CC that would normally work on their non-elite counterparts. Player characters are susceptible to most forms of CC, but are subject to &lt;a href=\"Diminishing%20Returns\"&gt;Diminishing Returns&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the two categories discussed, further forms of crowd control exist, similar to the way magical spells are divided in to schools (e.g. Holy, Shadow):\nHowever, as of Warlords of Draenor, the number of CC types with diminishing returns in PvP was drastically reduced to just six types: Roots, Stuns, Incapacitates (including Polymorph, Sap, Charm and Sleep types), Disorients (including Fear, Horrify, and Cyclone), Silences, and AoE Knockbacks. While Snares continued to exist, they were never affected by DRs and hence never given a classification during this transition.\nPvE strategy.\nThe strategy for crowd control was generally well understood in vanilla &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; expansion. During the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; expansion, use of crowd control diminished as it was not well suited to the &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; based tanking style of play that the expansion favoured. With the release of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; expansion, crowd control is once again used frequently in instances.\nRaid icons.\nTo use crowd control effectively in an instance, it is necessary to select and communicate which mobs will be controlled. This is most commonly done through the assignment of &lt;a href=\"Raid%20target%20icons\"&gt;raid icons&lt;/a&gt; and the establishment of a default \"kill order\" based on the icons chosen. For example, it is customary for players to treat a mob marked with a skull icon as the first target to be killed, followed by X. At the other end, it is often customary to use the moon icon as the \"last target\" to be killed, and to designate that target for a repeatable crowd control such as the spell &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;. The blue square is also commonly used for this purpose. The star icon is often associated with the rogue's &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt; ability, and is also often associated as a third or fourth target in the kill order. This dual-meaning is partly due to the fact that Sap may only be used at the beginning of the fight, so it is necessary to kill the rogue's target as the fight progresses sooner than other targets that may be crowd controlled indefinitely.\nIt is reccomended that the kill order be established to include the order in which crowd controlled targets will be killed (for example, one could declare that square will be killed before moon). Repeatable crowd control abilities should be kept last in the order, for maximum effect. In the event that group participants confuse the targets and go out of order, is generally best to follow the tank's lead. If possible, crowd control the other target instead. To aid in preventing confusion, group leaders might consider assigning the skull icon to a key and then progressively assigning the icon to the preferred target as each previous target is killed.\nPositioning.\nTo effectively employ most forms of crowd control, it is necessary to avoid causing damage to a target that will break the effect prematurely. For this reason, tanks should take care to pull the fighting mobs a short distance away from controlled ones so that AoE abilities will not cause accidental damage. One way to mitigate this problem is to select casters or ranged-attackers to be controlled, or to use line of sight tactics.\nIf the crowd control fails and the mob enters the fray, the player may have to abandon the use of crowd control. It is particularly difficult to apply crowd control once there are &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; effects on the target. If possible, select an alternative target and announce the change of targets.\nMacros.\nPlayers responsible for the application of crowd control are well advised to take advantage of &lt;a href=\"Macro\"&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt;. A common strategy is to assign a &lt;a href=\"Focus%20target\"&gt;focus target&lt;/a&gt; and use a macro to cast the crowd control ability on the focus target without diselecting the current target.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nWith \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" the amount of crowd control in the game will be dramatically reduced, and the number of &lt;a href=\"diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt; categories reduced. \nFor the lastest announced patch changes, see &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"Lil%27%20Smoky\"&gt;Lil' Smoky&lt;/a&gt; pet implies that \"crowd pummelers\" are a type of armament that a robot can have.

Since Gnomeregan's fall, most are programmed to attack anything that is not a &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrowd pummelers recognize &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, but only an experienced tinker, using the correct technological codes, may command them. In the past, a pummeler warned nearby violators aloud, giving them a short time to halt their offenses, but now all they say is \"Intruder!\" before charging.\nCrowd pummelers lack finesse, simply charging into combat and smashing any enemy in sight. If multiple crowd pummelers are commanded to capture a target, one bashes and others deal nonlethal damage."}

It may also lead to real world identity theft or theft of the purchaser's WoW account depending on the reliability and intentions of the gold selling company.\nThere are four major money making strategies; &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"daily%20quests\"&gt;daily quests&lt;/a&gt; and using the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of gold earned depends on the dedication of the player, the economy of the auction house on the server, the server ratios of casual, serious and hardcore players and time periods surrounding a major patch.\nOverview.\nThis guide covers many of the ins and outs of both making money, and spending it wisely. Many players have \"secret\" strategies for making money that they wouldn't want to put in a public info site, since it gives them their edge in the marketplace. If you can gain the trust of a successful WoW tycoon, you should ask them some of their techniques. However, this guide covers many of the more common strategies.\nQuick guide.\nIf you don't want to read this entire article, but you're primarily focused on how to get your mount at level 20, follow these steps. They will work for anyone, require no &lt;a href=\"grinding\"&gt;grinding&lt;/a&gt; sessions and generally offer a high reward-to-time ratio:\nIf you follow this basic advice you should have no problem at paying for the mount at level 20 and you will always be able to afford skill training, food and potions along the way.\nCold booting your economy.\nYou've started a new character with no alts for support, and you are dealing in the coppers level. How do you get your financial engine rolling?\nMost of these should sell for silvers each in the auction house:\nOne of your first purchases should be more bags. The &lt;a href=\"Traveler%27s%20Backpack\"&gt;Traveler's Backpack&lt;/a&gt; can only hold so much, and if you have to leave things behind due to a lack of bag space, you're losing revenue. &lt;a href=\"Netherweave%20Bag\"&gt;Netherweave Bags&lt;/a&gt; are great once you can afford them, but for now try to get each of your bag slots filled with a bag that'll hold 6-12 items, sell vendor junk at every opportunity, and use your bank for longer-term storage.\nIf you are a low level (1-10) and need bags, but don't have the money, consider hunting rare mobs in the starting areas. Many low level rare mobs drop 6-slot bags to help get you started If not, they may drop a white or green piece of equipment. Mulgore in particular is a good hunting spot.\nDetailed guide.\nFor those interested in more details on spending wisely and generating good cashflow, we cover a number of topics in more detail. Please note that this guide represents the accumulated wisdom of many people. You don't necessarily have to do all of these things\u2014there is no one \"right\" way to make and manage money. However, these pointers will give you ideas on how to establish a firm financial foundation for your character.\nSaving your money.\nThe most important step in being able to buy a mount and make other large purchases should be self-evident - saving. Economize as often as you can and don't buy anything unless you absolutely have to. You can burn through hundreds of gold even before level 20 by visiting the auction house for new equipment at every opportunity. If you do so over the long haul, you will be left with very little to show for it. Before level 20, keep your eyes on the prize: getting that mount. The mount helps you move faster. Faster movement means faster killing, faster questing, faster quest turn-ins and faster leveling. It is the most important tool to fast leveling you can get at level 20 and infinitely more important than getting your hands on that Left-Handed Vorpal Cleaver of the Zipswitch that you could have purchased at level 23. Stay focused.\nThe same goes for the level 40 mount. An elite ground mount means still-faster leveling. Not only that, but you'll get knocked off considerably less often by mobs while getting around inside zones, meaning you'll die less often as well. Remember, as the goblins are so fond of saying, \"Time is money, friend!\" So it behooves you to get an elite ground mount as rapidly as possible.\nOnce your character makes it to Outland and beyond, cashflow frees up considerably. The quest rewards are much better than in Azeroth. In fact, a typical character will earn from in quest rewards and vendor trash while leveling 60-70 in Outland, and perhaps from 70-80 in Northrend. The tendency is, therefore, to spend more freely after one hits 60. However, it is important for players not to go crazy on their spending once they make it to Hellfire. One thing is, training costs, repair costs, and consumable costs are also higher. More important, there is a large purchase that you are going to want to make at some point after level 60, your first flying mount and skill. The \"bird\" costs , the skill will cost you far more. Not only that, but if you want to fly it in Northrend at level 70, you'll have to shell out another for Cold Weather Flying. And for those characters who will be 'farming' herbs or ore in either Outland or Northrend, an elite flying mount is almost essential, as it helps you gather almost twice as fast. That's another you'll be looking at. Therefore, budgeting carefully during the 60-80 leveling process is essential to ensuring you have sufficient cash on hand for making those purchases. Saving your pennies early makes that bird appear that much sooner.\nHere are some things to consider when budgeting your money:\nBank alt.\nAn &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; (secondary character) in a capital city is an effective way to not only cheaply increase your available bank space, but to be a simple savings and auctioneer account. This character can serve as your bank, an auctioneer, bag-space creator and a time saver. Get one. (There may or may not be Item Recovery issues with characters below level 10, in cases where one's account is hacked.)\nTo use it as a bank, figure out how much you want to have on-hand on your character based on how much you normally spend on repairs, food, ammo, etc. and send the rest to the bank alt. The principle here is \"Out of sight, out of mind.\". Money \"you don't have\" cannot be spent without logging out of your character, and then logging into the alt. That brief moment may be enough to deter an impulse purchase.\nTo use the bank alt as an auctioneer, send all your auctionable items from your alts to your bank alt and organize all your auctions from this character. This saves your time spent on auction house management, focuses all your income to one character and allows for easier overview of your cash flow. Consider using an alt management addon to be able to access all information about your alts from your bank character. One such addon is &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/altoholic.aspx\"&gt;Altoholic&lt;/a&gt;\nTo use it as a bag-space creator, simply send excess items to the bank alt whenever you're near a mailbox for a low price of only a slot. Even if you accidentally send the wrong item to the bank alt, it can be returned-to-sender for free. It's very quick, because sending mail between characters on the same account is always instant.\nAltogether, focusing all these activities on one character saves large amounts of time. While the easiest thing to do is to create a character and run them straight to Stormwind or Orgrimmar, consider leveling your bank alt at least a little bit. Level five or ten should be sufficient, and it only takes a few hours. Why bother?\nEconomizing on professions.\nImproper leveling of your production profession skills can cost a small fortune. Heck, even \"proper\" leveling of some production skills can cost a small fortune. And keep in mind that equipment you produce using your profession will typically be slightly worse than equipment otherwise obtainable at your level via the Auction House and/or instances. Elixirs and scrolls rarely sell until the level cap, even when priced at a loss. It is therefore strongly recommended \"not\" to take on a production trade skill until you hit at least level 30, or better yet, level 70+. However, if you are determined to take on such a profession (particularly under level 30), read a suitable leveling guide in order to gain whatever skill level you desire for the least amount of money.\nYou can also reduce your out-of-pocket cost by choosing complementary professions, such that the outputs of one profession provide inputs for the other. For example, leveling Alchemy to 525 can cost thousands of gold, even using the most efficient recipes; most of that will be lost money, as few players see a need for elixirs while leveling, or are even aware of their existence. However, if your Alchemist is also an Herbalist, you will collect hundreds of herbs during the leveling process without really trying, and will have the option of farming your own herbs if time is more plentiful than money, or if Auction House prices are unreasonable. The &lt;a href=\"Professions\"&gt;Professions&lt;/a&gt; page provides detailed advice on complementary professions.\nGetting good equipment without breaking the bank.\nThe most important part of saving is to never buy equipment unless you're positive that it will increase your earning potential, \"or\" significantly speed your character's leveling progress. While it is true that gear is important, it is also true that an overemphasis on having great gear \"before level 80\" is dumb. Who cares if you're wearing a blue sword at level 43? If you're advancing well, you aren't going to be level 43 for very long anyway.\nThe two best ways to get good equipment are:\nA common mistake of new players is to upgrade their gear at every opportunity, paying for a new piece even if it will only add one or two new stat points over an existing item. Likewise, investing in headgear, neckwear, trinkets and rings at the earliest available levels can also consume valuable cash. While it might seem foolish to leave an available slot empty, you will eventually find something to fill it. In the mean time, the or more you save will serve you well if you invest it wisely. One can easily level all the way to 80 relying on just quest/drop greens. Instance blues help a fair bit, too, but aren't essential.\nThis is not to say that you should \"never\" buy gear. Having equipment that is reasonably current while leveling allows you to kill enemies faster and die less often in the process. Faster leveling = higher levels (where the real money is to be made). Likewise, death = loss of time. And as we all know, \"Time is money, friend!\" So, players should not hesitate to make well-considered equipment acquisitions during their leveling up, but \"only\" if they represent a substantial improvement over their existing equipment \"and\" if the price is right. Try to find good deals. Look several levels above and below your own for bargains. Don't buy items that you won't hold onto for at least 4-5 levels. And don't always use the buyout option at the AH. Some of the best deals come from bidding and being patient. If you know there's an item that would be great for you five levels from now, keep your eye out for it and bid on it. When you get it, stuff it away for later.\nNote that these general principles do \"not\" apply to &lt;a href=\"blue\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"purple\"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt; items. If you are a first-time player, there is absolutely no reason to purchase these items. None. Sub-80 rare and epic items are only for the alts or twinks of established players that have money to waste by showing off. Blues and purples are completely cost-ineffective for first-time characters. Within a few levels, you will find green gear that is roughly comparable, or you'll get better blues from instance runs at the same level. So, do not buy these items, under any circumstances, to equip. This is especially true as your character gets closer to levels 58 and 68. Even the most basic quest-reward gear in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; will have substantially better stats than anything you can buy off the AH for a level 56 or 66 character. As such, smart players stop making AH gear purchases by about level 54 or so and then just gut it out until level 58. The same is true at levels 64-68. Within the first several quests in Outland and/or Northrend you'll have replaced half of your gear, guaranteed.\nBuying items on the Auction House.\nThe Auction House is always the best option for getting good equipment at a good price. The only items you should be buying from Vendors are basic consumables: food, drinks, vials, dyes, etc. Most other things should come from the Auction House, as they are generally cheaper. Keep these tips in mind when buying items off the Auction House:\nThe Auctioneer addon.\nAnyone who is serious about using the Auction House should consider getting the &lt;a href=\"Auctioneer%20%28AddOn%29\"&gt;Auctioneer&lt;/a&gt; addon. Auctioneer assists players in the auction house by automatically gathering price information for your server. Among other things, Auctioneer offers the following useful features:\nNote, however, that Auctioneer is a very complex tool. Some would say \"too\" complex, in that the addon has a myriad of options for searching for and/or auctioning items. Be prepared to spend some time with the tool to become acquainted with options.\nMaximizing training bang for the buck.\nThere are a lot of &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s you can &lt;a href=\"train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; as you progress, each of which costs money. When you can afford to, you should train all the abilities that your class trainer offers. If you're completely broke, it's fine to put off upgrading abilities you rarely use for a level or two so that you can upgrade your most-used abilities. If this happens, you should ask yourself whether you are spending too much money on buying unnecessary equipment upgrades or leveling production trade skills. Be sure to save enough for class abilities and riding training before spending money on other things. This assumes you're earning money at a rate where buying skills makes a difference at all. If you have a hundred gold from two gathering professions by level 20, those skill ranks costing a fraction of a gold won't make any difference to your purse.\nIf you are dead set on leveling a production trade skill instead of taking two of the gathering skills, remember that not everything your trainer offers is worth buying. While it might be nice to have a long list of colorful shirts and dresses to produce as a tailor, for instance, the truth is they offer very little in the way of potential revenue. Also keep in mind that, generally, whatever items you craft at lower levels will not likely sell for more money than you could have made by simply selling the raw materials used to make them. For this reason, two gathering skills are highly recommended until you get closer to 80 (70 if you don't have the WotLK expansion or 60 if you don't have the TBC expansion).\nWorld of Warcraft offers a lot of ways to make money (gold). There is no one \"right\" way to make money, although there are some definite wrong ways! Some people like to play the Auction House, some people do their daily quests, some people tend to farm, etc. Many characters do a combination of all three of these along with other activities. Below is a compendium of money-making methods.\nSelling vendor trash.\nAny item with a grey name is considered &lt;a href=\"vendor%20trash\"&gt;vendor trash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"poor\"&gt;poor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt;. White items have some use such as &lt;a href=\"tradeskills\"&gt;tradeskills&lt;/a&gt; or as spell reagents, so you may want to check to see if they're worth more than the vendor price. Keep your eyes out for regular quality weapons, as even the worst of these tend to sell for several silver, or several gold at high level. Always check the tooltip for the vendor price before discarding anything. Also, white (or even grey) shoulder armor under level 20 sells regularly on the auction house, mainly because there is nothing better available at that level.\nUnless low quality items have some known quest use or are coveted by other players, you should try to sell it as soon as possible to create bag space. Always (or almost always, see above exceptions) keep things like cloth, leather, herbs, or large stacks of white/gray items over other loot when you have to decide what to keep when your bags get full. It might be worth your while to invest in larger bags (10-20 slot), especially if you know a tailor.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curse.com/addons/wow/sell-o-matic-2\"&gt;Sell-O-Matic&lt;/a&gt; is a particularly handy addon if you regularly bring home several bags' worth of trash all mixed in with the rest of your inventory - it allows you to sell all gray items to the vendor with a single click.\nIn general, if you have bag space, you should \"always\" pick up whatever vendor trash you can, particularly weapons, even if they are grey. Don't be too proud. This stuff may not sell for much, but vendor trash can easily pay for your repair bills, and as you level past your 60s that's not an inconsiderable amount of money.\nPlaying the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; (AH) is a brilliant way of making money if you know the tricks on how to do it. The basic strategy with the AH is to buy things cheap, re-list them on the AH, and then sell them for a profit. Even better, of course, is to get good items from drops and then sell them on the Auction House for pure profit. Many players generate most or all of their cashflow simply by speculating on the AH. So a good understanding of the it, as well as some time to invest, is essential to turning it into a money-making proposition for you. It is also highly recommended that you get the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//auctioneeraddon.com/\"&gt;Auctioneer&lt;/a&gt; addon for quick listing auctions, and knowing the average price of items.\nYour &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; population may determine how much profit you can make. Lower population servers generally have lower prices in the AH as there is less demand, but rare items or recipes can really make a profit as they are harder to come by. Higher population servers have a higher demand. However, they are more likely to have a flooded market, which makes items hard to sell, especially in the case of low-level gathering professions.\nBuying items for speculation.\nBuying items for speculation means buying item cheap in hopes of reselling for more. This works, this works well, but this works only if you know your market. Stick to what you know. Make cautious forays into unknown areas to test the waters.]\nItems to speculate on are not merely cheap; there must also be a demand or you will end up with a lot of cheap items sitting in your inventory. Items that are always in demand are:\nRecipes - provide in-game capability to create more kinds of items, and so are always in demand, BUT be careful; if the ingredients are obscure, and the benefits marginal, or the recipe is too common, this is not a good option. Some otherwise very good recipes drop far to often to hold value - Copper Chain Vest comes to mind. This produces an excellent entry-level item, but the recipe is available for low silver at the auction house. \n&lt;a href=\"Small%20pet\"&gt;Pets&lt;/a&gt; - Reasonably good for speculation, but track demand a bit before you invest. \nIf you make a mistake in speculating, admit that you made a mistake and move on. Sell the item for what you can to recover as much as you can.\nConverting Materials.\nMany trade materials can be created from other materials. For example, metal can be sold in either ore or bar form, each with its own audience and level of demand. Check the prices for both materials, and look for opportunities to convert one to the other; if &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Ore\"&gt;Copper Ore&lt;/a&gt; sells for each, and a &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Bar\"&gt;Copper Bar&lt;/a&gt; sells for , even a low-level miner can buy the ore, smelt it into bars, and sell the bars for a profit. Likewise, jewelcrafters can prospect ore to yield gems, and enchanters can disenchant armor or weapons into dust and essences. As this is a form of speculation, the same rules apply: start small, know your audience, and don't get too heavily leveraged on one product.\nTwink items.\nMany players who already have higher level characters create alts that they level to a certain point and then stop. Often, these &lt;a href=\"twinks\"&gt;twinks&lt;/a&gt; are level 18-19, 28-29, 38-39, etc. for the purpose of going to battlegrounds at the top of their tiers and kicking butt. Since these twinked characters are owned by higher level players with lots of cash, they usually outfit them with the best gear available at their level. Thus, items that require level 17-19, level 27-29, or any other items around this level, with good stats or dps, often sell for much higher prices than they normally would. This is especially true on an older server, and also especially true of blue (rare) items. In general, \"good stats\" include Cloth \"of the Eagle\" (for mages, warlocks), Leather \"of the Monkey\" (for hunters and rogues), and Mail \"of the Bear\" (for warriors/paladins)as well as weapons with these suffixes that can be used by the right class.\nNeutral Auction House.\nThe goblins of the Steamweedle cartel have set up several neutral auction houses about Azeroth. Gadgetzan, Booty Bay, and Everlook all house neutral auction houses. The neutral AH is useful for making money, as commodities that Alliance players can get easily can be sold at a profit to Horde players (or vice versa), who may then sell the product on their faction Auction House for a higher price. For example, is sold by a single Horde-aligned vendor in Brill, and is sold by a single Alliance vendor in Ashenvale. These recipes are only accessible to the other faction through the neutral Auction House, so they can often be sold for many times their purchase price.\nBuying items from vendors for resale.\nAlthough you usually don't want to buy items to sell from vendor, some items can be sold for much more than you pay for them from the vendor. There are a few reasons people will buy a vendor item for a higher cost at the AH. They vendor may be hard to get to, the recipe only sells in limited stock, or the buyer simply may not know where the item is from.\nSome players even turn this into their profession by systematically \"plundering\" vendors in the game world and then selling the items on the auction house at a significant markup. The reason why this works (even for items which are on unlimited supply at vendors) is, that many players don't want to spend time traveling to specific vendors to get hold of a recipe or skill book. They would rather pay a slightly higher price at their local auction house. In some sense, they use the auction house as a \"super market\" or \"convenience store\". So it is completely reasonable and legitimate to be the supplier for this convenience store and make money out of it.\nThis scheme works particularly well with items such as:\nPlayers wishing to avoid spending vastly over the odds on a vendor pattern should consider using &lt;a href=\"http%3A//fizzwidget.com/adspace/\"&gt;Adspace&lt;/a&gt;, which will add information to tooltips for patterns, books and similar items detailing their vendor cost and location.\nUsing Your guild.\n&lt;a href=\"Guild\"&gt;Guild&lt;/a&gt;s are perhaps one the most effective ways of progressing your character, and in turn, making money.\nGuild Perks.\nA well-established guild can offer you &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Perks\"&gt;Guild Perks&lt;/a&gt; which range from useful to incredibly lucrative! Some of these include:\nGuild Bank.\nMost 'high-end' guilds have a &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt; where members donate items for other members. This may range from potions, reagents, and craftable plans. Usually you will have to donate to a guild bank in order to receive items as well as stay active in your guild, but receiving potions that will aid your progression and craftable plans allowing you to profit off selling the products will benefit you in the long run. Also, donating to your guild bank may mean donating something you cannot use in turn receiving something you can use.\nGuild runs.\nIf your guild runs PvE content, it's a good idea to join in! Guild runs generally have better communication with each other, resulting in receiving gear faster from dungeons and raids, running more frequently in a shorter amount of time, and in turn making more money from runs. In a well put together guild, members become a close knit community including financial and questing support, which are among the most profitable benefits. If you have not considered joining a guild as part of your strategy moving through the game, you may wish to strongly reconsider.\nSoloing Instances.\nFor level 80 characters, almost any old-world instance can be completed solo even in mediocre gear, and Outland dungeons and Heroics and be completed with better gear and a fair amount of practice. At level 85, Outland Heroics and old-world raids are trivial with a little practice, while Karazhan and Wrath Heroics are within reach. If you can &lt;a href=\"Solo\"&gt;Solo&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;, you have two options. The first is to take the place apart yourself and sell all the drops on the Auction House.\nSoloing an instance can be all the more profitable if your character is an enchanter. During any solo instance run, you'll end up with some items which can be sold or traded, and some that are bind-on-pickup (almost all boss drops bind on pickup). Non-enchanters can only sell these soulbound items to a vendor, but an enchanter can disenchant the bind-on-pickup rare items, and then sell the shard/dust/essence instead of just selling the blue item to a vendor. (A side benefit of selling enchanting materials is that they require only a deposit to list in the auction house, allowing you to list endlessly until the item sells.) Be sure to check your Auction House to see what each type of material is worth; some sell for so little that it's better to vendor the item. Keep an eye out that might be useful for Transmogrification. An item can sell for hundreds of gold if it looks interesting enough.\nThe second way to make money by soloing dungeons is to offer to run people through the instance for a price. Even with &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; in place, some people get desperate to run a certain instance. Whether they need it for &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;rep&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, or specific &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;, they're willing to pay a pretty penny for it. You can turn that desperation into a tidy profit.\nCompleting quests.\nNearly all quests offer cash or items as a reward, and often both. While completing quests shouldn't be your main form of wealth generation, it is something you are going to do anyway. The key to making the most of quests is picking your reward items wisely. Don't always pick the item that most fits your class - if it isn't demonstrably better than your current item, instead go for whatever reward sells for the greatest amount to the vendor. You can select the in-game interface option to display it in the tooltip. In general, if you can't use a quest reward for your character, pick either a plate-armor or melee weapon as your reward\u2014these tend to sell to vendors for more than other items.\nCompleting daily quests.\nRepetitive &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quests&lt;/a&gt; are a legitimate method of generating significant cashflow. Though farming, crafting, and playing the Auction House each have better cash-per-hour potential at the level cap, dailies are still a staple of the working-class player's income. By planning out an efficient route, a player can complete his/her allotment of 25 daily quests within two hours, generating 100- per hour depending on level, professions, and farming activity. Many players have funded the purchase of their elite flying mounts solely through doing daily quests. The Burning Crusade expansion introduced daily quests, so a player's first large-scale exposure to daily quests will come at level 70. However, cooking and fishing dailies are available at level 5 in each capital city.\nAnother trick for higher level players is to do level 70 dailies during the Northrend level grind, and Northrend dailies during the Cataclysm levels. The quests are much easier at higher levels, but still award gold and EXP. If you have a hankering to get a Netherdrake, for instance, and you already have a fast flying mount (which is a pre-requisite for the drake), you will find your mid-70s an ideal time to go get that drake. Not only will the quests be a \"lot\" easier to do at level 75+, but the dailies will pay about as you level rep, \"and\" you'll get EXP along the way to boot (though usually less EXP per hour than you'd get for questing in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.) Similarly, Northrend dailies award around and 22,000 EXP each ( at the level cap), and are very easy to complete at level 83 in full Cataclysm gear. So if you're looking for a break from the grind of leveling, and want to kick back, spank some level 69 mobs and make some decent money along the way, doing lower level dailies can be a fun way to make some extra cash.\nElemental Items.\nElemental items (Primals, Eternals, etc.) can be a good source of money, because they are always in demand on the AH. See which mobs you will most benefit from farming, then set out for a few hours. In the process you will also most likely collect significant vendor trash, and may get other profitable item drops as well. Note, however, that older elemental drops usually lose profitability compared to newer ones, i.e. Primal Water sold well to level 70 players in , but sells far less well to level 80 players in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;WotLK&lt;/a&gt;, because level 80 gear requires Eternal this'n'that.\nUsing your Trade Skills (Professions).\nLook in the Auction House for items that sell for good prices, but don't have a big supply in the market, so your prices won't get much competition.\nSometimes you can make money by crafting items with ingredients supplied by other players who give you a tip to make the item. This is not necessarily a reliable source at low levels, but it can be a good supplemental income source at higher levels, particularly if you have good recipes. And if you can charge for the customer using your materials (as opposed to materials supplied by him/her), you can mark those up.\nGathering skills.\n&lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt; are all good money-making professions, particularly at higher levels.\nWith Mining, from the moment you take the skill you can make good money selling stacks of the bars or ores in the Auction House. Blacksmiths, Engineers and Jewelcrafters are interested in the bars, while Jewelcrafters and even other miners may want to buy the ores. Make sure to check the relative prices of ore versus bars before smelting. As your skill increases, so does your earning potential.\nSkinning is both highly profitable and convenient, in that you will be skinning the monsters that you're already killing as you level. A skinner starts by collecting relatively worthless ruined leather scraps, but soon moves on to light leather, which can be sold for a good profit. An excellent way to farm leather is to skin the kills of other players, especially if you are following along in the wake of a group. However, do wait to start skinning until it's clear that the other player has abandoned the kill. Don't assume that the other player doesn't skin just because they are not a leather-wearer, for example. Note that your chances of getting a better grade of leather increases with your experience; it is possible, though rare, to get light leather from rabbits. Higher grades of leather yield higher profits. A skinner/miner has potent earning power through the auction house, but often runs out of inventory space.\nHerbalism is also a good source of money. Herbs are required by &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"inscription\"&gt;scribes&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike ore which is found only in rocky areas, herbs can be found in many places. Be sure to check on the auction house for what herbs are in demand for a high value; often a lower level one is very valuable, so you can farm an area you already know for quick money.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;, consider getting the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gatherer\"&gt;Gatherer&lt;/a&gt; addon. This maps nodes and herbs on your minimap, allowing you to know which spots to visit when you are farming.\n&lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommon item recipes to look for include:\nThese items sell well for decent money, even though they are common &lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; items. Beware, these recipes can be pricey if you buy them, so try to get a bargain and ask around to see if you are getting a good price.\nBlacksmiths should also watch the prices for \"Needed by\" items such as the metal &lt;a href=\"rod\"&gt;rod&lt;/a&gt;s used by enchanters, and compare the price for the raw materials. For example, a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Rod\"&gt;Golden Rod&lt;/a&gt; requires\nThere's a good chance you can buy the raw materials for 25% - 75% of the going rate of the finished item, or mine them for free. The fee for an 8 hour auction is only 1 silver, so you can afford to re-auction rods that don't sell the first time. Be careful of making too many rods or other parts of a kind at once, though, as you may get stuck with them for a long time when others produce the same item and set a cheaper price to it.\n&lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is usually good money to be made selling bags, particularly the upper-level bags. This is particularly profitable if you are able to farm the majority of the materials.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a constant market for transmutations. If you are capable of doing these, you can charge an upcharge on each of those transmutes. A player who logs on his/her character each day, and sticks to it, can generate a significant subsidiary revenue scheme through transmutes. Likewise, if you have a transmute that allows you to transmute a lower value element into a high-priced one, you can make a cool profit every day by simply doing your transmutes.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Bar\"&gt;Arcanite Bar&lt;/a&gt; still remains a great source of income for Alchemists due to its continuous demand.\n&lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafting &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s is profitable if you have the right designs. Usually only the high level jewelcrafting (JC) are sought for gems, but you can make gold at low levels from JC too!\nJewelcrafters can create jewelery for other players, which can make big profits. Often players buying for their &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s will invest in low-level rings and necklaces, simply as rings and necklaces from quests are hard to find. You can make a tidy sum by selling these items in the Auction House.\nJewelcrafting also offers players the &lt;a href=\"Prospecting\"&gt;Prospecting&lt;/a&gt; ability; players can break down most &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt; ores to find gems used in &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"http%3A//enchantrix.org/\"&gt;Enchantrix&lt;/a&gt; addon can calculate the prospecting value of an ore, and when combined with the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//auctioneeraddon.com/\"&gt;Auctioneer&lt;/a&gt; addon, you can compare the prospect value to the ore's value and determine whether it has a fair chance of producing a profit. For example, on most servers &lt;a href=\"Tin%20Ore\"&gt;Tin Ore&lt;/a&gt; has a significantly higher prospect value than the ore itself, and players can make a tidy profit by prospecting tin from the AH. The low skill needed to prospect tin ore makes this a great profession choice for bank alts!\n&lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Glyph\"&gt;Glyph&lt;/a&gt;s are pretty cheap to produce and some of them are highly sought after, especially those learned at higher levels. Learn which glyphs are in demand and you may get a nice amount of gold by selling them. Don't assume that a high average price of a glyph means that it is in demand; if nobody is buying it, it doesn't matter what the price is.\nYou should also further develop your inscription skill through &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Inscription%20Research\"&gt;minor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend%20Inscription%20Research\"&gt;Northrend Inscription Research&lt;/a&gt;. If you're lucky, you may get a glyph that people want \"and\" not every inscriber can make, which can give you more gold. Research them every day to get those high yield recipes faster.\nAdditionally, you can make tomes held in the off-hand and the Darkmoon cards. These take more materials to make, but the tomes are classified as rare items and can fetch a good price, and even the lower level decks of cards can get you a BoE rare to sell.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile enchanting is generally considered expensive to level, you can make a profit with it as soon as you start &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanting&lt;/a&gt;. It is not unlikely that almost any green item in this case will have a buyout price for a lot less than the materials it disenchants into. Likewise, it is lucrative to check the auction house for green items with unpopular suffixes, such as \"of the Gorilla,\" with low starting bids.\nYou may want to get a another player or friend to disenchant items for you. Of course offer them some kind of fee or tip for their time, your overall profit will be greater.\nSelling &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt;s can also make some money, but usually only when you have very high level (over 400). Thus, enchanting is isn't really recommended as a good early money making source, particularly because its leveling costs are quite high.\nIf you use a dedicated &lt;a href=\"banker\"&gt;banker&lt;/a&gt; alt, that does nothing but work the Auction House, have him/her pick up enchanting, so this character can disenchant low-level items.\nSecondary Skills.\n&lt;a href=\"Cooking\"&gt;Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough cooking generally doesn't make money, at the top level you can cook foods which raiders use. These can sell for a few gold \"each\", so if you buy cheap meats on the AH, or farm them yourself, you can earn a tidy profit.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt;.\nFishing goes hand-in-hand with cooking. If you can fish up your own high-end meats, cook them, and sell them, you can make much more profit than just selling the raw fish.\nThe few exceptions to this rule are low-level fish which are used to level cooking, but you can make money here too. For players who don't have the patience to fish, they will pay a great deal to level their cooking skill quickly via the auction house. So target those common recipes such as:\n&lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Fish\"&gt;Deviate Fish&lt;/a&gt; is a lucrative fish, which sells well cooked or uncooked.\n&lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough mainly for vanity items, this profession can also be lucrative if you sell any &lt;a href=\"Keystone\"&gt;Keystone&lt;/a&gt;s you acquire.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;First Aid&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaking a profit with First Aid is unlikely, but possible. Firstly, \"never\" vendor any cloth. If you make it into bandages, it sells for a lot more than the basic cloth does. Secondly, a bandage might save your life, and save on repair costs, so stock up!\nClass-specific.\nLockpicking.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s can make fast money from pickpocketing mobs, opening lockboxes and selling items that drop from those on the AH. If you don't have a rogue make one and get him to at least level 16. &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s can also make some money by picking locks for people and getting tips. Not a great revenue source, but a decent one to supplement multiple strategies for making money. Generally, the usual lockpicking tip is between 50s to 1 gold, the most common being 50 silver. Sometimes, you can get lucky and have someone tip up to 5 gold for lockpicking several (or even just one) boxes. It's always beneficial for a rogue spending time doing repairing, training, etc. in a city to put up a lockpicking advertisement on the trade channel. Just make sure you let the buyers decide the price and that your lockpicking level is high enough.\nSummoning or portal opening.\nThese are &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;- and &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;-only skills which can net you some money. It's not much, but a few gold is worth it. Note that Mages have an easier time with this than Warlocks as Warlocks need to be at the location for the summoning and need an additional person (a 3rd) for the group to help out with the summons. Mages only need the reagent to open the portal. While the Warlock doesn't incur a cost (except the loss of a soul shard), the Mage will typically be more successful at finding employment using this method.\nRisky Tactics.\nBegging.\nNothing says \"loser\" like begging. Everyone (and I mean everyone) hates beggars. Don't do it. If you don't care about &lt;a href=\"etiquette\"&gt;etiquette&lt;/a&gt;, you can make a small amount of money this way, but it isn't as efficient as the regular (and respectable) ways of making money. You can never tell how an unknown player is going to react, but if you do any amount of begging you will probably earn some dislike.\nPromising to pay strangers back if they give you the money is a nice gesture, but is likely to be met with skepticism and cynicism. Better to try this with a friend or a guildmate than with strangers, and always, always keep your word.\nIf you find yourself coveting your first mount, and with no money to purchase it, try to swallow your frustration and work at earning and saving up so you can buy it honestly. Nothing is more annoying to other players who are working hard to earn their own money than hearing someone begging for gold so that they can buy a mount or fancy piece of gear.\nThat being said, there are occasions when a little kindness is not unwarranted. A typical example is a new player who just dinged level 20. They are suddenly confronted with a whole set of relatively expensive skills at his or her class trainer, and the cost of mount and &lt;a href=\"riding\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; training, and needs a small amount of money to learn those new skills. Likewise, sometimes one sees a player who, just by the way s/he walks, is clearly a new player. Kindness to non-whiny, well-intentioned, legitimately inquisitive newbies is karmically rewarding, and one should not worry about shelling out an occasional boon to such players. Remember, at that level, a few gold can go a long way. Heck, even a few older bags that you have lying around collecting dust in your vault will often be much appreciated.\nDueling.\nThis is a risky way to make money, and not recommended. Tell a player that if he beats you in a duel you will give him 10 gold, but if you beat him he has to give you 5 gold. This can be very effective if you are skilled in PvP and make the bet with a trustworthy person, or friends. It is a very risky strategy, as you may lose gold, or the other player won't cough up the money anyway. You will also get a bad reputation if you don't cough up the money in the case of defeat.\nTreat Your Profession Like A \"Business\".\nPerhaps the best and most secure way to make money within the game is to apply some basic business practice to your Professions. While some of these tips are common sense and common knowledge, it can't hurt to be reminded of basic principles of trade.\nAs previously stated, people will only buy your wares if they want it. Do not waste time gathering or producing items that people do not need. Focus on items that will most likely be wanted and bought.\nProfit is only created if you make sure your costs are less than your earnings. This is not so much an issue for gatherers who simply trade in some time and effort to gain their wares, but for production professions, this must be kept in mind. Many high-end items that sell well require materials that cannot be provided by the gathering profession normally paired with your production profession. To craft these items, purchasing the raw material from the AH or another player becomes necessary. You must keep record of how much you spent to obtain these materials, or else you may price the finished product inaccurately, either too low that you sell it at a loss, or too high that you can't sell it all.\nRecord keeping is thus necessary to ensure profit. Listing expenditures in a notebook or the like will help make sure you sell your items at the \"right\" price. This may seem excessive and time consuming, but it will save you a lot of time and effort in your endeavors to earn cash.\nFor items that you can gather directly, you have the choice of either going out to gather them yourself or to buy them from the AH. The former adds no cost to your item but requires time and effort, while the latter can be quick and hassle-free. Even should you choose to get the materials yourself, don't forget to add them to your cost \u2014 your labor and time should be compensated for, even if just a little.\nWhen buying raw materials from the AH, keep an eye out for bargains. Choose only the cheapest items available to keep costs down. Try scanning the whole section of item listings in the AH to check prices; often the prices for stacks of items in the AH are much cheaper than individual pieces (for example, a single &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Bar\"&gt;Thorium Bar&lt;/a&gt; may be priced at 3 , but a stack of 10 may actually be priced at only 2 per Thorium Bar) \u2014 you may spend more to acquire your materials, but you also save more and ensure larger profit in the long run. You can find a lot of terrific bargains this way.\nOnce you have assembled all the materials required to make the item, you can then refer to your records for how much you spent to acquire those goods in order to come up with your total \"cost\" \u2014 the price at which you would break even if you sell the item. From there, you can assign a higher selling price that gives your profit.\nWhen assigning a selling price, do not aim for too low a price that would give you too little profit, but certainly do not assign too high a price. Too much greed is never a good thing, and the AH is filled with items that do not sell due to excessive inflation. A very common tactic in the AH is to sell for lower than what another player is offering, and many players make a lot of money that way. Similarly, losing sales thanks to being undercut is never fun. Aim for as low a price you can that will still make you a good profit. If you can keep producing the same item over and over, sell cheaply yet make a good amount of the item, you will reliably make a lot of money by volume. Moving inventory is the best kind of inventory.\nSimilarly, when earning by volume, do not overload the AH with your items. Basic supply and demand: too much supply will make your wares too common and unwanted. Furthermore, with great demand and a cheaper price, you may end up starting a price war with your competitors, with them actively trying to undercut and outdo you. Moderate the amount of items you're selling on the AH to small batches, refilling them only when sold out.\nOnce you have your finished product and have a price for it, keep in mind that using either your faction AH or the neutral AH also costs money: if the item does not sell, its deposit is taken by the AH; if it does sell, the deposit is returned, but a cut from the payment it taken by the AH as a commission. You must factor this into your selling price: your faction's AH will take 5% from your sale, while the neutral ones will take 15%. You can factor this into your cost to determine the minimum price at which you need to sell to at least break even:\n Break Even price = Cost / 0.95\n Break Even price = Cost / 0.85\nIn the event your item does not sell but you still wish to try selling it again in the AH, factor in the deposit you paid for the previous auction.\n New price = Item's original price + (deposit / 0.95)\n New price = Item's original price + (deposit / 0.85)\nThis is cumulative, as you take into account each failed sale as a loss. In the event too many deposits accumulate, you must decide whether to continue selling the item inflated by too many sales or finding of another way to dispose of it. One final tip: when you find that an item fails to sell in one AH, selling it on the other may finally dispose of it and get you your earnings.\nConclusion.\nWhatever your approach, if you use some common sense and apply yourself, you can make significant quantities of money in the game. By managing your cashflow, conserving and budgeting where you can, and investing wisely in those activities that make you money, you can become financially solvent relatively early in your career, and remain comfortably well-off (while still buying good gear) at level 80. Good luck!"}

However, it can be much easier to find people to group within a larger guild. Smaller guilds are more personal. One complaint that players have about large guilds is that you often run into guild members you don't know (\"I don't know all these people.\"). With a smaller guild there is much more opportunity to get to know each member. For that reason, some players prefer a small guild. Ultimately, the \"Large vs. Small\" debate depends on the guild and the members that join. There are large guilds that still remain very good. Leadership and recruitment policies are the main factors in determining how a guild turns out.\nActive members.\nGuild size is less important than the amount of regularly online active members. Some small guilds have more active members than large guilds. A big problem with guilds as they grow is the abundance of &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s that pump up the guild size, but not the active membership. You want a guild with lots of active members, since that increases opportunities within the guild. Ideally, a guild you join will have active members in your level range.\nGrouping.\nGrouping can be a good way to find a guild. Team up with people and play with them for a while. Make friends with them and play together for several days. If they get to like you, they will usually want you in their guild so that you'll continue to play with them. After helping them out, inquire about their guild. Perhaps they may help you join. \nReputation.\nDo your own research into a specific guild. As guilds become powerful, well known, and popular, rumors about them begin to appear. Often when a guild member does something to offend a player, that offended player starts spreading stories about the entire guild. Jealous players make untrue generalizations about the guild and its members. Make sure you find out the real story on your own with whatever evidence you can find such as screenshots or web reports. Sometimes a guild may be good and is just the victim of a bad reputation. Guilds can be very jealous or hostile toward each other and thus make up rumors to hurt the reputation of the other guild. Or, perhaps, the reputation about that guild is true. Maybe the guild is full of troublemakers. Find out yourself.\nLarge guilds who don't keep good tabs on and train their members to behave often suffer from poor reputations because you don't know what to expect from their members. Generally it isn't a good idea to join a guild that doesn't maintain some standard of behavior because your reputation can get stained by some immature jerk who isn't brought in line by guild leadership.\nAnother point to take away is that what you do while in a guild may reflect on the reputation of your guild and may get you kicked out. You should try to find a guild that fits your play style. It's hard to believe, but some guilds form on the basis of being a bunch of jerks; however, most don't. So be aware of the image a guild wants to project.\nDiversity.\nAlthough some guilds form based on specific &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; affiliations, like \"Elf Druids of Elune\", most guild have a variety of races and classes. The best guilds have not only a variety of classes (race isn't so important to gameplay due to the nature of powergaming), but also many different &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s and play styles. If you like &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, you should look for a guild that focuses on that play style. If you're into making things, then a guild with a variety of trade skills should be sought. You may need specific classes to fill needs for doing quests in a dungeon or instance, so a guild with a diversity helps with all sorts of situations.\nVisit guild web sites.\nVisit the World of Warcraft.com Guild Recruitment forums. They contain links to various guild sites. You can visit their web sites, see what activities they engage in, and check out their rules. Quality guilds often have very good web sites and active forums, which can indicate that they are a good guild to join. You can also ask members of a guild if they have a web site.\nInterview guild members.\nIf you find a guild you like, interview some of their guild members. Ask them how things are in their guild and if they enjoy it. If you're interested in joining, ask them who you should talk to. Be very careful when messaging guild members because their impression of you is very important. If you offend the guild member, they may spread the word about your offensive request (via guild chat), and that could harm your chances of joining. Be on your best behavior. Asking to join one of the more powerful guilds can actually be similar to a job interview in real life. \nPositive guild behavior.\nThings to consider when looking for a guild: \nApplications.\nMany times a guild will request that you put an application on their guild site before they offer you a guild invitiation. This is particularly the case with &lt;a href=\"endgame\"&gt;endgame&lt;/a&gt; PvE guilds, who require a pool of skilled, intelligent players to progress through raid content. Just because a guild requires an application doesn't mean that they are an elitist or exclusive group. Often it is seen simply a routine requirement for any potential new member, or a way to quickly introduce them to current guild members.\nGuild applications vary wildly, but almost all will ask for your character name, class, level, and guild history. Many will also ask about your real-life age and gender, specific instances you are attuned or keyed for, raiding experience, hobbies or interests outside of WoW. In general it is a good idea to be as specific and thorough as possible on a guild application. Unless you already have grouped with or otherwise know current members of the guild, this will probably be their first introduction to you and if you are serious about becoming part of the guild you will want to make an impression that will improve your chances of getting an invite. Some guild leaders and officers look for specific things on an application (and there can also be specific things they watch out for) and in general a guild application is examined closely to determine whether the applicant would be a good addition to the guild as a whole. But the best policy is simply to be yourself; if you present yourself as someone who you aren't, your new guild will probably find out quickly (and you probably can find another guild that you will be happier in).\nSometimes guilds allow multiple people to apply as a group for the guild (often because they are real-life friends), but often they ask that you do not. If they do not, or if it is not clear whether they do, it is a bad idea to put in a group application. If you truly want to join a guild as a group, the best way in this situation is for one person to join the guild and let them get to know that person. If leaders determine that this first applicant is a good addition to the guild, they will often invite other people because they know that person. Even if this does not happen, you always have the option of leaving the guild in order to find a place that you and your friends are all welcome.\nConclusion.\nDo some research, shop around, and keep trying until you find a good guild. Don't give up. There are good guilds out there. You just have to find them. Remember, you can always create your own guild if you want and make one that follows your own requirements. \nLeaving a guild.\nType codice_1.\nIf you are the guild leader and want to disband Type codice_2\nDon't do this too much, because your reputation of guild hopping may catch up with you. Very few guild hoppers can have good reasons every time they quit. In that case, guilds suspect you don't do any research.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; expansion &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; has introduced &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Reputation\"&gt;Guild Reputation&lt;/a&gt;. If a player leaves a guild or is kicked that character's reputation will be reset to 0.\nStarting a guild.\nTalk to a guild master &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in a major &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Charter\"&gt;charter&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased for . You will need 4 other &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s to sign the charter before you can turn it in and start your guild. Due to a &lt;a href=\"bug\"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt;, your Guild Charter must be in your original backpack when you give it to the Guild Master to create your guild. Another bug is that sometimes the charter breaks and tells you that any name you choose already exists, including random letters. The only 'fix' for that is to delete the charter and start over. Choosing a tabard design costs , but the guild can be created without paying for the tabard design. When you still have the guild charter you can change the guild name to something that isn't taken.\nGuild names are case sensitive - this means that there could be two guilds, one named Guild of Rogues (spelled with a lowercase \"o\" in \"of\"), and the other named Guild Of Rogues (spelled with a capital \"O\" in \"Of\"), on the same server.\nNote: When signing a guild charter, once a player's character signs, no &lt;a href=\"alternate\"&gt;alternate&lt;/a&gt; characters on that account may sign. The charter must have signatures from 4 other &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s, each on a different account. This is why people sometimes offer to pay to have their charters signed. Yet you can have different character from the same account join the guild after charter is turned in.\nAlso, it is considered polite to ask someone to sign your charter before giving them the charter. When you spam someone your guild's charter it closes out the main bag window and any other windows they may have open (vendor, trade, etc.) It is extremely rude and annoying to the other player to do this. So please be polite.\nOnce you begin getting signatures on your charter, focus on getting the remaining signatures on your charter and registering the guild. Signatures can disappear if you delay, since players are allowed to put signatures on other charters until you turn yours in.\nGuild types.\nGuilds are often classified into types, such as Raid Guild, Social Guild, PvP Guild, Roleplaying Guild, etc. Keep in mind that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and many overlap (for example, some raid guilds like to participate in group PvP, some roleplaying guilds raid, etc).\nWhile raiding guilds are often very focused on raid preparation and progression, there are some cases where they also help members level or participate in group &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. As most raids are from level 55 and higher, a Raid Guild will most likely be exclusive to players that are in the mid to high 60-70s (many level 80 characters depending on guild). \nCommunicating in a guild.\nMost guild communication happens via &lt;a href=\"Chat%23Guild%20Specific%20Chat\"&gt;guild specific chat&lt;/a&gt;. The guild can also communicate via forums on a guild website. Often the guild will also communicate through a &lt;a href=\"VoIP\"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt; (voice chat) method, especially during instances, raids, or battlegrounds using programs such as Ventrilo or TeamSpeak.\nRunning a successful guild.\nRunning a guild is not easy, and can take a lot of time and effort. It can also be very rewarding. One of the most important aspects to any guild is the quality of its leadership. \nBefore you create a guild.\nBefore you create a guild, think first about what you want out of the guild you will create. Read through the &lt;a href=\"%23Guild%20types\"&gt;types of guilds&lt;/a&gt; listed above for ideas. Maybe you already know exactly what you want and who you want to join, but if not you should think about those things now.\nDevelop your ranks and come up with the responsibilities those ranks will have and what each member needs to do in order to prove they can handle/deserve those ranks. When you create your guild, use your guild control tab in your social window to change the titles and privileges each rank has to reflect your decisions on the infrastructure. If you eventually plan to make use of the full ten ranks allowed to you by the game, you should set them all up as soon as possible; the all-too-simple rank administration system will not let you reposition ranks, so you have to rename each rank leading up to the new rank spot, then demote everyone to their previous rank.\nCreating the guild.\nWhen you create a guild, you'll have four members. It is recommended that you be patient and actually find 4 people to sign the charter who will actually participate in the guild, not just people who will sign it to help you out and leave as soon as the guild is created. The guild charters were created for a good reason.\nAs your members join, make sure they understand the rules and goals that apply to the guild. This will decrease the possibility for drama and fighting within the guild. Use your guild message of the day to get out important information, for example: \"Our homepage is @ www.our-guild.com\" or \"guild meet 5pm Saturday in Orgrimmar\".\nCommunication.\nDevelop a means of communication exchange so members can communicate even when they aren't all online. Some guilds get by without this, but for end-game content guilds it is necessary. You can do this with an external website, from &lt;a href=\"Fansites%23Guild-related\"&gt;guild hosting services&lt;/a&gt; or a forum or website hosted by someone in the guild. Other options are using groups on social networks such as Facebook.\nTrust and Ranking.\nMost organizing of guild members happens via the UI or &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Slash%20Commands%23Guild%20Commands\"&gt;guild specific slash commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemember that it is okay to allow others to hold power. Promoting members who have earned your trust to \"Raid Leader\" or \"Veteran\" can be quite productive. Though in order to maintain a guild, it is important to realize that the structure of the guild can define stability. When assigning ranks and dealing with promotion, it is often accepted that trust must be involved. Do not allow members who are somewhat new to you to gain ranking at a certain rate because of their skill or complaints. If players complain about being a low rank, it is their right to leave. However, do not take this as a sign to promote them to make them to stay. Members must learn to attain a promotion only if they work for it. If you cannot establish this, then it is possible for your guild to quickly crumble.\nDo not promote people too fast. If you promote a new officer every other day, you're going to have 15 officers in a month. So be wary about who you choose to promote and how long they have been in the rank that they are currently before you promote them. It is acceptable for players to be initiates for months if they apply little-to-no effort in helping others in the guild. Remember that they should deserve the promotion; don't just give it away as an incentive for them to start getting more involved in the guild, as that will only give them more incentive to continue to do nothing. The ability to promote people is a very powerful privilege but if you use it too much, it will lose its power. On the other hand, if you use it too little, people will lose the incentive to continue to try to get somewhere in the guild. Keep that in mind.\nEncouragement.\nWhen someone gets promoted, when a new members joins, or when a member does something generous and so on, make sure you give them incentive to continue on that path. One tactic is to give out \"goodies\" like free enchantments to people in the guild when they are promoted to some of the higher ranks. Another VERY important thing to do is to congratulate someone on a job well done. Use your guild message of the day to say things like \"Congratulations [Player] on your promotion to OFFICER!\" or \"Welcome to the guild [Player]!\" Also if you have a guild homepage, it would be a nice thing to do to put these kinds of messages on the main page.\nBe enthusiastic. If you're not enjoying the guild, why should your members?\nGive your members goals. Give them a direction or something to feel like the guild is making progress towards \"something\" - whatever that something is, is really up to you and what you've designed the guild for.\nEmpower your members. If you've given your guild a goal, then give your members the feeling that they have the power to get the job done. You can do this by reinforcing their faith in themselves, or simple by encouraging statements like \"You're one of the best [class] on this realm, I know you can do it!\"\nEvents.\nHave regular guild events. Try to have some guild meets or events that will keep your members feeling like they are part of an active community. Guild events are a good way for you and the rest of the guild members to see each other and more importantly for you to see who's needs help, who has what it takes to be a sub-leader and who needs to be told \"don't do that.\" Make sure that you get the date and times of your guild events known to all your members via communications exchange like a homepage, guild message of the day, mail etc.\nDealing with conflict.\nShow your appreciation to your members and speak with those who are having problems. If you have someone that wants to leave your guild, don't let it burst your bubble. Everyone has feelings and if you speak to and (more importantly) listen to someone who wants to leave the guild, often enough you will find that they have a good reason for doing so.\nIt is inevitable that conflict will sometimes arise within the guild. The fairness and neutrality of the guild master is vital in resolving these issues, which can result from many things but are often due to perceived unfairness in some way. Do your best to listen to both sides and make a decision only after you fully understand the problem. Make sure to follow the rules you have set and not cave in to a player who breaks these rules, even if they have made significant contributions to the guild - this will only be bad for the guild in the long run, as other players will see it as unfair.\nOther resources.\nThere are some excellent resources for Guild Leaders on the official &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html%3FforumId%3D11124%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;World of Warcraft Guild Relations forum&lt;/a&gt;. The Guides and FAQs compiled there will be able to answer many of the questions you will have as a guild leader.\nGuild tabards and bank tabs.\nEach guild can design their own crest. This design is featured on &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Tabard\"&gt;tabards&lt;/a&gt; which all guild members can wear, as well as &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Battle%20Standard\"&gt;Guild Battle Standard&lt;/a&gt;s, and is used to represent the guild in places such as guild members' Guild tab, and on the official \"World of Warcraft\" website. The guild leader designs the tabard for a fee of from the Guild Master NPC found in any major city. In some cities, there is a separate Guild Tabard Designer NPC standing nearby.\nA player can purchase a tabard to wear for from a guild tabard vendor, found near the Guild Master NPC. If you are not in a guild, you may still purchase and wear a tabard, but it will be grey until you join a guild that has already chosen their design. The tabard is a visual symbol or badge of membership for each guild. The only purpose beyond the look is to display your guild or faction pride, otherwise tabards provide no mechanical benefit to your character. Once a tabard is designed, you must pay another each time to change it, so choose wisely the first time around.\nThe guild banks were introduced with &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt; to help reduce player-created guild bank characters which often led to Terms of Use violations. More expensive than tabards, guild banks provide space for members to share items, much like a \"multi-player bank.\" The Guild Leader can limit the players who can add and/or remove items from the bank. It features six purchasable tabs which have 98 item slots each; however, unlike personal banks, guild banks do not support the addition of loaded bags. The price for the first tab begins at , then increases for each successive tab, , , , , , for a grand total of . With Cataclysm came the &lt;a href=\"guild%20advancement\"&gt;guild advancement&lt;/a&gt; system, and two more bank tabs became available as guild perks: the seventh tab costs and is available to guilds that have reached level 5. The eighth tab costs and is available to guilds who have earned the &lt;a href=\"Stay%20Classy\"&gt;Stay Classy&lt;/a&gt; guild achievement. The price of the bank tabs have led a few guilds to tax their members and complain that the guild bank prices are tailored for hardcore players and raiders, not casual guilds. Other than items, gold can be stored and used for repairs.\nFrequently asked questions.\n What is the maximum number of characters that can be used in a guild name?\n How do I join a guild?\n How do I start my own guild?\n How do I leave a guild?\n How do I use the guild chat channel?\n What's the deal with tabards?\n How do I add people to my guild?\n How do I remove people from my guild?\n If I have a tabard with one guild, do I need to buy a new one if I join a different guild?\n Can a guild change its name or tabard?\n What's the deal with guild ranks?\n Why should I even join a guild?\nCreating a guild website.\nThere are many ways to build a guild website. The most common approaches are:\nTypical features for guild websites.\nGuild hosting services typically offer:\nPopular guild hosting services.\nA comprehensive list of guild hosting services can be found &lt;a href=\"Fansites%23Guild-related\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "241621", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=241621", "title": "Guild advancement", "text": "Guild advancement was a feature which allowed &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;s to level in a way similar to characters. \nThere were 25 levels for a guild to progress through. Experience towards level progression was gained through guild member participation in dungeon and raid boss kills, &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; victories, &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; victories, and profession skill-ups. \nTo qualify for guild &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;, a raid or PvP group needed to be be composed of at least 80% guild members (with some exceptions, see exact numbers below). Participating in any of these activities also granted players &lt;a href=\"guild%20reputation\"&gt;reputation with the guild&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed them to purchase unlocked &lt;a href=\"guild%20rewards\"&gt;guild rewards&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"heirlooms\"&gt;heirlooms&lt;/a&gt;, recipes, pets and mounts. Originally, there was also going to be a guild currency and a guild talent tree system, but they were simplified; guild talent trees became a set of linear guild perks without exclusive choices, and guild rewards are now purchased with gold instead of an additional currency type.\nEarning guild experience.\nA guild was able to level up to level 25. Advancement in levels was done in a manner similar to player characters: a variety of tasks earned experience which counted toward advancing to the next level.\nActivities which earned guild XP included:\nAlthough present at launch, Blizzard removed the ability of guilds to gain Guild XP from completing achievements in a hotfix deployed soon after \"Cataclysm\"'s release.\nRaid and dungeon boss kills.\nGuild xp for boss kills was scaled on a few factors:\nGuild experience and reputation caps.\nDuring \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", caps on guild experience and reputation gains restricted the rate at which players could advance guild levels and their personal reputation with the guild. These caps were removed with the release of the \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;pre-patch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe daily cap on guild experience was 7,807,000 XP, and was indicated on the guild's experience bar in the Guild window. The daily cap on guild XP was removed at guild level 20, so during the last five levels there was no limit on experience gains. Among other things, this allowed guilds to \"race\" to achieve &lt;a href=\"Realm%20First%21%20Guild%20Level%2025\"&gt;Realm First! Guild Level 25&lt;/a&gt; instead of being predetermined to all reach it on the same day, as they would have had they all been hitting the same daily cap through the final levels. See the table below for the time that was required for each guild level up to 20 (assuming the cap was hit each day).\nThe weekly cap on Guild Reputation per individual member was 4,375 rep. Thus it took approximately 9\u00bd weeks in a guild to reach exalted, provided you had enough guild activity each week to reach the cap. The weekly cap reset along with Daily Quests: 3 AM server time on Tuesday Morning for US servers, and 3 AM server time Wednesday morning for EU servers.\nGuild levels and perks.\nMembership in a guild grants several passive and active abilities known as \"perks\" that improve quality of life in various aspects of the game. Until the removal of guild advancement, these abilities were gained by leveling up the guild; all members received access to all abilities the guild had earned. Guild perks were a primary motivator in leveling up guilds as quickly as possible.\nWith the removal of guild levels, only six perks were retained, automatically granted to all members of all guilds: &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Resurrection%20%28guild%20perk%29\"&gt;Mass Resurrection (guild perk)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Banking\"&gt;Mobile Banking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Up\"&gt;Mount Up&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hasty%20Hearth\"&gt;Hasty Hearth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Quick%20and%20the%20Dead\"&gt;The Quick and the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Mail\"&gt;Guild Mail&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis chart illustrates the progression of guild levels and their perk rewards before the system was removed, including how quickly guilds could expect to earn each ability by hitting the daily guild experience cap every day starting at \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\"'s release.\nThe daily experience cap was quickly patched to be removed at level 23, and later adjusted to level 20, then removed entirely in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuild items and guild reputation.\nParticipating in various activities earns members &lt;a href=\"Guild%20reputation\"&gt;Guild reputation&lt;/a&gt;. Members can buy special items (with gold) based on their current reputation level. Many vendor items require guild achievements to have been earned by the guild to be sold by its vendor at all. The ground mounts, heirlooms, 7th bank slot voucher, and &lt;a href=\"Wrap%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Wrap of Unity&lt;/a&gt; all used to have guild level requirements, but are now sold by all guilds immediately.\nGuild achievements.\nGuilds are able to gain achievements for killing bosses, obtaining a certain membership demographic, and other activities. Some achievements reflect achievements already available to players.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn 29 June 2014, &lt;a href=\"Ion_Hazzikostas\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt; announced that guild experience and leveling would be removed from the game with \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", along with the &lt;a href=\"Cash%20Flow\"&gt;Cash Flow&lt;/a&gt; guild perk. The following was posted in response to a tester inquiring about missing guild perks in the Warlords of Draenor beta:"}

The amount of guild members needed to count as a guild group varies by group size and content type, but it is always at least a majority for non-legacy content:\nQualification as a guild group can be identified by an icon of the guild's logo appearing in the upper left corner of the &lt;a href=\"minimap\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt; area while inside an &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe official guild group status applies only inside instances, but there are several &lt;a href=\"guild%20achievements\"&gt;guild achievements&lt;/a&gt; for outdoor &lt;a href=\"world%20boss\"&gt;world boss&lt;/a&gt;es as well. These achievements do not use the term \"guild group\" and simply ask that 8 of the raid's members be in the guild; a raid that has met this threshold might informally be thought of as a guild group as well.\nGuild groups formerly qualified players to earn guild experience as part of the &lt;a href=\"guild%20advancement\"&gt;guild advancement&lt;/a&gt; system, but that system was subsequently removed from the game. In the case of dungeons, having 3/5, 4/5, or 5/5 guild members in the party awarded 50%, 100%, or 125% of normal guild experience, but now that guild experience is gone, any dungeon group past 3/5 qualifies for full guild group status."}

All are \"quality of life\" improvements that do not affect combat or the capacity to progress through game content. Therefore, players are encouraged to join a guild without being massively punished for abstaining from that part of the game. Several perks focus on play with other guild members, but &lt;a href=\"solo\"&gt;solo&lt;/a&gt; and non-guilded &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; play benefit as well. Perks were first added as part of an extensive &lt;a href=\"guild%20advancement\"&gt;guild advancement&lt;/a&gt; system in which each of 25 guild levels granted a perk (or a second level of one), but ultimately the system was simplified to just grant a small fixed set for any member of any guild with no advancement required.\nGuild perks can be viewed on the \"Perks\" tab in the guild window, as well as in the &lt;a href=\"spellbook\"&gt;spellbook&lt;/a&gt;'s general tab. The active abilities can be dragged to action bars or used directly from either location, as well as used in &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s like any other ability.\nWhile access to &lt;a href=\"guild%20rewards\"&gt;guild rewards&lt;/a&gt; is certainly a benefit of joining a guild, they are not considered \"guild perks\".\nList of perks.\nThe following four &lt;a href=\"passive%20ability\"&gt;passive&lt;/a&gt; bonuses become active upon joining a guild.\nThese following is available to all members of a guild.\nRemoved.\nThe list of guild perks has seen a severe reduction since their introduction in the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" in particular saw the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"guild%20advancement\"&gt;guild advancement&lt;/a&gt; leveling system, and with it most perks.\nPatch 5.0.4.\nThe developers chose not to continue with cauldron-based raid consumables after \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", so related perks were removed:\nAdditionally and controversially, it was felt that the ability for one person to summon an entire raid to an &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; discouraged exploration and involvement in the wider world, leading to its removal:\nPatch 6.0.2.\nThe dismantling of the &lt;a href=\"guild%20advancement\"&gt;guild advancement&lt;/a&gt; system was part of a paradigm shift in the developers' thinking of how guild benefits should work. In most cases, it had become the norm for the majority of players to be in maximum-level guilds, and developers were designing systems with those bonuses in mind, making them mostly pointless. The tuning of numbers (experience, reputation, honor, trade skill, justice, and harvesting gains, durability losses, flight path speed, and vendor prices) was therefore changed to simply use a \"baseline\" as if the perk was in effect, and the perks themselves were removed:\nFinally, one perk was removed due to its abuse by people who would create guilds and &lt;a href=\"spam\"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt; invites to unsuspecting new players simply to take all the &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; generated from their gameplay via the perk:\nBlizzard stated that it would pursue other options to help guilds recoup costs from &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;ing, such as increasing the number of desirable &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt; items to sell.\nThis post by Blizzard's Lead Encounter Designer, &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt;, explains the changes in detail.\nPatch 7.0.3.\nWith the release of \"\", the &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Resurrection%20%28guild%20perk%29\"&gt;Mass Resurrection (guild perk)&lt;/a&gt; perk was removed in favor of adding a baseline spell with the same functionality to all healing specializations (&lt;a href=\"Absolution\"&gt;Absolution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Vision\"&gt;Ancestral Vision&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Resurrection\"&gt;Mass Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reawaken\"&gt;Reawaken&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Revitalize\"&gt;Revitalize&lt;/a&gt;)."}

{"id": "18513", "revid": "38763312", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18513", "title": "Elune", "text": "Elune is a &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;dess of the cosmic realm of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;. Her sister and counterpart is the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they embody the balance of the great cycle of Life and Death. Elune is worshipped by several mortal cultures throughout the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, on both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;s. On Azeroth, she is best known as the primary goddess of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers her \"favored children\". She is associated with the larger of the planet's two moons, the &lt;a href=\"White%20Lady\"&gt;White Lady&lt;/a&gt;, and is considered to be the mother of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, the forest lord and patron god of all &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. Reverence for Elune is not limited to the night elves, however. In &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; culture, she is known as Mu'sha (or simply Moon), the left eye of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;, with the right eye being the sun, &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;. Elune is one of the few true deities of Azeroth, but the mythology surrounding her suggests that her true identity has not yet been fully understood.\nDescription.\nAlthough relatively little is revealed about Elune's true origins and background outside of mythology, Elune is known to be the sister of the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;. While her sister is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon%20of%20Death\"&gt;Pantheon of Death&lt;/a&gt;, Elune is her counterpart in the Pantheon of Life. Together, they embody the balance of a great cycle.\nElune also seems to have a connection to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. After the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; changed the &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s, she taught the former trolls words &lt;a href=\"Titan%20%28language%29\"&gt;in Titan&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;\"Kalimdor\"&lt;/a&gt;. The early night elves also believed that Elune slept within the Well of Eternity (a pool of Azeroth's blood) during the day. The titan &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; also took refuge on a planet named &lt;a href=\"Elunaria\"&gt;Elunaria&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, created by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, is named after. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; also believes that the &lt;a href=\"prime%20naaru\"&gt;prime naaru&lt;/a&gt; may have been created by Elune during the great ordering of Light and Shadow. This is further demonstrated by the &lt;a href=\"%3ATear%20of%20Elune\"&gt;:Tear of Elune&lt;/a&gt; being able to restore the heart of &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe markings on a set of &lt;a href=\"%3ACrumbling%20Ceremonial%20Vestments\"&gt;:Crumbling Ceremonial Vestments&lt;/a&gt; resemble both the sign of Elune and those of several &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;.\nA well-organized priesthood devotes itself to the service of Elune. The highest echelon of this order is known as the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and as the name implies, membership in this echelon is open only to women, on the belief that Elune's deepest mysteries can only be understood by a woman's heart. The war chants of the Sisters can call down Elune's wrath to smite their foes, and their prayers to the Mother Moon can nurture even the gravely wounded back to health.\nElune has never been observed in physical form on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but she has often been depicted as a &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; woman of transcending beauty and perfection, crowned with a simple platinum circlet and surrounded by a dazzling luminescence. Night elven artisans have traditionally portrayed her in their works as having long and silvery hair, alabaster skin, and eyes of pure &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo the best of anyone's knowledge, Elune only has had one lover: the &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. They conceived a child named &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, who inherited a powerful blend of his mother's unconditional love for Azeroth's living beings and his father's mystic ties to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The natural world is intimately connected to the moon goddess as a result, and for more than ten thousand years, the night elves have reflected this by arranging their society according to a harmonious balance between the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;esses, which is embodied in the present age by the union of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; too have &lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Stag%20and%20the%20Moon\"&gt;a myth&lt;/a&gt; that purportedly relates the story of Cenarius' conception.\nThe Night Warrior.\nStrongly associated with healing, tranquility and harmony, Elune is a goddess of peace, but she is not always a pacifist, as she does not advocate peace at all costs. One of her aspects is the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, who takes the valiant among the dead and sets them riding across the sky as stars. The Night Warrior is the incarnation of Elune's wrath.\nIn tauren mythology.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; know Elune as Mu'sha, one of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s eyes along with &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun. Along with her brother, she plays an important role in the early parts of &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe birth of Sun and Moon.\nThe tauren believe that the Earth Mother shaped the world to be a sanctuary where she could give birth to \"the light of her heart\" away from the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old Ones&lt;/a&gt; trapped in the depths. After creating the world and the elements, the Earth Mother went into labor and brought forth a radiant son she named An'she, followed by a luminous and gentle daughter she named Mu'sha. The elements called them \"Sun\" and \"Moon\". Over time, the twins grew close to the elements, with Mu'sha dancing with the waters and sharing secrets with the winds, while An'she similarly bonded with the fire and mountains. They steadily grew in power until they were able to influence the elements themselves and use their power to forge weapons so they might spar and play: a bow and arrows for Mu'sha and dual blades for An'she. The Earth Mother was overjoyed by this and gently guided her twins through the ages, but she remained ever vigilant against the Old Ones and their shadows.\nShe eventually grew tired and knew that she needed to rest. In order to keep her children close and safe while she slumbered, she pressed them into her eyes\u2014first An'she and then Mu'sha. The Earth Mother rested first with one eye shut and then the other, since her children's light was now too powerful to fully contain. When her left eye was open, Mu'sha gave peace and sleep to the creatures of the dawning. However, this restless watch denied the world An'she's warmth and caused the land to grow cold. Mu'sha's powers were similarly diminished by her mother's rest, and without her guidance, the winds whipped up in storms and blizzards. When the Earth Mother awoke, she despaired at how the elements had changed in her children's absence, but as their light returned, the cold faded and everything back to how it had once been. The elements consoled the Earth Mother and showed her how her time of rest had allowed new life to thrive, and so she named the seasons in her time of work (summer) and her time of rest (winter). From her eyes, she then showed Mu'sha and An'she how to guide the elements through these new seasons and eventually how to bring about the accompanying changes to the land at will. She told the twins that they had proven their strength and that they should watch over the world that she had made for them, but that they still had to stay safe inside her eyes.\nSorrow of the Earth Mother.\nThe Earth Mother wished for her twins to share the love and happiness she felt at seeing their growth, and so created the shu'halo (tauren). On their mother's request, Moon and Sun taught the shu'halo everything they knew\u2014how to work with the elements, build homes, acquire food, sing, dance, ferry the rivers, and hunt wild beasts. However, while Moon and Sun were almost strong enough to defend themselves from the Old Ones and their &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadows&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren were young and vulnerable. The next time the Earth Mother slept, the Old Ones stretched their influence across the land and corrupted many of the tauren with their whispers, causing them to make war on each other and throw the elements into chaos. Mu'sha and An'she watched helplessly, as their mother had only ever spoken of shadows and not the suffering those shadows might cause. They cried out, waking their mother. Upon seeing what had happened, the Earth Mother wept a single tear. Realizing that she was also susceptible to the corruption and thus no longer a safe haven for her children, she wrenched Mu'sha and An'she free from her skull, her fingers digging so deeply that their light could never return to her again. Moon and Sun tried to console their mother, but she lay paralyzed by sorrow. An'she declared that they had to set off to stop the source of the corruption, and Mu'sha agreed.\nWord of the Earth Mother's sorrow and the twins' journey to save her was carried on the winds. The siblings soon encountered a party of uncorrupted shu'halo, who presented a radiant blue infant they'd found on the plains. When the child began to wail, the twins recognized them as having been born from the Earth Mother's lone tear. Mu'sha took the babe in her arms and An'she asked what they should call them. Mu'sha replied that their mother would know, but before the twins could return to their mother, the shadows attacked them. With the aid of the elements, the twins managed to hold back the darkness: Mu'sha evaded the shadows' grasp as quick as the wind and flowing like water and used her glimmering arrows to disperse the shadows' whispers, while An'she did the same with his swords, fire, and earth. As they began to beat back the darkness, however, one of the shadows lashed out for An'she's heart. Mu'sha destroyed it with one of her arrows, but not before it inflicted a great wound on An'she. Mu'sha tried to bind her brother's wound with water and wind, but it continued to bleed no matter what she did. Mu'sha sent a plea on the wind and the Earth Mother sought out her children. She told Mu'sha that her presence was keeping the bleeding An'she alive, but Mu'sha knew that her brother would surely die if her &lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;healing light&lt;/a&gt; strayed too far from him.\nKnowing that the shadows would return to take the rest of the tauren, the Earth Mother decided to sacrifice herself to contain the darkness. The twins protested, but she quieted them and told them to take permanently to the skies, from where their light would be able to chase away any shadows she could not hold. She told them to always stay in each other's sight so Mu'sha could tend An'she's wounds. She then gave the blue child\u2014whom she'd named &lt;a href=\"Lo%27sho\"&gt;Lo'sho&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to Mu'sha and told the twins to teach the infant everything they knew. Although heartbroken, the twins obeyed their mother's words and took their eternal post in the skies with Lo'sho. The Earth Mother proceeded to embrace the land a final time and give all of herself in order to keep the shadows at bay. Seeing their mother's sacrifice, Mu'sha asked the breezes to lift her mother's words so the shu'halo could hear them, and pulled at the tides and winds so they would always be able to follow her voice. Meanwhile, An'she shone his light across the land so the way would be clear, and all the while, Lo'sho listened to their siblings' lessons, hearing in them the wisdom of their mother.\nBackground.\nAncient times.\nOriginally, the people that would become known as &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; were a tribe of &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s who migrated to the heart of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and settled upon the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The energies of the Well transformed their bodies, elevating their stature and granting the trolls great intelligence and virtual immortality. It was then that the tribe's mystics first began worshipping the moon goddess, \"Elune\", whom they believed slumbered in the Well's depths during daylight hours.\nThe night elf goddess Elune was said to be disappointed in the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;'s feral insistence. It was his unwillingness to tame his savagery and bloodlust that overshadowed his noble heart. When Elune's great moonlight illuminated the dark during the full moons, it was as if her eyes glared down upon him in judgment. His anger at her conviction caused Goldrinn to become even more bloodthirsty and indomitable than ever.\nRecorded night elven history shows that formal worship of Elune dates back to at least 14,000 years. However, it is certain that the moon goddess was being revered through more primitive and decentralized methods long before this. The first known center of devotion to Elune was established by the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; within the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. The Sisterhood at one point relocated this temple to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; after it became evident &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; increasingly distanced themselves from the tenets of the moon goddess. After Suramar itself had fallen to the onslaught of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Elune became a profound source of hope and humility to all night elves as they witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; rally under the blazing moon to come to the defense of a world being put to the flame over their civilization's mistakes.\n&lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, a former high priestess, mentioned that there are legends saying that Elune's power through the Night Warrior helped the night elves to secure Kalimdor.\nRecent times.\nIn the era between the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a period known as the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Vigil\"&gt;Long Vigil&lt;/a&gt;, devotion to Elune had essentially become universal among the kaldorei but was practiced without centralized places of worship, much like in ages past. The Sisters of Elune founded a new temple for the moon goddess however, the first of its kind since the complex at Suramar itself: the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; within the recent night elven capital city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Elune's chosen, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, resided here both as high priestess and as head of the kaldorei government, and by her side stood many priestesses (and for the first time, several male night elven priests) ready to venture out and soothe a war-weary Azeroth with the Mother Moon's &lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;healing light&lt;/a&gt;. Elune has at least one other functional &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; were kept for millennia, and which Tyrande Whisperwind personally helped protect in recent times.\nAt one point, a piece of one of 's moons fell into a pool on the far side of the woods. Such a thing was perfect for use in the dedication of a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; to Elune in &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Outpost\"&gt;Starfall Outpost&lt;/a&gt;.\nVelen's visit to Darnassus.\nDuring a visit to Darnassus by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, he explained that the kaldorei's description of Elune, as well as the demonstrated powers of the goddess, matched his experiences with powerful &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. He began to offer advice regarding how to commune with powerful naaru, but Tyrande thanked him for his opinion, then cordially requested that he refrained from making such outlandish claims when in Darnassus or in the presence of Elune's priesthood.\nShadowlands.\nWhen the machine of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; broke, &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; fell into an &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought and the Winter Queen called out to her sister for aid. Elune heard of the Queen's distress and sent the souls of the night elves killed in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; to Ardenweald in order to sustain it. Unbeknownst to Elune, however, the breaking of Death meant that all of the souls she sent ended up funneling into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of eternal torment. The Winter Queen, for her part, believed that Elune had ignored her cries for help and grew to resent her as a result.\nDuring the events in the Shadowlands, Tyrande Whisperwind's continued wielding of the powers of the Night Warrior threatened to kill her. During &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;:the Battle of Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, she tried to expend her own life in order to kill &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, but Elune's power left her and allowed Sylvanas to escape in order to keep Tyrande alive. Later, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; conducted a ritual with the souls of other former Night Warriors to stabilize Tyrande's powers, but the ritual proved ineffective and the Winter Queen herself intervened. Elune took control of the Night Warrior's body and spoke through her to tell the furious Winter Queen how she had tried to help her by sending kaldorei souls to her. The Queen, realizing that her sister hadn't abandoned her after all, explained how the souls had been claimed by the Maw, and Elune shed a single tear when she realized that she had condemned her \"favored children\". The Queen took the tear into her hand and stated that together, they could still guide the souls to \"their spring\", starting with Tyrande. Elune replied that since it was Tyrande who had invoked her, it was also Tyrande who had to choose between renewal or continued pursuit of vengeance. Tyrande chose renewal, and together Elune\u2014acting through Tyrande\u2014and the Winter Queen turned the tear into &lt;a href=\"the%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;the Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Elune then left her priestess' body, and the Queen used the Sisters' Tear to revitalize the drained &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; and recreate the Night Fae's &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;, thereby bringing the forces of Life and Death back into harmony. Afterward, the Winter Queen's fellow &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20One\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, commented that this event perhaps marked a rebirth of Elune and the Queen's kinship as well.\nIn a later conversation between Tyrande and her daughter &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris&lt;/a&gt;, the latter stated that she hadn't understood why Elune didn't intervene during the Burning of Teldrassil, but that back then she did not know of the purpose that awaited the night elves' souls in Ardenweald. Tyrande replied that \"Perhaps we can never truly know the ways of the gods\", but that she believed Elune had acted with the intention of helping her sister, not causing sorrow to the kaldorei.\nDevotion and worship.\nElune's aspect known as the Mother Moon emphasizes tranquillity and harmony to allow for the greatest nurturing of Azeroth's creatures. However, Elune does not advocate pacifism in the face of threats to her harmony and tranquillity; novices in the Sisters of Elune are trained extensively in tactics and combat under the moon goddess' aspect of the Night Warrior. Elune expects devotion from her priestesses, but never demands they give her every waking moment \u2014 the Mother Moon is experienced by her daughters as a nurturing, loving matriarch whose expectations are not oppressive in nature. Whereas Elune is the center of reverence for the Sisters of Elune and the &lt;a href=\"sentinels\"&gt;sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, the kaldorei &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; have devoted themselves to the teachings of Elune's only child; the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. As such, there exists a deep and intimate link between the spirituality of the night elven druids and priestesses, on which their entire society has been based for over ten thousand years.\n&lt;a href=\"Moonwell\"&gt;Moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s can be commonly found in most Temples of the Moon as well as throughout night elf settlements. Containing waters from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; blessed by the moon goddess, they possess extraordinary healing and restorative properties, and can purify their surroundings for years. They even allow spellcasters to refresh their mana, apparently a gift from Elune to Azeroth's other defenders, and in kaldorei society, they are revered by the &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; alike.\nIn the area now known as &lt;a href=\"Sargeron\"&gt;Sargeron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, there were once four shrines known as Elune's Cathedral, Elune's Temple, Elune's Sanctuary and Elune's Palace. Each shrine housed a relic of Elune commonly used by the ancient elves in rituals to their goddess.\nReligious practice.\nThe night elves use the word \"god\" in plural (\"Gods help us all\"; \"May the gods have mercy\"), and the Temple of the Moon in Suramar had frescoes and murals depicting Elune and many other gods (actual gods, not &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s) shaping the world. We infer that the night elf religion, though centered around Elune, is actually polytheistic (the druids' reverence of certain demigods supports this). Elune's worship, therefore, is more like a dominant mystery cult than a monotheism, similar to the religions of Ancient Egypt or Ancient Greece on Earth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; were also known to honor, if not outright worship Elune. The earthen were aware that it was she who gave birth to Cenarius, and were surprised to hear that Ysera was regarded as his mother. It's unknown if this means that the earthen worshiped her, or were merely better-informed about the origins of Kalimdor's demigods.\nA tauren myth, the \"White Stag and the Moon\", relates how Apa'ro (Malorne) fled the Shu'halo (Tauren) by escaping into the sky, but was entangled by the stars. Mu'sha saw him and fell in love with him, and agreed to free him if he loved her. Mu'sha's actions appear slightly out of character with Elune as understood by the night elves and the earthen, but it might be helpful to interpret it as a \"just-so\" story that the tauren used to explain the origin of Cenarius.\nDivine interventions.\nWhen the night elves rode into battle, the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; fought side by side with the &lt;a href=\"sentinels\"&gt;sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, singing to Elune and calling upon her &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt; power. Oftentimes the lunar goddess responded by visiting her wrath upon the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' enemies. It was even said that the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;esses could bring a semblance of the moon into the noonday sky, lending some of Elune's strength to the nocturnal night elves. After the battle was won, the priestesses prayed over the wounded and brought them healing. Other divine interventions were granted by her including:\nIn the RPG.\nElune is the only true goddess in the world, and the most powerful &lt;a href=\"Eternal\"&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn the world's infancy, she protected all living things and allowed them the chance to grow and thrive. Whenever she found violence, she would cast her calming influence across the land so that peace and healing might be given another chance to thrive.\nThus it was for many centuries, until &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy began to leak into the world through the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Despite her attempts to guide them away, she watched in horror as her spiritual children among the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; were drawn to the Well and seduced by its power. Though her companion &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; and their child &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; joined her faithful among the Kaldorei in an attempt to stave off the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the demons spilled across the land in a wave of death and destruction that even she could not prevent.\nAfter the Kaldorei went into seclusion following the War of the Ancients, Elune spent thousands of years nurturing the world back to life. Saddened by the fall of so many Eternals in the war, she pursued her task alone with only occasional visits to her son.\nJust as she felt she had once again accomplished her task and brought Azeroth toward a new era of peace, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms fell under the corrupting influence of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; magic and crumbled into chaos. Shortly thereafter, the &lt;a href=\"orcish%20Horde\"&gt;orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; came to Azeroth and sparked a new era of warfare that threatens to consume the world like the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; did so long ago. Though her Kaldorei followers have returned from their time in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, it has yet to be seen if the moon goddess will take any direct action during this time of trouble.\nAppearance.\nIt's difficult to make the goddess out through the luminescence that surrounds her, only catching glimpses of alabaster skin and long, pale hair, graceful gossamer robes and a platinum circlet upon her brow. Her eyes are brilliant orbs of pure &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt;, and she smiles peacefully upon her worshipers.\nElune faiths.\nElune is revered by those who worship her as the mother of the world, a scion of peace and a protector of all living things. The majority of the Kaldorei strive to follow in her footsteps, though most rationalize their need to resort to violence as the shortcoming of a mortal existence. Even those who worship other powers respect Elune for the unconditional love she gives to all creatures regardless of their beliefs or actions. Though she has never shown herself in physical form on the Material Plane, all the creatures of Azeroth know that were she to do so, it would herald the arrival of a long awaited era of peace.\nCombat.\nElune never engages in combat of any kind, nor does she allow it to occur in her presence. Though she never physically manifests in the world of mortals, when she involves herself in a violent situation, she arrives invisibly and undetected using her song of peace to calm the combatants until sunrise.\nInspirations.\nFictional.\nElune borrows from many lunar goddesses and fictional derivatives, particularly Tolkien and Forgotten Realms:\nSpeculation.\nElune, a being of Light?\n&lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; himself suggested that Elune could be a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, and Blizzard have stated that, as a prophet of the naaru for thousands of years, it's unlikely that he would propose such a theory without significant evidence and consideration. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; however dismissed Velen's opinion on the matter out of hand.\nDuring the events of , &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; found a cosmology tome indicating that the prime &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; may have been created by Elune during the great ordering of Light and Shadow. Shortly after, the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; opened &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;the core&lt;/a&gt; of the naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough it would subsequently be revealed that Elune is seemingly a being of Life, the alternate Velen stated that \"the light is life\" and life was formed from shards of light impacting the material universe. All this, plus her potential involvement in the prime naaru, suggests a link between Elune and the Light.\nElune, the Tidemother?\nSee &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt; speculation.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is possible that the fourth dialect is the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%23Language\"&gt;nightborne language&lt;/a&gt;, which is distinct from both modern Darnassian and Thalassian.\nElven is a unique and obscure language. It is known by the &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ielephia\"&gt;Ielephia&lt;/a&gt; and some inhabitants living on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis language is not to be confused with Thalassian which is sometimes referred to as \"High Elven\" by individuals who are unfamiliar with its proper name.\nNotes.\n\"Elven\" is a language derived from Dungeons and Dragons, which can be found in the DnD rule books. In DnD it is the language used by various types of elves, and uses the Elven alphabet. The language is based on the languages of the elves in Lord of the Rings. In the Warcraft RPG it is listed as a separate language from Darnassian, Nazja and Thalassian. \nThe original reference to the term \"High Elven\" was in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", and later the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Warcraft Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;, as another name for the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; language. \nAdditionally, \"&lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cycle of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" uses the term \"elven\" to describe four total distinct dialects used by elves, and races descended from elves. However, it does not list the four dialects by name. It can be assumed that they would include &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, and a final mystery language. As \"Elven\" is the only other elven dialect ever mention it is likely the fourth language...however, it might be some as of yet unknown language.\nIt may be the \"strange dialect of Darnassian\" found on ancient ruins. Its unknown if that mysterious language was derived from or predates the current form of Darnassian. It is perhaps the language of the ancient &lt;a href=\"dark%20elves\"&gt;dark elves&lt;/a&gt; the only other elven race mentioned in lore.\nIt is possible that elven is the language from which all current elf languages derive, spoken by the Kaldorei before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Then the other four dialects: &lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, and the final, mystery language evolved over the 10,000 year period after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;."}

Trained to hunt down renegade &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s in the wildlands of both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Rangers are a force to be reckoned with. Being Half-Elven, the Rangers are often avoided by members of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High Elven&lt;/a&gt; stock. However, these crafty females make their home in the wilds and seldom feel the need for the distractions of camaraderie. Rangers are expert marksmen with the longbow and carry specially weighted &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and magically enhanced &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\nRangers were eventually canceled as a hero unit. Most of their abilities were given to the &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Priestess of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; instead, and their model was reused for the in-game appearances of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jennalla%20Deemspring\"&gt;Jennalla Deemspring&lt;/a&gt;. Among the possible random names was \"Somand Wayfinder\".\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Legacy of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; was defended by an organization called the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Ranger%20Corps\"&gt;Elven Ranger Corps&lt;/a&gt;, which is presumably a different name for the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral deceased rangers were resurrected in &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elven&lt;/a&gt; rangers still traditionally belong to the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, staunch defenders of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The order endured the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourging of their homeland&lt;/a&gt; and continues to defend the elven kingdom. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and are usually stationed in their reclaimed country, holding a presence in the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Ranger Captains serve as intermediate officers.\nOf those who chose to remain high elves, most of them rejoined the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; or various lodges such as &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s decided to serve the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; under their progenitor Lady &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, formerly her student in the arts of the elven ranger, now trains other Forsaken &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s of non-elven ancestry.\nFinally, some &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; recently gained the rank of ranger though it is unknown if it is a recent creation or an ancient tradition from before the splitting with the high elves. One of them is depicted as having the title of &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger General&lt;/a&gt;, something originally thought to be limited to the Farstriders.\nIn the RPG.\nThe elven ranger is an elite wilderness warrior whose skills are unique to the elven race. These skills are rooted in ancient tradition, from even before the time of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and survive in the cultures of both the high elves and the night elves. Elven ranger orders exist among both high elves and night elves. Among the modern high elves, the elven ranger is known as just that, but among the night elves the elven rangers are called by their ancient title: &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. The elven rangers of both races are capable of running through rugged terrain to make impossible shots that appear fluid and natural.\nElven rangers practiced a form of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism. Those rangers who became &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s lost the ability to use those powers. Elven rangers draw their spells from their relationships with nature and the spirits of nature. As such, their spell lists are focused on archery, wilderness, animals, and stealth. A druidic power called \"&lt;a href=\"Speak%20with%20Plants\"&gt;Speak with Plants&lt;/a&gt;\" allowed them to talk to normal plants and plant creatures.\nNight elven rangers were members of the group called the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders%23Night%20elven%20Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Camp\"&gt;Farstrider Camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpic elven ranger.\nEpic elven rangers are highly experienced elven rangers. Stalking the wilderness is the epic elven ranger, a silent, lethal champion of nature. They can bring down their foes with a single arrow from miles away, and their enemies flee from their name. Those creatures they most hate shiver in their dens at night, sure they see them crouching at the edge of their consciousness. Combat, particularly ranged combat, is their forte, so they increase their abilities in that arena. Defensive improvements keep them alive to snipe another day. Dexterity is their most important ability, while occasional wisdom boosts improve their spellcasting and allow them to track, spot and hear their foes better.\nSentinels.\nRangers have always remained a large part of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; society, but among the kaldorei they are called by their ancient title: Sentinels. Sentinels share almost the exact customs as &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; rangers, to the point where you can only tell the difference by race. Many Sentinels fulfill their duties as &lt;a href=\"huntress\"&gt;huntress&lt;/a&gt;es, riding astride great &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt; panthers, or as &lt;a href=\"windwarrior\"&gt;windwarrior&lt;/a&gt;s astride &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warden%20of%20the%20Sunwell\"&gt;Wardens of the Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Warden\"&gt;Sunwell Warden&lt;/a&gt;s might be rangers, as they are armed with bows and dual swords."}

The idyllic &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; lie to the east, and to the south, across the &lt;a href=\"Nazferiti%20river\"&gt;Nazferiti river&lt;/a&gt; is where &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; is located. It is the heartland of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and consequently is the starting point of all human characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt; serves as the municipal law enforcer for &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20McBride\"&gt;Marshal McBride&lt;/a&gt; serves as the municipal law enforcer for &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Though much of the forest was burned down during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, trees and lush glades have grown anew. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; lies northwest of the forest and is heavily patrolled by the Stormwind guards.\nHistory.\nLittle is known of Elwynn's history before Stormwind was founded centuries ago by the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; bloodline of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenturies ago, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the disparate human nations flourished, among them the smallest and most isolated of the kingdoms was Stormwind. Over the years, it found prosperity through the farmsteads that dotted the surrounding fertile region, and as its population grew, small towns sprang up in the nearby regions, notably in Elwynn Forest, and ever since humans first settled in the forest, it has thrived under their stewardship.\nLong ago, Elwynn Forest was populated with a group of &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s that lived peacefully amid the woods. Yet when the curse fell over &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; and turned the once peaceful woodland into a realm of terror, the spiders began to &lt;a href=\"Venom%20spider\"&gt;mutate and grow&lt;/a&gt; to monstrous proportions, and entered the shadowed land.\nElwynn Forest was captured by the Horde during their bloody campaign to Stormwind in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The resources culled from the bountiful woods helped fuel the Horde's war machine. Much of the forests were razed as the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s marched across Elwynn. The town of Goldshire and the Abbey at Northshire were both tragically destroyed by the Horde. When Stormwind fell to the orcs and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; led the humans to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans assumed domains in Elwynn forest. When the humans of Stormwind finally retook their city at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, they regained Elwynn as well. It cost the kingdom of Stormwind a significant amount of gold and resources to rebuild their broken homeland. As a result, the kingdom's economy has flagged since it was rebuilt. Many of the middle and lower classes became fed up with high taxes and unpaid labor in service of the kingdom. Many of these dissidents defected to form the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; (led by the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the architects who reconstructed Stormwind and weren't paid anything). Still, against all the odds, Elwynn has returned to much of its former majesty and glory. &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt and has become a recruiting center of sorts for the Stormwind army. Goldshire and its famous &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Pride%20Inn\"&gt;Lion's Pride Inn&lt;/a&gt; have returned to their former glory as a bustling hub of activity. Today, the only reminders of the Horde's occupation are a few scattered orcish &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s, broken and rotting. Meanwhile, the humans of Stormwind rejoice as Elwynn once again becomes the pride of the Kingdom of Stormwind.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had been victim to massive mystic struggles, which tore magic currents from once stable channels, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; struggled to determine the effects these changes had caused, and some of them feared the worst. When the flow of magic in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and Elwynn Forest was somehow altered, they sent a mage &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Lake\"&gt;Mirror Lake&lt;/a&gt;, in order to test its water for magical properties before those who drank from it would be adversely affected.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Elwynn Forest was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; has cracked the once natural defenses buffering the kingdom from its enemies and left openings that were taken advantaged of. The &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orc&lt;/a&gt;s have managed to sneak into &lt;a href=\"Northshire\"&gt;Northshire&lt;/a&gt; through a break in the southern Elwynn Mountains. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Infantry\"&gt;Stormwind Infantry&lt;/a&gt; and patrolling &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;s were deployed to defend Elwynn Forest. The Stormwind Army has also put a bounty on &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt; and incarcerates him to the &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of his defeat.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, Elwynn Forest came under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. To fight against the undead, troops of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; were mobilized in order to protect the region and its inhabitants.\nPeople and culture.\nThe humans have lived in Elwynn for centuries, but members of all Alliance races can be frequently seen traveling and residing in Elwynn due to its proximity to the capital, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Most residents of Elwynn are involved in one of its major industries: logging, farming, fishing or mining. They are also renowned for the breeding of their Evendales: steeds especially prized by adventurers for their loyalty and steadiness in the face of danger. The people are hardy and hard-working and for all its pomp and grandeur, Stormwind wouldn\u2019t last long without a constant stream of food and supplies to support the city\u2019s population.&lt;ref name=\"http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/race/human\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/game/race/human\"&gt;http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/race/human&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThis exchange has become increasingly threatened by kobold invasions, vicious feuds among farmers, and attacks from wild animals. The &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; once terrorized these lands, but Elwynn became more tranquil after their downfall. &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; remains dedicated to recruiting and training any adventurers brave enough to help keep the peace. Likewise, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orc&lt;/a&gt;s are gathering their forces in the nearby Redridge Mountains. With Stormwind\u2019s militia stretched thinner than ever, these renegade orcs stand ready to finally annihilate their old human enemies in Elwynn Forest.\nThe region organizes its festivals and celebrations around the planting calendar, its two biggest parties being the planting and harvesting festivals. It also hosts the &lt;a href=\"Wickerman%20Festival\"&gt;burning of the Wickerman&lt;/a&gt;. Elwynn is also visited periodically by the famous, traveling &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nElwynn lies below the southern foothills of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The Forest is a labyrinthine mixture of rushing rivers, various lakes, and forests of magnificent trees and lush glades. Its rich farmland is a result of frequent rains. Recently several of the lakes have been found to be inhabited by hostile &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Stormwind City itself sits proudly in the northwestern hills of the region, its gates opening down onto the Forest. East of Stormwind and behind a thick wall lies the peaceful &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt; and its Abbey. Northshire was the pride of Stormwind's vineyards until Defias bandits drove off the farmers and occupied the farm and fields. Though the Defias were eventually taken down, Northshire couldn't catch a break: after the Cataclysm it was invaded by &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; assassins and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orcs, who ate the grapes and burned the vineyards. The formerly &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;-infested &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Ridge%20Mine\"&gt;Echo Ridge Mine&lt;/a&gt; has been closed up.\n&lt;a href=\"Bear\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s constitute the bulk of the region's large wildlife. The creatures are hostile everywhere except for Northshire. The roads leading from Stormwind and Northshire converge to the southeast just north of &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;. Goldshire is Elwynn's largest settlement besides Stormwind itself. Second to Goldshire is the &lt;a href=\"Eastvale%20Logging%20Camp\"&gt;Eastvale Logging Camp&lt;/a&gt; in the east near the border with &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Eastvale is the center of Elwynn's lumber industry. On the road from Goldshire to Eastvale is the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Azora\"&gt;Tower of Azora&lt;/a&gt; where mages conduct arcane experiments in seclusion. On the road to Westfall from Goldshire is the imposing &lt;a href=\"Westbrook%20Garrison\"&gt;Westbrook Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. This barracks and surrounding grounds house a number of the Stormwind Guard and protects Elwynn's western border. Dotted throughout the forest are small farmsteads growing crops such as wheat, pumpkins, melons, and grapes. \nKobolds infested the &lt;a href=\"Jasperlode%20Mine\"&gt;Jasperlode Mine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fargodeep%20Mine\"&gt;Fargodeep Mine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gnolls\"&gt;Gnolls&lt;/a&gt; have erected camps in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Forest's Edge&lt;/a&gt; region and the northern rim of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cairn%20Lake\"&gt;Stone Cairn Lake&lt;/a&gt;. It is rumored that both the kobolds and gnolls are somehow associated with the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s have taken up residence in and around &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cairn%20Lake\"&gt;Stone Cairn Lake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Lake\"&gt;Crystal Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Defias presence in the region has been growing and their people have holdings at &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Lake%20Orchard\"&gt;Mirror Lake Orchard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Vineyards\"&gt;Northshire Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Brackwell%20Pumpkin%20Patch\"&gt;Brackwell Pumpkin Patch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerod%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Jerod's Landing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cairn%20Lake\"&gt;Stone Cairn Lake&lt;/a&gt;, until they were taken down.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D7\"&gt;Topographic map of Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamona.de/worldmap2/map_elwynn.html\"&gt;Detailed area map (lists all creatures)&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nElwynn Forest is home to several humans of high status. From the Northshire Abbey &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20McBride\"&gt;Marshal McBride&lt;/a&gt; recruits promising young humans into the Army. In Goldshire, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt; leads the effort to reclaim Elwynn from the kobolds and other vile threats, and from his post near Eastvale Logging Camp, &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Thomas\"&gt;Guard Thomas&lt;/a&gt; seeks to eradicate the foothold the murlocs have established in the forest. Deputy Rainer is currently the leader of the Westbrook Garrison and protects the border from the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuests.\nAfter their heroic victory against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the humans of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; see new threats arise closer to home. As the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; rips across the world, the trading routes of Elwynn Forest are threatened by &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s taking over the gold mines, feuds between families, attacks from wild animals, farms being overrun by bandits, and the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt; invading through the north. The whole zone deals with an investigation, for these seemingly unrelated threats could all have the same cause behind it, and with the army stretched thin, and Stormwind's economy on the brink of collapse, it falls to its citizens to defend their kingdom and restore the peace.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; is the capital of the humans, and of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. There can be found all-level quests that draw adventurers to other zones.\nIn the RPG.\nElwynn is a gorgeous span of fertile land and thick forests. The weather is brightly sunny and cheerful during the day and silent and peaceful at night. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, it is close enough to Stormwind to enjoy considerable Alliance guardianship. Home to many farmers, loggers, and miners, Elwynn Forest is a tranquil region with several friendly places to stop. Little troubles this region; kobolds infiltrate some mines, and murlocs have moved inland to reside in some lakes and rivers, but overall it is safe. One should stick to the roads though, as the forest is home to many fearsome and territorial creatures. Those who can defend themselves are not in any danger, but others may not be so lucky. Elwynn enjoys consistently good weather, warm and humid with few stormy days. Gentle rain falls just enough to make everything grow full and lush.\nThis woodland is pleasant and tranquil. Loggers and fishers fuel Stormwind\u2019s economy, and a diligent militia keeps it safe from the kobolds and murlocs that occasionally surface. The Defias Brotherhood, a group of robbers and bandits wearing red masks, has recently become a growing menace in the region. The Brotherhood reaches into Elwynn Forest from time to time, preying on lone travelers, although their main center of operations lies somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. Some say they have a case against Stormwind, as they weren\u2019t paid for their work rebuilding the city; others say they are whiners who charged too much in the first place. Others (such as &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;) did their work and were paid, and don\u2019t understand the problems.\nElwynn Forest is under guardianship of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; but has its own democratic government.\nTrue criminals in the area are usually sent to Stormwind for trial and punishment in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, as most people care more for their jobs than housing criminals. Goldshire has a small holding area for drunks and pickpockets, but few stay in the clink for very long. Elwynn\u2019s towns will welcome most any travelers, especially those who want to shop or trade to help the local economies. They are especially kind to those willing to lend a hand in a tough spot.\nFilm universe.\nElwynn Forest is depicted close to its \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" incarnation. It contains the communities of &lt;a href=\"Goldshire%23Film%20universe\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey%23Film%20universe\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; can be seen and the laughter of a &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; can be heard in the forest.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Ridge%20Mine\"&gt;Echo Ridge Mine&lt;/a&gt; north of the abbey has been infested by &lt;a href=\"kobolds\"&gt;kobolds&lt;/a&gt;.\nKobolds infested the &lt;a href=\"Jasperlode%20Mine\"&gt;Jasperlode Mine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fargodeep%20Mine\"&gt;Fargodeep Mine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gnolls\"&gt;Gnolls&lt;/a&gt; have erected camps in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Forest's Edge&lt;/a&gt; region and the northern rim of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cairn%20Lake\"&gt;Stone Cairn Lake&lt;/a&gt;. It is rumored that both the kobolds and gnolls are somehow associated with the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s have taken up residence in and around &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cairn%20Lake\"&gt;Stone Cairn Lake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Lake\"&gt;Crystal Lake&lt;/a&gt;.

From the Northshire Abbey &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20McBride\"&gt;Marshal McBride&lt;/a&gt; recruits promising young humans into the Army. In Goldshire, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt; leads the effort to reclaim Elwynn from the kobolds and other vile threats, and from his post near Eastvale Logging Camp, &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Thomas\"&gt;Guard Thomas&lt;/a&gt; seeks to eradicate the foothold the murlocs have established in the forest. Deputy Rainer is currently the leader of the Westbrook Garrison and protects the border from the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuests.\nElwynn Forest is the starting zone for &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The quest range here runs from level 1 to 12 with the earliest, starting quests concentrated in &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;. In southern Elwynn the player can witness the rivalry between the Stonefields, Malcures and Brackwells and do quests on both sides (the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch is currently overrun by Defias). The quests also include fighting the murlocs near Crystal and Stone-Cairn Lakes and the kobolds in the two big mines - the Fargodeep and Jasperlode. But the strongest recurring threat are the Defias Brotherhood (strangely, most of them are situated in Eastern Elwynn, having their base somewhere in Westfall).\nTwo quest chains run the adventurer back and forth between the rival farms of the Maclure and Stonefield families. Although not a quest chain, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Linen%20Goods\"&gt;Red Linen Goods&lt;/a&gt; sets the Defias threat early. Meanwhile, the drop quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Collector\"&gt;The Collector&lt;/a&gt; could help link the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s near &lt;a href=\"Ridgepoint%20Tower\"&gt;Ridgepoint Tower&lt;/a&gt; to the Defias.\n&lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt; is the starting &lt;a href=\"subzone\"&gt;subzone&lt;/a&gt; with the level 1-5 quests. &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; is the central village for those following most zone quests and suggested home inn for levels 6-10. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; is the capital, with all level quests geared to quests that draw adventurers to other zones."}

It is assumed a beginning player already worked to Level 5 in a starting zone before arriving here and making the Inn at Goldshire their home.\nThe Stonefields and Maclures are two farms just to the south with family issues.

For the quests in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; before the Cataclysm, see &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest%20%28Classic%29%20quests\"&gt;Elwynn Forest (Classic) quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nEver since the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, these vast woodlands became far more tranquil. Nonetheless, this region, with &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; at the crossroads in its heart, is the prime location for trading. Most residents of Elwynn are involved in one of its major industries: logging, farming, &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;; they provide the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;, to the west, with a constant stream of food and supplies. This exchange has become increasingly threatened by &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt; invasions of the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;s, old rivalries among &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, and attacks from wild animals, and with the army stretched thinner than ever, it falls to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;citizens&lt;/a&gt; to restore the peace.\nRecently promoted to Acting Deputy, the adventurers recruited in &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;, joined by the other races of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, arrive at Goldshire. There, they are greeted by &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt;, who immediately gives them their next assignment.\nMines and kobolds.\nMarshal Dughan has received reports that the &lt;a href=\"Fargodeep%20Mine\"&gt;Fargodeep Mine&lt;/a&gt; is overrun with kobolds, so he tasks the adventurers with scouting the mine to confirm these reports. At the same time, they are asked by &lt;a href=\"William%20Pestle\"&gt;William Pestle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Pride%20Inn\"&gt;Lion's Pride Inn&lt;/a&gt; to gather candles used by the kobolds for their wax. On the way back, they also sell their &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Dust\"&gt;Gold Dust&lt;/a&gt; mined by the kobolds to a crazy &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Remy%20%22Two%20Times%22\"&gt;Remy \"Two Times\"&lt;/a&gt;. After reporting back to the Marshal, the adventurers investigate the more distant &lt;a href=\"Jasperlode%20Mine\"&gt;Jasperlode Mine&lt;/a&gt;, located in the foothills northeast of Goldshire. Finally, Dughan concludes that he will have to increase the patrols near the mines to be able to open them again.\nMaclures vs Stonefields.\nBernice's Necklace.\nWhile investigating the Fargodeep mine, the adventurers enter the &lt;a href=\"Stonefield%20Farm\"&gt;Stonefield Farm&lt;/a&gt;, where they stumble upon an old family feud. &lt;a href=\"%22Auntie%22%20Bernice%20Stonefield\"&gt;\"Auntie\" Bernice Stonefield&lt;/a&gt; lost her necklace, but she is convinced that &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Maclure\"&gt;Billy Maclure&lt;/a&gt;, member of the rival family of farmers, the Maclures, had stolen it. The adventurers ask Billy whether he had indeed stolen the object, to which he replies that he is \"too hungry to remember\". Turns out that Billy is a big fan of Bernice's &lt;a href=\"Pork%20Belly%20Pies\"&gt;Pork Belly Pies&lt;/a&gt;, and only those delicacies would make him remember. The adventurers hunt a few wild boars and take the meat back to Bernice. She isn't happy about it but wants her necklace back more, so she bakes the pie and they take it back to Billy. Billy still doesn't admit his wrongdoing, but he got the pie he wanted. Apparently, a large kobold named &lt;a href=\"Goldtooth\"&gt;Goldtooth&lt;/a&gt; stole Bernice Stonefield's necklace when Billy Maclure dropped it near the mine and took it to his den above it. The necklace is finally returned to \"Auntie\" Stonefield, who reveals the necklace originally belonged to her husband.\nTommy and Maybell.\n&lt;a href=\"William%20Pestle\"&gt;William&lt;/a&gt; asks the adventurers in the Lion's Pride Inn for a favor. Last time he was at the &lt;a href=\"Maclure%20Vineyards\"&gt;Maclure Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;, he overheard &lt;a href=\"Maybell%20Maclure\"&gt;Maybell Maclure&lt;/a&gt; crying in her cottage, so he wishes for someone to go check up on her. She reveals that she is in love with &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Joe%20Stonefield\"&gt;Tommy Joe Stonefield&lt;/a&gt;, but because their families are bitter enemies, they cannot be together. She asks the adventurers to deliver a &lt;a href=\"Maybell%27s%20Love%20Letter\"&gt;love letter&lt;/a&gt; she wrote to Tommy Joe, who after reading the letter tells them to speak with his &lt;a href=\"Gramma%20Stonefield\"&gt;grandmother&lt;/a&gt;. Gramma Stonefield is against the feud between the two families, so she goes to great lengths to bring the two lovers together. She sends a &lt;a href=\"Gramma%20Stonefield%27s%20Note\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; to William Pestle, who asks the adventurers to collect &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Kelp%20Fronds\"&gt;Crystal Kelp Fronds&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s living in the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Lake\"&gt;Crystal Lake&lt;/a&gt;. He manages to concoct an &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20Liquor\"&gt;Invisibility Liquor&lt;/a&gt; that the adventurers deliver to Maybell. Even though she feels guilty for deceiving her family, she drinks the liquor and vanishes, sneaking away.\nPrincess!\nThe &lt;a href=\"Brackwell%20Pumpkin%20Patch\"&gt;Brackwells&lt;/a&gt; own a huge prize winning pig, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20%28boar%29\"&gt;Princess&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to sneak all the way over to the Stonefield Farm and started eating their watermelons. &lt;a href=\"Ma%20Stonefield\"&gt;Ma Stonefield&lt;/a&gt; promptly asks the adventurers to kill the pig and bring her &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Collar\"&gt;Brass Collar&lt;/a&gt; as proof.\nA Swift Message.\n&lt;a href=\"Smith%20Argus\"&gt;Smith Argus&lt;/a&gt;, one of Goldshire's blacksmiths, needs to request a shipment of armor to &lt;a href=\"Osric%20Strang\"&gt;Osric Strang&lt;/a&gt;, owner of the &lt;a href=\"Limited%20Immunity\"&gt;Limited Immunity&lt;/a&gt; shop in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, since the supply levels are dwindling due to the high numbers of new recruits. The adventurers quickly arrange to be transported on &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s to the city, deliver &lt;a href=\"Argus%27%20Note\"&gt;Argus' Note&lt;/a&gt; to Osric's shop, and bring &lt;a href=\"Osric%27s%20Crate\"&gt;Osric's Crate&lt;/a&gt;, containing the supplies requested, back to Argus.\nOn to Eastvale.\nA Fishy Peril.\n&lt;a href=\"Remy%20%22Two%20Times%22\"&gt;Remy \"Two Times\"&lt;/a&gt; wants the adventurers to speak with &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; threat to the east. Since he cannot afford to send more troops east without a military report, he asks the adventurers to go speak with &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Thomas\"&gt;Guard Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, who confirms the murlocs have been behaving aggressively. Thomas then entrusts them with finding two guards, &lt;a href=\"Rolf%20Hartford\"&gt;Rolf Hartford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malakai%20Stone\"&gt;Malakai Stone&lt;/a&gt;, who were sent to investigate the murloc threat but had not yet returned. Both guards were found dead in the murloc village, so Guard Thomas decides that the murlocs are a threat that can no longer be ignored.\nEastvale Logging Camp.\nThe adventurers help the local population with advertised bounties and collecting wood. From murlocs to wild &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and a bounty on a local &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"James%20Clark\"&gt;James Clark&lt;/a&gt;, here the army is stretched thin as well. After killing James Clark, the adventurers find with him a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pickup%20Schedule\"&gt;Gold Pickup Schedule&lt;/a&gt;, detailing the gathering of the gold collected from the Elwynn mines. The man in charge appears to be called &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20the%20Collector\"&gt;The Collector&lt;/a&gt;, and resides in the &lt;a href=\"Brackwell%20Pumpkin%20Patch\"&gt;Brackwell Pumpkin Patch&lt;/a&gt;, which is now overrun by bandits. The adventurers kill the Collector and bring his ring to &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Patterson\"&gt;Marshal Patterson&lt;/a&gt;, back at Eastvale. He recognizes the ring as a membership ring from the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemason's Guild&lt;/a&gt;, an object he hasn't seen since the Defias Brotherhood leader, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, had been defeated years before.\nWestbrook Garrison.\nAfter the gold mines investigation, Marshal Dughan has one final assignment. The &lt;a href=\"Westbrook%20Garrison\"&gt;Westbrook Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, on the western border, has been sending reports of increasing &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; activity, and has been requesting more reinforcements, which the army does not have. The adventurers go help the soldiers deal with the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw gnolls&lt;/a&gt; and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt;. When he is severely injured, Hogger tries to run away, but word has been brought to Stormwind already, and &lt;a href=\"General%20Hammond%20Clay\"&gt;General Hammond Clay&lt;/a&gt; is suddenly teleported in, with &lt;a href=\"Maginor%20Dumas\"&gt;Maginor Dumas&lt;/a&gt; to his left and &lt;a href=\"High%20Sorcerer%20Andromath\"&gt;High Sorcerer Andromath&lt;/a&gt; to his right.

After suffering a great personal loss, he chose to live alone in a bog on the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, but this ultimately changed as the result of his friendship with the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keda%20Bloomblade\"&gt;Keda Bloomblade&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nElyrion once enjoyed a life of happiness with his beloved wife &lt;a href=\"Ellaene\"&gt;Ellaene&lt;/a&gt; and daughter &lt;a href=\"Arietta\"&gt;Arietta&lt;/a&gt; until they were both killed in a battle. He blamed himself for their deaths since he failed to supply the battle with healing potions. He subsequently moved to a cottage in a swamp, where he found new purpose in helping other kaldorei with his potions and became known as the \"mysterious hermit of the bog\". He did not dare to try to find happiness again and kept his tragic past a secret from others in order to alleviate the pain of his loss.\nElyrion befriended the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keda%20Bloomblade\"&gt;Keda Bloomblade&lt;/a&gt; when she came to his home for an antidote for one of her sisters-in-arms. Keda reminded Elyrion of his late daughter (though he didn't tell her this), and she frequently returned to him for wares and conversation. She often tried to invite him to visit her in the nearby village, with no success. Long after their first meeting, Keda told the alchemist about how she lacked the boldness to confess her romantic feelings for the Loreekeper &lt;a href=\"Toreth%20Bluestar\"&gt;Toreth Bluestar&lt;/a&gt;, and later about how she planned to impress the Lorekeeper with feats of heroism, since she believed that being a good soldier was her only desirable quality. Elyrion disagreed and told Keda\u2014who had been estranged from her family due to her life choices\u2014that she was a brave and remarkable person who deserved love simply for who she was.\nKeda repeatedly threw herself into danger but continued to feel too embarrassed to talk openly with Toreth. Elyrion grew tired of listening to her agonizing and offered to brew her a potion that would give her confidence, if she collected the last few ingredients for him: three crescents stones, two moss bunches, and a &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;'s tear. When Keda returned with the ingredients, Elyrion warned her that pursuing what she wanted also meant that she had more to lose. He told her that she reminded him of himself from long ago and explained how he preferred to live alone in the bog and find purpose through his work because he had once suffered a great loss, without revealing any further detail. Keda responded by returning the advice Elyrion had given her earlier: that he had value beyond his usefulness.\nThe potion gave Keda the confidence to finally enter a relationship with Toreth. However, when she told him about the potion, he revealed that all of the ingredients she'd collected were useless and that, as Lorekeeper, he was familiar with the Elyrion's history. The two sought out the alchemist, and he told them about Ellaene and Arietta. Keda invited Elyrion to return to the village with her. He initially refused, saying that there was nothing there for him and that he would be as alone as he was in the bog, but Keda retorted that visiting him had begun to feel like coming home for her. She then offered him a bundle of three crescent stones, two moss bunches, and a nightsaber's tear, saying that the mixture would help him see himself as worthy of having a family again, and added that she had \"love enough\" in her heart for a father of her choosing. After a moment, Elyrion smiled and accepted the bundle."}

The Hold was originally created by the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; herself, from which the &lt;a href=\"Ascended%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ascended&lt;/a&gt; can stand guard over the region. The rest of the Spires of Ascension were created by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Forgelite\"&gt;First Forgelite&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is the meeting place of the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; and Paragons of Bastion, and serves as the location of many powerful facilities and tools, such as the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; used to elevate new &lt;a href=\"ascended\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt;. Wards that protect each of the five temples of Bastion are also found in the Hold in the southern wing of the hold. The bell named Echo of Aeons in the central upper platform can summon the Paragons to the Archon while the northern wing holds the Bell of Recall to summon the ascended kyrians back to the hold.\nHistory.\nAfterlives.\nWhen the soul of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; was brought to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; following his demise on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, it was the Paragon of Loyalty &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; that took him under her supervision and made it her mission to oversee his &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;ascension&lt;/a&gt;. As time passed, she discovered that Uther's soul had somehow been wounded by the power of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, and brought this revelation to the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; and other Paragons in Elysian Hold at &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Archon's Rise&lt;/a&gt;. Despite her warnings, Devos's fears were dismissed by her fellow kyrian, and the Paragon departed from the Hold to take matters into her own hands.\nAnima Drought and Forsworn.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; experienced a severe &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought as part of the Jailer's plan, all parts of Bastion suffered from a lack of the precious resource. Many features of Elysian Hold itself were deactivated, including its &lt;a href=\"Anima%20Conductor\"&gt;Anima Conductor&lt;/a&gt; used to reinforce Bastion's temples. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortal allies&lt;/a&gt;, however, many of these tools were once again activated with the influx of new anima.\nThe newly-organized dark kyrian known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; would target Elysian Hold's wards as part of their first move against their brethren, with Uther the Lightbringer personally sabotaging those protecting the temples of &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Purity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt;, which would both fall to outside attack.\nAs the Forsworn rebellion gained momentum across Bastion, it was decided that new &lt;a href=\"ascended\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt; should be created to bolster the number of loyal kyrian. During the ceremony for this at the Hold's &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, the former Paragon of Loyalty Devos launched a surprise attack on the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, Elysian Hold, and the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Spires of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, she revealed herself to be the leader of the Forsworn and shattered the Crest to prevent any further ascension. In the ensuing battle, the Archon's forces were able to first retake the Hold from the attackers before moving to confront Devos herself deeper into the Spires, where she was defeated. Work to restore and empower the Crest soon began under the supervision of the Forgelite Prime, &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt;."}

He can be found in the eastern wing. He carries pieces of &lt;a href=\"Tier%208\"&gt;Tier 8&lt;/a&gt; loot and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; gear, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tier%207\"&gt;Tier 7&lt;/a&gt; loot dropped by &lt;a href=\"Archavon\"&gt;Archavon&lt;/a&gt;. Like Archavon, Emalon is only available to the faction that controls Wintergrasp Fortress. Also like Archavon, Emalon becomes un-attackable ten minutes before each fight for Wintergrasp starts. He does not become un-attackable if he is already engaged in combat.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; came to the Vault to find a way to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, the giant brothers who made it their home were less than cordial when he arrived, still furious after their previous encounters with the adventurers from both factions.\n25-man abilities.\nEmalon.\nMelee: About 20,000 on plate, once every three seconds.\nEmalon uses only lightning abilities.\nTempest Minions.\nFour are present at the beginning of the fight; when one is killed, a new one spawns to replace it. Each add has ~520,000 health.\n10-man abilities.\nEmalon.\nEmalon uses only lightning abilities.\nTempest Minions.\nFour are present at the beginning of the fight; when one is killed, a new one spawns to replace it. Each has ~141,000 health. Assuming all dps is attacking within three seconds of the first Overcharge application, each dps will need a minimum of 1.6k dps to down the minions in time.\nTargeting Overcharged Tempest Minions.\nQuickly targeting Tempest Minions when Emalon overcharges them is critical to killing them quickly enough. Picking out the correct Minion out of the crowd of four used to be somewhat time-consuming. However, as of Patch 3.1.3, overcharged Tempest Minions immediately grow to twice the height of their brethren. They are now easy to select. Just click on the tall one.\nStrategy.\nTen-man raids should use two tanks, two or three healers, and five or six damage-dealers, with ranged damage-dealers slightly preferred. Twenty-five-man raids should use two or three tanks, five to seven healers, and fifteen to eighteen damage-dealers.\nOn the pull, the tank (or tanks) for the Tempest Minions runs in first, closely followed by the tank for the boss. The boss tank taunts the boss immediately. Hunters and rogues can use &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tricks%20of%20the%20Trade\"&gt;Tricks of the Trade&lt;/a&gt; to help direct the targets to the correct tanks.\nThe boss tank and Minion tank separate to pre-agreed spots about 30 yards apart, so the Minion tank is not hit by Lightning Nova. Exact positioning is not important, so long as the separation is correct. Healers and ranged damage-dealers position themselves at least 30 yards from Emalon and in range of the Minions.\nOn 10-man, everyone must remain at least 10 yards away from everyone else, to keep Chain Lightning from jumping. On 25-man, it may be too crowded for this. Instead, stand exactly on top of one or two other characters, but at least 10 yards away from everyone else. This lets the Chain Lightning jump every time, but not far. Everyone must stay at least 10 yards away from the tanks.\nThe tanks' initial threat is low as they get their targets under control and positioned. This is because they are moving and they need to avoid grabbing each others' targets. Damage-dealers must wait until the tanks establish solid threat before they can attack. Once threat is established, they simply attack Emalon. There is no benefit to attacking the Minions until they are overcharged. They will constantly respawn\nA straight melee hit from Emalon can cause 20,000 damage to the tank. Two hits in a row, without intervening heals, can kill many tanks. Having two healers on the Emalon tank makes sure that he gets healed often enough. The Minions do extra damage when they are overcharged, so the Minion tank may need extra healing at that time. The rest of the raid must be healed through Chain Lightning and (on 25-man) Lightning Nova.\nAll melee must run away from Emalon when he starts to cast Lightning Nova, then run back in to attack.\nEmalon casts Overcharge on a strict 45-second timer. Use a timer mod (such as Deadly Boss Mods) to predict when he is about to cast it. All melee runs over to the Tempest Minions ahead of time. The overcharged Minion immediately grows to double height, and all damage-dealers attack it immediately, using whatever burst abilities they have. It must die in 20 seconds, or it wipes the raid.\nOnce the overcharged Minion dies, Emalon summons a new one near himself. The Minion tank must quickly pick it up. Having a third tank, while probably not necessary for survival purposes, makes picking up the new Minion more reliable.\nThe most common causes of wipes are exploding Minions, losses to Lightning Nova, losses to Chain Lightning, and losses to loose Minions.\nTo avoid wipes to exploding Minions, run a damage meter. Replace any damage dealers sustaining less than 2000 (10-man) or 2500 (25-man) DPS. If that is not reasonable, try positioning the Minions closer to the boss and rotating damage-dealing cooldowns (including Bloodlust/Heroism) on the overcharges.\nTo avoid losses to Chain Lightning, try separating and/or stacking as described above, or replace characters with low health. Having higher DPS also helps, as it allows the raid to win the fight before suffering too many deaths to the Chain Lightning.\nAvoiding wipes to loose Minions is mainly a matter of tank skill. The boss tank can grab the Minion initially, until the Minion tank can pick it up.

He is now re-establishing his court and inviting VIPs from Revendreth and beyond.\nDescription.\n\"A new court has opened in Revendreth, where Prince Renathal attempts to unite allies from across the Shadowlands and increase his covenant's influence.\"\nThe Ember Court is both a weekly event that is the Covenant Feature of the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; gained through doing the event, and the topmost floor of &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt is organized by &lt;a href=\"Temel\"&gt;Temel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Spire%20of%20the%20Unseen%20Guests\"&gt;Spire of the Unseen Guests&lt;/a&gt;, and the party occupies the entirety of the topmost level of &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe guest list is maintained by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Garridan\"&gt;Lord Garridan&lt;/a&gt;, entertainment is organized by the &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hips\"&gt;Hips&lt;/a&gt;, and refreshments provided by &lt;a href=\"Picky%20Stefan\"&gt;Picky Stefan&lt;/a&gt; from your first Court. Gaining reputation with the Ember Court unlocks further party organizing options, themes by &lt;a href=\"Boot%20the%20Beaut\"&gt;Boot the Beaut&lt;/a&gt; and security by &lt;a href=\"Watchmaster%20Boromod\"&gt;Watchmaster Boromod&lt;/a&gt;, purchased from Temel. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ilinca\"&gt;Lady Ilinca&lt;/a&gt; also sells Ember Court related items. Increasing your reputation also unlocks one of the color tints for the Venthyr Covenant sets, purchased from &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Rovinette\"&gt;Lady Rovinette&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nThe five categories of preferences are:\nBefore entering the Ember Court, various NPCs allow you to select options to modify it from the onset, allowing for different events or quests within the instance to help with the preference bar. Each option must be unlocked through a quest, the expansion of options must be purchased from Temel, and every week one of these NPCs requires a quest before you can choose an option that always requires obtaining one reagent and 20-50 &lt;a href=\"Infused%20Ruby\"&gt;Infused Ruby&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote, that each selection grants both its default and the opposite, with a slight boost to the default from the onset of the scenario. For example, the Traditional decoration is +Dangerous because the candles cause fires, but if you put them out it grants +Safe.\nThe more NPCs you unlock, the more upgrades you obtain (Sanctum Upgrade or purchased upgrade), and the more selections you unlock, the more populated the Ember Court becomes, both instanced and uninstanced. For example, unlocking Stoneborn Reserves as an option places &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; statues and gargoyles all over the perimeter of Sinfall.\nDifferent rewards are obtained at the end of each party depending on both your standing reputation with each RSVP Guest and their happiness levels. Each guest has a set of preferences that makes them happier, and going contrary to those preferences makes them unhappy. \nThe happiness spectrum ranges from Miserable, to Unhappy, to Uncomfortable, to Comfortable, to Happy, to Elated. Elated brings the most anima rewards, the most reputation gain for that guest, and the rarer rewards. In addition, you gain reputation for each guest you have present, where the more you have, the more you gain.\nSanctum Upgrades.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dredger%20Butler\"&gt;Dredger Butler&lt;/a&gt; pet can be customized.\nThe Professionals unlocks the following:\nRSVP guest possibilities.\nAll reward chests grant Ember Court reputation proportional to their happiness levels. They also grant grey items, anima, transmog appearances, mounts, and buffs that are either visual flavor or damage buffs that last for an hour or more."}

Broll used the feather to summon Sharptalon, and escape from &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; to Ashenvale. During the process, Sharptalon was injured by an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wyvern%20rider\"&gt;wyvern rider&lt;/a&gt;. Broll rode him during a fight in the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. His next stops were &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20Hold\"&gt;Thistlefur Hold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and then Sharptalon was free to go.\nHe apparently returned to Ashenvale as he was attacked and killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Horde who took his claw to &lt;a href=\"Senani%20Thunderheart\"&gt;Senani Thunderheart&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Horde &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s that know the secrets of taming &lt;a href=\"feathermane\"&gt;feathermane&lt;/a&gt;s can catch him.\nSpeculation.\nSince Sharptalon has been a quest objective since \"Classic\", it is possible that is a name given to a rare breed, or perhaps family, of hippogryphs. It is also possible it is a different hippogryph than the one ridden by Broll, since &lt;a href=\"Senani%20Thunderheart\"&gt;Senani Thunderheart&lt;/a&gt; remarks the \"beast terrorized many over the years\" and the Sharptalon ridden by Broll was called after the invasion of Outland, some time after adventurers would have originally killed the Ashenvale NPC in \"Classic\". (Like many other named kill quests that survived from \"Classic\" to the \"Cataclysm\" revamp, the timing of the creature in question's death is uncertain.) The most likely event seems to be that since it was only a claw turned in, that the original adventurer(s) happened along a rather large and/or vicious hippogyph in Ashenvale, thought it was Sharptalon, killed it and claimed the bounty, although it was not the actual beast. (This template has been used in some other named kill quests that survived from \"Classic\", and it seems to work well here, especially given that the quest gossip text was updated for the \"Cataclysm\" version.) Whether or not, then, the actual Sharptalon was killed in the \"Cataclysm\" revamp would remain debatable."}

The event was introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1\"&gt;patch 2.1&lt;/a&gt; and requires or higher reputation with &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the event, the player does not control his or her character, but instead controls a single \"demon pet\" with a variety of abilities. The player's character spends the entirety of the event disabled, while the player controls this demon pet from a third-person point of view, a la Mind Control.\nThe event consists of three \"phases\" or battles, each of which places the player in control of a different demon. Each phase has a variety of objectives and mobs to battle, but generally, the idea is to defeat your enemies without letting your demon perish.\nOther players are not able to assist in this event. Mobs are marked friendly to anyone other than the player currently completing the event.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, completion of the event awards 3x in addition to the other previous loot items. However, 2x are received instead when dropped as the loot item and is a known bug.\nStarting the event.\nTo access the event, a player must first obtain reputation with &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;. Once honored, a new quest will become available, &lt;a href=\"Banish%20the%20Demons\"&gt;Banish the Demons&lt;/a&gt;. Creating the portal consumes one and lasts 3 minutes.\nUpon completion of &lt;a href=\"Banish%20the%20Demons\"&gt;Banish the Demons&lt;/a&gt;, the player will receive a . This opens up the daily quest &lt;a href=\"Banish%20More%20Demons\"&gt;Banish More Demons&lt;/a&gt;, which has a reward that has a chance of containing a new or a . Five fragments can be used to create a complete darkrune. Once a is obtained, it can be turned in to &lt;a href=\"Gahk\"&gt;Gahk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; to receive . Note that the is unique but separate, so that one might carry a , a plain , and as many as five , all at once.\nTo start the event, use the while standing near &lt;a href=\"Shartuul%27s%20Transporter\"&gt;Shartuul's Transporter&lt;/a&gt;. If another player has recently ended an attempt (either by completing or by failing), the &lt;a href=\"Felguard%20Degrader\"&gt;Felguard Degrader&lt;/a&gt; will respawn immediately, but you will have to wait briefly until he starts moving before you can begin.\nControls.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, the controls for the various demons appear directly on your main action bar. Previously, they would appear as a pet's action bar.\nKnown bugs.\nThe event can bug out for an unknown reason.\nBugs include:\nFirst demon.\nThe first demon you control is the &lt;a href=\"Felguard%20Degrader\"&gt;Felguard Degrader&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nHis normal attacks deal ~1000-1500 per hit and helps if the mortal strike doesn't kill the target.\nOpponents.\nTwo types of mobs will be summoned throughout the stage:\nSecond demon.\nThe second demon you control is the &lt;a href=\"Doomguard%20Punisher\"&gt;Doomguard Punisher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird demon.\nThe third demon you control is the &lt;a href=\"Shivan%20Assassin\"&gt;Shivan Assassin&lt;/a&gt;.\nForms.\nThis demon has three different aspects, similar to a Warrior's stances, that can be swapped into and out of throughout the fight. All forms cost no mana and have a small (2 second) delay while switching (but can be cast on the move and are not interruptable save for being stunned) and have four unique abilities to each. The specific form abilities are listed below.\nNote: There is a 10 second cooldown on form changes and a 30 second cooldown per form. Use caution when changing forms when a boss is about to use an ability.\nAll Aspects.\nChaos Strike - 2.5 Second Cast - 15 second cooldown - Requires 2x - Deals very high damage along with:\nUsing a Death Blast and Shadow Nova after a Chaos Strike which caused the weakness effect will heal your demon for quite a lot. Reapplying Siphon Life and casting Death Blast in short order will essentially heal your demon to full. Casting Chaos Strike will buff your demon with Chaos Form for 30 seconds, giving you spell haste and +300% damage. \nAspect of the Flame.\nPatch 3.0.2 Bug.\nIntroduced with &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the Flame Buffet ability is bugged causing Pyroblasts to do less damage once it goes over 6 stacks. Until this is fixed, be sure to stack it to 6, let it run out and repeat.\nStrategy.\nNote: Leaving the area marked off by the yellow tethers will cause your demon to be thrown back into the ring and can cause potential issues with the event. Do not leave the ring.\nDemon 1: Phase 1.\nYou start the event controlling the &lt;a href=\"Felguard%20Degrader\"&gt;Felguard Degrader&lt;/a&gt; patrolling around the transporter. This is fairly simple phase. The goal is to break through the barrier on the portal, which causes the boss of this phase to spawn.\nThere is a time limit to the phase, so if you don't Smash Shield soon after it is up each time you'll forfeit the event. As soon as you have control of the demon, use Smash Shield right away and watch the cooldown of this closely throughout the fight to ensure you always use it right away. For this phase, all minor creatures despawn when the boss spawns, so using Smash Shield is a higher priority than finishing off a creature that might be attacking you.\nMost creatures will die to one Mortal Strike or a strike plus a swing. Note that your special attacks do not also cause you to auto-attack\u2014if Mortal Strike doesn't finish a Felhound Defenders or Fel Imp Defender off, right-click on it to swing. Mortal Strike is on a very short cooldown so don't be shy about using it whenever it is up.\nSingle target the Felhounds that spawn by using your auto-attack and Mortal Strike until an Imp spawns and starts to attack you. You will then want to drag any Felhound that are on you towards the Imp so when you Chaos Charge the Imp, the Felhounds also die. Finish off any leftover Imps/Felhounds with a Might Whirlwind or Mortal Strike.\nIf you get low on health, wait until many Felhounds are surrounding you and use your Absorb Life.\nDemon 1: Phase 2 (Boss).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Doomguard%20Punisher\"&gt;Doomguard Punisher&lt;/a&gt; will come out of the portal once it reaches 0% and all minor demons will despawn.\nUse Mortal Strike on the boss every time its up. You should not need to use Mighty Whirlwind at all. When the boss starts casting Fel Flames, use Terrifying Roar followed shortly by Chaos Charge.\nThere is a small chance the boss will resist your Fear and if he's using Fel Flames, it will be lethal unless your demon is near full health. If this happens, you need to run as far away as quick as possible or use your Absorb Life skill.\nUpon defeating this boss you will receive 100 reputation with &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemon 2: Phase 1.\nNow you have control over the &lt;a href=\"Doomguard%20Punisher\"&gt;Doomguard Punisher&lt;/a&gt; and this is where it starts to get difficult.\nThis phase starts with a small number of &lt;a href=\"Gan%27arg%20Underling\"&gt;Gan'arg Underling&lt;/a&gt;s. They don't deal very much damage on their own but they have a nasty channeled ability which spawns a Portable Fel Cannon that has very low hit points and deals very high damage to you if left alive. The cast time on spawning a Fel Cannon is approx. 6\u20138 seconds and they will run off a short distance (thus stopping their attacks of you) to spawn one, so pay close attention to them.\nIf a Gan'arg begins summoning a &lt;a href=\"Portable%20Fel%20Cannon\"&gt;Portable Fel Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, that should be your immediate priority. Unless they are at 10% or under (and thus can be killed with one \"Punishing Blow\" swing, your best bet is to interrupt the cast somehow. If there are mobs around you, use the Super Jump ability to stun the mobs near you and interrupt your target as you land. While the nearby target is stunned, \"Punishing Blow\" for big damage then try to run over to the previously stunned mobs for another \"Punishing Blow\" with bonus damage if the stun lasts long enough.\nIf there aren't creatures around you during a Fel Cannon summoning, or Super Jump is on cooldown, use Throw Axe to interrupt or Consume Essence to kill him at low HP.\nAfter 3 waves of Gan'arg Underlings (8 total), a large &lt;a href=\"Mo%27arg%20Tormenter\"&gt;Mo'arg Tormenter&lt;/a&gt; will spawn along with 4 Gan'args around him and 3 more not near him. Mo'args are top priority during these waves due to their high damage Acid Geyser ability. When these spawns, immediately use Throw Axe on the Mo'arg and get a Mortal Strike in. Start to run away and once the Axe Throw stun wears off, Super Jump onto the Mo'arg (stunning all the Gan'arg Underlings on the take off). This should allow you enough time to finish him off with Mortal Strike. Once the Mo'arg is dead, use Fel Flames while backing up to finish off all the Gan'arg underlings.\nOnce thing to note here is that the Gan'arg Underlings have an ability which will make the Mo'arg invulnerable. If one starts casting this, you need to use Consume Essence on the Gan'arg whom is casting or stun him via Throw Axe or Super Jump. Be sure to watch for any Gan'arg Underlings starting to summon Fel Cannons and be sure to Consume Essence whenever it is available.\nAfter 3 waves of Mo'args, 2 more Gan'arg Underlings will spawn which means the boss is about to come out. Use Consume Essence on the first and kill it right away. Keep the second one alive during the boss fight to Consume Essence on whenever it comes up again.\nDemon 2: Phase 2 (Boss).\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Shivan%20Assassin\"&gt;Shivan Assassin&lt;/a&gt; spawns, open up with an Axe Throw and Mortal Strike. The object of this boss is to keep her stunned as much as possible. Once the Axe Throw stun wears off, get some distance and Super Jump followed by 2 Mortal Strikes. Keep using the Axe Throw/Mortal Strike/Super Jump/2x Mortal Strike cycle until the boss is defeated.\nNote: There has been a known bug with defeating this boss away from the transporter so try your best to ensure she is defeated near it.\nUpon defeating the &lt;a href=\"Shivan%20Assassin\"&gt;Shivan Assassin&lt;/a&gt; you will receive 200 (100 x 2) reputation with &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemon 3: Phase 1 (Boss 1).\nNow you have control of the third and final demon, the &lt;a href=\"Shivan%20Assassin\"&gt;Shivan Assassin&lt;/a&gt;. There is no 'trash' to fight for this demon. Instead you fight three bosses in a row. \nThe first boss (&lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Shartuul\"&gt;Eye of Shartuul&lt;/a&gt;) is not too difficult, it melees for around 18k and has 4 abilities:\nStart out this boss in Aspect of Shadow. Once the boss becomes active and starts moving towards you, cast Siphon Life and Shadow Nova (within range of him). You should then stay in Aspect of the Shadow casting your Shadow Nova near the boss whenever it is up. Once you have around 5 seconds left on your Siphon Life cooldown, cast Death Blast to consume the current Siphon Life debuff then reapply it. Note: Be sure to wait for the old Siphon Life to be removed, if your Death Blast misses or you cast Siphon Life too early, you will end up wasting possible damage or even worse, not having Siphon Life up.\nEvery so often, the boss will cast Dark Glare which is indicated by a raid emote in the middle of the screen (\"The Eye of Shartuul focuses intently!\"). When you see this, you need to switch into Aspect of Ice and use Iceblock once Dark Glare is almost done casting. Using it too early will cause the Ice Block to wear off before Dark Glare is casted. Once you reflect the damage, cast an Iceblast then switch back into Aspect of Shadow and repeat.\nUpon Eye of Shartuul's death, you will receive 500 reputation with &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemon 3: Phase 2 (Boss 2).\nThe second boss, &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaw%20%28fel%20beast%29\"&gt;Dreadmaw&lt;/a&gt;, is a large demon dog who is by far the easiest boss. He hits very hard in melee and has two abilities:\nThis boss must be kited at all times and should never reach you in melee range. Start out the fight in Aspect of Shadow and apply Siphon Life/Shadow Nova and switch into Aspect of the Flame. While in Aspect of the Flame, you will move well faster than the boss. Keep Flame Buffet up (only to 6 stacks though due to the bug) and Pyroblast whenever possible.\nWhenever he Charges you, cleanse the debuff using Cleansing Flame and switch into Aspect of the Shadow. Cast Death Blast to consume the Siphon Life and heal you, then reapply Siphon Life on him. Switch back into Aspect of the Flame. If done correctly, you should end the fight with very close to 100% life.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2\"&gt;patch 3.2&lt;/a&gt;, the Dreadmaw fight is bugged and extremely difficult. Cleansing Flame will not dispel his debuff, making the fight almost impossible. The only way to defeat Dreadmaw is to collect a large number of and use Chaos Strike very often. A combination of Chaos Strike and then Siphon Life, Death Blast, and Shadow Nova will allow you to defeat him quickly, while maintaining high health for the final boss.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaw%20%28fel%20beast%29\"&gt;Dreadmaw&lt;/a&gt;'s death, you will receive 500 reputation with &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemon 3: Phase 3 (Final Boss).\nThis fight involves fighting &lt;a href=\"Shartuul\"&gt;Shartuul&lt;/a&gt; himself as well as numerous Eye Tentacles (think C'Thun). The tentacles will Mind Flay you and other players nearby (this was originally intended to stop other players assisting against Shartuul) for 7.5k a tick. In the middle of the transporter you are safe from the tentacles.\nShartuul melees for around 10k and has the following abilities:\nBe aware that Magnetic Pull/Blink can throw your Assassin into the transporter wall making you unable to move. Shartuul will most likely start evading when you use Ice Block on his first Incinerate because he can't reach you with spell nor melee attacks. There is a small chance of saving yourself by using Ice Leap, jumping back into the direction you came from. Avoid this at all costs, because you will lose your precious Darkrune.\nStart off the fight in a corner of the area and in Aspect of the Shadow. Apply Siphon Life at the start and use Shadow Nova to kill the Eye Tentacles and switch into Aspect of the Flame. Start to stack Flame Buffets (up to 6 due to bug) while also weaving Pyroblasts inbetween. Use Cleansing Flame on any debuffs he puts on you, especially the Immolate.\nEither he will use Magnetic Pull or Incinerate (which is always casted after an Immolate) after a bit of time. If he uses Magnetic Pull, you should switch into Aspect of the Shadow and use Death Blast to consume your Siphon Life and reapply it afterwards. You can also use Shadow Nova to kill any Eye Tentacles that have spawned and/or hit Shartuul with it for extra healing. Switch back into Aspect of the Flame and continue casting Pyroblast/Flame Buffet and cleansing any debuffs. If you are standing in a corner you should only be hit by 1 or 2 Mind Flays at a time so killing the Eye Tentacles is not a priority. If he spawns Eye Tentacles right after you switch out of Aspect of the Shadow, you can move into the center of the transporter to not be hit by any Mind Flays until he does a Magnetic Pull or Incinerate.\nIf he casts Incinerate, which is denoted by a raid warning and is preceded by an Immolate, you need to switch into Aspect of the Ice and use Ice Block once his cast is near complete (using it too early will end the Ice Block effect before the Incinerate hits you). You should then switch into Aspect of the Shadow and use Death Blast/Siphon Life/Shadow Nova. Switch back into Aspect of the Flame and continue casting Pyroblast/Flame Buffet and cleansing any debuffs.\nIf you become low on health, remember to use your &lt;a href=\"Shartuul%27s%20Transporter%20%28event%29%23Healing\"&gt;Chaos Strike&lt;/a&gt; for max healing.\nAfter Shartuul is defeated (he commits suicide at 1 health point remaining, he does that after he finishs his cast, you can't kill him yourself), your demon will die and you will regain control back over your normal character. The Eye Tentacles will die when Shartuul dies. Upon Shartuul's death, you will receive 750 reputation with &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; and he will be lootable with the chance to drop the following items:"}

It multiplies the critical strike chance of all the mage's spells against frozen targets by 1.5 plus an additional 50%. A frozen target is a target immobilized by a frost-based effect, such as &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt; or the freeze effect from the &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Band\"&gt;Freezing Band&lt;/a&gt;. The critical strike chance applies to all of the mage's spells, including those not in the Frost school.\nTips and tactics.\nFreeze effects have a much higher chance to break when taking damage, meaning it can be difficult to get more than one spell to land on each freeze. It is still possible to get two criticals on the same freeze effect before it breaks. First, use a long cast time spell that also has a projectile travel time, such as &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately after the cast, use an instant spell such as &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Lance\"&gt;Ice Lance&lt;/a&gt;, if you are fast enough and at good range. The check to see if the target is frozen, and thus the critical strike check, is done at the time the cast completes, while the freeze effect is not removed from the target until after the spell hits. Thus, both spells will have the benefit of Shatter due to the time of flight for the first spell."}

The instance is one of the first endgame instances in players will encounter.\nBackground.\nFor years, this gargantuan fortress was thought to be abandoned, but it's now inhabited by marauding bands of red, furious &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The presence of this new, savage breed presents something of a mystery, though what is far more disconcerting is that the numbers of these fel orcs seem to be... growing.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stand Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars.\"\nOverview.\nShattered Halls has a very straight layout with only one way to go. Several increasingly large packs test the group's focus and crowd crontrol or aoe abilities. The most difficult being the last one before the first boss. A rogue can lockpick the door to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlock%20Nethekurse\"&gt;Grand Warlock Nethekurse&lt;/a&gt;, (or an engineer with a &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Seaforium%20Charge\"&gt;Elemental Seaforium Charge&lt;/a&gt; can blow it open) and thus avoid the sewers - an area with large groups of slime mobs and several single ones on a fast respawn timer. \nAfter Nethekurse you enter the gauntlet event. Archers from the far side will shoot fireball arrows that leave burning spots on the ground while you fight your way ahead. There are some static mobs as well as small packs that continuously spawn at the end and come your way. All of these mobs are nonelite. The respawn is on a static timer. Thus, if you kill them fast enough, you will leave combat. Depending on your group, you may either kill them one pack at a time or run right through to the last alcove and AOE them down all at once.\nAt the end of the gauntlet - on heroic mode - &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Guard%20Porung\"&gt;Blood Guard Porung&lt;/a&gt; awaits you. You will encounter two more large packs flanked by two groups of gladiators each. The packs can and should be pulled out of the room to avoid adding the gladiators. The gladiators will fight among themselves and can be pulled when most of them are already low on health.

Formed from outcasts and liberated &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; gladiator slaves, the clan was named after its gruesome self-mutilation practices. The clan was left behind on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s, but later rallied under &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;. Following Draenor's transformation into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, many Shattered Hand transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, with their founder and chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; in service to the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the modern day, the Shattered hand is also known as the Order of the Shattered Hand (or simply the Hand for short) and is a secretive multi-racial &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; organization of spies, assassins, and &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; trainers. They value ruthlessness, cunning, and the nerve to do what must be done to ensure peace for the rest of their people; seemingly fulfilling a role similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s . It is still considered a clan, and took part in Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; had a long history of enslaving &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and forcing them to fight each other in brutal arenas for entertainment. Around 11 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, a slave named &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt; tore off his own hand to escape his chains and rallied his fellow slaves to do the same. Those who did accompanied him as he rampaged through &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, spilling the blood of his masters. Kargath and the former slaves established a new clan, known as the Shattered Hand, and settled in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nThe Shattered Hand were present at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; announced the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; as the enemies of the orcs. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Shattered Hand were among the clans assigned to act as scouts, raiders, and auxiliary forces that could quickly move from one region of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to another. Shattered Hand warriors were among the war party that sacked &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;, with one of them killing a young draenei girl in front of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the clan was present during the drinking of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; atop the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne year later, Kargath Bladefist was charged with eliminating the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; and formed a lightly armored but highly mobile invasion force from the Shattered Hand, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; clans. After dozens of orcs were incinerated by the arakkoa's &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;immense cannon&lt;/a&gt;, Kargath convinced the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcast arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; to sneak into Skyreach and sabotage the weapon. The Outcasts were successful, but Kargath and his forces then proceeded to slaughter the Outcasts alongside the high arakkoa, throwing some of the latter into &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde assault led to the destruction of high arakkoan civilization and the near-extinction of the Outcasts.\nAfter the Horde had conquered much of Draenor, the threat of starvation caused many orcs to grow more agitated and turn on each other, clashing in short-lived battles that left hundreds dead. Shattered Hand raiders attacked the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; for grain, seeing them as a clear target for their pacifist views. As the &lt;a href=\"Dying%20Time\"&gt;Dying Time&lt;/a&gt; went along, several clans, among them the Shattered Hand, completely lost themselves to the depths of madness. To protect the rest of the Horde, Blackhand banished the violent clans from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the remote areas of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in order to preserve some of the Horde's dwindling strength.\nWhen the Horde prepared to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand ordered the troublesome clans to remain on Draenor, since he believed that they would become liabilities if allowed to participate in the invasion. He knew that the clans would grow restless on Draenor, but a few months of waiting while hearing only stories of the lush new world and seeing only scraps of the war spoils would force them to be on their best behavior. If the clans were still uncontrollable, they could stay on Draenor and rot, for all Blackhand cared. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the new Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; sent messengers to Draenor to call up the remaining clans in order to replenish the Horde's numbers, but the messengers later returned to inform the Warchief that the clans on Draenor had descended deeper into bloodlust and had begun fighting with one another, allowing only a few orcs and ogres to bolster the Horde.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nLife on Draenor was stark for Draenor's orcs, as the world continued to die and the orcs continued being consumed by bloodlust and violence. The &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; and Shattered Hand clans, in particular, had insatiable needs for violence. Following the Horde's defeat on Azeroth at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul rallied the clans still left on Draenor, the Shattered Hand among them, under his &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;new banner&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of opening portals to new worlds for the Horde to conquer. The gathered chieftains easily agreed to Ner'zhul's plans; having sat out the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and Second Wars, they thirsted for battle, and any chance to escape their dying homeworld was worth taking. Almost immediately after Ner'zhul reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Warsong chieftain &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; led the Warsong, Shattered Hand, &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt; in an invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; led a group of orcs and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s away from the Blasted Lands in search of the artifacts that would allow Ner'zhul to open portals to new worlds.\nAfter Gorefiend brought the artifacts back to Draenor, Ner'zhul and the bulk of the Horde journeyed from Hellfire Citadel to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; to begin performing the ritual, but he left Kargath and the Shattered Hand behind to hold the invading &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; at bay. The Alliance mistakenly believed that Ner'zhul was still in Hellfire Citadel and launched an all-out offensive on the stronghold. The Shattered Hand had dug in at the citadel for a siege and had hoped to hold the Alliance at bay for a week, but their defenses fell before the end of the first day. Even with the aid of &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragons&lt;/a&gt;, Kargath had no means to repel simultaneous attack from &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s and soldiers on the ground. Once &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; joined the fray, Kargath was forced to abandon his position and flee into the wastes.\nKargath and his clan sailed to &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; quarantined there, but as &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; refused their request they soon left again. Realizing that he had too few soldiers to make a difference, Bladefist instead decided to abandon the struggle and reclaim Hellfire Citadel one day in the future, when he was stronger and more prepared.\nThe New Horde.\nOn Azeroth, the Shattered Hand have become an integral part of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s New Horde and now accept various other races into their ranks, including &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. Based out of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowswift%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Shadowswift Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, they are responsible for watching the Horde's enemies and for training aspiring &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s from various races in the ways of stealth, deception, and the brewing of deadly poisons. Thrall acknowledged that the Hand was necessary to ensure orc and troll safety. \"The great &lt;a href=\"Shenthul\"&gt;Shenthul&lt;/a&gt;\" appeared to be considered a high-ranking member of the organization. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt; have allies within the Shattered Hand.\nMany members of the Hand do not survive their training. The only way for a member of the organization to truly identify another member of the Hand is through a gesture known as the Shattered Salute.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt some point, the Shattered Hand on Draenor, now &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and joined the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; in service to the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Kargath himself made good on his promise of reclaiming Hellfire Citadel and became the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Fel Horde, ruling from the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany Shattered Hand are camped along the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt; leading up to Hellfire Citadel from the Dark Portal, as well as in the breaches in the northern and southern ramparts. They also make up the majority of the forces inside the Shattered Halls. The &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20Legionnaire\"&gt;legionnaires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20Champion\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20Centurion\"&gt;centurions&lt;/a&gt; of the Shattered Hand made up the elite of the Fel Horde. They were feared by the regular troops and serve as an officer corps. &lt;a href=\"Force-Commander%20Gorax\"&gt;Force-Commander Gorax&lt;/a&gt;, a subordinate of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Kargath\"&gt;Hand of Kargath&lt;/a&gt;, was charged with training Shattered Hand captains at the base of Hellfire Citadel, honing them to a bloody razor's edge. Unhappy with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s' successes against the fel orc clans, a Shattered Hand force led by &lt;a href=\"Drillmaster%20Zurok\"&gt;Drillmaster Zurok&lt;/a&gt; began organizing for an all-out assault. After Alliance heroes killed Zurok, scouts reported that the Shattered Hand were in disarray.\nKargath was ultimately slain by adventurers, who retrieved his namesake fist.\nCataclysm.\nThe Shattered Hand on Azeroth lay mostly quiet for several years, but continued to serve under the new &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, as they had under Thrall. &lt;a href=\"Gordul\"&gt;Gordul&lt;/a&gt; is now considered the leader of the Hand's rogues in Orgrimmar. The Shattered Hand rogue &lt;a href=\"Kagtha\"&gt;Kagtha&lt;/a&gt; and several other operatives were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; to take the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; and use it against the Alliance, which Kagtha considered to be a symbol of the Shattered Hand's \"rebirth\" after its long dormancy.\nThe Shattered Hand also spied on the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; and reported that they seemed to be preparing for something.\nTraveler.\nAt an undefined point, several years before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Shattered Hand clan orcs found the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fighting the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Mahrook%20clan\"&gt;Mahrook clan&lt;/a&gt;. They defeated the Alliance, but the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s were wiped out, all except the warrior &lt;a href=\"Throgg\"&gt;Throgg&lt;/a&gt;. The ogre immediately recognized the orcs as they only had one hand. He knew that they weren't numerous on Azeroth since only a few were left. The orc &lt;a href=\"Teremok\"&gt;Teremok&lt;/a&gt; approached him and offered the ogre a place amongst the Shattered Hand. Seeing them as great warriors and without any ogre brothers left, Throgg agreed to join. To seal the deal, Teremok cut off Throgg's hand and to replace it, Throgg was given a variety of weapons to choose from the clan's &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulmok\"&gt;Ulmok&lt;/a&gt;. Throgg and the Shattered Hand clan continued fighting the Alliance, but in time his only friends and brothers in the clan, Teremok, and Ulmok, were killed during the battles.\nThe other orcs didn't treat Throgg well. When the Shattered Hand assisted the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; with locating Captain &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, its leader, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; noticed Throgg. The human bought the ogre's release from the Shattered Hand from &lt;a href=\"Garamok\"&gt;Garamok&lt;/a&gt; for 30 silver. Garamok said that Throgg would never become a true Shattered Hand and that they would use him for carrying supplies.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, several members of the Hand led by &lt;a href=\"Gordul\"&gt;Gordul&lt;/a&gt; joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Skulker\"&gt;Shattered Skulker&lt;/a&gt;s participated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; and were seen occupying &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; with Horde troops..\nDragonflight.\nThe Shatter Hand clan was one of the orcish clans in attendance at the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; held on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, represented by their chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Thega%20Graveblade\"&gt;Thega Graveblade&lt;/a&gt; and a number of their members. When questioned as to why &lt;a href=\"Gordul\"&gt;Gordul&lt;/a&gt; no longer led the Shattered Hand, Thega reveals that she usurped him; as is the way of their clan, that the strongest must lead. She dissuaded any worries about his fate, stating that he was present at the Kosh'harg as well, and had not been slain.\nWhen the clan leaders gathered inside of the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Barracks\"&gt;Razor Hill Barracks&lt;/a&gt; to pitch their clan to prospective orcish recruits; Thega highlighted how the Shattered Hand valued ruthlessness, cunning, and the nerve to do what must be done to ensure peace for the rest of their people. She also revealed that the Shattered Hand had been watching them from the shadows and would welcome them into the clan with pleasure. Upon the champion requesting to join the Shattered Hand, Thega declared it a good choice. She subsequently instructed them with hunting, tracking, and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Thega accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of the clan.\nAs the Kosh'harg festival neared its end, Thega invited &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; into the Shattered Hand, who promised to consider the matter.\nCulture.\nOn Draenor, slavery had changed the Shattered Hand into a twisted and embittered people who knew only pain and torment, and they adopted bloody traditions of self-disfigurement and scarification. Made up of orcs who could call no other clan home, the Shattered Hand were sadistic warriors who maimed their bodies, perhaps in a show of solidarity, or perhaps because they simply enjoyed the pain, which they claimed strengthened them. The clan celebrated victory in battle with self-mutilation. Their most celebrated warriors were covered with scars and piercings, and it became increasingly difficult with age to tell which were inflicted by enemies or by the triumphant orc.\nTaking their namesake literally, warriors of the Shattered Hand would ritualistically smash their own left hand before cutting it off as a way to demonstrate their loyalty to the clan. The stump was cauterized and replaced with one of many varieties of crude tools or weaponry. Heavily weighted blades resembling simple butcher's cleavers were used to make a single clean cut at the wrist.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the practice of severing one's hand had been abandoned as a requirement.\nAll incarnations of the Shattered Hand appear to be known for using &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and assassin units. It seems to be common for Shattered Hand assassins to retain both hands.\nIn Warcraft II.\nLeader: &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Korgath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;\nColor: White\nAs those of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the Shattered Hand practice the rituals of self-mutilation to demonstrate their loyalty to the clan. &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s who rise to the status of warrior within the clan offer their left hands to be broken or completely removed. Their ruined stumps are often replaced by some sort of crude weapon or tool.\nCampaign.\n\"The following events were &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned by the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\" and the expansion, \"\":\"\nThe Shattered Hand had stayed in Draenor when the orcs first crossed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and were spared the defeat that ended the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Under Kargath, the Shattered Hand and the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; lent their forces to &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; from a captain of the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nKargath led a force of Shattered Hand orcs into Azeroth. Kargath's Shattered Hand army defended the Azerothian side of the Dark Portal during the last days of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. They were left stranded with their chieftain after Ner'zhul abandoned them and the Portal was destroyed by the Alliance.\nIn Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", the Shattered Hand clan had several appearances, notably at the &lt;a href=\"Ork%20Reservation\"&gt;orcish reservation&lt;/a&gt;. Following the lore in the orc campaign of \"Warcraft II\", the Shattered Hand were stranded on Azeroth and imprisoned with their leader by &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;. A new character, &lt;a href=\"Clawhand\"&gt;Clawhand&lt;/a&gt; was another named member of the clan and had a mechanical pincer-like tool for a hand.\nThe clan's culture was developed during the game: it was said that when a young warrior of the clan came of age, he crippled his own left hand with the hammer of the chieftain, and then the hand was replaced with a weapon fitting the orc's character. Many lethargic members of the clan had sold their blade hands to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"black%20ale\"&gt;black ale&lt;/a&gt;, the forest troll being fond of collecting them, and when Thrall was given a hacksaw-hand that was considered unworthy of the collection he noted that the tool must have belonged to a &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt; of the clan.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Karthog\"&gt;Karthog&lt;/a&gt; could be a member."}

Following the symbolic severing of one's hand from the chains binding him in order to earn freedom, as Kargath himself desperately demonstrated while he was chained under the &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; arena, these former slaves have been drawn together through a macabre joy of pain both self-inflicted and imposed upon others. It is through this pain that they believe they gather strength, and their reputation as relentless and dirty fighters is well-earned.\nThe Shattered Hand clan is made up of orcs who can call no other clan home. They are sadistic warriors who maim their bodies, perhaps in a show of solidarity or perhaps because they simply enjoy the pain.\nHistory.\nBirth.\nThese orcs were raised as slaves by the &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. They were imprisoned and held beneath &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; for many years. Striving for their own freedom, they became gladiators fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; arena. The price to earn their freedom was to take one hundred orcish lives while fighting in the arena. Among them, fought in the arena for his freedom. Having won every battle against his opponents, Kargath marched out of Highmaul, only to discover the promise of freedom to be a lie. Kargath was thrown in a dungeon beneath the arena, and desperately severed his hand, which was bound by shackles, in frustration and rage. The other orc slaves, seeing his resolve, followed in his footsteps and did the same. They followed Kargath in his uprising against the ogres and helped him slay the emperor. Kargath showed the severed head of the emperor to his followers, and they raised their severed hands, armed with blades, cheering at him. This moment marked the birth of the Shattered Hand clan.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Shattered Hand was one of the clans that responded to the call of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. While the previously claimed no specific territories, they were able to firmly establish themselves within the swampy &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; under their new alliance. Several members of the clan, including himself, assisted in the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the clan was assaulted by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;. An avatar of &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; himself attempted to defeat Kargath but failed. Kargath was confronted once again in &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, where he returned to gladiatorial combat of his own will, holding some authority over the ogres that once enslaved him. It was here where Kargath met his death, where he was once imprisoned.\nIt is assumed they are recovering with the rest of Draenor after &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s fall.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn time, the Shattered Hand clan joined with the other under the command of . As the Mag'har and [[Lightbound]] [[war between the Lightbound and the Mag'har|clashed]], events on [[Azeroth]] would see to a [[Fourth War|new war]] between the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]]. In the midst of this, [[Eitrigg]] sought to travel to the and call upon the debt the Mag'har owed to the Horde for liberating them from [[Garrosh Hellscream]]'s meddling and the [[Burning Legion]]'s corruption.\nAs the entire Lightbound army was marching towards the Mag'har, Grommash ordered for the Mag'har to follow Geya'rah and fallback to Azeroth. Thus, when Warchief Hellscream and charged at the Lightbound, Eitrigg activated the shard of the [[Vision of Time]] in his possession in order to return to Azeroth with his new allies. After their arrival on Azeroth, Overlord Geya'rah took her place as leader of the Mag'har and pledged the loyalty of her people to [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner]] and the [[Horde]].\nSpeculation.\nThe Shattered Hand orcs all have a very pale, almost white skin tone:\nReferences.\n[[Category:Shattered Hand clan| ]]\n[[Category:Alternate universe organizations]]"}

Their operations are centered around the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, where the Sunwell is located. The Offensive is the culmination of a plea for unity between the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to prevent Kil'jaeden's summoning.\nThe Offensive's main base is located on Quel'Danas in an area called &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, on the island's northwestern corner. The first efforts of the Offensive are to retake Sun's Reach - first the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Sanctum\"&gt;arcane sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Armory\"&gt;armory&lt;/a&gt;, then finally the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; - from the &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade%20%28army%29\"&gt;Dawnblade blood elves&lt;/a&gt; loyal to Kael'thas, as well as the demonic forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; who have come at the evil Prince's call. Members of the Offensive will also be called upon to enter the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt; and do battle with the elite of Kael'thas' forces, eventually facing the lord of the blood elves himself in a final showdown.\nHistory.\nBattle for Sun's Reach.\nWhen the first adventurers reached the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the Shattered Sun Offensive's base of operations at &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt; only consisted of elven ships and a small camp, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Staging%20Area\"&gt;Shattered Sun Staging Area&lt;/a&gt;. As the heroes completed their daily missions, the Shattered Sun Offensive progressively took over buildings on the island, unlocking more resources and missions.\nThe first building to be reclaimed was the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Sanctum\"&gt;Sun's Reach Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, and upon retaking it, their next step was to recover the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Armory\"&gt;Sun's Reach Armory&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Nasuun\"&gt;Exarch Nasuun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; created a portal to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and asked the adventurers to help him complete it. Once the portal was activated, Exarch Nasuun regularly asked the heroes to find mana cell in order to maintain the portal, while &lt;a href=\"Astromancer%20Darnarian\"&gt;Astromancer Darnarian&lt;/a&gt; sent them to test the island's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Harbor\"&gt;Sun's Reach Harbor&lt;/a&gt; was the third and final location to be reclaimed, along with the \"&lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%27s%20Pride\"&gt;Silvermoon's Pride&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Shattered Sun Offensive later began to accept donations of gold to construct a statue in &lt;a href=\"Monument%20to%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;honor of the fallen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssault on the Sunwell.\nFollowing the demise of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of the Shattered Sun Offensive and the blue dragon, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, the Offensive's troops procured a foothold in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; itself. However, an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20guardian\"&gt;Arcane guardian&lt;/a&gt; twisted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; blockaded their advance, and threw them back to the entrance. Heroes were tasked with fighting their way through the blood elves' sacred fount of power, and the Shattered Sun captain &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Selana\"&gt;Selana&lt;/a&gt; debriefed new troops on the situation.\nThe Shattered Sun troops entered the Sunwell's room shortly prior to &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;'s own arrival, and were present to witness its rebirth from the heart of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nThough their work was done, it appeared that the Offensive had not been \"entirely\" relieved from duty. With the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; back under complete control, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; fortified the defenses of their sacred &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, while the remnants of the Shattered Sun still hold a small presence around &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Village\"&gt;Dawnstar Village&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding areas, a few members of the Shattered Sun Offensive could be seen assisting the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Builder\"&gt;blood elven builders&lt;/a&gt; in reconstructing the area.\nDragonflight.\nYears later, following the rediscovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dranarus\"&gt;Dranarus&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; for a matter of great importance, and could be seen with a tabard of the Shattered Sun Offensive.\nReputation.\nThe Shattered Sun Offensive is a new faction that was added in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4.0\"&gt;patch 2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, with the opening of the Isle of Quel'Danas and its instances. In addition to the NPCs on Quel'Danas, several new quest givers were added in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, and the majority of the NPCs around the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; are now marked as members of the Offensive, with blood elves mingling with the draenei (prior to 2.4, all of the NPCs around the Terrace were draenei affiliated with the Aldor).\nFaction description: \"Shattrath City's final push against Prince Kael'thas' operations in the Sunwell.\"\nReputation through \"Exalted\" with the Shattered Sun Offensive can be gained via doing specific quests as well as by running the 5-man dungeon &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nAdditionally, after players retake the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Armory\"&gt;Sun's Reach Armory&lt;/a&gt;, several other vendors spawn, including , the vendor. Once players retake &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Harbor\"&gt;Sun's Reach Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and activate the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28object%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt;, begins selling her &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; wares.\nQuests.\nThe Shattered Sun Offensive storyline is unique in WoW as far as gameplay is concerned, as most quests are added or removed based on the completion of server-wide objectives like retaking locations on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; or activating the Portal to the Isle from Shattrath, and not based on reputation.\nMost quests take place solely on the Isle, but a few involve activities elsewhere in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Quests not taking place on the Isle are marked with their zone information below. Once the final phase is reached, there are Shattered Sun Offensive quests taking place in every zone of Outland excluding &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nSun's Reach daily quests.\nQuests are first introduced in the phase designated by their column and either last until the beginning of the phase introducing their replacements if marked by a dagger (\u2020), or are permanently added to the game. The dagger notation is kept throughout the wiki for all links pointing to the removed quests.\nOnly the quests in the rows designating an objective count towards completing that objective. So, only the quests &lt;a href=\"Intercept%20the%20Reinforcements\"&gt;Intercept the Reinforcements&lt;/a&gt; (IR) and &lt;a href=\"Taking%20the%20Harbor\"&gt;Taking the Harbor&lt;/a&gt; (TH), as part of the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Harbor\"&gt;Sun's Reach Harbor&lt;/a&gt; objective, will advance the realm towards Phase 4.\nAlternate rows under the \"Portal\", \"Anvil\" and \"Monument\" headers are introduced at the same time as their parent phases (Phases 2, 3 and 4, respectively), but track completion separately from the parent phases. Realms on average will complete the alternate (Phase \"n\"B) phases before advancing to the next major phase.\nNearly all of the quests in this table are both &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s, and available at all reputations starting from with the Offensive. The exceptions are &lt;a href=\"Your%20Continued%20Support\"&gt;Your Continued Support&lt;/a&gt; (YCS), which is a daily quest available until players reach reputation with the Offensive, and &lt;a href=\"A%20Magnanimous%20Benefactor\"&gt;A Magnanimous Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; (AMB), which is a one-time only quest, available starting in Phase 4, but requires exalted reputation with the SSO to be eligible. These two quests also have a \"negative\" amount listed in the \u0394Gold column, indicating their status as donation quests.\nDue to the rather large amount of information in this table, all of the quest names and rewards have been abbreviated to limit the visible size of the table. Simply hover over the link to bring up a tooltip with the full name of the quest and reward information if javascript is enabled. Additionally, the column headers for the phases link to their relevant sections in the &lt;a href=\"%23Reclaiming%20Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Reclaiming Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt; section of the article.\nPlayers performing these daily quests after the Wrath of the Lich King expansion will now see a lower gold return in exchange for experience granted for completing the quests while still under the level cap. The total for all 19 quests (including &lt;a href=\"Your%20Continued%20Support\"&gt;YCS&lt;/a&gt; but not &lt;a href=\"A%20Magnanimous%20Benefactor\"&gt;AMB&lt;/a&gt;) will grant 208800 experience, , and 4450 reputation."}

For thousands of years, its waterfall beat against the ground, carving the bowl of the vale. The waterfall flows into a large pool whose shoreline is doted with Shatterspear huts and smaller fishing tents.\nHistory.\nThe Shatterspear tribe split off from the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. After settling in the vale, they struck a bargain with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of the region - the trolls would live in peace, but they would not leave Shatterspear Vale. If they were under attack, the night elves wouldn't come to their aid. The Shatterspears agreed and counted themselves lucky.\nThe Shatterspear trolls are friendly to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and were originally neutral to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; until the escalation of hostilities following &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s takeover as the new Warchief of the Horde. These once peaceful villagers of Shatterspear Vale have since then come under siege by the forces of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of Darkshore, after they joined the Horde by invitation of the new warchief who sent a battalion of Horde enforcers helping the trolls to construct several fortifications in the nearby area outside the vale, including the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20War%20Camp\"&gt;Shatterspear War Camp&lt;/a&gt;, all in preparation for an assault on &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;. The ground around the Vale is covered with numerous troll corpses, as &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel%20Sentinel\"&gt;Lor'danel Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s combat the Shatterspear trolls from both the air (Sentinels mounted on &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s) and the ground with their &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; allies wreaking havoc on the ground. Ultimately, the elves killed the troll chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Jor%27kil%20the%20Soulripper\"&gt;Jor'kil the Soulripper&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remnants who escaped retribution went their separate ways, abandoning Darkshore. Some of these refugees found shelter within the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, while others joined various organizations. After the trolls left, a large family of &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es made their home here. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and his Horde army arrived here through &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;'s mountain. While the Horde offered them protection, in time most trolls returned to Shatterspear Vale to reform their broken tribe.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, conflicts between the Alliance and Horde continued in northern &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; posed a threat to Shatterspear Vale. &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; was encountered here by Horde champions. It also served as a roost for night elf &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s. When the Horde invaded the base, they encountered &lt;a href=\"Leora\"&gt;Leora&lt;/a&gt; there.\nFighting continued here between the elves and trolls in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, the village having been reclaimed by the trolls under their new chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Ohseso%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Ohseso\u200e&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the vale was visited by &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nShatterspear trolls are to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The village can be seen from the &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; when flying to or from &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. The settlement is in the mountains between &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Moonglade, &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, and is practically unreachable by normal means of travelling. It is situated in Darkshore geographically.\nThe levels of the trolls vary between 52 to 58, they can be engaged by the Alliance (but not the Horde), and give experience and loot when killed. Some trolls also dance and seem to be celebrating some kind of festivity. Aside from the main populace, there are four notable characters, including &lt;a href=\"Una%20Ji%27ro\"&gt;Una Ji'ro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jory%20Zaga\"&gt;Jory Zaga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krah%27ranik\"&gt;Krah'ranik&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Voriya\"&gt;Voriya&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; head can be seen hanging by a rope stake on their dancefloor.\nBeside a handful amount of troll huts, there is a cave with uninteractable tablets within. A waterfall falls into the main feature of the village \u2014 the gray-blue lake. The village is divided into two parts, separated by the small river one can cross using the bridge.\nShatterspear Vale became an accessible subzone of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", connected to the rest of the zone by the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Pass\"&gt;Shatterspear Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves are now fighting the Shatterspear trolls and the Vale serves now as a quest hub in connection to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Mathystra\"&gt;Ruins of Mathystra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; via a &lt;a href=\"Nightsaber%20Rider\"&gt;Nightsaber Rider&lt;/a&gt;. The Vale is reached by foot from the Ruins of Mathystra through a fortified passage that leads up to a tunnel at the end section of the Shatterspear Pass."}

They lived in prosperity until the tribe's decimation by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as a result of their recent allegiance with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, though later returned during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Shatterspear tribe split off from the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. The various tribes claimed territories in the vast jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; but quickly began fighting one another.\nThe Shatterspear tribe eventually settled at the northeast edge of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Highly reclusive and apparently uninterested in claiming further territory, the Shatterspear trolls established a small village in &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost entirely surrounded by jagged hills. The trolls' purpose in living in the vale is unknown at this point in time. It is a strange location for any troll to choose to live: surrounded by mountains and, beyond that, night elves (the trolls' ancient enemies). The Shatterspear trolls settled here because they chose peace instead of war.\nThe night elves knew that the Shatterspear lived in their territory, but as long as the trolls were not hostile, they were apparently quite content to leave them and Shatterspear Vale in peace. They also struck a bargain - the trolls would live in peace, but they would not leave Shatterspear Vale. If they were under attack, the night elves wouldn't come to their aid. The Shatterspears agreed and counted themselves lucky.\nVisiting the secluded village used to be a difficult endeavor, and a number of adventurers fell to their deaths in attempts to scale the steep hills around the Shatterspears' home. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Shatterspear village became accessible through a tunnel, &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Pass\"&gt;Shatterspear Pass&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Mathystra\"&gt;Ruins of Mathystra&lt;/a&gt;, built by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; recruited the Shatterspear tribe into the Horde. The Horde planned for the Shatterspear tribe to attack the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; from the north, while the armies of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; would push from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The Shatterspear tribe established the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20War%20Camp\"&gt;Shatterspear War Camp&lt;/a&gt; near the Ruins of Mathystra, invaded the ruins with laborers, and destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;Tower of Althalaxx&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain a foothold in the attack against the night elves.\nThe tribe came into conflict with the night elven forces, with the fight eventually coming to Shatterspear Vale itself. The night elves were intent in destroying all the Shatterspear trolls before they could become a bigger problem. &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Sandrya%20Moonfall\"&gt;Huntress Sandrya Moonfall&lt;/a&gt; led her &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; there, and she asked Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to aid her in kill their &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jor%27kil%20the%20Soulripper\"&gt;Jor'kil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe death of their chieftain was nearly the final chapter in Shatterspear tribal history. As their former leader fell to the might of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes, the remaining trolls disbanded the tribe, and its remnants who escaped retribution went their separate ways, abandoning Darkshore. Some of these refugees found shelter within the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, while others joined various organizations. While the Horde offered them protection, in time most returned to Shatterspear Vale to reform their broken tribe.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nSurvivors of the Shatterspear who joined the Horde were used during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, notably in the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;, because of their knowledge of the land. The Shatterspear War Camp was also used as forward outposts for the Horde.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Speaker\"&gt;Shatterspear emissaries&lt;/a&gt; can also be found on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Speakers\"&gt;Terrace of the Speakers&lt;/a&gt;. As with the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt;, these are the only Speakers friendly to Horde players.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, the Shatterspear have reclaimed some of their territories. They have a strong presence in both the Shatterspear Pass and the Shatterspear War Camp, though no longer in the Ruins of Mathystra. They are, once again, being attacked from the air by the Alliance in the vale.\nIn the end, the Alliance won the Battle for Darkshore, and the tribe continues to live in Shatterspear Vale under their new chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Ohseso\"&gt;Ohseso&lt;/a&gt;, who continues to rebuild in hopes that the tribe can ever answer the Horde's call. Even after the battles for Darkshore, the Shatterspears still chose harmony over bloodshed. They try to honor their bargains with both the night elves and the Horde. At some point after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, they were visited by &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;. They learned that what they need is simply medicine for bad days and bringing back letters to Orgrimmar, with well wishes for the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Darkspears, they put their home and people above all else.\nNPCs.\nPre-Cataclysm.\nThe named denizens of &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt;, pre-Cataclysm."}

He is a gigantic armor-plated &lt;a href=\"Voidlord\"&gt;Voidlord&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"This infamous &lt;a href=\"Voidlord\"&gt;Void Lord&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the Duke of Chaos, the Eater of Nations, and Worldslayer. Pandemonius was one of the commanders serving under &lt;a href=\"Dimensius\"&gt;Dimensius&lt;/a&gt; when the ethereal homeworld of &lt;a href=\"K%27aresh\"&gt;K'aresh&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed. He was later bound by Nexus-Prince Shaffar and forced to continue sating his unending hunger in service to the ethereals.\"\nStrategy.\nClear the first room before engaging. Any Ethereals left alive will aggro along with Pandemonius.\nThe person holding aggro may use any combination of anchoring and kiting. When anchoring, tank in the center of the room. Put your back to the big hunk of stone in the middle, as the boss does a knockback. It is also advisable to have your healer secure himself behind a wall or object so he doesn't get knocked so far back that he can't reach the tank in time to heal.\nPandemonius has near the average running speed. By &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt; him, especially after knockback, you waste his melee damage. Kiting will also buy valuable seconds after the tank dies.\nHe will shoot a volley of shadow bolts (&lt;a href=\"Void%20Blast\"&gt;Void Blast&lt;/a&gt;) out toward the party. Frost mages can &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; out of this. 63+ Warriors with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; equipped and sufficient rage can use &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt; to reflect this damage back to him. He will rear back a bit and expand his arms right before he volleys. This attack occurs with knockback and he seems to \"follow up\" with additional shadow bolts if you receive the knockback. Having everyone stand with their backs to a wall to avoid knockback seems to seriously reduce the damage taken from Void Blast.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Shell\"&gt;Dark Shell&lt;/a&gt; interferes with DPS by reflecting spells and damaging melee. Anyone that is surprised by it stands to prolong the fight with their death, or doom everyone by wasting healer mana. By enabling the \"Show Enemy Cast Bar\" option of Interface Settings, every player has an improved chance to see the Shell coming.\nNote: Pandemonius's attacks are not blockable (2.1), do not use Shield block or Holy shield, work with non-blocking aggro generation (e.g. Exorcism as a Paladin).\nHeroic.\nHe does not gain any new abilities on Heroic difficulty, but his melee now inflicts ~3500-5000 shadow damage, and the damage shield will reflect ~1500-1700 per swing against melee attackers. Each of the 5 Void Bolts can hit for 5000 Shadow damage.\nAs a tank make sure you build as much threat as you possible at the start, as you will not be able to build threat during Darkshell, while the healer will continue to gain threat through healing.\nThis is an EXTREMELY mana-intensive fight that demands high DPS, fast heals, and as much resistance and stamina as you can spare. The tank is recommended to have 200 or more SR. If you are still having trouble after many attempts, start an off-healer as DPS and have them switch to healing as the main-healer runs out of mana. The MH can then melee or use a wand as mana returns.\nAvoid using effects on the tank that will reflect damage to the boss during Dark Shell, such as &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Retribution%20Aura\"&gt;Retribution Aura&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile tanking make sure you stop your auto-attacks right away on Dark Shell, Paladins be aware that Reckoning can result in some hefty burst if you are not reacting fast enough.\nSince Dark Shell is often used shortly after the knockback, a working strategy is to kite Pandemonius after naturally gaining some distance from said knockback. Accomplish this by tanking with your back to the middle of the room, and after you have been knocked back, keep running until you reach the opposite wall of the room. Make sure the Healer and DPS are positioned at the same angle as Tank to circumvent range issues associated with the knockback. Druid tanks can use this time to Shapeshift and Innervate the healer.\nAs of 2.1 his damage has been nerfed considerably. It can still be a strain on the healer if he is alone though, so make sure no one gets unnecessary damage from the shield.\nuseful note on SR : since there's no physical damage, the tank can build a cheap resist set from misc armor types, down to and including cloth. At this point he will probably look quite comical, which may provide added entertainment value. Alternately, try to find a decent robe, as this will preserve some modicum of dignity and maybe even provide neat screenshots."}

The barrels will always have a &lt;a href=\"Wyrmtongue%20Extractor\"&gt;Wyrmtongue Extractor&lt;/a&gt; nearby.

Head outside instead and follow the short bridge curving down to the ground floor's entrance.\nStage 3: Maniacal Laughter....\nIf you time it right, you can get by &lt;a href=\"Il%27ruxx\"&gt;Il'ruxx&lt;/a&gt; without having to fight the &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestroy the door and then make your way through a couple mobs to reach the door leading to the outside.\nStage 5: Demon Overload.\nDon't bother with engaging the mobs, just look for the portals and close them.\nFinal Stage: Brewmasters Attack!\nWhile his Wall of Doom and Mind Wrack are irritating, it's Varagol's Blood Wake ability that really hurts. When he uses Blood Wake, be careful to kite the AoE until it dissipates.\nSpeak to Almai.\nUpon returning to the temple, it's clear that something has already happened."}

Some classes are more 'blessed' with these buttons than others but it is usually evened out by their surviving/damaging skills.\nPanic buttons are nearly always &lt;a href=\"instant\"&gt;instant&lt;/a&gt; spells with a certain &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, to make them available for use at all times, but not limitlessly. These abilities are usually neither &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; methods nor &lt;a href=\"Snare\"&gt;Snare&lt;/a&gt;s, though the Druid's &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Grasp\"&gt;Nature's Grasp&lt;/a&gt; is useful as a Crowd Control method and some of the other abilities have other offensive uses.\n\"Save the day\" Buttons.\nUsually used to prevent the death of every person in your party/raid and having to restart all over again.\nFor more information, see &lt;a href=\"Wipe\"&gt;Wipe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen and how.\nMost buttons have a pretty short cooldown, enabling it for use every one or two battles if/when needed. However, some have the potential to be used to save a lot more than you'd think so think twice before using these for &lt;a href=\"PVP\"&gt;PVP&lt;/a&gt; situations."}

They created the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, various races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and empowered the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;titanic keepers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entire Pantheon was defeated in a battle with their former brethren &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; who obliterated their physical forms. However, &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; cast a spell to protect their spirits and sent them hurtling towards Azeroth, where they tried to merge with the keepers. This failed as the keepers' bodies were unable to handle the titans' souls' entire might. Their spirits faded and all that remained was a flash of memories and feelings that the keepers could not comprehend.\nThe keepers tried to reach out to the Pantheon but received no answer in return. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Keeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; concluded that the Makers had died, and he fell into a deep state of depression. He left all civilization behind and retreated into the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, abandoning his kin and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; followers.\nAs the armies of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; launched their united assault on the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s capital world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth's Speaker, discovered that the ruined planet hosted a &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; within its core. The titan &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; was being tortured and twisted by Sargeras' servants and used to fuel the Legion's infinite army.\nThere, it was also discovered that at some point, the Legion had acquired the diminished forms of the Pantheon's spirits and had brought them to &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, where they were being tortured and brainwashed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;The Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; in order to corrupt them into a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Pantheon\"&gt;Dark Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. It was already too late for the noble &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; whose tortured spirit had been infused into an avatar to serve his dark master. After millennia spent hiding in isolation, &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt;'s essence too was recently discovered on the world of &lt;a href=\"Elunaria\"&gt;Elunaria&lt;/a&gt; by the Legion who sent the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Paraxis\"&gt;Paraxis&lt;/a&gt;\" to capture her.\nEventually, Eonar and Aggramar were restored and reunited along with the other members of the Pantheon, and with the help of Azeroth's champions, they eventually severed &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;'s connection with the Legion, and after his defeat, they combined their powers with the last remnant of Argus to imprison &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, ending the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBirth of the Pantheon.\nThough no one knows when or why the first titan awoke, legends say that his name was &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;. He was alone, but he knew that others like himself must exist, and so he set out to explore the myriad worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; in search of other titans. In time, he found and nurtured other &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s, rousing them from their slumber and thus causing them to join his noble cause. Eventually, Aman'Thul and his younger siblings formed the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. They came to realize that order was crucial to find others of their kind and developed &lt;a href=\"World-soul%23Ordering%20process\"&gt;certain techniques&lt;/a&gt; to determine whether or not the worlds they encountered contained nascent world-souls.\nOver the ages, the titans discovered fewer and fewer world-souls during their travels, but they were not disheartened, because they knew that they had still only explored but a small corner of the immeasurably vast universe.\nSargeras' betrayal.\nSoon, the Pantheon learned of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s: chaotic and destructive beings who occasionally clawed their way into the physical universe from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to terrorize any mortal civilizations they came across. Fearing that these beings would disturb the Pantheon's quest, the titans dispatched their greatest warrior, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, to cleanse the universe of all demonic influence. Later, this noble champion of the Pantheon was joined by the young and inexperienced &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Sargeras and Aggramar eventually decided to split up in order to combat their foe more effectively, and it was during this time that Sargeras discovered the plans of the malicious beings known as the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s. Coming across a planet almost completely infected by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras learned that the void lords had sent the Old Gods out into the cosmos to infect any worlds that housed world-souls, and if they succeeded, the world-soul would be twisted into an unspeakably dark creature that not even the Pantheon could stand against. Enraged at this discovery, Sargeras cleaved the planet in two, instantly killing the nascent titan it housed.\nSargeras immediately returned to the rest of the Pantheon to tell of his discovery, but they chastised him for his rash action, insisting that they might have been able to purge the world-soul of its corruption without killing it. Sargeras tried to convince the other titans that what he had done was right and that the universe needed to be purged of life in order to prevent the risk of a world-soul becoming corrupted and opening the way for the void lords. Realizing that the others would never see things the way he did, Sargeras stormed off, vowing to cleanse the universe on his own.\nThe ordering of Azeroth.\nAfter Sargeras' departure, Aggramar continued the hunt for demons in his stead. One day, he sensed the tranquil dreams of a slumbering world-soul from a distant corner of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;. As they traveled towards the source of the emanations, he discovered the world that would later become known as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Within its core was a nascent titan far more powerful than any others the Pantheon had yet encountered, but the world had already been seized by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. The nascent titan's spirit remained uncorrupted, but, knowing it was only a matter of time before it succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, Aggramar swiftly returned to the Pantheon and relayed his discovery, arguing that this was proof of Sargeras' claims and that the Pantheon had to take action before Azeroth was lost. &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; agreed, and convinced the rest of the Pantheon to save the maturing world-soul from the Old Gods.\nAnd so, it was decided that the Pantheon would travel to Azeroth and purge it of the malicious &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; which had claimed it. However, due to the titans' colossal forms and the risk of irrevocably damaging or killing the world-soul, Aggramar decreed that rather than take action directly, the Pantheon would create servants to do battle in their place. Under the guidance of the forger &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, the titans shaped mighty &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; servants of stone and metal to meet the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;i forces of the Old Gods head-on.\nThough the spawn of the Old Gods, as well as and their &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; servants, were powerful beyond mortal comprehension, their combined forces could not stop the armies of the mighty titans. One by one, the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20lord\"&gt;elemental lord&lt;/a&gt;s fell, and their forces dispersed. However it was discovered that the Old Gods had managed to \"infect\" the planet so early in its development cycle that they were irreversibly linked with it. Since they could not destroy the Old Gods, the titans decided to chain the evil gods far beneath the surface of the world. Without the Old Gods' power to keep their raging spirits bound to the physical world, the elementals were banished to an &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;abyssal plane&lt;/a&gt;, where they would contend with one another for all eternity. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony. The titans saw that the threat was contained and set to work.\nAt some point, the pantheon experimented with means to solve the problem posed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. They used &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; to experiment upon their unending, ravenous need to corrupt, however, they unexpectedly created a perfect avatar of that desire. &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; is the result of years of experiments where the titans couldn't figure out how to cure this Old God disease, and it had to be &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20seal\"&gt;sealed&lt;/a&gt; in Uldir.\nThe titans empowered a number of races to help them fashion the world. To help them carve out the fathomless caverns beneath the earth, the titans created the dwarf-like &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; from magical, living stone. To help guard and protect the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the titans created the stone &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; to guard and protect the Vale and the surrounding region. To help them dredge out the seas and lift the land from the seafloor, the titans created the immense but gentle &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s. For many ages, the titans moved and shaped the earth until at last there remained one perfect continent. At the continent's center, the titans crafted a lake of scintillating energies. The lake, which they named the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, was to be the fount of life for the world. Its potent energies would nurture the bones of the world and empower life to take root in the land's rich soil. Over time, plants, trees, monsters, and creatures of every kind began to thrive on the primordial continent. As twilight fell on the final day of their labors, the titans named the continent &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;: \"land of eternal starlight\".\nSatisfied that the small world had been ordered and that their work was done, the titans prepared to leave Azeroth. However, before they departed, they charged the greatest species of the world, the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, with the task of watching over Kalimdor, lest any force should threaten its perfect tranquility. There were many dragonflights in that age, yet there were five flights that held dominion over their brethren. It was these five flights that the titans chose to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the Pantheon imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. These majestic dragons became known as the Great Aspects, or the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. Thus empowered, the Five Aspects were charged with the world's defense in the titans' absence. With the dragons prepared to safeguard their creation, the titans left Azeroth behind. In the Pantheon's absence, the various titan-forged continued to shape and order the surface of the world.\nThe Burning Crusade and the fall of the Pantheon.\nMeanwhile, in the distant reaches of the Great Dark, Sargeras, having now broken his ties to the other titans, meditated on the fate of the universe. As doubt and despair twisted his thoughts, he reached the conclusion that to spare the universe from the clutches of the void lords, it had to be destroyed. To accomplish this, he would need an army \u2014 thus, the traitorous titan returned to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic prison world of &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, where he had imprisoned his defeated demonic foes, and shattered it to unleash the demons upon the universe once more. In the process of doing so, the former champion was twisted into a &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted, hateful being. Sargeras united the chaotic creatures under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and so began the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to purge all of creation. After a devastating confrontation between Sargeras and his former student &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, the Pantheon began preparing for war. The Pantheon and the Legion met near a world known as &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; pleaded with Sargeras to end this madness, telling him of the fledgling world-soul Azeroth, a being that would one day be able to stand against the void lords. Sargeras was unmoved. Aggramar, thinking that his former friend could still be reasoned with, approached Sargeras unarmed, but in response the fel-corrupted titan killed Aggramar with a single blow. Outraged, the Pantheon attacked, but even the combined might of the titans could not stand against the dark titan's fel might. Before long, the titans were all dead. Sargeras declared the Legion victorious and set off to find Azeroth, not knowing that &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; had weaved a protective shroud around the titans' spirits during his final moments. The now disembodied souls of the Pantheon then hurled out through the cosmos.\nEventually, the spirits reached Azeroth, slamming into the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s that the Pantheon had assigned to watch over Azeroth. For a brief moment, each of the keepers was overwhelmed by an influx of fragmented memories. Puzzled by this, they called out to the Pantheon for answers, but never received a reply. &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; was the only one who realized that the influx of titan power felt by the keepers was the very last remnant of the Pantheon. He extracted what remained of the soul of &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, storing it in a vault near the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. Overcome with despair, Ra then retreated into the catacombs beneath the land to meditate on what he had learned. Centuries later, Ra showed Aman'Thul's spirit to the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; warlord &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; to explain his silence and how the world was beyond saving, but instead of reacting in the same way that Ra did, Lei Shen claimed the power of both the keeper and the remaining fragments of Aman'Thul. Lei Shen would then use this power to establish the first &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nThe titans left many &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; behind, including the &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;keepers&lt;/a&gt;, to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Before leaving, they gifted the latter with the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later, they empowered &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; from afar and through the keepers.\nThe titans are now a subject of significant interest on Azeroth, at least for the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 especially the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Their part in Azeroth's history lies far, far back in time, although &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; has an active role in recent conflicts through the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe denizens of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; know very little about the titans save for scraps the dwarves have unearthed and some vague &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; folklore. Simple humans believe that the world was shaped by the titans themselves. Legend holds that the great ones shaped the land when the world was young, then left the world to its own devices. The ruins and buried cities that remain on Azeroth \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; Desert, &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, ancient libraries in &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; beneath the dwarven home of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 are known to a few to actually be \"titanic\" ruins.\nDuring the World of Warcraft Q&amp;A panel at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; 2013, it was officially confirmed that &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was visited by the titans, however, their involvement was far less extensive than it was on Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s believe that they and Draenor were created by \"the &lt;a href=\"Forgers\"&gt;Forgers&lt;/a&gt;\", but it's not clear if this refers to the titans or something else.\nThrough the storyline of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, it was discovered that Azeroth had a failsafe, a signal triggered by the death of the Prime Designate, is used to alert &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt; as the first warning sign of systemic planetary failure. Algalon then translocates to Ulduar and runs planetary diagnostics of its vital systems to analyze the world for corruption, such as in its life-support systems and defense mechanisms. If sufficient corruption is found, Algalon will send a signal to the titanic facility in Uldum and request planetary re-origination.\nThe re-origination device the keepers built into the world triggered a huge pulse, breaking down the planet \u2014 and all life on it \u2014 into base elements of rock, metal, and gases. The machine then uses these elements to reconstitute the world into its original planetary blueprint, starting over from scratch.\nAs the titans are considered to be benevolent, shaping worlds and encouraging life to flourish, it may seem odd that they are willing to effectively destroy a world full of sapient beings in order to start over. However, they appear to do this in thinking along the lines of 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few': they consider the re-origination of a corrupted world to be in the best interests of the universe at large.\nLegion.\nThough the titans of the Pantheon were thought to be dead, their spirits had endured. Sargeras deemed them a great source of power, captured them, and sought to manipulate and corrupt these titan souls. It is still unexplained how Sargeras found the soul fragments but for existing theories see &lt;a href=\"%23Speculation\"&gt;#Speculation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were tortured by the &lt;a href=\"Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; within the core of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, except for &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; who had managed to stay hidden on &lt;a href=\"Elunaria\"&gt;Elunaria&lt;/a&gt; until recently. Aggramar was the first to break and fall to Sargeras's will. His corrupted soul was infused into an &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; but was defeated and purified by the champions of Azeroth.\nAfter the Pantheon was freed and successfully restored, they reunited at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, where they attempted to sever &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;'s connection with the Legion at their center of power, but was interrupted by Sargeras, who challenged them to fight Argus. After Argus was finally defeated through their combined efforts (with &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; reviving the champions during the encounter and &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; dissipating his form with a massive temporal blast), Sargeras struck out at Azeroth and wounded her heavily in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. The Pantheon then concentrated their powers with the last of Argus's power to imprison Sargeras within the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, crippling the Legion and decisively ending his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who stayed behind while his companions left, now serves as Sargeras's jailer. In the aftermath, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; says that Azeroth is the only titan left.\nOther names and titles.\nThe Pantheon have been called by different names by various groups and races, including:\nDark Pantheon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; managed to find and capture what was left of the Pantheon's diminished souls, except for &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt;'s who was still eluding the Legion. Imprisoned within &lt;a href=\"Antorus\"&gt;Antorus&lt;/a&gt;, the titans' souls were being tortured and brainwashed into &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' service by the &lt;a href=\"Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt;. The first to succumb and join his Dark Pantheon was the once-mighty Aggramar, whose essence was infused into an avatar, making him a \"titan of destruction\". The heroes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; together managed to defeat the shivarra priestesses and free the titans' spirits. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; remained behind while the armies moved on to defeat the corrupted Aggramar so that he could offer the titan souls a little bit of comfort. The freed Pantheon then brought the world-soul of &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to their place of power, the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, where they pooled their power together and defeated Sargeras. In the end, Sargeras did not succeed in creating a Dark Pantheon. Had he managed, no force in the universe could have stopped him.\nSee also: &lt;a href=\"Greatcloak%20of%20the%20Dark%20Pantheon\"&gt;Greatcloak of the Dark Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;"}
