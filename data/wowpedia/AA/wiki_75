Mastery effects are found in the &lt;a href=\"character%20sheet\"&gt;character sheet&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the &lt;a href=\"Spellbook\"&gt;Spellbook&lt;/a&gt; under each specialization tab. Each Mastery offers specific benefits which can vary but generally fall into one of three categories: increasing the effectiveness of specific abilities or types of damage dealt; becoming more effective when certain conditions are met; or providing bonus effects including &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"HoT\"&gt;HoT&lt;/a&gt;s, free attacks, or free spellcasts. All mastery benefits are measured in percentages, whether in terms of a numerical improvement, the size of an effectiveness boost or bonus effect, or a proc chance.\nMastery also refers to the associated secondary stat rating, which increases the strength of the effect. Like other ratings, this can be increased by gear with mastery on it. Each mastery has a base percentage value; the mastery stat increases this percentage by a varying amount depending on spec and level. Therefore even characters with no mastery stat rating will benefit from their Mastery.\nMastery stat rating is unique as its percentage depends \"both\" on the player's level and the specific mastery associated with their spec, with each mastery having a different amount of rating required to increase its effects. For example, a warlock that changes from affliction to demonology will see a decrease in both their base mastery percentage and mastery gained from rating, as it takes more mastery rating to increase than it does for . This can be shown by viewing the effects for inactive specializations in the spellbook. Numerous enhancements such as &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s increase mastery rating. In terms of stat weighting, the importance of mastery depends on the effect it grants the player, as well as the effectiveness of mastery rating on the spec's mastery percentage.\nMasteries.\nBelow is a list of all Masteries, and the classes and specs to which they belong. Listed under 'Base effect' are the base percentage benefits granted to players regardless of their mastery stat. 'Rating per 1%' is the mastery rating required at level 60 to gain an additional 1% effect for that mastery's X value only (the displayed mastery percentage value in the &lt;a href=\"paper%20doll\"&gt;paper doll&lt;/a&gt; frame). At lower levels, smaller amounts of mastery rating are required to gain the same benefit. Both base effects and ratios are often very specific and are sometimes difficult to determine precisely.\nRemoved masteries.\nThe following is a list of masteries that were removed from game. This list does not include the masteries that were previously removed and then re-added (such as ), as these are still the current masteries in game. This list also does not include masteries that were redesigned but not renamed (such as )."}

Shaw, &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; began searching for the king and prince of Stormwind.\nAt some point, he appointed &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Mistress%20Yvonia\"&gt;Scout Mistress Yvonia&lt;/a&gt; to help the night elves in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt; and sent &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Kearnen\"&gt;Agent Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; to scout &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Gearbreaker\"&gt;Helix Gearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; in Westfall.\nHe also helped &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; with the investigation of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20Cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer Cult&lt;/a&gt; in the City.\nMaster Mathias Shaw is later sent to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to head the SI:7 operations there. In &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Pass\"&gt;Dragonmaw Pass&lt;/a&gt;, he can be found coordinating with the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; on raiding &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; caravans. Afterwards, he has an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; lead a &lt;a href=\"Highbank\"&gt;Highbank&lt;/a&gt; squadron to secure the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Gates\"&gt;Dragonmaw Gates&lt;/a&gt;. Later he is found in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Citadel\"&gt;Twilight Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, awaiting reinforcements, but his reinforcements were killed by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the adventurer his only support. Together they kill the Citadel's Twilight Hammer assassins and cultists, assassinate influential Twilight Hammer candidates for ascension, free &lt;a href=\"Lirastrasza\"&gt;Lirastrasza&lt;/a&gt; from capture and aid the red dragon in finishing off &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragon\"&gt;Twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. When the adventurer reports &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20of%20Forgemaster%20Finlay\"&gt;Forgemaster Finlay&lt;/a&gt;'s warning about the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hammer of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; to Shaw, Shaw has his agents investigate. After a while, he briefs the adventurer on the intelligence he received from his dead agents and tells them that the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hammer of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; is located in the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Altar of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, and in a struck of good fortune, Cho'gall is personally overseeing its construction. Shaw, the adventurer, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cassius%20the%20White\"&gt;Cassius the White&lt;/a&gt; lead an assault on the Altar of Twilight to confront Cho'gall, but it is revealed to be a trap. Cho'gall ordered &lt;a href=\"Skullcrusher%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Skullcrusher the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to dispose of his enemies but with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammers&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance was able to defeat the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and force Cho'gall to retreat to the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nJust before the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, SI:7 discovered that there was a trap set by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Before they could warn the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; ambushed the SI:7 agents and captured Shaw before impersonating him. As &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; was a witness to this, Detheroc had her killed before she could warn &lt;a href=\"the%20Uncrowned\"&gt;the Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to work for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and attacks Stormwind, Detheroc as Shaw puts the city under lockdown and tells &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;a Shadow&lt;/a&gt; of the Uncrowned that they are not allowed within the city. Despite this, Garona and the Shadow sneak their way through the city and slay &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;Melris Malagan&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the cult's attack. Afterward, \"Shaw\" says that although the king was never in any danger, their success in stopping the cultist before even Shaw's own men could, would keep them out of prison at the very least. He tells them to leave the city before he changes his mind.\nAfter finding the corpse of Amber Kearnen in the sewers of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the Uncrowned begins looking into SI:7's recent suspicious activities and discovers that \"Shaw\" was the one who ordered Kearnen's death. He hired the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Blade\"&gt;Red Blade&lt;/a&gt; pirates to do it, in exchange for the riches of Stormwind and access to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; deciphered an encrypted letter that Kearnen had held, the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; discovered the man they thought was Mathias Shaw was, in fact, an impostor. &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; decided to find and save the real Shaw in order to expose Detheroc.\nTaoshi and a fellow Shadow of the Uncrowned infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt;, with bombs provided by &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt; serving as cover. They found and located Shaw, returning him to the Hall of Shadows. After being saved, Shaw revealed to the Uncrowned that Detheroc had told lies to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; about the Horde and had manipulated the new king into preparing Stormwind's armies to attack the Horde, thus beginning another conflict between the Alliance and Horde when the world could least afford it. To cover his tracks, Detheroc had put up wanted posters of the members of the Uncrowned all over Stormwind, claiming they had conspired with the Burning Legion and thus turned Stormwind's citizens and guards against them. An adventurer, Taoshi, and Shaw were brought to Stormwind under the cover of night by &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Admiral%20Tethys\"&gt;Fleet Admiral Tethys&lt;/a&gt; and sneaked their way to SI:7 headquarters, where they exposed Detheroc and defeated him. In the aftermath, while Shaw does not join the Uncrowned due to his position as leader of SI:7, he does enter into an alliance with them to assist whenever asked.\nThe Wound.\nMany months later &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the lord of the Legion, was defeated, but not before he managed to heavily wound Azeroth in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; ordered Shaw to investigate the destroyed land and report back. When the new king was giving a speech at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; celebrating the Legion's defeat, Shaw hurried to meet with him and &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; with worrying news: many &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s had been sighted in Silithus mining an &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;unknown substance&lt;/a&gt;. Shaw then sent Alliance adventurers to meet with SI:7 in Silithus.\nHe later appeared on the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyguard\"&gt;Skyguard&lt;/a&gt;\" above the &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Shore\"&gt;Seething Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where he oversaw the fight against the Horde.\nBefore the Storm.\nMathias Shaw briefed King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s advisers about the information garnered about &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; during the conferences King Anduin held about the subject. He also remained neutral when King Anduin proposed the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. He noted that his information about the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; indicated that the idea would be extremely well received by them, but also that they did not represent the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Thorns.\nMathias Shaw oversaw the operation to saturate &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with agents and relayed the information they garnered to King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the other Alliance leaders. His agents reported that there has been a disagreement between &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and High Overlord &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; regarding the deployment of troops. Saurfang was said to have wanted an army deployed to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, while the Blightcaller regarded it as a waste of resources. The Alliance leaders believed that the discord indicated that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had weaponized &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and were planning to secure a monopoly of the mineral in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; had begun to secretly amass a night elf army in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to intercept the Horde forces should they march to Silithus. Shaw later reported a public fistfight between Nathanos and Varok. Nathanos' subsequent reprimanding seemed to confirm the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders' suspicions of the Horde's capability to make Azerite weapons and that &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had endorsed Saurfang's Silithus campaign, which consequently caused the Alliance leaders to deploy the night elven army to deter them.\nIt was later discovered to be a ruse, however, and the Horde had used the opportunity to invade &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt; instead. After discovering the Horde invasion, Shaw redirected bands of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to aid in Ashenvale's defense until Alliance reinforcements arrive.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMathias can be found aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" docked at &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. He was charged with establishing an elite strike force to assist &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; from the shadows as they worked to secure the Alliance's position on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and Kul Tiras.\nShaw later worked with &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, a stolen &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; artifact, from the Zandalari treasury. At first, he didn't get along with Flynn, not appreciating his quips, but seemed to warm up to him by the end of the scenario. Once the real scepter was taken and swapped out with a fake one, they made an escape from &lt;a href=\"Opulence\"&gt;Opulence&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance began a feint attack led by &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt; to bait the Horde out of Zuldazar, while the Alliance prepared to attack &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. They would cover the area in a mist with the Abyssal Scepter, and until it was set up Jaina and Shaw provided support for Telaamon's forces. Afterward the two of them led the Alliance forces to get as much of Nazmir as they could, to make the Horde think it was where their main fleet was.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; escaped from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, Shaw traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Corners\"&gt;Three Corners&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and told the guards there to take the night off, providing them with plenty of alcohol to drink. Once they were drunk, they missed Saurfang passing by. Shaw also provided plenty of gold for more guards to stay at the &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; inn and gave them orders to guard the roads from there to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. However, Saurfang was traveling along the southern roads of Redridge, not the north. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Lyana\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lyana&lt;/a&gt; accused Saurfang of conspiring with the humans, which Shaw's actions seem to support though it is unknown if Saurfang knew about what Shaw did.\nMathias asked Flynn to watch out for any intelligence regarding the &lt;a href=\"Fluctuating%20Worldvein\"&gt;Fluctuating Worldvein&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran warship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nAfter Alliance spies caught wind of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; planning to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin sent &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, Shaw, and an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Alliance champion&lt;/a&gt; to rescue Baine. As Shaw and his allies ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, they unexpectedly encountered &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, who had also come to rescue Baine, and after a brief moment, agreed to work together to save Baine. When things started getting heated between Saurfang and Shaw, Jaina and Thrall were quick to get them focused on the task at hand. Upon nearly reaching Baine, the group was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Rowa%20Bloodstrike\"&gt;Rowa Bloodstrike&lt;/a&gt;, who expressed disappointment but not surprise by Saurfang's and Thrall's decision to rescue Baine. Unwilling to stand down, the group was forced to kill Rowa and moved forward to Baine, who was surprised by their presence. Shaw moved to release Baine from his chains and realized on examining the locks that they were warded against magic, which meant only his lockpicking skills would work. Saurfang remarked that it felt too easy and the group was then attacked by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Hathorel\"&gt;Magister Hathorel&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to kill them and Jaina in particular for vengeance for the &lt;a href=\"purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the group was successful in protecting Shaw long enough to free Baine, and Jaina teleported the group safely out of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. Shaw assisted Baine in getting to his feet while Jaina and Thrall talked privately, and afterward he and Jaina departed via teleport in order to report the mission's success to Anduin.\nShaw then called upon Alliance adventures to meet with him as he declared that the time had come to finish the war. Thus, he revealed that there had been some interesting developments, mainly that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had split between revolutionaries led by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; led by Sylvanas. Shaw then joined other Alliance forces in arriving in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and was prepared to assault Orgrimmar. However, Saurfang, unwilling to see more Horde blood spilled challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with his death and Sylvanas' abandonment of the Horde. He subsequently was among those that attended Saurfang's funeral. Following these events, Mathias returned to the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" to lead 's efforts in hunting Sylvanas and her agents in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; shared with Mathias his concerns about how not only are Sylvanas and her agents still at large but also how the Horde has become united once again. Shaw suggested they watch the Horde closely and inform King Anduin if there is a need for action.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and in the process let N'Zoth free from its prison, the Alliance had to consider how to deal with the new threat looming. Mathias Shaw and his agents of the were ordered by King Anduin to track down the Old God, but their research led nowhere. In order to calm the furious King, the Spymaster announced alongside &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; that his agents were doing everything they can, before announcing the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by an advisor, who is none other than &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Fourth War came to a close, Valeera asked Shaw what was next for him, prompting him to say that there was &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; he'd like to get to know better. Valeera encouraged him to find happiness while he could.\nShadows Rising.\nShaw joined &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in horse riding to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, as the young king dealt with feeling crushed over the knowledge that &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had decided to remain in &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, while leaving all of his missives unread. After hearing explosions, the pair investigated and discovered that &lt;a href=\"Jago\"&gt;Jago&lt;/a&gt; had taken advantage of a farmer's son hospitality near &lt;a href=\"Saldean%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Saldean's Farm&lt;/a&gt; by using the barn to brew moonshine, which had caused the explosion that destroyed building's roof. Upon seeing Anduin, Jago tried to attack the young king, blaming him for not stopping Sylvanas at the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. Jago was intercepted by Mathias and passed out soon after. Shaw and Anduin soon departed for &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter receiving word suggesting that &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; were within &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Shaw was sent to gather further intelligence on the matter. In light of the storm brewing as the \"&lt;a href=\"Bold%20Arva\"&gt;Bold Arva&lt;/a&gt;\" sailed, Flynn directed Shaw below deck, declaring that Shaw didn't have the sea legs for it and that he was too drunk. While below deck, Shaw received messages from &lt;a href=\"Swailes\"&gt;Swailes&lt;/a&gt; from his agents &lt;a href=\"Narsilla%20Keensight\"&gt;Narsilla Keensight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krazzet\"&gt;Krazzet&lt;/a&gt;. When Flynn learned who the messages were from, he declared it very paranoid of Shaw. While acknowledging that they signed an armistice with the Horde, Shaw pointed out that it doesn't mean that they weren't watching them. He then stated his belief that only a fool mistakes peacetime for complacency.\nFlynn then asked what was happening within the Horde, and Shaw revealed that an assassination attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting. While Shaw was pleased to have had eyes on the assassination, Flynn wondered if the storm around Zandalar was caused by Talanji as a way to keep the whole island on lockdown, with nobody going in or out until they found the assassins. Unbeknownst to them, the storm had been created by &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; who was behind the assassination attempt on Talanji, as a means to isolate her.\nAs the mission progressed Shaw found himself bonding with Flynn and greatly sympathized with the other man when he learned that Flynn witnessed his mother's death by hanging for thievery. After landing on Zandalar to avoid the storm, Flynn suggested making their way to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Victory\"&gt;Fort Victory&lt;/a&gt;. However, Shaw revealed that after the armistice with the Horde was signed, they ceded control of those encampments and that any sign of them on Zandalar shall be taken as an act of aggression. In light of this knowledge, Flynn's first order of business was to hide their ship. Though Shaw privately thought it was wiser to stay abroad the ship, he consented to the group going on land, understanding that morale was low and a brief stint on land always did a sailor good.\nAfter disembarking the ship, Shaw spied on a Widow's Bite camp and upon investigating it, he discovered evidence suggesting that the group was in working with the Banshee loyalists. He then ordered Flynn to get the ship ready to sail, while he gathered more evidence only to end up captured by the Zandalari. While a distressed Flynn and the crew made it with all haste to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of getting rescue for Shaw, the spymaster was thrown into a cell within &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen he requested an audience with Queen Talanji, he was ignored as she was focused on combating the Widow's Bite unaware of the information that Shaw held. While in his cell, he noted that the Zandalari really committed to the theme by even having their prisons made of gold. He was also never unsupervised, making escape attempts rather difficult. Thus, he took to trying to speak with the guards only to be generally ignored. During these attempts, he stumbled into a truth that he hadn't meant to bungle into; he desired a partner. As such, he decided that when he got out of prison that he would ask Flynn out and fantasied about the different conversations they could have. In time, he would refer to this as a little vacation.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and Zandalari defeated their enemies, Shaw, to his surprise, was released by the Horde leadership with no strings attached. The only request of him was from &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted him to take the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; and deliver her to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, along with a letter. Upon arriving in Stormwind, Shaw was met with Anduin, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and Flynn, who wrapped him in a tight warm hug, and Mathias returned the gesture. Shaw then revealed that there was something that he wanted to talk about with Flynn and asked him to meet at the &lt;a href=\"Gilded%20Rose\"&gt;Gilded Rose&lt;/a&gt; that night, causing the other man to blush which said all that Shaw needed to know.\nHis personal desires done, Shaw returned to business and delivered Sira to Anduin and Jaina. When Anduin tried some magic to make Sira tell him where Sylvanas was, the fear on Jaina's face shook Shaw to the core.\nTerror by Torchlight.\nAfter they returned from Zandalar, Flynn and Mathias barely interacted with each other until one day when Flynn won a treasure map of &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; in a card game and convinced Shaw to come with him for an adventure and a bit of fun. Near the &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Gardens%20Cemetery\"&gt;Tranquil Gardens Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, the two came across the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; commander &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Sarah Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; suffering from a mysterious rotting illness and brought her back to &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, where she revealed that she had been attacked while investigating a report that the &lt;a href=\"%3ATorch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;:Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an artifact used to keep the undead of Duskwood at bay\u2014had gone missing from where it had been placed on &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Rowe\"&gt;Forlorn Rowe&lt;/a&gt;. During the conversation, more injured Night Watchers arrived and revealed that an army of undead was heading from &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt; to Darkshire.\nFlynn and Mathias set out for Raven Hill on &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;back. Along the way they passed over the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; and agreed that they would head to a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; for their next, more peaceful adventure. Upon reaching Forlorn Rowe, the two rogues quickly discovered the culprit responsible for stealing the torch, a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Terror%20by%20Torchlight%29\"&gt;human necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, and (after Mathias offered some encouraging words to his companion) followed her down into the &lt;a href=\"Dawning%20Wood%20Catacombs\"&gt;Dawning Wood Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; while avoiding detection by her undead minions. In the deepest level of the crypt, they found the necromancer attempting to corrupt the torch within a ritual circle. Mathias revealed himself and began talking with the necromancer to distract her while Flynn used rum from one of his bottles to wash away the bone powder making up the circle. While Mathias attacked the necromancer, Flynn grabbed the torch and realized that it could be cleansed of corruption in a moonwell. The necromancer managed to curse Mathias with the same rotting disease that had afflicted Ladimore, but the two rogues used their blades and the torch to fight their way out of the catacomb and used one of the Night Watch's left-behind gryphons to escape to the Twilight Grove. The necromancer pursued them on her winged undead horse and blasted them off their gryphon as it came down to land in the grove. Although his skin was now covered in sores, Mathias declared he'd keep the necromancer busy while Flynn purified the torch. While Shaw and the necromancer fought, the latter demoralized her opponent by revealing that &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;dark wings&lt;/a&gt; would come to take away what the spymaster held most dear. Moments later, however, Flynn plunged the torch into the moonwell, reigniting it and allowing him to use it to set the necromancer aflame and kill her.\nWith the necromancer's death, the illness affecting Shaw and Ladimore vanished. The Torch of Holy Flame was returned to Forlorn Rowe, and Ladimore commended the two rogues for saving Duskwood, to which Shaw replied that it was mostly thanks to the Night Watch, and that he would send Stormwind guards as reinforcements after the necromancer hinted that the threat was not over. As they didn't get to complete their treasure hunt, Mathias gave Flynn's map to the Night Watch, and the watchers returned with the treasure as a gift to the rogues: a hand mirror. Afterward, Mathias told Flynn that there were many powerful artifacts like the torch scattered across the world and that King Anduin frequently sent him to check up on them. With &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; relatively quiet for the time being, it was time for Shaw to go on an inspection trip\u2014and he wanted Flynn to come with him on the journey. When Flynn asked why, Mathias simply responded \"Because I trust you\". Flynn agreed, and the two kissed.\nExploring Azeroth.\nBy agreement of &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Shaw was granted a temporary leave to travel through the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; in order to write up reports on its people, on its places, to inventory some powerful artifacts and ensure that they are safe, but also to meet contacts of the Spymaster to collect as much information as possible on the situation of the continent. Flynn joined him, claiming to \"prove my worth by assisting the Spymaster and his right Royal Majesty King Anduin.\"\nFor the sake of their mission and relations between the two factions, the duo obtained permission from the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, signed by &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, to pass through Horde territories without being attacked.\nFollowing their mission, Shaw and Flynn managed to find the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20crown\"&gt;lost crown&lt;/a&gt; of the late &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;, buried in a secret memorial behind the Stormwind Lighthouse. The duo believes it was done by Lordaeron refugees who buried it there, so the survivors of Lordaeron would have a place to mourn their king, and that neither Arthas nor anyone can ever find the crown. After verifying and confirming the presence of the crown, they buried it once more and agreed to continue keeping the secret, without telling Anduin anything about it.\nDeath Rising.\nFollowing the abduction of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Shaw called for Alliance champions to meet with him, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, and other allies to discuss the matter. Shaw initially blamed himself for the kidnapping, out of misplaced guilt, before resolving himself to only hold &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; accountable as it was done at her command. Meanwhile, in Anduin's absence the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; supported the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; as the regent and protector of Stormwind, a decision that Shaw misliked as he believed that Genn should be in command but bowed to Greymane when the later said he would respect the decision.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Shaw and Flynn were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; noticed that the Spymaster was undoubtedly keeping an eye on &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. He later chatted with Flynn, &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and Wrathion, emphasizing that his lover was serious when he talked about trying to negotiate with the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s who threatened &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; at the time. This remark made Flynn smile, and he smiled back, much to the astonishment of the Black Prince.\nDragonflight.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Scalecommander Azurathel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, they were received by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; and Mathias Shaw who reminded the black dragon that he has been warned against making unannounced visits, especially when he brings company. After hearing Wrathion's apology and his request to deliver a message from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to Lord Commander &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, the Spymaster agreed to allow the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; to visit the city but warned them that the SI:7 would be watching them closely and that the responsibility of their actions would fall on the Black Prince.\nWith the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and the Alliance answering to the call of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, Shaw was present with &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and Turalyon at the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; was preparing to depart. He then revealed to Genn that &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; had inquired about the missing &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and then further revealed that he had followed countless leads but so far none of the sightings of Anduin had been proven true. Genn then remarked that Anduin won't be found until he wished for it. In response, Shaw pointed out that while Turalyon is popular with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;nobles&lt;/a&gt;, the people of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; missed their king and Genn declared that the best thing that they could do was to give Anduin the time he needed and to be there for him when he came home.\nMeanwhile, Turalyon discussed with Mathias the return of the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Although the Lord Commander had faith in &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s intentions, he expressed distrust of the other dragons, citing the 's report of the damage done to the kingdom by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; years ago. In order to protect the Alliance and their past years' efforts to recreate its strength, he ordered the Spymaster to enlist the expertise of the Stormwind mages to create a foolproof method to see through the \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%23Shapeshifting\"&gt;visage&lt;/a&gt;\" that the dragons wear among mortals. Thus in accordance to Turalyon's wishes, &lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Elling Trias&lt;/a&gt; and SI:7 agents could be found spying upon the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWelcome to SI:7 headquarters, &lt;name&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe Uncrowned must strive to undermine the Burning Legion in all the ways we do it best: artifice, guile, deception, and of course, politics.\nUntil the Legion is defeated, our continued cooperation is my highest priority, &lt;name&gt;.

Kul Tiras has its charms, but these walls will always be home.\nDragonflight.\nOur scouts slip in an out of every town, city and inn both near and far. \nIf anything of value is muttered by friend or foe, we'll know about it.\nIn the RPG.\nMaster Mathias Shaw is a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Assassins\"&gt;Stormwind Assassins&lt;/a&gt;. He is a young man to lead such a powerful organization, but the 33-year-old is not daunted. He has deep brown eyes and is diminutive, very unassuming for a guild leader of &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s. Her grandmother, &lt;a href=\"Pathonia%20Shaw\"&gt;Pathonia&lt;/a&gt;, was his predecessor, and unbeknownst to him, &lt;a href=\"Waltion%20Freemore\"&gt;Waltion Freemore&lt;/a&gt; is his grandfather.\nShaw does not trust the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, knowing they do not fully trust the Assassins.\nBiography.\nMathias' mother was a First Finger assassin who died on the job when he was 4 years old. He grew up at Grandmother Pathonia's knee, as she did not see fit to lie to him about her mother's death or his family's business. She trained him for the job since he was an infant, testing his speed and dexterity on a physical level and making sure he understood the difference between doing what was right and doing what was necessary, and how those two do not always mix. He was the youngest member of the guild when his grandmother made him a Fourth Finger at the age of 10, and he worked his way up slowly, spending much more time in the various levels than most. This worked very well for him, as he knows intimately what is done at every level, and what is needed in new recruits. His first kill was the target his mother had failed to eliminate.\nWhen his grandmother passed control to him on his 30th birthday, choosing to retire instead of die and leave things in disarray for him, he eagerly took the reins. Mathias attempted to make improvements on her designs, but after a couple of months finally had to accept that her design was flawless, and he simply needed to run the already well-oiled machine. The rest of the members are familiar with how Pathonia wished the organization to be run, and they often steer the young Mathias on the correct path.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; found the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; filled with hapless, eager-faced &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; approached Mathias and demanded he did something about it. Mathias assigned the Fourth Finger of the Stormwind Assassins to recruit the best of them.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

When Boros let himself be carried away by his anger and his desire for justice for all the draenei who died at the hands of the Legion, and launched the charge against all demons in lower &lt;a href=\"Faronaar\"&gt;Faronaar&lt;/a&gt;, she tried to stop and warn him about their lack of information on the enemy, but he didn't listen to her.\nDespite Boros' departure, Julia did not give up the reasons for her presence and worked with the Highlord to destroy the Legion Orbs, vital to the Legion's planning and strategy, in order to severely damage their invasion efforts. She thus learned about the existence of Balnazzar's &lt;a href=\"Codex%20of%20Command\"&gt;Codex of Command&lt;/a&gt; under the protection of the demon &lt;a href=\"Jarvox\"&gt;Jarvox&lt;/a&gt; who managed to capture Boros and his paladins. But before she could save him, she accompanied the Highlord to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"imp%20mother\"&gt;imp mother&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Ozram\"&gt;Mother Ozram&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for the creation of &lt;a href=\"imps\"&gt;imps&lt;/a&gt; who keep attacking the defenses of the Silver.\nWith the help of the Highlord, she managed to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"fel%20lord\"&gt;fel lord&lt;/a&gt; Jarvox and reach Boros' prison to free him from the three fel locks that held him captive. She comforted the vindicator being ashamed of having let himself be guided by anger, before leaving the region with the Codex of command in the direction of &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the success of their mission, she claims to have heard for years stories about the deeds of the Highlord, and that after fighting by her side, she knows all the stories were true. She subsequently requested permission to represent the Order as a Champion of the light, assuring that she would fight with justice and bravery, and carry out their orders to the end. A request that was accepted by the Highlord, making her a Champion of the Order of the Silver Hand.\nDuring the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, she was present with the troops of the Silver Hand who came to support the priests of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;. She fought against the hordes of demons summoned by Balnazzar, until &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; came and helped them to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; for good.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWe ride together.\nEvery man and woman in our order would sacrifice themselves for the greater good, but we won't get anywhere without a plan."}

Points were commonly rewarded after killing a boss or after completing a dungeon that was initiated using the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;. One requirement is that all participants of the dungeon must conform to level requirements, or else no reward will be given to any participant.\nJustice Points replaced &lt;a href=\"Emblem%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Emblem of Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emblem%20of%20Triumph\"&gt;Emblem of Triumph&lt;/a&gt;. \"Mists of Pandaria\" based raid content also rewards &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Points\"&gt;Valor Points&lt;/a&gt;. The cap for Justice Points is 4000. After each patch, Justice Points above the cap are converted to per Justice Point.\nJustice Points and &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Points\"&gt;Valor Points&lt;/a&gt; were removed in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; and per point was mailed to each player to replace them. Items previously purchased using Justice or Valor now cost gold, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Heirloom\"&gt;Heirloom&lt;/a&gt;s and Justice-purchased rep tokens, which have been removed.\nSources.\nJustice Points are rewarded in level-appropriate dungeons and raids at the following quantities:\nOutgrowing content by out-leveling it will result in the listed objectives no longer rewarding Justice Points. Thus, for \"Wrath of the Lich King\" content, no Justice Points are awarded for players levels 81 and above (except for the &lt;a href=\"weekly%20quest\"&gt;weekly raid quest&lt;/a&gt; award). The same rule applies for \"Burning Crusade\" content, which also rewards Justice Points.\nPurchasable rewards.\nWrath of the Lich King gear (ilevel 200-264).\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" gear used the five-tier &lt;a href=\"Emblem\"&gt;Emblem&lt;/a&gt; system for dungeon and raid rewards. The emblem costs have since been converted to Justice Points.\nBurning Crusade gear (ilevel 110-146).\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" gear used &lt;a href=\"Badge%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Badge of Justice&lt;/a&gt; system for dungeon and raid rewards. The emblem costs have since been converted to Justice Points.\nConversion of Emblems to Justice Points.\nWhen players first logged in after &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the number of Justice Points they have will be calculated as follows:\nwhere:\nHowever, if the one-time emblem-to-point conversion granted the player more than 4,000 Justice Points, they were unable to accumulate any additional Justice Points until they had spent the excess. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;Patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, any Justice Points above 4,000 were immediately converted to gold at a ratio of per Justice Point.\nOther emblems, badges and tokens.\n, , and were immediately converted to gold (and not Justice Points) at a ratio of per emblem in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;. were also immediately converted to gold at a rate of per badge.\nPvP-based currency was converted to &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Point\"&gt;Honor Point&lt;/a&gt;s much the same way.\nOther, specific currencies such as &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Champion's Seal&lt;/a&gt;s was not converted.\nComparison of purchasing power.\nWith the introduction of \"Justice Points\" (Patch 4.0.1), that replaced &lt;a href=\"Emblem%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Emblem of Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emblem%20of%20Triumph\"&gt;Emblem of Triumph&lt;/a&gt;, players will be able to use the same currency to purchase both &lt;a href=\"Tier%209\"&gt;Tier 9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tier%2010\"&gt;Tier 10&lt;/a&gt;, potentially skipping the earlier in favor of the latter. Obtaining &lt;a href=\"Tier%2010\"&gt;Tier 10&lt;/a&gt; is now in comparison faster and easier.\nThe conversion did affect the prices of &lt;a href=\"Heirloom\"&gt;Heirloom&lt;/a&gt;s as well, from using &lt;a href=\"Emblem%20of%20Heroism\"&gt;Emblem of Heroism&lt;/a&gt; to using the same currency. The prices for Heirlooms seems to be equated for the \"Justice Point\" income at level 85, which at level 80 means relatively higher costs. Example:"}

K'ara's final act was to convince the draenei to eject it from the vessel, but this was easier said than done. The Void energy instinctively caused K'ara to go to war against the other naaru aboard the vessel, &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;. Their violent clash of Light and Void threatened to kill any draenei who interfered, yet &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward nonetheless. He used the Light to shield the other naaru and cast K'ara out of the vessel. But the battle sapped his strength, physically and mentally, and his visions of the future became unreliable. K'ara was ejected from the \"Genedar\" in the chaos of the crash, and came to be known as the Dark Star to the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Because of both the Void's power to defile the dead and that those few who accessed K'ara's shadowy power directly had their minds shattered, the ancient chieftain of the Shadowmoon clan outlawed its powers after the discovery of the Dark Star.\nRise of the Horde.\nDuring the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; cared little for and ignored the Shadowmoon's warnings. They conducted a ritual to call on the Dark Star in their war against the draenei and channeled it at &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei holy temple in Shadowmoon Valley. A pillar of Void energy ripped through the heavens and slammed down on Karabor, driving many draenei defenders to madness while many others died instantly. Velen called on his powers to keep the Void at bay and rally the survivors to Karabor's harbor, but the Dark Star had forever darkened Karabor, and it became known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; and was taken by the orcs. The option for the Horde to harness the Dark Star was no longer available after this. What happened to K'ara after this, including whether it survived the destruction of Draenor in some fashion, is unknown."}

How he found it is still hotly debated among the surviving ethereals, but the effects of his coming were unmistakable: he opened countless &lt;a href=\"Portal\"&gt;gateways&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; around the planet, bathing K'aresh in dark and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energies. One of the mortal races hastily attempted to construct magical barriers around its cities, but although the dark energies were blocked, the unimpeded flood of arcane energy tore away the mortals' corporeal shells and infused their souls with enough energy to transform them into the ethereals. This altered state proved to be a blessing in disguise, however, as their enhanced minds and magical abilities allowed the ethereals to fight Dimensius and his limited forces to a standstill. Over the years, however, Dimensius eventually grew powerful enough to summon armies of fellow void creatures, forcing the ethereals to flee into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Guide\"&gt;Adventure Guide&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Pandemonius\"&gt;Pandemonius&lt;/a&gt;, K'aresh was destroyed. However, at least one ethereal appears to still operate from K'aresh, which suggests that a portion of the planet may have survived the destruction. Dimensius may have also abandoned the planet after the ethereals fled."}

It communicated to Velen through an &lt;a href=\"ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt; that the eredar held sacred for centuries, as their mysterious appearances long ago is what allowed the eredar to make such sweeping strides in the areas of magic, science and technology from their telepathically given knowledge. K'ure became Velen's friend and mentor during their centuries of flight from Kil'jaeden.\nDuring the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;s crash several centuries ago, &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt; was injured, which caused it to enter the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; state of the naaru lifecycle. K'ara's final act was to convince the draenei to eject it from the vessel, but this was easier said than done. The Void energy instinctively caused K'ara to go to war against the other naaru aboard the vessel, &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; and K'ure. Their violent clash of Light and Void threatened to kill any draenei who interfered, yet &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward nonetheless. He used the Light to shield the other naaru and cast K'ara out of the vessel. But the battle sapped his strength, physically and mentally, and his visions of the future became unreliable. K'ara was ejected from the \"Genedar\" in the chaos of the crash, and came to be known as the Dark Star to the orcs of . \nMeanwhile the D'ore and K'ure were too weakened to land the Genedar and the vessel soon plummeted to the ground killing D'ore and many of the draenei on board. Over the next several centuries, K'ure became friends with the spirits of the orc ancestors, who were attracted to K'ure's energies. The ancestors took up residence in Oshu'gun, the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; name for K'ure's dimensional ship, and structured the orcish religion in such a way that the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s would unknowingly care for K'ure. \nOrcish exiles who had been expelled by their clans for tapping into the void and losing themselves to madness were attracted by K'ure's void energies. Deep underneath &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; these exiles would tap into the void energies bleeding from K'ure. By studying these powers the orcs would communicate with the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Lords\"&gt;Void Lords&lt;/a&gt;, who bombarded them with visions of apocalypse and revealing the secrets of using shadow magic. The influx of K'ure's Void energies would gradually turn the exiles' skin a sickly white, and they would call themselves the &lt;a href=\"Pale\"&gt;Pale&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs its &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; energies bled away over time, a &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; slowly grew in its place \u2014 devouring the souls of those nearby. K'ure watched helplessly as generations of orc spirits were consumed by this vortex. Recently, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; harnessed this vortex in order to draw countless &lt;a href=\"voidspawn\"&gt;voidspawn&lt;/a&gt; to increase their own ranks, until they were stopped by an adventurer with the aid of &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;."}

In Stormwind, King Varian's &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; use their spells to force the attacking necropolis out over the ocean, after which &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;-piloted &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; planes from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; cause the structure to plummet into the sea by destroying the chains holding the necropolis' stabilizing crystal. The &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King's herald&lt;/a&gt; declares that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s victory means nothing and invites them to face his minions in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, which Varian eagerly accepts. In Orgrimmar, Thrall calls upon the forces of earth, fire, lightning, and sandstorms to blow away another necropolis and cause it to crash in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. In response to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; herald's challenge, the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; tells &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; to prepare the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for war. Finally, in Theramore, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; freezes a necropolis in mid-air before unleashing a firestorm that partially cracks open the structure and forces it and the other Scourge to retreat.\nMeanwhile in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, Valeera realizes that she can't face &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; by herself after seeing how easily the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; felled &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt;. She decides to drain the remaining magical energy from Meryl to give herself enough power to distract the ogre, thus buying time for &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; to heal the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; so he can teleport them all to safety. However, after Valeera absorbs Meryl's energy, she feels the long-dormant &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; inside her being awakened by the surge of power, something that Cho'gall also notices and gleefully points out. Valeera tries to throw her daggers, but Cho'gall easily deflects them with his &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt; and slams the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; into a nearby wall.\nMed'an is overcome by &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;'s whispers but calls upon the spirits of the elements to calm his mind and send healing energy to his companions. Focused on his spell, he doesn't notice Cho'gall approaching him from behind. Recovering thanks to the boy's healing, Valeera pulls out a hidden dagger from her cloak and jumps at Cho'gall, slicing open his hamstring. However, the ogre immediately heals his wound by causing tentacles to erupt from his leg and begins to pummel the elf with his fists and magic.\nMeryl wakes up and admits to Med'an that &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; is his mother and that she's held at Theramore. The two watch as Cho'gall lifts up Valeera into the air and urges her to let her inner demon out. With no other choices in sight, Valeera offers herself to her demon willingly. The &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; loudly rejoices at his release and immediately takes complete control of Valeera's body (instantly causing her skin to once again become covered in &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; runes and causing her to speak with the dreadlord's voice) before firing a fel beam at the ogre. Meryl is shocked at the revelation of the demon's identity, explaining to Med'an that he faced Kathra'natir almost three thousand years earlier but had thought him banished from threatening &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; again.\nUnfazed by his new opponent, Cho'gall steps onto a nearby rune and monstrously mutates under his master's influence before barraging Kathra'natir with his power. However, while Valeera's sacrifice was not enough to defeat Cho'gall, it did give Meryl enough time to recover. The mage now teleports himself, Med'an, and Valeera away from Ahn'Qiraj, much to the ogre's fury.\nIn the courtyard of Theramore Keep, Jaina and her healers tend to the injured in the wake of the battle with the Scourge. &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; kneels beside &lt;a href=\"Sven\"&gt;a wounded friend&lt;/a&gt; and comments that in the presence of so much pain and death, she realizes how selfish she was to have used her magic to preserve her own youth and beauty while she was &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, unnoticed by everyone, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;a dark figure&lt;/a&gt; sneaks into Garona's cell, removes her shackles, and carries her off.\nAt the same moment, Meryl, Med'an, and Valeera arrive in another part of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;; Meryl says they can't bring Valeera to Theramore while she is possessed. Kathra'natir and Meryl exchange insults, with the latter pointing out that the demon is so weak that he's only able to possess a young blood elf female. Kathra'natir throws back that Valeera has strength that even she is unaware of and that she managed to keep him suppressed until she had no choice. Furthermore, she has powerful friends that the dreadlord planned to move on to eventually. The demon remarks that while Meryl glows with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power, Med'an is \"incandescent\" and would make a particularly fine host."}

This means that the characters associated with your regularly upgraded account could never obtain this item, with a transfer of a character to a Collector's Edition account not allowed.\nHowever due to numerous requests, Blizzard officially announced on January 22, 2007 that they are working on a solution to help customers \"re-upgrade\" their accounts. Those who fall in this category are asked to contact their Billing and Account Services department. Those who posted in the thread at the WoW forum have mentioned their having been able to get their accounts manually re-upgraded using this method.\nNotes.\nThe Netherwhelp pet caused much anger in Europe because &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard didn't put a code to get the pet, only the standard one to upgrade an account to a normal Burning Crusade account. To compensate for this production error, they implemented a new way to obtain the item that involved:\nMany fans were angered because the items to send were a part of the Collector's Edition. In response to the additional inconvenience, Blizzard added 2 days of gametime to all affected accounts and offered them a second exclusive pet: &lt;a href=\"Lurky\"&gt;Lurky&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;."}

It increases the Arcane Mage's passive &lt;a href=\"spell%20haste\"&gt;spell haste&lt;/a&gt;, which increases the speed at which he casts spells.\nNotes.\nSpell haste is useful for both PvP and PvE as it makes your spells with a cast time such as &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blast\"&gt;Arcane Blast&lt;/a&gt; quicker and channeled spells such as &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt; do full damage in less time. In addition, it reduces your &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier to cast multiple spells in quick succession in PvP or casting faster after an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Barrage\"&gt;Arcane Barrage&lt;/a&gt; in PvE. It does not reduce cooldowns.\nThis talent increases spell haste in two ways: First, it adds a flat percentage to the mage's spell haste number. For example, a mage with no other &lt;a href=\"haste%20rating\"&gt;haste rating&lt;/a&gt; on his gear will have 3.0% spell haste with three points in this talent.\nSecond, the talent increases the spell haste from gear by the given percentage. For example a level 85 mage with 500 haste rating, and no points in this talent, will have 3.90% spell haste. With three points in the talent, the same mage will have 4.02% spell haste (equivalent to 515 haste rating), plus the flat 3.0%, for a total of 7.02% spell haste."}

Now, they seek to find their identity beyond the shadows of their father's destructive heritage.\nHated to Neutral.\nThe quest chain begins by speaking with &lt;a href=\"Mordenai\"&gt;Mordenai&lt;/a&gt;, who wanders the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Fields\"&gt;Netherwing Fields&lt;/a&gt; in the southeast corner of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; and is often fighting flayers. When he is in combat, the quest marker will not be visible, making it harder to find him. To get the quest sooner, just assist him in combat. You will need a flying mount for this chain.\nNote: The quests in the Hated-to-Neutral chain are \"not\" daily quests. These are one-time-only quests that upon completion bring your reputation with the Netherwing up from to . It is not possible to start the daily quests before this entire chain is completed.\nThe +42000 reputation for Ally of the Netherwing is not subject to the human +10% reputation bonus. However, it is subject to the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Sharing\"&gt;Spirit of Sharing&lt;/a&gt; buff at present. It is also subject to any guild-based reputation bonuses you may have.\nIf you have &lt;a href=\"Diplomacy\"&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/a&gt; or another &lt;a href=\"reputation%20buff\"&gt;reputation buff&lt;/a&gt;, you can go from to instead from to .\nNeutral to Friendly.\nThe questline resumes by speaking with &lt;a href=\"Mordenai\"&gt;Mordenai&lt;/a&gt;, 300 &lt;a href=\"riding\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; skill and a flying mount are required to continue. Players who accept the introduction quest have Mordenai use the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflight\"&gt;Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s magic on them to appear as a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; riding a &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt; while in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Fortress\"&gt;Dragonmaw Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Ledge\"&gt;Netherwing Ledge&lt;/a&gt;.

The fake mount provides the same speed bonus as the real thing, giving a nice preview of what all the hard work is for.\nPlayers who do not have at least one gathering profession will be unable to complete the gathering based daily quests and so are at a slight disadvantage to players who do have a gathering skill. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blood%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Black Blood of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; mob found within the nearby mines drops &lt;a href=\"Sludge-Covered%20Object\"&gt;Sludge-Covered Object&lt;/a&gt; that has a chance to contain any of the gathered items, but without a gathering profession, the related quests do not appear.\nFriendly to Honored.\nPlayers receive a trinket that summons a &lt;a href=\"Overseer%27s%20Badge\"&gt;combat pet&lt;/a&gt; while in Shadowmoon valley and open up an additional 3 daily quests. Earlier repeatable quests are still available.\nHonored to Revered.\nPlayers receive an &lt;a href=\"Captain%27s%20Badge\"&gt;upgraded trinket&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to summon a combat pet in all zones. All previous repeatable quests are still available and another daily quest as well as the Dragonmaw Races become available. \nRevered to Exalted.\nPlayers receive yet another &lt;a href=\"Commander%27s%20Badge\"&gt;upgrade to the trinket&lt;/a&gt;, this time adding 45 stamina, and open up a daily group quest. All earlier repeatable quests are still available. The questline after Hail, Commander! depends on which of the &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s players are allied with.\nExalted.\nPlayers may then talk with the six Netherwing drakes standing next to &lt;a href=\"Barthamus\"&gt;Barthamus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;.

A &lt;a href=\"flying%20mount\"&gt;flying mount&lt;/a&gt; is required for this reputation grind, and 300 &lt;a href=\"riding\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; skill is necessary to advance past . Netherwing is one of the only factions in the game where players do not lose reputation by attacking and killing its members.\nIgnoring both the egg quest and the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; racial reputation bonus, the fastest reputation progression possible by completing the daily quests is:\nCompleting &lt;a href=\"Accepting%20All%20Eggs\"&gt;Accepting All Eggs&lt;/a&gt; can significantly reduce the total number of days needed to reach . Some have reported getting there in three to four days.\nSince the end of Burning Crusade, there are far fewer people doing these quests, resulting in far more eggs lying around, making it that much easier to get exalted.\nRewards.\n&lt;a href=\"Drake%20Dealer%20Hurlunk\"&gt;Drake Dealer Hurlunk&lt;/a&gt; sells additional &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20drake%20mounts\"&gt;Nether Drake&lt;/a&gt; mounts to players who are with the Netherwing at the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Dragonmaw Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;.

Netherwyrms are capable of shooting out green fire. Netherwyrms use the same tactics as nether dragons, though they like to evaluate their prey from a distance before moving in.\nThey appear similar to &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Wyrm\"&gt;Mana Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s, except for the fact that they have wings."}

However, Netrezaar's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Gorelix%20the%20Fleshripper\"&gt;Gorelix&lt;/a&gt;, discovered the plot and revealed it to Kil'jaeden. As punishment, Netrezaar's spirit was bound within his beloved axe and cursed to a fate worse than death: the weapon's metals would leave him racked with hunger, but the more souls the Maw consumed, the worse Netrezaar's hunger would grow.\nBiography.\nOn the eredar homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Netrius was a gifted smith who adored his master, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, and spent his entire life seeking his lord's approval. The crystalsmith was among the eredar who gathered in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; when Kil'jaeden told his people of the offer that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; had presented to Kil'jaeden and his fellow rulers. Netrius believed that Kil'jaeden would usher in an era of prosperity for the eredar and be remembered as their greatest leader.\nWhen Kil'jaeden joined the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Netrius was one of the first to follow his path, as he considered pledging himself to the Legion to be the ultimate expression of his loyalty. Upon joining the Legion, the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; flames remade both Netrius' mind and body, and he took up a new name: Netrezaar. Even his feelings toward Kil'jaeden changed as his admiration twisted into a dangerous obsession, and Netrezaar became fixated on the idea of creating a weapon to consume the demon lord's life force.\nNetrezaar's work won much renown in the Legion, his blades and war machines bringing ruin to entire civilizations. However, most of these were merely experiments in the quest for his true life's work, and Netrezaar spent years searching for exotic ores that could draw out Kil'jaeden's essence. On &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam, the Doom World&lt;/a&gt;, where Sargeras had long ago slaughtered his &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; brethren, Netrezaar discovered that the planet's metals had been infused with otherworldly properties. The ore had become nearly indestructible, could reflect brief images of the ancient battle and, most importantly, had gained the ability to leech away the life essence of any being that touched it.\nNetrezaar used this ore to craft his masterpiece, which he christened the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Maw of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. He tested it on two of the dozens of &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; under his command, slowly cutting their flesh to observe the axe's life-draining properties. The Maw worked just as planned and channeled the mo'args' vital energies into the eredar. However, one of the mo'arg survived: &lt;a href=\"Gorelix%20the%20Fleshripper\"&gt;Gorelix&lt;/a&gt;, Netrezaar's most devoted follower. The experiment had left him shriveled and disfigured, and the admiration he had once held for Netrezaar darkened into hatred. Knowing that he did not have the physical strength to rise against his master, Gorelix began observing Netrezaar's every move in search of a weakness. Gorelix discovered that his master never used the Maw of the Damned in battle, despite its great power, and kept it hidden from all other demons, save his mo'arg servants.\nEventually, Netrezaar decided that the time had come to use the Maw on Kil'jaeden. He planned to present the axe as a gift to his master and then strike when the demon lord least expected it. When Gorelix learned of this, he realized the true purpose of Netrezaar's axe and warned Kil'jaeden of the impending betrayal. When Kil'jaeden met with Netrezaar as planned, the demon lord struck before the smith had a chance to present his \"gift\", using his magics to lock Netrezaar's spirit in place while Gorelix took up the Maw of the Damned. Gorelix used the axe to inflict his vengeance upon his former master, slowly cutting away at the screaming smith's flesh until only bone remained.\nKil'jaeden cursed Netrezaar with a fate worse than death. Locking the traitor's howling spirit within his own skull, the demon lord ordered Gorelix to fuse the bone onto the axe. The weapon's metals would constantly drain Netrezaar's spirit, leaving him racked with hunger, but no amount of life force would ever satisfy him. To the contrary, the more Netrezaar consumed, the worse his pangs of hunger would grow. Kil'jaeden gifted the axe to Gorelix as a reward for his loyalty and gave him only one specific order: keep Netrezaar's spirit fed to continue his torture.\nGorelix used the Maw of the Damned in the service of the Legion for countless years, but despite the immense power it gave him, there where times when he did not use the axe. Sometimes, he would observe from a distance while the Legion besieged a world, describing the battle and the lives lost in great detail to Netrezaar's spirit to taunt him. When the Maw began to physically tremble in Gorelix's hands, he knew that his former master's spirit was suffering, and he found as much satisfaction from these acts of torture as he did from consuming his enemies' life force.\nWhile in Gorelix's care, the Maw claimed countless victims and devoured &lt;a href=\"Centralis\"&gt;an entire world&lt;/a&gt;, but still it hungered for more, and even the demons began to fear the weapon and its cursed prisoner. Netrezaar is the only one who knows how many lives the Maw has ended. His eternal hunger is so great that he cannot distinguish between friend and foe, and he would gladly consume the Legion's souls should the axe fall into the hands of an enemy of the Legion. Whether Netrezaar's hunger will ever die is unknown.\nUpon the death of Kil'jaeden, the Spirit of Netrezaar declared that\u2014at long last\u2014vengeance was his.\nGiven that &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Maw of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; has been drained of its power in order to neutralize the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, it is likely that Netrezaar has finally been freed."}

According to &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;' diary, the location of the fortress is very near where the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Fleet\"&gt;Scarlet Fleet&lt;/a&gt; made landfall: on the southeastern coast of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; region. New Hearthglen serves as the main garrison and harbor for the majority of the Onslaught's troops and fleet.\nThere is no doubt that the Onslaught has come to Northrend prepared for war. The base was constructed in record time in spite of the Scourge presence and the biting cold of the Dragonblight. Great reinforced stone walls surround the town within, which includes a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, a handful of houses, &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen%20abbey\"&gt;abbey&lt;/a&gt;, and several &lt;a href=\"Chapel\"&gt;churches&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in a massive white stone cathedral. Menacing &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e face outward from the walls. Along the coast, the Scarlet fleet lies docked in a sizable &lt;a href=\"harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scarlet forces are led by &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, who has relocated from &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;, the presumed-dead commander of the Scarlet fleet, secretly replaced by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress was assaulted and their leadership wiped out between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the Onslaught are still active and are attacked by the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; in order to save &lt;a href=\"Mariella%20the%20Heretic\"&gt;Mariella the Heretic&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that there are still enough crusaders around to continue their twisted crusade against anyone they think an enemy."}

{"id": "19443", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19443", "title": "New Plague", "text": "The New Plague, also known as the Forsaken Blight and the Blight or blight is the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s own version based on the powerful &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken's aim was to create a new plague that would annihilate the Scourge itself, and ultimately, during the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; campaign, this success comes within reach. However, the Forsaken's plague was usurped by the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, who proceeded to unleash it upon the Scourge, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. As such, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Forsaken's allies&lt;/a&gt; have deemed it unethical to be used again at its full potency.\nThe final form of the Blight has proven to be an extremely powerful weapon, but also something of a double-edged sword. As it's designed to cause harm to the living and the undead, the Forsaken are themselves vulnerable to it, having to wear gas masks in its contact. The full potency of the Blight was even powerful enough to momentarily bring the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; himself to his knees in fit of hacking coughs.\nUnlike the Plague of Undeath, which had the effect of transforming normal humans into mindless undead in the service of the tyrannical Lich King, the New Plague does not transform those affected by it into undead. It is akin to an extreme toxin; poisoning those it comes into contact with and killing them.\nDepending on how strong the released plague is, instead of killing, it can transform the subject into a shambling husk incapable of any reason or thought beyond a violent, throbbing hatred for the warmth of life.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt;, the alchemical experts of the Forsaken, worked on various ways to use various parts from creatures living in their sphere of control as well as agriculture grown in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; to create powerful toxins. \nThe use of the New Plague on humans was initially only partially successful. While it killed the victim, it didn't bring the human back after death as a new Forsaken. Other problems included distribution; the &lt;a href=\"R.A.S.\"&gt;R.A.S.&lt;/a&gt; searched for a way to effectively spread their new plague, so that no living thing would remain on the entire planet...leaving all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as one big plagueland, ruled by the Forsaken. Sylvanas' initial plan was to wipe out her immediate enemies \u2014 the Scourge and &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlets&lt;/a&gt; who hounded them \u2014 and then the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and raise them again to her cause.\nAn early near-brush with success involved pumpkins from the &lt;a href=\"Solliden%20Farmstead\"&gt;Solliden Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; in Tirisfal. When tested on a &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;r held captive in the &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; Inn, it brought about transformation into a &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;, only to cause true death seconds later. The mage &lt;a href=\"Phin%20Odelic\"&gt;Phin Odelic&lt;/a&gt; suspected that the Forsaken were involved with the death of his &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20Stanley\"&gt;cousin's dog&lt;/a&gt;, sending &lt;a href=\"Quae\"&gt;Quae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kinelory\"&gt;Kinelory&lt;/a&gt; to investigate.\n&lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; asked a Horde adventurer to go to &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Berard%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; of his former colleague, now the crazed &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Berard\"&gt;Apothecary Berard&lt;/a&gt;, and bring it to &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Renferrel\"&gt;Apothecary Renferrel&lt;/a&gt;. From the journal, Renferrel learned about ingredients that could help in the creation of the new plague. After the adventurer collected moss and tumor from &lt;a href=\"bog%20beast\"&gt;bog beast&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, they brought them to Faranell. From the journal's notes, Faranell was able to create the plague.\n&lt;a href=\"Castillian\"&gt;Castillian&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for delivering spores which helped lead to the finalization of the New Plague. Although located in a remote town, &lt;a href=\"Hierophant%20Theodora%20Mulvadania\"&gt;Hierophant Theodora Mulvadania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Goretooth\"&gt;Warlord Goretooth&lt;/a&gt; seem to have heard rumors about the new plague. &lt;a href=\"Infiltrator%20Marksen\"&gt;Infiltrator Marksen&lt;/a&gt; seemed to know what the Forsaken were up to. &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt; sensed that the Forsaken were up to something.\nSuccess.\nFollowing several successful field tests, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated a strain of New Plague to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Apothecarium\"&gt;Apothecarium&lt;/a&gt;, a strain of blight was administered to a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; woman and a Forsaken criminal. The girl bled from the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears before dying. The latter collapsed in spasms as his skin broke open and wept black ichor before dying. Sylvanas was elated to at last have a plague that killed both humans and Scourge.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe latest strain of the \"New Plague\" engineered in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; was shipped to &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Landing\"&gt;Vengeance Landing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; for use against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, but the long trip across the sea reduced its effectiveness. After several failures in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, the apothecaries of &lt;a href=\"New%20Agamand\"&gt;New Agamand&lt;/a&gt; sent a sample of the perfected plague, known as the \"Forsaken Blight\", to &lt;a href=\"Venomspite\"&gt;Venomspite&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this version vaporized everyone that tried handling it, necessitating further adjustments. The Forsaken Blight was modified to be inert until combined with a reactive agent in the form of &lt;a href=\"ectoplasm\"&gt;ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Shore%20%28Dragonblight%29\"&gt;Forgotten Shore&lt;/a&gt;, which would make it potent enough to turn its victims into shapeless piles of goo. It was contained in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragon%20Tear\"&gt;tears&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Before delivering the plague to &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Sintar%20Malefious\"&gt;Doctor Sintar Malefious&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, the new blight was tested on the Scourge at &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Fields\"&gt;Carrion Fields&lt;/a&gt; in the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; via a Forsaken \"blight spreader\" catapult. It appeared that the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; were immune to this plague, as indicated in the failed test against a &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught%20Prisoner\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Forsaken could perfect their New Plague, a sample was stolen by the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Peppy%20Wrongnozzle\"&gt;Peppy Wrongnozzle&lt;/a&gt;, a drunken amateur alchemist, accidentally perfected the Blight while attempting to make a &lt;a href=\"Peppy%27s%20Special%20Mix\"&gt;plague vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. When tested on a &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; prisoner, he melted into a pile of goo.\nThe Forsaken Blight's most despicable use occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; was slain by the Lich King when he and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; confronted him, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the bluff overlooking the battlefield with several blight spreader catapults. Serving the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, who had launched a coup against the Dark Lady and taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Putress launched the Blight against both the Scourge and the combined Alliance-Horde forces. The attack resulted in Highlord Fordragon becoming missing in action, the near-total destruction of the combined army, and even weakened Arthas himself, who retreated back into &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Forsaken attack was considered by the Alliance to be outright treachery on the part of the Horde, and the coup by Varimathras gave &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; an opening to lead Alliance forces in a &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt; to avenge Bolvar and retake Lordaeron for the Alliance. The Horde launched &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;an attack on the Undercity&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim it from Varimathras.\nCataclysm.\nThe Horde banned any further use of the fully powered Forsaken Blight after the Wrathgate incident. However, they supplied some apothecaries with a weaker version of the blight, which wouldn't be so destructive. It proved to be literally rather explosive when &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s tested it out on &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Forsaken victory in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; and a number of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blightspreader%20%28Shadowfang%20Keep%29\"&gt;Blightspreaders&lt;/a&gt; assault &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. As the Forsaken fight inwards, they spray down most areas with another strain of blight.\nDue to the neutered blight being ineffective against the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken later drenched &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in a very potent strain of blight, though the Forsaken responsible for it expressed mild surprise at its effectiveness, alluding to an uncertainty as to whether the fully powered blight was employed. They revealed that, ideally, the Forsaken want to eventually inhabit the areas purged via the plague, though when more powerful versions are used the land becomes uninhabitable for a \"cooling down\" period. The area then became plagued by &lt;a href=\"Blight%20Slime\"&gt;Blight Slime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angry%20Blight%20Slime\"&gt;Angry Blight Slime&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Forsaken brought barrels and containers of the plague to &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wyrmtongue%20Harvester\"&gt;Wyrmtongue Harvester&lt;/a&gt;s were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;Ruins of Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in order to harvest remaining &lt;a href=\"Blight%20Sample\"&gt;Blight Sample&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith Sylvanas taking the reins as Warchief of the Horde, she chose to make use of the plague once more, though this new one seemed different, or at least fine-tuned. Developed aboard the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rose%20%28ship%29\"&gt;\"Black Rose\"&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"R.A.S.\"&gt;R.A.S.&lt;/a&gt;, this new plague was extremely volatile, exploding on contact with a sickly green liquid that melts away skin and flesh almost immediately, right down to the bone. The plague must be contained inside special vials developed by the R.A.S., and if opened, cannot be contained. Production of it apparently produced volatile \"byproducts\". Exposure to these byproducts caused rapid cell degeneration and reduced the subject to a shambling husk incapable of reason or thought, aside from a burning hatred for the warmth of life.\nIts use wasn't only found in Forsaken catapults, as both &lt;a href=\"Nathanos\"&gt;Nathanos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; were seen using it to tip their arrows.\n&lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Befouler\"&gt;Forsaken Befouler&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Plaguebringer\"&gt;Forsaken Plaguebringer&lt;/a&gt;s also use it at &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Towers\"&gt;Warden Towers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; deployed the Forsaken Blight on &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces alike in order to hold off &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s assault, although &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s unexpected arrival helped turn the tide against her after she dispelled most of the Blight blocking the Alliance access to the Keep. This blight was an improved formula of the first one. Supplemented by mindless undead Sylvanas raised from the fallen, these tactics managed to slow the Alliance's advance and gave Sylvanas and her forces enough time to fall back and escape to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, although these tactics were seen by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; as dishonorable. Sylvanas ultimately rigged all of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; to be blighted in an effort to wipe out the Alliance leaders that had been lured into the city. Although the Alliance leaders escaped her setup, the blight itself also made the Ruins of Lordaeron inhospitable and thus prevented the Alliance from using it as a base, even apparently after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the blight infecting &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; was being weaponized by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Apothecary\"&gt;apothecaries&lt;/a&gt;. The efforts were stopped by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; champions.\nThe New Plague was used in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nIn the aftermath of the Jailer's destruction and Sylvanas' sentencing, Alliance and Horde adventurers were invited to assist the Forsaken in purging the blight from Undercity. To do this, creatures from Maldraxxus were used to devour the plague, after which their combined form was destroyed, destroying the plague with it.\nItems and objects.\nThe following is a list of items related to the New Plague:\nSpeculation.\nWhile not necessarily radioactive in nature, its effect on an area is somewhat similar to the effects of radiation. When a large amount of radiation is in an area, it is considered uninhabitable for a long period of time, anywhere from days to possibly centuries, due to the radiation levels in the area making it unsafe to be in. Likewise, in Southshore, it is stated that areas that are plagued must undergo a \"cooling-down period\" before they can be inhabited again. The way players can scan the levels of danger in Southshore caused by the plague is akin to, and may, in fact, be, scanning with a . The interface of the meter used in the quest even resembles a classic Geiger counter.\nIt is unclear in the lore whether plagued regions can truly be healed or purged, and if so, how difficult it is to successfully cleanse its effects, and whether it becomes more difficult the longer they linger. For example, according to certain sources, most of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; remains blighted and largely uninhabited even years after it was attacked, implying that even the neighboring Horde is unable or unwilling to purge the Blight. The &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;'s combined efforts are able to apparently heal Scourge-plagued lands as of the Cataclysm, but it is unknown whether they are effective against the new Forsaken Blight.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon Aspect of Life, and her &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; were able to stop the spread of the Blight at the Wrath Gate, but they arrived only minutes after it was released upon the Alliance and the Horde forces, and were still unable to save most of the victims, and Alexstrasza herself mentioned that the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; was beyond her powers to remove, at least without severely affecting the physical body, as seemed to be the case with &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most powerful Alliance magi, was able to apparently dispel the Blight at Lordaeron with a massive &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Ring of Frost&lt;/a&gt;, but it is unclear whether she is able to permanently remove it, or merely hold it in stasis temporarily. The kaldorei led by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; seem to be able to counter and contain the Blight used against them in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; using nature magic, but it remains to be seen whether their efforts are able to completely cleanse it throughout the region."}

After the preparations were made, Gelbin led a full assault to wrest control of Gnomeregan's air field, surface command post, and ultimately underwent a raid into the tunnels of lower &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Gnomeregan exiles' best efforts to reclaim their techno-city, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; detonated a radiation bomb in the city; forcing Mekkatorque's forces to hastily teleport to the surface to escape the re-irradiated city. It was a successful first maneuver, but there will be much more bloodshed before the entirety of the gnomeland is liberated. In the ongoing effort to reclaim Gnomeregan from Sicco Thermaplugg and his twisted cohorts, the gnomes have carved out a tenuous foothold in New Tinkertown, near the techno-city\u2019s gates.\nAs per \"\" website &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/cataclysm/features/tinkertown.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\"As &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Exiles\"&gt;Gnomeregan's exiles&lt;/a&gt; set out to reclaim their beloved capital from the treasonous &lt;a href=\"Mekgineer%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Mekgineer Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;, we bring you a first look at how this wondrous techno-city will exist in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.

Note that while all these terms are derived from the word newbie and have the same literal meaning, their connotations are quite different. Newb commonly speaks of a new player, while a noob, n00b, or nub means someone who thinks he knows everything, criticizing others while doing many of the things listed below and calling people who tell them they're doing something wrong a n00b. Though not doing the things listed below will prevent you from acting like a noob, good humor, admitting to being new, and asking about things you don't know will prevent you from acting like a noob.\nSome examples are \"The Paladin bubbled while carrying the flag, NOOB!\" and \"Even though I've been through Waling Caverns 3 times, I still feel like a noob there.\"\nUsage.\nThe terms newb or newbie typically refer to someone new to the game, and thus forgivable of any innocent mistakes they might make. Noob or nub (and their &lt;a href=\"Leetspeak\"&gt;Leetspeak&lt;/a&gt; variations) carry a harsher meaning, that of a player being stupid or ignorant. Beyond a certain character level, players who make mistakes are usually assumed to be noobs, or else new players who have purchased their accounts instead of leveling up themselves. Either way, other players generally regard them with contempt.\nMost players are mature enough to recognize that everyone was once a newb, and offer tips and other assistance to inexperienced players. Some, however, have severe disrespect for anyone who they consider a \"noob\"\nA \"noob\" described by wowcrendor is someone who is either:\nA. New to the game\nB. Bad at the game\nC. Is being called a noob by a noob because the noob is mad at his noobness and retaliates by calling the non-noob a noob.\nHow NOT to be a noob.\nThe best way not to be a noob is to accept that you will never know \"everything\" there is to know about the game. Always be open to criticism and strive to learn more about game mechanics and the specifics of your class. If you're new to tanking, healing or a certain instance, don't be afraid to say it as people will be more understanding if they know you're new.\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of noobish behaviors. Most of these offenses are at one point or another committed accidentally by everyone. Some people may act in these ways with a full understanding of what they are doing, performing a twisted form of humor (somewhat related to trolling). \nWhat makes this a list of newbie behaviors is that newbies exhibit many of them at once, usually out of ignorance either of the offense or its consequences. By reading and understanding this list and the social mores behind it, one can learn how \"not\" to be a noob. \nPVE.\nTanks.\n\"\"Rogue\" casts &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt; at \"Humanoid Enemy\".\"\n\"\"Humanoid Enemy\" is affected by \"Rogue\"'s &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"\"Tank\"'s melee swing hits \"Humanoid Enemy\" for X damage.\"\n\"\"Rogue\"'s &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt; dissipatates from \"Humanoid Enemy\".\"\nHealers.\nHowever, in certain situations (namely Heroic Instances and Raids), a single hit from a mob can easily kill a healer due to their lack in stamina and armor, which leads to a wipe anyways. In these situations, Psychic Scream can save the healer and the group.\nRaiding.\nNoob raiders suffer from all the foibles of the PVE noob, with some additional outrages all their own. \nGear.\nYour gear also plays a big factor in not being a noob"}

{"id": "46733", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46733", "title": "Newbie battleground guide", "text": "The anti-thesis of dungeons, Battlegrounds offer a completely different experience to players. Dungeons are completed by calculated, methodical progression; the goal being to \"control the game\" rather than letting the game control you.\nPvP is quite the opposite. In PvP battlegrounds, you are not pitted against digital entities with calculated behaviors, but fellow humans with all the common sense and lack there-of that comes with being human. PvP rewards quick thinking and situational awareness: the moment you think everything is safe and good, a rogue will appear behind you and you'll have the choice of releasing your spirit now or in 6 minutes. \nWarsong Gulch.\nWarsong Gulch, or WSG, is the first Battleground that leveling characters can access. The game flow is the classic capture the flag model which grew up in real world paintballing and has made its way into many online multi player games. (e.g. \"Blood Gulch\" in Halo). As battlegrounds go, WSG is the standard fare; games tend to resolve quickly resulting in high turnaround and thus increased opportunity to gain honor. \nLeadership &amp; Play Style.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Instance%20Grouping%20Guide\"&gt;Instance Grouping Guide&lt;/a&gt; briefly mentions the role of the party leader; designating targets and planning the flow of the battle. The party plans a fight, executes that plan, and then advances to make the next plan. In this way, Dungeons are similar to American Football, where play action is interrupted regularly and the emphasis is on anticipating what the opponent will do in the next snap. \nThis is not the case in WSG. Game flow is never interrupted; if you stand still for a span of time in the middle of the battle you can expect that the opponent will either kill you or ignore you and go after the objective. Here, the leader must coach in a style more akin to basketball, where players know their roles and do them to the best of their ability according to their knowledge of the situation at the moment. A good battleground leader will remind people what their job is, and tell them information that they need to know that they might not know, such as where the flag bearer is.\nThe MOST important thing in WSG is positioning: being in the right place at the right time to react, particularly in the lower levels of the battleground, before people can be mounted. It takes time to move across the map, and in many cases you could follow someone for minutes and gain no ground at all if they choose their path correctly. You can't hit what you can't catch.\nClass Duties.\nIf you've read the &lt;a href=\"Instance%20Grouping%20Guide\"&gt;Instance Grouping Guide&lt;/a&gt;, or have played WoW at all, you should already be aware that there are significant differences between classes. In a dungeon, tanks and healers exist to allow dps classes to do their work. This relationship is reversed in WSG. \nFlagbearing: Druids, Warriors, Paladins\nThe flag bearer is absolutely assured to be target \"numero uno\" to the opponent. S/he can expect to take fire from any and every player who can disengage to intercept them in time. Thus, it is absolutely critical that the flag bearer be a class capable of surviving the run with the flag. Druids, with their animal forms, can be useful in this role because of their great speed or armor/stamina. Mages, with their snares and blink, and priests, with shielding and fear, can also survive in this role but not against a determined and focused opponent; once a few DoTs pile up, cloth classes tend to die quickly. Warriors and Paladins are ideal if a druid is not available.\nSkirmishing: Warlocks, Hunters, Shamans\nThe role of the skirmisher is to harass the opponent. Classes with combat pets can present a threat to the opponent, particularly hunters with pets similar to druid animal forms. This role is less about killing the opponent, and more about stalling and forcing the opponent to become entangled in battle instead of running towards their objective. Shamans, with their combination of skills, also make excellent skirmishers. Skirmishers should concentrate on wing men going in for the flag, and the flag bearer. \nWingmen: Priests, Mages\nMages and Priests, with frost nova and fear respectively, make excellent wing men for flag bearers. Frequently they can run alongside opponent players behind the flag bearer with little risk of being attacked merely because the opponent is focused solely on recovering the flag. AOE snares can stop pursuit cold. Against a particularly disorganized opponent, wing men might also stay behind at the opponent's graveyard and snare players as they rez; a suicidal move frequently but certain to draw attention away from the rest of the fight. \nFlag Guards: Mages, Hunters \nClasses with the ability to detect rogues also make good guards. Hunters, with their flares and traps, can detect rogues and booby-trap the flag area. Mages, with frost nova and arcane explosion, have equally good abilities. In some cases an opponent rogue will camp the flag alcove while the flag is being carried, for a quick rebound should the team score or the flag be returned, and guards have the abilities to detect these infiltrators before they can act.\nHunter-Killers: Rogues, DPS Casters\nDespite the name, this role has little to do with hunters and everything to do with killing. Hunter-Killer players roam the backfield, or sometimes camp the flag, looking for otherwise unengaged players to pick off; in practice this is similar to sniper-camping in most shooting games. If the skirmishers have picked off wing men, the HK rogue camping the flag can pick off the flag bearer before the flag can leave the base. Other DPS classes can support this role as well: night elves give the alliance an advantage in this way with their shadowmeld ability."}

Use the /chat command to get a listing of chat channel commands. You will automatically join chat channels \"General\", \"Trade\", and \"LocalDefense\" when you create your character.\nTo send a message to a chat channel, type \"/# (message)\" where # is the number of the channel you would like to send to. 1 is always the \"General\" channel, and 2 is the Trade channel when in a city. (Type /chatlist to see a list of channels you are currently on.)\nItem links can be sent by shift-clicking any item, but they won't work in any \"numbered\" chats other than the Trade channel, which only appears in large cities. Links will work in party, say, and guild chat. (This was done to prevent item/trade spamming in the General chat channel; unfortunately, it also means that you can't share item links with friends in private chat channels. However, if someone requests that you link an item to them, you can do that through &lt;a href=\"whisper\"&gt;whisper&lt;/a&gt;.)\n&lt;youtube width=\"375\" height=\"225\"&gt;N3n3MocV9Zw&lt;/youtube&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mail\"&gt;Mail&lt;/a&gt; system.\nFor a small price (), you can send in-game mail to other players. This can be sent when other players are offline or online. An icon will appear near your minimap indicating if you have new Unread Mail. To read your mail, visit the postbox outside any inn. You can also send items through mail to other players as \"attachments\". Sending mail is instantaneous, unless there is an item attached, in which case the message will take one hour to be delivered (sent items between characters on the same account is still instantaneous). Attachments are returned to the sender if the message goes unread for 30 days, or if the recipient does not remove the item from their mailbox within 30 days of reading the message.\nYou can also use a &lt;a href=\"C.O.D.\"&gt;C.O.D.&lt;/a&gt; to send mail with items attached. This allows you to set a price for the recipient to be able to collect the item from the mail (i.e. you can charge them for the item). When the recipient clicks the item to put it in their pack, a dialog comes up stating the price. If they say accept, then the price is deducted from their money and sent to you in a mail message. They may also select return which will return the item to you via mail. C.O.D. items expire from the recipients inbox in 30 days even if unread, so be sure they know that it is coming. You can C.O.D. items to your other characters on the same &lt;a href=\"account\"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; also.\nYou may also send cash in mail, but all mail sent with &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; arrives with an hour delay. For example, your character needs a bit of quick cash and you have another character on the same account with cash, switch to the other character, drop some cash in the mail, then switch back, and the cash should already be in your inbox. If your other character is on another account (say, your brother's or sister's), you need wait 1 hour, log out to the beginning logon screen and proceed as normal. You don't need to be on one account to send money or any such, but it \"is\" much faster and easier."}

(Killing other than for a quest is called &lt;a href=\"grind\"&gt;grind&lt;/a&gt;ing.) Either way, you will have to fight.\nYou can attack any &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; (name written in red when selected) or &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; (name written in yellow when selected) and they will fight back. &lt;a href=\"Combat\"&gt;Combat&lt;/a&gt; can also begin by entering a hostile creature's &lt;a href=\"aggro%20radius\"&gt;aggro radius&lt;/a&gt; and they will attack you automatically. A neutral mob will ignore you unless you make any kind of threatening action toward it. Sometimes two or more mobs (hostile or neutral) may be linked so that if you attack one, another comes without calling.\nTo kill the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; you must reduce their &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; to zero. If the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; reduces your character's health to zero you &lt;a href=\"Death%28gameplay%29\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo reduce a creature's health you can attack in a number of ways:\nOnce you kill the creature you may or may not be able to &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; and gain some treasure.\nUsing combat skills will increase your weapon skill. Being attacked will increase your &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; skill. The maximum amount of skill (under common circumstances) is 5 \u00d7 your character level + Racial bonuses.\nPlayer vs Player (&lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;).\nWith the PvP system, you may fight players of opposite factions if their &lt;a href=\"PvP%20flag\"&gt;PvP flag&lt;/a&gt; is turned on. You will know since their names will be written in yellow (you can attack them but they can't attack you) or red (you can attack them and they can attack you). Players of opposite factions can only attack you if your flag is up, unless you're on a &lt;a href=\"PvP%20server\"&gt;PvP server&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=\"PvP%20flag\"&gt;PvP flag&lt;/a&gt; for a fuller description.\nYou can fight players of your own faction in &lt;a href=\"Dueling\"&gt;duels&lt;/a&gt;. Duels will not affect the status of your PvP flag and they do not end up in death. \"Death\" will cause the duel to end but the loser will be left alive with almost no health.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, there is an arena where you can fight anyone of any faction, like a free-for-all battle. Only those in your group are safe from your wrath. At specific times a treasure chest is set at the center of the arena. The last man standing gets the loot.\nRecovery.\n&lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;) will recover over time. If you are willing to sit down, you can eat &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; to recover health faster and imbibe a &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; to recover mana faster. You can eat something and drink something at the same time (use one then the other) which regains health and mana in one break period. You cannot eat or drink during combat.\nDuring combat you can use &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s to recover health or mana during combat. Some special items also allow recovery with effects similar to spells. Potions generally act instantaneously. You may only drink one of these potions every 2 minutes and drinking one potion type precludes drinking the other for the full time. Spells can be instant, but most have a casting time which can be delayed or interrupted by combat. &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;First Aid&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to recover health during combat, but the recovery is incremental and can be interrupted, as it is &lt;a href=\"channel\"&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt;ed.\nRogues have some special &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, potions or foods that can increase the recovery rate of energy, but most are only available at higher levels, so somewhat beyond the scope of this guide.\n&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s use &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; which is generated by dealing, receiving, and avoiding damage. Thus, recovery is not really an issue. But since their rage decays over time following a battle, there are potions that give the warrior rage. These aren't generally necessary, however, since rage is usually generated at an acceptable rate without the potion.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20%28gameplay%29\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other games, in \"World of Warcraft\" you lose no items or experience when you die. Instead, all of your equipped items immediately take a 10% &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; reduction (this applies only to items equipped when you died, not to items in your inventory).\nWhile in spirit form, you can run back to your corpse and rejoin it for no additional penalty by selecting the \"Resurrect Now\" button when you come within range; you come back to life with half health and half mana. Run speed is increased while you are a spirit and you are able to walk on water.\nA &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt; is also present in each graveyard who can bring you back to life immediately, saving you a trip to your corpse. However, doing this will cause all of your equippable items to take an \"additional\" 25% durability hit; this applies both to equipped items, and to items in your inventory. In addition, you will suffer from &lt;a href=\"resurrection%20sickness\"&gt;resurrection sickness&lt;/a&gt;, beginning at level 11. Furthermore, at the point when you die, you are usually doing something that is necessary to complete a quest. In this case, you will have to return to the same place. While sometimes it is better to go ahead and resurrect at the spirit healer, it is usually better to return to your corpse.\n\"Note:\" If you are killed by another player in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat, you do not take the initial 10% durability hit. This means that if you walk back to your corpse or are ressed by another player there is no adverse effect at all, except the time to make the trip to your corpse due to a PvP death. However, you will always take a 25% hit if you are resurrected by a spirit healer no matter how you died, and if you are above level 10, you will also suffer from resurrection sickness."}
{"id": "89562", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=89562", "title": "Newbie guide/Getting better", "text": "There are many ways to improve your character from merely &lt;a href=\"grinding\"&gt;grinding&lt;/a&gt; (killing &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s for what they &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; they give), to &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Profession\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; (learning and improving &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s), or just &lt;a href=\"Profession\"&gt;gathering&lt;/a&gt;.\nUltimately, you'll want to gain &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;s so you can improve your fighting or spellcasting, but also because you need higher levels to improve professions and access such cool things as &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s. Also, to make your character more competitive you will want to get better &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s. For most of that you will need &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be gained through quests and PvP.\nGetting Experience.\nThe combination of &lt;a href=\"Quest\"&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt;ing and killing &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s is the primary way of gaining &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get smaller amounts just by &lt;a href=\"exploring\"&gt;exploring&lt;/a&gt; new areas (although this is impossible without first being at a reasonable level and shouldn't substitute combat experience considering the risk involved). You can also gain experience by just killing &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s without questing, although this may become boringly routine after some time. As for just milking experience from mobs, there are guides elsewhere explaining which mobs are best for killing at certain levels of classes (some of which are listed at the bottom of this guide). The rule of thumb is, monsters two levels lower than you allow for the fastest XP, as they die fast while still providing decent XP per kill.\nTraining New Skills.\nAs you progress and gain levels in the game, you will be able to learn many new and exciting skills (&lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s) and &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s. These are learned automatically, or at your &lt;a href=\"profession%20trainer\"&gt;profession trainer&lt;/a&gt; in the various cities. If you're having troubles locating a trainer, just ask a city &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;. The profession trainers will allow you to advance in skill stages and offer you more &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s as you increase your skill level.\nAs of level 10, you can also further specialize your character by investing &lt;a href=\"talent%20point\"&gt;talent point&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"talents\"&gt;talents&lt;/a&gt; geared toward different aspects of your character."}
{"id": "85856", "revid": "40277561", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=85856", "title": "Newbie guide/Instanced Dungeons", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Instance%20Guide\"&gt;Instanced&lt;/a&gt; Dungeons.\nGroup Encounters.\nInstanced Dungeons (or \"&lt;a href=\"Instances\"&gt;Instances&lt;/a&gt;\") are where the fun really begins. These are not the sort of places you'll want to go alone. Unlike many areas of the game where you may easily get by as a solo player, instances and dungeons are \"designed\" to challenge \"groups\" of players. Most instances and dungeons will require five people to complete successfully. They always contain many &lt;a href=\"Elite\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; monsters.\nInstances are a great way for groups to get experience and loot, though they present quite a challenge. It is ideal to construct well-balanced groups that include members which fill all party roles: typically a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, and three &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;s. Additionally, it is preferable to have at least one party member with good &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; abilities.\nThere are four classes that can resurrect when out of combat: Priest, Druid, Paladin, and Shaman. In addition, the Druid ability &lt;a href=\"Rebirth\"&gt;Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;, the Death Knight ability &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Ally\"&gt;Raise Ally&lt;/a&gt;, and the warlock ability &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; can resurrect players in combat. &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s of any class can make or buy &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Jumper%20Cables\"&gt;Goblin Jumper Cables&lt;/a&gt;, which allow the user to attempt to resurrect someone. Anyone in a maximum level guild will have the ability &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Resurrection%20%28guild%20perk%29\"&gt;Mass Resurrection (guild perk)&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow them to resurrect all dead players within a group.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; article for a table of roles that usually need to be played, and the rating of each class' ability to fulfill that role.\nInstances are both sources of excitement, and of dread.\nA place for you and your group only.\nIn the open world, monsters exist and are free to roam. Anybody can come along, kill them, get the loot, &lt;a href=\"skin\"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; them, etc. and move on. If one player kills a monster, obviously it can't be killed twice. That means other players have to wait until that monster respawns, which occurs regularly (usually within 5-15 minutes). Some monsters are quest targets, which need to be killed by any player attempting to complete a quest (a well-known example is &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt; for the quest in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;). You may find yourself waiting for Hogger to respawn before you can kill him again. You may even be able to kill the same monster any number of times, as long as you wish to wait around.\nIn instances, it doesn't quite work the same way. Each group that goes into an instanced dungeon gets their own version of it \u2013 their own instance of it, hence the name. This means you will never be inconvenienced by another group going in and killing all of the monsters, getting the loot before you do, but you will also be completely responsible for your own safety. Each group gets to go through the whole instance on their own. This can result in good loot and experience as a group progresses through an instance. \nMonsters in a dungeon do not typically respawn, unless a long period of time has passed, or a special scripted event is executed. For example, in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, the Goblins and Defias Miners (of various types) stay dead. The wandering Defias Enforcers and Taskmasters (&lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt;s) are the only ones that respawn regularly (just to keep things interesting). Typically, dungeon respawns will not be much of a concern, unless you leave a dungeon in order to return later.\nDeath and Resurrection in Instances.\nIf you die in an instance, your spirit need only find its way back to the entrance of it. As soon as you re-enter the instance, you are resurrected normally, but at the instance gate. This can mean that you may have a long way to run before you catch up to the rest of your group. In certain cases, you may end up fighting your way back to your group (or your group, if you're the only one left, may end up fighting their way back to \"you!\"). The benefit of this is that if every member of your group dies in a battle, you don't need to go walk around looking for your corpses. You just need to re-enter the instance, and everyone gets revived at the same point.\nIf your group has advanced a considerable distance into an instance, it may be desirable to avoid pulling mobs on the way back. It's smart to try to allow characters with &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt;ion abilities, such as &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, or players in maximum level guilds with the spell &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Resurrection%20%28guild%20perk%29\"&gt;Mass Resurrection (guild perk)&lt;/a&gt; to survive a difficult fight, even if other characters must sacrifice themselves in the process. If these particular characters survive a disaster that kills the rest of the party, they can eventually resurrect everyone else \u2013 preventing a long run back."}

There are two types: those that will &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;bind when first equipped or used&lt;/a&gt;, and those that will &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;bind when they are looted or picked up&lt;/a&gt;. When looting, you will get a warning dialog telling you that looting the item will permanently bind it to you when you either equip or loot such an item. Once an item is bound to you, it will indicate in the &lt;a href=\"tooltip\"&gt;tooltip&lt;/a&gt; that it is soulbound just below the name of the item. You can sell &lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt; items to vendor &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, but not to other players. Destroying these items, selling them to a vendor, or &lt;a href=\"disenchant\"&gt;disenchant&lt;/a&gt;ing them (if you are an &lt;a href=\"enchanter\"&gt;enchanter&lt;/a&gt;) are the only ways of getting rid of these objects; you cannot mail them, trade them, or sell them in the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcquiring items.\nItems are acquired in several ways:\nItem attributes.\nMost items in \"World of Warcraft\" have one or more &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on what &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; you chose to play, some attributes become more important than others."}

If we wanted to play a one-player game, there might be other games more suitable. Partying is the best way to get to know someone, as far as the quality of their character:\nIn order to be the best you can be in a group, it is good to look at other classes to see what they can do for you, and to see what you can do for them that they can't do for themselves. Don't be afraid to ask someone for a benefit that they can offer you; and if you have something they might benefit from, give it to them.\nFirst off, it is not entirely uncommon for first-time group members who had never met before to offer an enchantment (as it increases their skill, which benefits them). If you don't get such an offer, do not just \"expect\" them to respond affirmatively to a request. \nAll classes that can buff should buff everyone in their party. Some buffs require certain &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"reagent\"&gt;reagent&lt;/a&gt;s, so you shouldn't be surprised if someone doesn't have the buff you're looking for. Just remember to ask. Many players don't know the lengths of all your buffs, so you'll just have to remind the buffer. In the case of a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, where they can cast only one blessing on each character, you should ask the paladin for the particular blessing you want.\nMany classes are hybrids and you can fill two different roles. Everyone should know what role they play in any given party, and also \"how\" to play that role well.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Instance%20Grouping%20Guide\"&gt;Instance Grouping Guide&lt;/a&gt; for information that is absolutely essential for going into dungeons with others. It is incredibly annoying when people do not follow the principles outlined in that article. Some people can be taught patience and such; others can't. You should do what you can to learn from experienced people (who are usually notable just from seeing how they speak and act) and teach others the same.\nIt is considered rude to invite somebody into a party, especially if they have not asked for a party, without first speaking with them. In many cases, however, it's obvious that you have a common goal. In these cases, you may get an invitation to join a party (but you should still not give one before speaking). Some instances of this is when you see the same character over and over in the area of a certain type of monster which is a quest monster or one that gives reputation. In this case, it is very beneficial to be in a group even if you don't help each other. The reason is that all members of the group get credit for killing each monster that the other one kills. However, if you're not immediately in the same area attacking the same clusters of monsters, it would be good to have free-for-all &lt;a href=\"looting\"&gt;looting&lt;/a&gt;, or else a lot of loot would probably not be picked up by the others.\nAnother important reason to party up is that (probably) in every case, two together will be more than twice as effective at killing any given monster or set of monsters than the two separately. Synergy is very important in grouping. Two paladins can have two different auras which can be very beneficial; three is nice, too, but the rewards are greatly diminished at that point, because the group would receive a greater reward from another class. Two hunters can benefit each other in a similar manner as well, along with two warriors, and so on. But the greatest benefit of all is to have only one of each class. But it is not always easy to achieve such a grouping.\n&lt;a href=\"Loot\"&gt;Loot&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nLooting and loot &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; are fairly straightforward. If the corpse of a monster has gold sparkles on top of it, it means there's something on the corpse that you can loot. Once you loot a corpse, if you don't take everything off it, everyone else in your group will have the option to loot.\nThere are a few different looting types in parties that can be set by the party leader by right-clicking on his own portrait in the upper left. Two of these types are affected by the loot threshold, also set by the leader (the threshold can be set to &lt;a href=\"uncommon\"&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt;).\nMoney loot is always shared in a party regardless of loot type. However, if a party member is out of range when a monster is looted, they will not receive a share of any gold found on a corpse and will not be able to roll for any special items found.\nIn addition to the loot rules that can be set up to run automatically (see &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;), many groups have additional rules that they add in. Don't forget to decide them before starting!"}
{"id": "85848", "revid": "41423286", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=85848", "title": "Newbie guide/Picking a Server", "text": "\"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" servers are referred to as 'realms'. A &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; is a game world that exists only for the &lt;a href=\"Character\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; within it. This concept used to be more strict, but with modern changes introduced in the game players can sometimes interact with players from other realms (&lt;a href=\"Cross-realm%20zones\"&gt;cross realm zones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Connected%20Realms\"&gt;connected realms&lt;/a&gt;, and others). Each realm is a complete instance of the game world, but has its own player characters who are tied to that particular realm. You should pick your realm based on where your friends are situated, but if you're starting out alone there are some other aspects to consider in the decision.\nWhere are your friends playing?\nWith each character your create, you can only fully interact with people on the same &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;, and who are members of the same &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; (Horde vs Alliance) as your character. You may create characters on many different realms if you like, but they will not be able support each other (e.g. swapping gear, money, supplies). Being able to move low level gear or transfer gold from a higher character to a lower character can make a significant difference in how fast that lower level character gets up to speed. The in-game mail system limits you to only mailing players on your current realm, and faction membership. However, you may still play with friends that aren't on your realm by inviting them to join your party, you just won't be able to do some things with them, like send them mail or trade items with them.\nRemember, you are not forever locked into your realm decision. You can always start a new character on a different realm, and there is always the option of a paid &lt;a href=\"Character%20Transfer\"&gt;Character Transfer&lt;/a&gt;. For a fee, you may move a character to another realm. The character will be unplayable while the transfer occurs, and a character can only be moved once every 3 days. For example: You have two characters named Bob and Alice, and you choose to move Alice to a different realm. She is not playable for a short while during the move, and cannot be moved again for 3 days once the move has completed. However your second character (\"&lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;\"), Bob, remains fully playable and can moved to the same or even a different realm at your discretion. However, moving Bob would require a second payment.\nWhat is you primary language?\nRealms are divided up by which language is primarily spoken on them. While you will not be banned if you do not fluently speak the other languages on the realm, you may feel more comfortable on a realm where the majority of players speak a language that you understand. You might also be interested in learning a new language during your gameplay, so it will be helpful to interact virtually with foreigners. In the US servers players can find english, spanish and brazilian portuguese speaking realms. The european realms cover a wider variety of languages: german, russian, french, spanish, italian, portuguese, and english. Asian realms offer chinese and korean languages. Oceanic realms are mainly for english speakers.\n\"For a complete list of the realms and their language, &lt;a href=\"Realms%20list\"&gt;visit this page&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDo you enjoy roleplaying a character?\nRealms used to be divided into 4 categories: PvP, Normal, RP (Roleplay), and RPPvP; but with \"\" this division has ended. Although these categories are still present in \",\" the current version of the game only divides realms between 'Normal' and 'Roleplay' realms. If being immersed in a fantasy world and roleplaying your character is important, or interesting, to you - roleplaying realms should be considered..\n\"For more information about roleplaying, &lt;a href=\"Roleplaying\"&gt;visit this page&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWhat's your time zone?\nPlaying on a realm with a time zone similar to the one you live in means more people will be on around the time you're going to play \u2014 assuming you play during peak hours (which varies but is usually between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on the realm during weekdays). This affects the game in several ways, some of which may not be immediately apparent or affect you until you reach higher levels.\nA few of the ways your realm's time zone can affect your World of Warcraft experience:\nPeople who are usually unable to play during peak hours often try to play on a realm in a different time zone than the one they live in. If you tend to be available earlier than peak hours, you might want to look for a realm that is in a time zone earlier than where you live. Similarly, if you're usually available later than peak hours, you may wish to play on a realm that is in a time zone later than where you live. This will generally maximize the number of people who are around when you are also looking to play.\nWhat's the realm population?\nEach &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; has a population listed on the realm selection screen. Each realm is characterized as having Recommended, Low, Medium, High, and Full population. Recommended realms are realms that &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; feels will give a new player the best experience, while the rest are categorized based on how many players are currently logged into the realm. As these population figures may change throughout the day, you will want to decide on a realm at the time you would normally play, to ensure that the number accurately represents the population that you'll be playing with.\nYou cannot create a character on a Full realm unless you already have characters on that realm. Full realms are deemed 'full' by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; and as such, their 'full' status does not fluctuate like a 'high' population realm's might. There is no reason to wait until off-peak times to see if you will be allowed to create a character on a 'full' realm.\nFull and some High population realms will frequently have wait queues during peak hours. This means you cannot log in to the characters on that realm until other people have &lt;a href=\"etiquette\"&gt;completely logged off&lt;/a&gt; of that realm. \nEach type of realm has benefits and drawbacks for new players.\nAlthough having lots of other players around can be useful when looking for others to play with, it can also present some problems. On higher population realms, competition over resources such as herb and mining nodes is far higher, which can provide a frustrating experience, and players may even have trouble finding important quest mobs that haven't already been killed by other players. Additionally, the presence of so many players, especially in capital cities, can place a substantial strain on players' computers. Those with lower-end systems may experience considerable &lt;a href=\"lag\"&gt;lag&lt;/a&gt; and even frequent disconnections when surrounded by too many other players. In extreme cases, this can make the game almost unplayable for those with older or less powerful computers. Players with lower-end systems may therefore have an easier and less frustrating experience on lower population servers.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; occasionally introduces new realms. New realms, instead of displaying population display the \"New\" status, which means the realm has just recently been put online and characters will be lower levels on average and the population of course starts very low. This generally means less resource competition and also a small economy so trading at the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; will be reduced and prices will usually be quite a bit lower.\nWhen these new realms are first populated, paid character transfers from other realms are not allowed. Everyone starts at level 1, but after a relatively short time there will be many hardcore players at the level cap and the &lt;a href=\"endgame\"&gt;endgame&lt;/a&gt; will begin to pick up from there. Down the road, there is also the possibility of entire high level guilds transferring to the realm, giving it a real kick start. After six months, paid character transfers will be opened up to the realm.\nWhat is the Horde/Alliance breakdown?\nWhile most realms have a relatively even-matched ratio, on some realms there may be a larger number of players on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, or vice-versa. Imbalances in factions can be an issue for &lt;a href=\"PVP\"&gt;PVP&lt;/a&gt;, grouping up, or just trying to complete quests since sometimes you have to wait for quests to &lt;a href=\"Respawn%20Time\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt;. However, much of the importance of realm faction balance has been removed with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"cross-realm%20zone\"&gt;cross-realm zone&lt;/a&gt;s in most areas.\nSites like &lt;a href=\"http%3A//warcraftrealms.com\"&gt;WarcraftRealms.com&lt;/a&gt; show you the Horde/Alliance breakdown and other useful information (e.g. how many Horde players are online at 9pm) connected with choosing a realm. However, because these sites don't have access to official population numbers and rely on largely on player reporting (via add-ons), they are widely regarded (including by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;) as inaccurate. Blizzard does not publish official numbers, but its representatives have commented several times that the numbers on population-measurement sites like WarcraftRealms.com sometimes have little relationship to the actual active population.\n\"Your choice between Alliance and Horde would obviously depend on taste. See &lt;a href=\"Races\"&gt;Races&lt;/a&gt; for more information on each.\""}
{"id": "88807", "revid": "41592613", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=88807", "title": "Newbie guide/Quests", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Quests\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt; are the core of the World of Warcraft experience. From around level 10, you will almost always have a dozen active quests in your quest log. A lot of the time, if you're like many, your log will have the maximum of 25 quests in your log. It is good, however, to limit this as well as is reasonable, because others frequently have quests to share with you. The more of the group working on the same quest, the better, as you can all work to a common goal and you each know distinctly what that goal is.\nQuests are obtained from NPCs, from items in the world, or shared from party members. Not all quests can be shared, and there are many quest lines that you must follow from the beginning; you cannot skip within a quest line.\nIn your starting area, you will find some quests that are common to all, and for some classes, you will have some class-specific quests. All of these quests are good to start gaining experience. These often include killing low-level &lt;a href=\"creature\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;s in the area or speaking to one of the nearby &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s.\nYou can identify quest giving NPCs from the ! over his head. &lt;a href=\"Talk\"&gt;Talk&lt;/a&gt; to the quest giving NPC to get the quest. The giver of a quest you have yet to complete will have above his head a silver ?. When you complete the quest by meeting its requirements, the quest giver will have a ? over its head. These symbols will also appear on your &lt;a href=\"mini-map\"&gt;mini-map&lt;/a&gt; to help in navigation and discovering new quests.\nMost of your first 10 levels will come from &lt;a href=\"%23Obtaining%20and%20Completing%20Quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; and from monsters you kill as a part of doing quests. While a good group is a very good thing, if you find yourself in a &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; that wanders around killing non-quest monsters and doesn't seem to be working towards a quest, it may be better to go questing alone. Most frequently, groups involving different classes are much more effective than groups of only one class, or being solo. Also, in groups, players can share many quests with one another so that all of them can be doing the very same quest, and if the quest involves only killing monsters, each monster killed contributes to everyone's quest. If a quest involves picking up an item from one specific &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, all party members can pick it up at once.\nYou should always take the time to read the quest information. It will almost always tell you where to go in order to complete the quest objective, or occasionally tell you to check an item in your Inventory for detailed information regarding your objectives (quests that do not tell you where to go or what to do are few and far between)."}

In other words, you can leave your character resting in an inn for up to ten days without playing before you earn the maximum amount of rest state.\nYou also become rested while logged off in the wilderness, but only at 1/4 the normal rate. Be sure to log off at an inn or a major city whenever possible! And if you're at an inn, make sure you see the resting icon. It is usually a good idea to &lt;a href=\"hearth\"&gt;hearth&lt;/a&gt; back to the inn of your binding, if you can't run there quickly enough.\nTo set or change your bind point, talk to an innkeeper and click \"make this inn your home\".\nWhen you are about 5th or 6th level, you will receive quests to go to another town area. This town is where the first inn available to a new character is placed. Put another way, until you get your first 5 or 6 quests out of the way you will not happen across an inn and so you will have to 'camp out' when you logout, unless someone shows you where it is so that you can go there \"before\" you receive such a quest.

There are several reasons for this:\nTips for Grouping with Other Players.\nMobs will target whoever is highest on their &lt;a href=\"threat%20list\"&gt;threat list&lt;/a&gt;. This person is the one with &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;. When grouped in a party, you want this to be a tank (warrior, bear, paladin). Let the tank generate some &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; for a few seconds before you begin DPS, so that you don't pass the tank in &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; generation and pull &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;.\nItem drops come in two flavors, &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt; (BoE) and &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; (BoP). BoP items become &lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt; as soon as you loot them. When in a group, it's a good etiquette to pass on items that are an upgrade to other players. BoE items may be sold on the auction house, but they may be of more benefit to your party members than the gold you'd earn in selling them. Items that aren't usable by anyone in the party should be fair game for rolling on.\nIt's usually safe to follow these loot rules:\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Need%20before%20Greed\"&gt;Need before Greed&lt;/a&gt; page more more details.\nKnow which item &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; are important to you. Don't select \"need\" unless you have a good reason for why that item's attributes help you the most.\nChoose specialization over generalization. If you're not a tank and you're getting killed a lot, defensive stats won't help much. What \"will\" help is to level through the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, because it puts you behind a tank. When you're behind a tank, the stats you need are the ones that increase your &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20second\"&gt;damage per second&lt;/a&gt; or your ability to heal without running out of mana."}

See the &lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;Race&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Class\"&gt;Class&lt;/a&gt; pages for discussions of the different race and class options.\n&lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;Race&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe race you choose for your character determines their looks, voice, &lt;a href=\"starting%20area\"&gt;starting area&lt;/a&gt;, classes available, &lt;a href=\"racial%20traits\"&gt;racial traits&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; he or she will belong to (&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;).\nThere are many reasons to choose one race over another. While some dedicated players may select their race purely in order to gain a slight advantage in high-end play, others may choose their race based on looks, lore or personality. From tiny &lt;a href=\"gnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;gnomes&lt;/a&gt; to towering &lt;a href=\"tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, the way each race looks, feels, moves and sounds is quite unique, and it's worth taking the time to find one you really enjoy.\nIn terms of playing experience, the main difference between races is their racial traits, which while usually not game-changing in their importance, can at times be fun, helpful or even life-saving. There is a very slight (+/-3 points) &lt;a href=\"Attributes\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; difference based on race, but as your character increases in level, these differences become negligible.\nOne important note: The Alliance vs. Horde distinction is a very important one, as you will have very limited interaction with those on the opposing side outside of combat. If you're playing on a server with friends, you all want to be on the same side so that you can &lt;a href=\"chat\"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nPlayable races:\n&lt;a href=\"Class\"&gt;Class&lt;/a&gt;.\nCan't decide what class to play? Make one of each that sound interesting (you can have up to 11 characters per server), play them up to level 5-15 or so, and decide then. It only takes an hour or two to get the first few levels, and then you'll have a much better idea of what it's like to play each class. You may still miss out on the more significant parts of playing a class, as some important skills are given at level 20 or 30 for the first time, but you will get the gist of the class so that you can at least understand what higher level characters are talking about. You can also read the &lt;a href=\"Class\"&gt;description of each class&lt;/a&gt; to have a general idea of them.\nAn important factor to consider when choosing a class is whether there is going to be much demand for characters of your class in groups. Generally, &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Healer%20classes\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s are in higher demand than &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;s (commonly referred to as &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; classes). Therefore, if joining instance group/raid is your first priority, choosing classes that can &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; tank or healer may improve you chance of getting invited. Alternatively, while they are still very important to a group's success, the &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt; classes tend to carry less responsibility, and with it less blame in the event that a group is struggling to progress.\nFor those who want to be the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; in instances, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; are your choices. With the right gear and spec, they can have higher health and armor than the rest of the party. You can absorb large amounts of damage and prevent others from being attacked. Warriors, paladins, and death knights can wear &lt;a href=\"plate\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt; after level 40, which provide them with unequaled armor. Druids and monks can only wear &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt;. However, druids' &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; gives them a large amount of health and armor bonus. Monks have abilities allowing them to evade and mitigate much of the damage they receive.\nIf you want to &lt;a href=\"Healer%20classes\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; others, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; can be considered. In the right &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;, all of these classes can make a competent main healer. In addition, all of them provide useful buffs to the other members of the party. Paladins have blessings that they can cast on anyone that give different benefits. Shamans have &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt;s which buff party members near them, but they have very different benefits. Druids can increase the critical hit chance, spell critical chance, or amount of healing done to the entire party, in bear/cat form, moonkin form, or tree of life form, respectively. Priests' stamina buff is always useful to everyone.\nAll classes can be &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;s with the right gear and spec. However, there are four classes that are pure damage dealers: &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Mages excel at dealing massive magical damage to their enemy. Their powerful &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; damage is helpful in many encounters. Warlocks have abilities to &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; which will do the player's bidding. They are famous for their &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; spells. Rogues have stealth abilities and can deal high &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; damage. Hunters are the only ranged class in game that do mainly physical damage. They can tame &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s to help them in a fight, as well as put down various traps to help the party. Depending on their spec, they can also boost their party members' damage output in different ways.\nTo see what the population for each class is on a given server (or all servers) for one faction or another, see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warcraftrealms.com/weeklyactivity.php%3Fserverid%3D-1%26amp%3Bfactionid%3D3\"&gt;Warcraft Realms&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Please be aware that these numbers are regarded by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; as highly inaccurate, and should be used as a loose guide at best.\"\nName.\nPicking a name can be tricky. Nearly everyone wants something unique, awe-inspiring and/or \"cool\". However, the name you pick does tell others something about \"you\". \nKeep in mind that your name needs to be easily typable in conversations, and that it probably shouldn't clash too much with the warcraft/medieval themed environment. Names that you probably shouldn't pick include:\nOn &lt;a href=\"RP\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RP-PvP\"&gt;RP-PvP&lt;/a&gt; realms there are additional naming policies active. They can be found at the official Naming Policy page (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/support/en/article/naming-policy\"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;, \"no equivalent on US sites\") under the title \"Only applied on Roleplaying Servers\" and at the official Roleplaying Realms Policy page (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/policy/roleplaying.html\"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml%3FarticleId%3D20458%26amp%3BsearchQuery%3Droleplaying%2520policy%26amp%3BpageNumber%3D1\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;). If your name is considered inappropriate (even if it would be okay on a non-RP server), you may be forced to change it.\nPicking something unobtrusive that actually sounds like a name is usually your best bet. Your name doesn't have to be cool to make you cool. You make your name cool by who you are and what you do; WoW may be \"massively\" multi-player, but the core population of any given server is really only a couple hundred players. Rumors, names and stories of feats do travel quickly.\nTry using the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.stratics.com/content/features/name/\"&gt;stratics.com WoW name generator&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.xenoveritas.org/namegen.shtml\"&gt;xenoveritas.org random name generator&lt;/a&gt;!\nCan't decide on a name? Try &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.behindthename.com\"&gt;BehindTheName.com&lt;/a&gt;.\nGender.\nLastly, you can choose your gender, male or female, when creating a new character. Functionally, there is no difference between a male or female character. The only in-game differences are the appearance, animation and speech. (As a rule of thumb of playing WoW as well as any other MMORPG, do not assume the gender of anyone by the look of him/her!)\n\"Note: rarely, male Tauren warrior tanks' larger hit box may cause problem in certain fights, e.g.&lt;a href=\"Halazzi\"&gt;Halazzi&lt;/a&gt;, but this can easily be solved by better positioning.\""}

Don't forget to pick a profession and skill it up as much as you can in the early levels. Trying to max out your profession after you hit a very high level (60+) is a tedious and very undesirable process. As you go up in level, both the quest rewards and the money from mobs increase, as a general rule. Also, &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs drop &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; for more cash per kill than any of the beast type mobs who aren't quest-related. Upon completion of a quest at your maximum level (60 before, 70 after The Burning Crusade, and 80 in Wrath of the Lich King) you receive a monetary reward instead of experience. The same rules apply, you get more money if the quest was more difficult.\nEffective use of the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; can be a very lucrative source of income even for low level characters. Many experienced and wealthy players wish to experiment with crafting professions on lower level characters, but they don't want to go through the trouble of gathering the materials in newbie zones. Therefore, you might be surprised by how much you can charge for non-gray items that drop off of low level mobs. &lt;a href=\"Chunk_of_Boar_Meat\"&gt;Boar meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"linen%20cloth\"&gt;linen cloth&lt;/a&gt; can net you a lot more money than normal questing. In addition, consider picking up two out of the three gathering professions (&lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"herbalism\"&gt;herbalism&lt;/a&gt;) in order to sell the material.\nLearning a crafting profession is more fun for many players than gathering, but making money with crafts can be more difficult. Raw materials (&lt;a href=\"skin\"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s) will often sell for more money than finished products that you can create with a tradeskill (&lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, and other items). You can search the auction house to discover how much is a reasonable rate to charge for your items. Remember that prices can change as a response to supply and demand, so it is possible to improve your profits by holding onto your products and timing the market.\nIn addition, there are always the &lt;a href=\"Chat%23Basic_Chat_Channels\"&gt;Trade Channel&lt;/a&gt; (only in &lt;a href=\"City\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; (which appear in all racial capital cities, including &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; for Horde and &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance) where you can hawk your wares.

{"id": "171784", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=171784", "title": "Newbie instance guide", "text": "Characters typically experience their first &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; between the levels of 10 and 30. This guide is written specifically to help newer players of any level prepare for their first instance experience, and to make it as enjoyable and trouble-free as possible. \nIf you are a more experienced player wanting to learn how groups work together, make sure you check out the &lt;a href=\"Instance%20grouping%20guide\"&gt;Instance grouping guide&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbout Instances.\nAn \"instance\" is a dungeon that the game creates just for you and your &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;, so that you are not intruded upon by anyone else in your realm. This personal instance starts when you enter a blue\u2020 &lt;a href=\"instance%20portal\"&gt;instance portal&lt;/a&gt;, which is often already located inside a cave or dungeon. Almost all of the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s in an instance are elite, and the &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"quest%20reward\"&gt;quest reward&lt;/a&gt;s are better than those obtained through &lt;a href=\"Soloing\"&gt;solo play&lt;/a&gt;, though they are somewhat more difficult and require teamwork to achieve.\nFor some players, &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; is all about instances, whereas some players only do them when the mood strikes them, or when they have dungeon quests. Since doing an instance is not a requirement for leveling a character, some players go all the way to 70 without setting foot inside one. Still, if you want to try one out, it is suggested to try the low-level ones first, as that is when all party members are learning how to play their class (in group settings, at least) so you may feel more comfortable.\n\u2020 Portals come in other colors, but blue means parties of no more than 5 characters. Lower-level characters are unlikely to start in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; instances.\nGameplay Differences.\nJust for your party. Instances are large, multi-room areas (sometimes with scripted events) that the game has generated only for the use of your party. You will never find another party already in the instance ahead of you, because walking through the portal creates a special run just for the party.\nDeath is also handled differently. When you &lt;a href=\"die\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt; in an instance and &lt;a href=\"Release%20Spirit\"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"ghost%23After_death_in_World_of_Warcraft\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;, you release to a &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt; out in the &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; the instance is located in. You then run back to the instance portal as a ghost. You are brought back to life the moment you step back into that portal\u2014\"not to where &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;your body was lying&lt;/a&gt;\". It is for this reason that you should not release until you are sure no one will &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt; you. Because of this, you should pay attention to the way to the instance portal as you go with the group, so if you do have to run back from the graveyard as a ghost you don't get lost.\nA note about running away: Your natural instinct when you cannot shake a mob is to run away; however the mobs in an instance are designed differently than their outside counterparts: They never give up the chase until you are either dead, or have zoned out of the instance altogether. Counterintuitive as it may seem, your single best tactic is to run towards the tank. (There's more on Tanks in the next section.) This lets the tank pick up the loose mob, and off of you. Once you get to the tank, stay in one place to make it easier for the tank to target the mobs attacking you.\nGroup roles.\nA balanced party typically consists of:\n&lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypically a &lt;a href=\"Bear%20form\"&gt;Bear form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, the tank's job is to keep the attention of the mobs on themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypically a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, paladin, druid, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; or monk, a healer stands out of harm's way in the back and heals the group (primarily the tank). \n&lt;a href=\"Damage%20dealer\"&gt;Damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;s or \"DPS\".\nDamage dealers or \"DPS\" are those players who focus on dealing damage. \"This is everyone else not healing or tanking.\" The trick is to deal a large amount of &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;damage per second&lt;/a&gt; \"but not so much as to get the mob more interested in themselves than the tank\". Any class can choose to &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; for the damage-dealing role. \nMore knowledgeable groups can also assign &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; tasks for multi-&lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; fights. These tasks usually fall to one of the DPS members like a mage to &lt;a href=\"polymorph\"&gt;polymorph&lt;/a&gt; (also known as \"sheep\"), a hunter to &lt;a href=\"hunter%20trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;, or a rogue for &lt;a href=\"sap\"&gt;sap&lt;/a&gt;. The plus of doing this is if you are attacking a group of four mobs, and the mage &lt;a href=\"polymorph\"&gt;polymorph&lt;/a&gt;s one into a sheep, you only have to worry about attacking \"three\" mobs for 20\u201330 seconds. Damage breaks most of these crowd control methods though, so don't use abilities that attack multiple opponents while using crowd control.\nNote: The skills used to tank and heal are counterintuitive to solo play. It's an entirely different experience to try to keep things attacking you (and it's not as easy as it would seem), and it might seem dull or unimportant to stand in the back of the party to keep people alive. However, tanking and healing are the two most important tasks for a successful instance; if either is missing, the group cannot succeed. \nBecause the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; limit is five players (low instances will accept &lt;a href=\"raids\"&gt;raids&lt;/a&gt; of ten, but in those cases you cannot complete quests), there is usually one tank, one healer and three DPS. However if any of the other three have the ability to switch roles, they should be prepared to tank or heal in a pinch should the need arise.\nIf you are asked to tank, heal, or DPS.\nIf you are asked to be the healer, stay back, far behind the tank\u2014but close enough you can reach the tank with your healing spells. Use skills that &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; to keep people topped off and save big heals for when health bars go very far down. The healer, more than anyone, realizes how important it is for the tank to attract attention\u2014it means only having to worry about healing one person most of the time. Tell those in your party to try to keep in range and in sight so they can get your heals. Learn to use your defensive (like &lt;a href=\"Bear%20form\"&gt;Bear form&lt;/a&gt; for druids or for priests) or threat-reducing abilities (like &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt; for priests) for when a mob turns its attention from the tank toward you, since healing can generate a large amount of threat from mobs that are unhappy at seeing the health of their target (the tank) continue to stay up.\nIf you are asked to be the tank use any skills you have that increase your armor and cause a high amount of \"&lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;\" (usually listed in the tooltip; also known as &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hate\"&gt;hate&lt;/a&gt;). You may have never used these abilities before because in solo play you don't have to worry about keeping mobs on yourself. Make sure to keep in range and sight of the healer.\nIf you are asked to provide DPS try to wait a few seconds for the tank to build up threat. Learn any good defensive (&lt;a href=\"evasion\"&gt;evasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;s) or threat-reducing skills (&lt;a href=\"Cower\"&gt;Cower&lt;/a&gt; in druid &lt;a href=\"Cat%20form\"&gt;Cat form&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disengage\"&gt;Disengage&lt;/a&gt; for hunters, or &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt; for rogues) you might have for when a mob turns its attention from the tank toward you. If you use mostly ranged attacks, try to keep as far-ranged as possibly. Rogues should use &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt; to reduce threat or &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; (if they have it) if their &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; is up.\nReal Life issues.\nBefore you go about finding an instance group, try to make sure to set aside about two hours of undisturbed time, which is typical for a normal party (it may take shorter or longer depending on your particular situation). Few things frustrate other players more than someone agreeing to run an instance and then getting called offline for something they knew they had to do. If you do start an instance with a limited amount of time, tell the group right away. Also keep in mind that it can take a varying amount of time to gather a complete group in the first place, then get everyone to the instance portal.\nMost party members are understanding if you have to step away from the computer from time to time for &lt;a href=\"Real%20Life\"&gt;real-life&lt;/a&gt; issues. If you do need to briefly step away to get a drink, use the restroom, change the baby, and so on, make sure you let the group know by typing \"&lt;a href=\"AFK\"&gt;AFK&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"BRB\"&gt;BRB&lt;/a&gt;\", so they don't go back into combat a person short. If you find yourself repeatedly getting called away during an instance to the detriment of the party's progress, offer to leave so the group can find a replacement.\nFinding a group.\nThe Dungeon Finder.\nThe best way is to use the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; tool. In the past people had to ask in the Trade Channel in major cities or ask their guild, but since December of 2009 the dungeon finder has made it easy for everyone to find a dungeon group.\nWhat the Dungeon Finder does is assembles a group and teleports them into the dungeon. These people are not limited to your own server, but to your specific server's &lt;a href=\"battlegroup\"&gt;battlegroup&lt;/a&gt; (which is a group of about 15-20 different servers), meaning there is a much bigger pool of players to pick from. Prior to the dungeon finder, it wasn't unheard of to spend longer looking for a group on your server than to actually run an instance.\nTo use the Dungeon Finder:\n1: Select the role(s) you wish to play. \n2: With the pull-down menu, you can select a random dungeon in your level range, or choose one or more specific dungeons.\n3: When you are satisfied with the options you have selected, press \"Find Group\"\n4: A green \"eye\" icon will be on your minimap now, letting you know you are in the queue.\n5: When the dungeon is ready you will get a pop-up. \nThere are a few things that will remove you from the queue. If this happens, when you requeue you will be \"sent back to the end of the line\", and anyone who queued up after you did will get precedence. These happen automatically - you do not get an \"are you sure?\" option.\nSO, if you have a long wait ahead of you, remember that you are in the queue before joining a group!\nA few things to know:\nHistory.\nPrevious to the Dungeon Finder players had to ask/beg in chat channels and zones, get a group together and then travel to the specific instance. When a player left in the middle of a group, someone had to go out and locate another, then bring them to the group. It was a real pain at times, especially for players with limited time.\nLoot Rules.\nWhen there is loot of green quality and above in a party, the rolling window comes up:\nThe high-roller among those who roll is awarded the item, and it goes in that character's backpack. If their backpack is full, that person, and only that person, may loot it by clicking on the monster's corpse after first clearing up space.\nMost loot from bosses is Bind on Pickup, though, and this tends to be the best loot. Always roll greed or disenchant on items from bosses you have no way to use for yourself. Pay attention to if an item is more of use to the healer, tank, or damage dealer than yourself.\nBe aware that other players will expect you to specialize in your chosen role as much as possible, even if that makes it almost impossible to do quests alone. Once you reach level 15 and can use the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, you can level steadily without doing quests at all, and many players get most of their XP from dungeons. If you have &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Talent%20Specialization\"&gt;Dual Talent Specialization&lt;/a&gt; and want an item for the spec you're not currently in, ask the other players for permission to \"need off-spec\".\nGeneral Guidelines.\nMost of these are laid out in the &lt;a href=\"Instance%20grouping%20guide\"&gt;Instance grouping guide&lt;/a&gt;, but here's a quick version:\nThe Level 15-30 Instances.\nThese are the available instances for the 15-30 character."}

Thorngrin the Tender makes sure that &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s botanists have the power and essence they need to reveal the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s secrets, even if that means untold numbers of living creatures must be sacrificed to obtain it.\"\nFight.\nBefore engaging Thorngrin, his room must be cleared. There are two pulls of four demons and a Channeler; although it seems like they pull together, you can actually pull the demons separately if you wait until the Channeler walks forward towards Thorngrin (just wait until the buff wears off of them, or you'll be in a world of hurt.)\nThere are also two stealthed satyrs who patrol in the next room (as you go towards Laj). They should be killed before fighting Thorngrin, as you can easily aggro them by mistake if they have patrolled close to the boss.\nAlternate LOS Strategy.\nThe goal of this strategy is to keep everyone in the party out of line of sight, so that Thorngrin never uses his Sacrifice. Tank should wear DPS and fire resist gear, hybrid classes should go heal mode. Rogues can take a nap. The party stands in the hallway outside the demons' room. The tank pulls Thorngrin up the ramp, positioning him just outside of line of sight, west of the doorway. The tank stands in the doorway, in line of sight of healers. Tank supplies almost all the DPS on this fight; ranged AoE classes can drop AoE in the doorway and hit Thorngrin with it. Just heal through the Hellfires and Enrages.\nIf the positioning is right, Thorngrin will occasionally turn to party members and try to cast Sacrifice, but will never be able to.\nStraight Tanking (Heroic).\nThis method works best with 3 ranged DPS. Tank the boss in the middle of the room so his AoE is out of the range of the first step of the stairs where the boss spawned. Have your DPS and healer standing on the step. During the fight the tank need to watch when the boss randomly chooses a party member to Sacrifice. After the sacrifice is started, the boss will randomly aggro on another DPS/healer; that is when the tank needs to use the taunt ability to bring the boss back to the middle of the room before he does his AoE (the tank stays inside the AoE). If the taunt is a bit late, DPS can move back up the boss' stairs a bit to avoid the AoE. Resume original position after AoE. Sacrifice is not a big problem with this method, but requires the tank to be precise on when to use his taunt."}

{"id": "564906", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=564906", "title": "Thornspeakers", "text": "The Thornspeakers are a group of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s located in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally founded by the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; druids, who did not agree with &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Drust\"&gt;war against the human settlers&lt;/a&gt;, and left Drust society. Druidism used to be the old ways of the Drust before the days of Tul, whose ways the Thornspeakers consider to have brought disgrace upon the Drust. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt;, the High Thornspeaker and last of the Drust druids.\nDescription.\nThe Thornspeakers are not so different from other druids. They are guardians of balance, and keepers of the cycle. To them, &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; is a part of nature just as &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; is. Most people seem to be wary of them. They have few relics remaining, some of which are runes carved on wooden plaques. The Thornspeakers cannot throw away their lives, for as long as the trees stand so must they. They know how to disrupt the magic in the core of &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;Drust construct&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe wolf &lt;a href=\"Greenstalker\"&gt;Greenstalker&lt;/a&gt; was an ally of the Thornspeakers. The deer &lt;a href=\"Athair\"&gt;Athair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athainne\"&gt;Athainne&lt;/a&gt; blessed the ancient Drust druids.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the Thornspeakers were a &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; organization. Druidism was the old ways of the Drust, from before the time of &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;. But not all of the Drust agreed to &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Drust\"&gt;wage war against the human settlers&lt;/a&gt; thousands of years ago. A thornspeaker known as &lt;a href=\"Sef%20Iwen\"&gt;Sef Iwen&lt;/a&gt; spoke out against it, believing it to be unnecessary and that the Drust and Humanity could live in harmony. Given an ultimatum, to attack the humans or to live in the woods forever, Sef chose the latter; believing Tul simply meant to exile her. Instead, she was murdered by Gorak Tul and her soul torn from her body then shackled to the remains; forcing her to live as a spirit forever in the woods that would eventually become the &lt;a href=\"Glenbrook%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Glenbrook Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, her death meant as an example to those who would seek to work with the humans. This, amongst the other atrocities that Gorak Tul would commit against the humans, eventually led to Sef's fellow Thornspeakers rebelling against Gorak Tul and aiding the humans. This led the Thornspeakers to leave the Drust and join Kul Tiran society. Some of the humans' descendants heard the call of the wilds and sought to learn the ancient ways, which the Thornspeakers taught them. Now Ulfar is the only Drust Thornspeaker left.\nThe Thornspeakers once tended to Drustvar as kin of the trees, but that age has long since passed. However, there are a few who have not forgotten that path. &lt;a href=\"Ashenwood%20Grove\"&gt;Ashenwood Grove&lt;/a&gt; was home to two Thornspeakers, &lt;a href=\"Morwin%20Gladeheart\"&gt;Morwin Gladeheart&lt;/a&gt; and his student &lt;a href=\"Amalie%20Oakseeker\"&gt;Amalie Oakseeker&lt;/a&gt;, until the &lt;a href=\"fungarian\"&gt;fungarian&lt;/a&gt; attacked and covered it in spores.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Thornspeakers sensed the activation of ancient powers in &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Koval\"&gt;Gol Koval&lt;/a&gt; and moved to fight it. They banded with the &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s for mutual protection.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; sought to save her daughter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt; and the grip of Gorak Tul, &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; directed an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to Ulfar and the Thornspeakers. Ulfar at first did not want to aid them for he felt the door to the Blighted Lands should remain closed, but an attack from Gorak Tul made Ulfar realize that Thros was already open and its denizens no longer confined to their own realm.\nThey later assisted the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; by aiding &lt;a href=\"Zallestrasza\"&gt;Zallestrasza&lt;/a&gt; in protecting the green dragon &lt;a href=\"Vadekius\"&gt;Vadekius&lt;/a&gt; at his final resting place from &lt;a href=\"Danir%20Emberlight\"&gt;Danir Emberlight&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina Proudmoore commissioned &lt;a href=\"Dorian%20Atwater\"&gt;Dorian Atwater&lt;/a&gt; to build a &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;special ship&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Wood for the vessel was sourced from the &lt;a href=\"Algerson%20Lumber%20Yard\"&gt;Algerson Lumber Yard&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, though the shipment needed to first be purified of dark influence with the aid of the Thornspeakers. Ulfar succeeded in cleansing the wood at their request and sent the Thornspeakers to &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; to further aid in the vessel's construction. Ulfar himself later made an appearance at &lt;a href=\"Port%20Fogtide\"&gt;Port Fogtide&lt;/a&gt; for the ship's blessing.\nShadowlands.\nTo save the &lt;a href=\"sylvar\"&gt;sylvar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gweyir\"&gt;Gweyir&lt;/a&gt; from a Drust curse, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; is told by &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to work with Ulfar, who she once knew. Ulfar directs the adventurer to his long-dead former teacher &lt;a href=\"Kivarr\"&gt;Kivarr&lt;/a&gt; with a fetish that contains Gorak Tul's power, who after saving her agrees to help but requires additional reagents, including a plant called &lt;a href=\"nox%20root\"&gt;nox root&lt;/a&gt; that only grows in Drust corrupted soil, and some other reagents from Ardenweald. Reagents from the Shadowlands are necessary in attempting to break a Drust curse. However, this was rendered moot as &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt;'s power was too great, thereby ensuring that there was no way to save those possessed by the Drust."}

The collected data was later uploaded to the website of the same name, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/\"&gt;Thottbot.com&lt;/a&gt;, either automatically or manually. The uploaded data available on the site was used for many applications such as finding &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s that you need to complete a certain quest, items that you might have to retrieve, or even the drop rate of items from different monsters. Thottbot was owned by Affinity Media through the ZAM Network.\nThottbot was drastically changed in December 2010 when ZAM Network decided to \"merge\" it with &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;, which is also owned by ZAM. The change consisted of deleting all data on Thottbot, having it load all data from Wowhead instead. This included the deletion of accounts, screenshots, comments, and forums so far posted on Thottbot. In order to post new comments, users will have to sign up an account on Wowhead. \nWhile ZAM explained that their goal was to \"improve the data available to the Thottbot community while retaining the Thottbot styling, navigation and community\", the merge has caused Wowhead and Thottbot to technically be the same page with two different names and layouts. Some former users of Thottbot have criticized the merge as having ruined Thottbot, along with general World of Warcraft history, as several years' data was lost in the process.\nOn November 16, 2016, Thottbot was discontinued, and for a while, the url would redirect to wowhead.com, before the redirect was taken down aswell."}

In the east, the canyon opens up to what was once the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge&lt;/a&gt; is located. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the area was fairly peaceful for a &lt;a href=\"contested\"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt; territory and was considered to have its own harsh beauty. However, the entire zone was flooded in the Shattering and is now in turmoil.\nMany residents, such as the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; clans, have been wiped out entirely. The iconic &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lift\"&gt;Great Lift&lt;/a&gt; has been destroyed, while the Alliance outpost of &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; border has been flooded and its residents moved to higher ground. Meanwhile the &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Pirates\"&gt;Southsea Pirates&lt;/a&gt; have gained a foothold in &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Holdfast\"&gt;Southsea Holdfast&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt; controls several areas formerly of little interest or inaccessible altogether. The Horde forces of &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; and the new &lt;a href=\"Westreach%20Summit\"&gt;Westreach Summit&lt;/a&gt; are now in a struggle for survival.\nEven after the Shattering, most of the towering spires have camps, sometimes even entire towns built on them. The twisting rock tower needles were cut and sharpened over centuries by water.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quentin\"&gt;Quentin&lt;/a&gt; has speculated that the drastic difference in climate between the arid Thousand Needles and the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; jungle is the result of strange magic.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe high mesas of the Thousand Needles are home to a large number of tauren. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren of &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; fought back against local &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; in the southeast part of the region were the home of the world-famous &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Racetrack\"&gt;Mirage Racetrack&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s raced their respective rocket cars in order to settle the question of which race had better engineering\u2014at least until the next race.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, the area was invaded by the armies of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s return, the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; flooded this zone, turning the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; into a lake called the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Deep\"&gt;Shimmering Deep&lt;/a&gt;. Wreckage of the speedway can be found scattered throughout the area. &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20Brassbolts\"&gt;Fizzle Brassbolts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pozzik\"&gt;Pozzik&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; respectively, built &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Deep\"&gt;Shimmering Deep&lt;/a&gt;. Although they did work together to create this mishmash island, the passive hostility between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; at the Speedbarge causes frequent bar fights.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s attacked the Needles, especially the home of the Grimtotem tribe, forcing &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; ask the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; for help.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Southsea Pirates and the Grimtotem tauren continue to attack, and it is a struggle for the Horde to keep its footing in the area. When &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; were visiting the area, they had to be careful not to be spotted by Grimtotem scouts. While there, Zekhan gathered &lt;a href=\"%3Aliferoot\"&gt;:liferoot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3Astranglekelp\"&gt;:stranglekelp&lt;/a&gt;, and encountered wild wyverns.\nGetting there.\nThousand Needles is accessible on foot from &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; in the west, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; in the south, and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in the north. Most players wishing to quest in this area will be sent here through bread crumb quests and be given a free flight from &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe path between Thousand Needles and the Barrens is currently overrun with quilboar, having been pushed to the brink of annihilation between the Alliance and Horde persecution and &lt;a href=\"Mankrik\"&gt;Mankrik&lt;/a&gt;'s retribution. These mobs are relatively low level for the surrounding zones (in the 20s), so the path is not difficult to clear. Although the Great Lift has been ruined, there is plenty of water to cushion the fall for those interested in traveling by foot. Bear in mind, of course, the reduced mount speed in water will make travel annoyingly slow. It is best to follow the prescribed quests unless one has a flying mount.\nGeography.\nThousand Needles contains one dungeon, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel hubs.\nThere are only two flight paths in Thousand Needles, one is the Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"Westreach%20Summit\"&gt;Westreach Summit&lt;/a&gt; and the other is the flight path on &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge&lt;/a&gt;. However, Alliance travelers can use the nearby &lt;a href=\"New%20Thalanaar\"&gt;New Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; flight path to the west to help them navigate the zone.\nNotable characters.\nThe Thousand Needles are home to several characters of note. At Freewind Post, &lt;a href=\"Cliffwatcher%20Longhorn\"&gt;Cliffwatcher Longhorn&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in the battle against the evil Grimtotem Clan. At the Weathered Nook, &lt;a href=\"Dorn%20Plainstalker\"&gt;Dorn Plainstalker&lt;/a&gt; attempts to teach members of the Horde about Faith, Endurance, and Strength. Where &lt;a href=\"Kravel%20Koalbeard\"&gt;Kravel Koalbeard&lt;/a&gt; once sent bold adventurers around the world in search items that will give him personal gain in his bets at the gnome and goblin races at &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20Brassbolts\"&gt;Fizzle Brassbolts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pozzik\"&gt;Pozzik&lt;/a&gt; now have &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;their boat&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nAll quests in the zone are level 40-45. There is a neutral quest hub on &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge&lt;/a&gt;, but overall the Horde is favored much as it was pre-\"Cataclysm\".\nIn the RPG.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the region of the Thousand Needles was a river canyon, the spires of sandstone shaped from years of rushing water. Water flowed to the sea from a large lake to the east, fed by an underground tributary. Then came the demons and the destruction that threw the entire world into upheaval. The canyon was thrust above the water table; the eastern lake dried up and became a vast salt flat and Thousand Needles became a sandy gorge. Thousand Needles rises south of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and serves as a channel to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; to the west or the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; Desert to the South.\nThe long canyon stands as a natural divide between central and southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.

To the east of Thousand Needles, the canyon opened into a large, dry lakebed known as the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; prior to the massive flooding. This dried-out salt flat was actually below sea level. At its center stood an alkaline lake with ten times the salt of any ocean.

{"id": "14037", "revid": "41339159", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14037", "title": "Thousand Needles (Classic)", "text": "Thousand Needles (aka The Thousand Needles) is a huge dry canyon in Southern Kalimdor, filled with towering mesas. In the east, the canyon opens up to the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt;, a vast salt pan that is used by Goblin and Gnomish engineers for their races. Despite being relatively barren, the area has its own harsh beauty, and the sunrise seen from either &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; or one of the mesas around &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; can be spectacular. The &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; are also worth visiting for their surreal, lonely atmosphere.\nAlthough as a &lt;a href=\"contested\"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt; territory this area doesn't see anywhere near as much action as some, &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; is a favorite stealth ganking spot for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; rogues due to the many Horde quests there as well as the relative difficulty of the mobs/remoteness of that location. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; also tend to attack the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lift\"&gt;Great Lift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; fairly regularly. In addition, players questing on the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; near the Tanaris border are advised to look over their shoulder from time to time, as the unwary can occasionally find themselves being stabbed in the back by a passing member of the opposing faction.\nHistory.\nBefore the great Sundering, the region of Thousand Needles was a river canyon, the spires of sandstone shaped from years of rushing water. Water flowed to the sea from a large lake to the east, fed by an underground tributary. Then came the demons and the destruction that threw the entire world into upheaval. The canyon was thrust above the water table; the eastern lake dried into a vast salt flat and Thousand Needles became a sandy gorge. Thousand Needles rises south of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and serves as a channel to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; to the west or the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; Desert to the South. It also connects to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. The long canyon stands as a natural divide between central and southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The realm gets its name from the dozens of giant, cylindrical columns of sandstone that rise from the bottom of the canyon like a forest. Bridges have been constructed atop many of the spires, connecting pathways across the canyon from one side of the surrounding mountains to the other. To the east of Thousand Needles, the canyon opens into a large, dry lakebed. This dried-out salt flat is actually below sea level. At its center stands an alkaline lake with ten times the salt of any ocean. The sere region is so hot, dry and salty that few creatures venture here. Lizards, scorpions, vultures, and birds of prey are not uncommon and neither are centaur war bands. A contingent of goblins mines for oil in the &lt;a href=\"Scorched%20Basin\"&gt;Scorched Basin&lt;/a&gt;. The spire bridges allow travelers to traverse the canyon without running into the barbaric centaur who patrol the canyon floor. The bridges are not entirely safe, however, as birds of prey will attack the unwary. Larger birds have even sabotaged the bridges from time to time. There is very little of interest in this land, unless someone has a passion for salt or sandstone... or oil.\nThe barren canyons of Thousand Needles have traditionally been the territory of several &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribes. The Tauren were forced to live precariously on the tips of the high mesas in order to avoid the large tribes of &lt;a href=\"Centaur\"&gt;Centaur&lt;/a&gt; that almost wiped them out. Now, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren are fighting back against their enemies, including the fanatical &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; Tribe. The &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast are also the home of the world famous Mirage Racetrack, where &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s race their respective rocket cars in order to permanently settle the question of which race has better engineering.\nIt is suspected that ages ago Thousand Needles was once a small inland sea, or perhaps even an inlet of the Great Sea. This explains the salt flat as well as why there are so many \"needle\"-like mesas (once possibly islands). The cause for the sea's evaporation could be attributed to the sundering, which tore the ancient Kalimdor cleanly in two. A catastrophe such as this could easily have caused climate change.\nAnother theory states that a river with its source in &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, possibly &lt;a href=\"Wildwind%20Lake\"&gt;Wildwind Lake&lt;/a&gt;, flowed into the area that would become Thousand Needles. The river cut through the earth, carving the canyon and shaping the dramatic pinnacles that became the Thousand Needles. It was a verdant, forested land. The river emptied into a large inland sea in the east. When the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; occurred, the course of the river was altered and ceased to flow through what would become Thousand Needles. The forests died and the fertile soil became orange dust. The inland sea, without its source of water, evaporated, leaving behind a vast salt flat.\nIt has also been thought by &lt;a href=\"Falfindel%20Waywarder\"&gt;Falfindel Waywarder&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; that dark magic of some kind blighted the land.\nGeography.\nThousand Needles contains no dungeons, raid dungeons, micro dungeons, or battlegrounds.\nTravel hubs.\nThere is only one flight path in Thousand Needles, and that is Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt;. However, Alliance travelers can use the nearby &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; flight path to the west, and the flight path in neutral &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; to the south to navigate the zone.\nNotable characters.\nThe Thousand Needles are home to several characters of note. At Freewind Post, &lt;a href=\"Cliffwatcher%20Longhorn\"&gt;Cliffwatcher Longhorn&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in the battle against the evil Grimtotem Clan. At the Weathered Nook, &lt;a href=\"Dorn%20Plainstalker\"&gt;Dorn Plainstalker&lt;/a&gt; attempts to teach members of the Horde about Faith, Endurance, and Strength. And at the Mirage Raceway, &lt;a href=\"Kravel%20Koalbeard\"&gt;Kravel Koalbeard&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers around the world in search items that will give him personal gain in his bets at the gnome and goblin races.\nQuests.\nHorde quests in Thousand Needles begin around level 25 and go through level 35. Neutral quests at the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; begin around level 30 and continue to level 35. Some of the neutral quests that send players out of the zone continue all the way up to level 45. Notable quest chains include and , both neutral and available at the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt;."}

If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the as to your reasoning.\nHorde Questing Guide (LVL 25-35).\nThough &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players can make use of the extensive questing available in the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt;, an area in eastern &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, there are many quests offered over the rest of the zone that are only available to &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; characters. This section of the guide targets those &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; characters, and is appropriate for levels 25-35. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players should skip to the later section, the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20questing%20guide%23Neutral_Questing_Guide_.28LVL_30-33.29\"&gt;neutral questing guide&lt;/a&gt;, designed for the low 30s. The neutral area continues to offer quests that head out of this zone up until the mid 40s, but those quests will only briefly be covered in this guide.\nBefore You Leave.\nBefore heading to &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, it would be a good idea to pick up a few prerequisites and pull quests for a little extra XP.\nRunning Around.\nThese early &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; quests are a collection of random errands that even a level 25 character can easily do.\nArikara Preparations.\nBefore you move on to &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, you need to complete these two quests.\nDarkcloud Pinnacle.\nFor this section, it would be very useful to have a small group (no more than 2-3 would be needed). The &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; come in groups and tend to swarm. However, it is possible to solo these quests at level 29.\nHighperch.\nNow it's time to visit &lt;a href=\"Highperch\"&gt;Highperch&lt;/a&gt;.\nGroup Quests.\nThe remaining quests in this part of the Needles are best done with a group. &lt;a href=\"Steelsnap%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Steelsnap (quest)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Endurance\"&gt;Test of Endurance&lt;/a&gt; are both technically solo quests, but are more difficult than the norm. A group of 3-4 would be best, though 2 will probably suffice.\nTidying Up.\nThe final steps before moving to the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; include:\nBefore moving on to the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt;, you should be around level 30.\nShimmering Flats.\nThe Horde quests of the Shimmering Flats are best suited for level 35 players, so it is likely you will need to level a bit between the other Horde quests of Thousand Needles and these. The neutral quests available from &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; in the Shimmering Flats could be useful for this purpose.\nTo obtain the Horde quests for the Shimmering Flats, players need to begin in the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeutral Questing Guide (LVL 30-33).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; are a prime questing hub for the low 30s, and continue to offer quests that head out of this zone until the mid 40s. Both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players often partake of these quests at the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt;. As this is one of the first contested zones many players will encounter, it is a place where many new players on PvP servers test their skills.\nMirage Raceway.\nUpon arrival at the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, players will be confronted by a large number of available quests.\nFurther Questing.\nFurther questing from the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; sends players out of the zone. There are a few stand-alone or short-chain quests - these include:\nIn addition, two lengthy quest chains originate at the Raceway, both of which send players all over the world on various errands. See and for more information.\nWhere to go from here.\nAfter this point, most zones become equally viable for both Horde and Alliance. For those wishing to stay on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; is probably the best option, though by level 35 a few quests in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; will also be opening up. In the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the vast questing hub of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; is available. Other Eastern Kingdom zones for the next level range include: &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; (note that most quests for this zone come from the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;."}
