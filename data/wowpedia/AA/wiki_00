All life on the surface of Uldum died instantly, and the lush jungle turned into a barren desert.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n12,200 years after Lei Shen's death, the Forge of Origination was almost activated by &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt;, but he was convinced to stop.\nCataclysm.\nA short time after the Algalon incident, the Forge was disabled by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and a band of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in order to stop it from being used by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s servants.

The forces standing against N'Zoth, led by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, used the Forge of Origination - powered by the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;, another titan facility in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; - to destroy N'Zoth for good by concentrating the reorigination device with the &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;:Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; on him instead of across the whole world."}

In his ongoing struggle to stop the Lich King, Tirion Fordring of the Argent Crusade has joined forces with Darion Mograine of the Knights of the Ebon Blade in order to assault Icecrown Citadel with a unified army called the Ashen Verdict.\"\nShadowlands.\nMany years later, it would be revealed that the Forge of Souls' true purpose was to extract the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torghast\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; intended to use it to power the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Machine of Origination&lt;/a&gt; to rewrite reality.

It can only be entered after the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt; event has been completed. It is surrounded by dormant &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. After the fight with Sjonnir, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; speculates that another location is making more of them (either the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Crucible\"&gt;Iron Crucible&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Forge\"&gt;Colossal Forge&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Forge of Wills and its twin, the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, were built by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titanic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;watchers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; were defeated. Their purpose was to help infuse &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; with cosmic energies. The Forge of Wills would shape the world-soul's sentience, while the Forge of Origination would shape its form.\nThe Forge was also able to draw on the life essence of Azeroth and create sentient life. It was here that the various &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; were born, such as the &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;Engine of the Makers&lt;/a&gt;, like all the massive machinery around the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, is actually part of the Forge of Wills. &lt;a href=\"Uldis\"&gt;Uldis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loken%27s%20Bargain\"&gt;Loken's Bargain&lt;/a&gt; are presumably parts of the Forge of Wills as well.\nHistory.\nThe titan-forged.\nAfter the Old Gods had been defeated, Prime Designate &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; ordered the Forge of Wills' construction. Built within &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; by Watchers Mimiron and Archaedas, it was intended to be used in helping shape the world, drawing on the energies of the cosmos to mature the Azeroth world-soul's sentience. The Forge of Wills was also used to create the various titan-forged which would help the keepers to shape the world. However, the first design was too complex, resulting in the creation of malformed creatures such as the stone troggs. The watchers corrected their design and the next generation of titan-forged was the earthen.\nThe Curse of Flesh.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned within Ulduar, he devised a plan to escape the watchers. He corrupted the Forge of Wills' matrix with the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. The Curse would infect new titan-forged, slowly turning their rock-like forms into ones of flesh and blood. The Curse would even spread from the newer generations to the older ones, making the titan-forged much easier to kill when the time came. Those infected became the ancestors of the modern &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStorm and ice giant wars.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;'s mate &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, Loken blamed her death on &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;Arngrim&lt;/a&gt;, King of the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s. Thorim sent his &lt;a href=\"storm%20giant\"&gt;storm giant&lt;/a&gt;s to attack the ice giants, resulting in many wars between them. To guard Ulduar from the warring giants, Loken used the Forge of Wills to create a massive army of earthen. However, Yogg-Saron had manifested as the spirit of Sif to trick Loken into creating earthen with the Curse of Flesh. Loken deactivated the Forge after he realized it was cursed.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nFor thousands of years the imprisoned Yogg-Saron was unable to do more than keeping the Keepers, Loken included, quiet and complacent inside Ulduar. His grasp on them was tenuous, and convincing them to directly help the Old God had proven fruitless in the past. It was not until &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; of the Old God-worshiping &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated Ulduar and weakened Yogg-Saron's chains that the entity's influence on the Keepers increased, becoming strong as iron. Yogg-Saron commanded Loken to create a new army from the Forge of Wills. In Lokens's hands, the forge churned out legions of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who sought only bloodshed and war.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Forge is still operational albeit back in titan-forged control.\nPossible inspiration.\nAnyone familiar with \"\" will instantly notice a resemblance between the Forge of Wills and the Star Forge. Both are ancient factories that enemy factions use to manufacture large amounts of troops, and both forges work much the same way (by generating troops as Brann does when he summons troggs and oozes). They also resemble one another in terms of architecture. The main part of the forge bears a striking resemblance to the holo-deck where the second to last fight in the game takes place. It is possible, then, that the idea for the Forge of Wills rests in the Star Forge."}

An artifact of incredible power, it was used for centuries by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; to transfer the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power of many mages into the body of one, thus creating a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. It was first devised by &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, the first Guardian, whose spirit is forever bound to the forge, allowing him to interact with the people of the present centuries after his death. The Forge of the Guardian also serves as a font of arcane energy which can be used to manipulate and empower the artifacts of the world.\nThe last time the forge was used was during the time of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the second-to-last Guardian of Tirisfal, who refused to return her powers to the Council, thus preventing the appointment of a new Guardian. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; learned of the forge's existence, the Council locked the artifact away behind the arcane barriers of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, which was not only the most secure location in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, but also a place where few would think to look. Ever since, the forge's location has been known only to the Council.\nDuring the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; finally broke free from the body of his host, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, and infiltrated the Violet Hold in an attempt to claim the forge. He was confronted by Meryl and a mage &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, the former of which waylaid the dreadlord long enough for the adventurer to use the forge and become imbued with Alodi's \"mark of the Guardian\", allowing them to defeat Kathra'natir and force him back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to recuperate before giving the power back to Alodi. Alodi, Meryl and the mage champion then worked together to transport the forge to a safer location \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 believing it to be necessary if they were to defeat the Burning Legion. After retrieving a powerful &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapon to wield in battle against the Legion, the adventurer was instructed by Meryl on how to tap into the forge's power to further enhance their new weapon."}

Using the &lt;a href=\"Incantation%20of%20Deng\"&gt;Incantation of Deng&lt;/a&gt;, which is a rare drop off of any mob on the isle, Deng can be summoned from beyond the grave. This is a requirement of the Isle of Thunder quest achievements &lt;a href=\"The%20Mogu%20Below-gu\"&gt;The Mogu Below-gu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"These%20Mogu%20Have%20Gotta%20Go-gu\"&gt;These Mogu Have Gotta Go-gu&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nForgemaster Deng was a gifted blacksmith who lived during the reign of the Thunder King &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the first emperor of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;. Frustrated with his inability to harness two ancient artifacts, &lt;a href=\"the%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;the Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Highkeeper%27s%20Ward\"&gt;the Highkeeper's Ward&lt;/a&gt;, Lei Shen gave them to Deng and ordered him to unlock the artifacts' secrets, but he also warned the artisan not to harness their power for himself, or he would suffer grave consequences. Deng promised Lei Shen that he would follow his command, but secretly plotted to disobey his master and reasoned that if he could find a way to use the two weapons, something the Thunder King had been unable to do, he would be able to take control of the mogu empire himself. While the smith was tampering with the Fist of Ra-den, he was suddenly struck by a bolt of lightning. The artifact absorbed most of the energy, saving the forgemaster's life, but the lightning left him permanently disfigured.\nAfter much experimentation, Deng found a use for the two artifacts and used them to power the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Forge\"&gt;Thunder Forge&lt;/a&gt;, an immense engine that churned day and night, creating exceptional armaments for the mogu military. Lei Shen was pleased by the work, and ordered Deng to personally craft him weapons and armor that would put all others to shame. Toiling the Thunder Forge, Deng managed to craft what would be his three greatest creations: a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Spear%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;massive spear&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;battleaxe&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Helm%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;mighty helm&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nBefore summoning Deng, make sure to clear plenty of area around his epitaph - as aggroing &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Ancestor\"&gt;Risen Ancestor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Shan%27ze%20Gravekeeper\"&gt;Shan'ze Gravekeeper&lt;/a&gt;s just make the encounter that much more annoying.\nDeng's most common attack is launching four Forge Fire Waves 90 degrees apart from each other that extend out in a straight line to ~30 yards out, much like &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Flameheart\"&gt;Liu Flameheart's&lt;/a&gt; Dragon Wave ability in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. The fire waves leave pools of Forge Fire on the ground that tick for 25,000 Fire damage a second, so don't stand in them.\nDeng's other main ability chain is using a Death Grip to pull a range combatant to him, throwing a Spike Chain on that target, then winding up a Brutal Smash in that target's direction. Do \"not\" get hit by the smash."}

He can quickly forge &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; into terrible instruments of pain and death, or he can just throw it at his enemies.\"\nBosstiary.\n\"A master blacksmith and the overseer of the Scourge's cold forges, Garfrost infuses the blades of the Lich King's armies with the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s blood.\"\nStrategy.\nAt the beginning of the fight, either by aggroing Garfrost himself or any of the s in the room, all of the siegesmiths will aggro and join the fight. AoE them down, then focus on Garfrost once they're dead.\nGarfrost's main attack outside of basic melee is to throw saronite boulders at ranged players. The boss' boulder emote only appears above the player who actually has a boulder heading his/her way. Thrown boulders carry a large amount of kinetic energy and will both knock a player back and deal tremendous damage to anyone foolish enough to stand in its shadow.\nThe fight can be healing intensive due to constant party damage and line of sight/interrupt issues as healers have to dodge boulders or have one dropped between them and the tank. As such, all ranged dps should attack as melee from close behind Garfrost to allow AoE heals work effectively and cheaply. The healer should stand at a distance until one rock is thrown, then join them to avoid further boulder issues.\nAt 66 and 33%, Garfrost AoE stomps the instance, then jumps over to one of the two forges in his room and reforges his weapon to increase his frost damage dealt by 50% (100% in Heroic mode). While Garfrost is in his corner, the party should take the opportunity to get behind boulders until the debuff wears off. Mages should equip &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Armor\"&gt;Mage Armor&lt;/a&gt; when battling Garfrost as the debuff's timer is cut in half and will usually vanish before it stacks past two.\nOnce everyone's debuff has worn off and is healed up, feel free to meet Garfrost in his corner. Garfrost does not lose aggro on the phase transitions, so rinse and repeat from 100% to 0.\nIn phase two Garfrost casts Chilling Waves in front of him. The tank (and only the tank) should be getting hit by the Chilling Waves.\nAfter the second phase transition, Garfrost's +frost damage bonus has increased to +100% (+200% on Heroic). Garfrost will use Deep Freeze on random players in the party. Make sure the player is at full health (and shielded if possible) when the debuff wears off, as Deep Freeze hits hard.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Move out of these cave-ins, Tanks should move Throngus should these cave-ins appear on the melee.\nSword Phase.\nThis is the high single-target damage phase. \nMace Phase.\nThis is a kiting phase, and Throngus resets aggro. Throngus hit extremely hard when he has the mace equipped, but will also be slowed. If you are not the tank, avoid these at all costs, as healers need all their mana to heal the tank during the shield phases. During this phase, Throngus also jumps to a random player and picks them up, doing some damage before letting them go.\nTanks may wish to start him near the stairs and then enter into a kiting rotation of going towards the entrance on one mace phase, back to the stairs on the next, and so forth. This will not be perfect due to his jumping. Melee must be very careful in this phase, and remember that surviving is more important than damage. Do not tax your healer unnecessarily, and especially don't get aggro in this phase, as any non-tank is likely to be killed with one hit.\nShield Phase.\nThis is a movement and healing phase. Throngus will use his shield to get a buff called \"Personal Phalanx,\" which reduces damage taken from the front by 99%. Meanwhile, flaming arrows rain down from the balconies.To manage this phase, everyone needs to move as close as possible to Throngus. Everyone who is not a Hunter should be standing right behind him, and Hunters should be as close to his back as their deadzone allows. When he turns around, the group simply has to move through him to get out of the shield-flame as quickly as possible.\nHeroic.\nDuring Sword Phase, Throngus applies a debuff on the tank. This debuff should be dispelled as soon as possible. The tank can disarm Throngus and use cooldowns to reduce the damage to easily manageable levels if the debuff is dispelled, though it is not completely necessary.\nDuring Mace Phase, Throngus leaves a trail of magma pools that do considerable damage; upwards of 20,000 on the first tick. \nOn heroic, Throngus' shield also sprews a wide cone of fire, and the flaming arrows do much more damage to the group. \nDuring Shield Phase, the flaming arrows in the shield phase hits the party very hard, and this quickly drains healer mana. The entire group needs to work to get through this phase. Move out of AoE in the other phases to conserve your healer's mana, and get out of the shield's flames quickly in the phase itself. If you have damage-reducing or healing abilities, using them in the shield phase is not a bad idea. The more you can do to conserve healer mana for the flaming arrows, the better. The arrows do not seem to have any AoE splash damage, so there is no harm in gathering up as close as possible during the shield phase, if your healer's AoE heals require it.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Players theorized they may have been playground for developers, a testing site of sorts, an unfinished instance, or something else entirely. In vanilla \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", the area could be accessed via dying close to the gate and running through it as a ghost, but this was changed in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.1\"&gt;patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20the%20Forgotten\"&gt;Well of the Forgotten&lt;/a&gt; was made available, and in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.0\"&gt;patch 7.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, the entire crypt was opened for all who solved an &lt;a href=\"Riddle%20of%20the%20Lucid%20Nightmare\"&gt;extremely difficult puzzle&lt;/a&gt;.\nReasons for abandonment.\nMany players suspected that the crypt was originally never fully implemented because of the mildly disturbing content, mainly the now infamous room of &lt;a href=\"Upside-down%20Sinners\"&gt;upside-down sinners&lt;/a&gt;, would've made \"World of Warcraft\"'s ESRB rating become M for Mature. On January 24th, 2014, Blizzard community manager Bashiok responded to a post inquiring to the reasons the crypt was never used and provided some insights on Blizzard's design processes back during the days of its creation, stating the reason it was abandoned was more than likely that Blizzard simply changed their minds about using it.\nAdditionally, in a Reddit AMA in September 2018, &lt;a href=\"John%20Staats\"&gt;John Staats&lt;/a&gt; answered a question about the intentions for the crypt. He stated that crypts were meant to be questing areas, but that it turned out they weren't needed, so they were never finished."}

The shore is perpetually shrouded with mist. The natural bay is choked with the disintegrating wrecks of &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s, the sands littered with shattered, wind-worn wood, and many &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s wandering aimlessly.\nHistory.\nIt was the site of the main encampment of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; when he set out to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to destroy &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;. After finding &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and his men and establishing a smaller base camp, Arthas went to rescue the rest of Muradin's men from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. A nearby second undead base was razed by Arthas' men, and they were ordered to build a new base on top of it.\nWhile Arthas and Muradin searched for &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Emissary\"&gt;messenger&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; came and told them that they were to pack up and leave. With no choice but to obey, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Luc%20Valonforth\"&gt;Captain Luc Valonforth&lt;/a&gt; ordered the troops to cut through the forest to reach the beach. When Arthas returned to the camp, he learned his father's orders, however, the prince was determined to stay in Northrend until Mal'Ganis was destroyed. He, Muradin, and two &lt;a href=\"mortar%20team\"&gt;mortar team&lt;/a&gt;s recruited a number of &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the ships. Arthas then blamed the mercenaries, saying that they had burnt them (though it was a half-true), and let his enraged soldiers murder them. The prince's forces later moved close to &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; some years later, the shore was populated by &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Captain\"&gt;Forgotten Captain&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Knight\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Footman\"&gt;Footmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Rifleman\"&gt;Riflemen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Peasant\"&gt;Peasants&lt;/a&gt;.

However, Valgarde was changed as being built by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; instead."}

Unlike their more peaceful tauren relatives, the taunka forcibly bend nature and the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; to their will in order to survive.\nThe taunka were long thought to be lost until they were re-discovered by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; forces upon their arrival in Northrend. Due to being forced to migrate from their homes by the encroaching &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the taunka have largely given their allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and also because of their kinship with the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough they appear similar to the tauren, they resemble more than , and are referred to as bison-men by &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Malthus\"&gt;Apothecary Malthus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe taunka are the descendants of a bovine race known as the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt;. Several millennia before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the yaungol roamed central &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and lived in peace with the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, but were eventually driven south due to not wanting to share hunting grounds with the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. There, the yaungol were enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; and twisted by the mogu &lt;a href=\"flesh-shaping\"&gt;flesh-shapers&lt;/a&gt;. Though they eventually regained their freedom along with the other slave races during the &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;pandaren revolution&lt;/a&gt;, much of their ancient cultural heritage had been lost. Heated arguments led many yaungol to migrate back north. One group, who would later take up the name \"&lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;\", resettled in central Kalimdor and rediscovered their ties to Cenarius, while the more nomadic tribes traveled across the entire continent, only stopping when they reached the frigid lands near the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. There, &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; machinery such as the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; transformed these northern yaungol into a new subspecies, known as the \"taunka\". The taunka, tauren, and yaungol retained some contact with one another for many years, but the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; finally shattered the connections between the tribes.\n4,500 years prior to the First War, shockingly vicious and bloody battles erupted between the normally peaceful taunka and &lt;a href=\"forest%20nymph\"&gt;forest nymph&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. When word reached the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, the elves conducted an expedition to find the cause of the brutal conflict. To their immense horror, they discovered that the roots of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt; had reached so far into the ground that they had come into contact with the prison of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. The malevolent being's energies had spread through the tree, slowly driving all lifeforms in the area to madness. As a result, the Cenarion Circle were forced to fell Andrassil, killing it in order to stop its suffering. Forever after, it would be known as \"Vordrassil\", or \"Broken Crown\".\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe taunka of &lt;a href=\"Taunka%27le%20Village\"&gt;Taunka'le Village&lt;/a&gt; had long been under siege by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20City%20of%20En%27kilah\"&gt;Temple City of En'kilah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Naxxanar\"&gt;Naxxanar&lt;/a&gt; by the time the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; launched the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the taunka capital of &lt;a href=\"Icemist%20Village\"&gt;Icemist Village&lt;/a&gt;, was attacked and fell under the control of the Scourge, with High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Roanauk%20Icemist\"&gt;Roanauk Icemist&lt;/a&gt; being imprisoned. In this dark hour for the taunka, they made contact with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and established a working relationship with them. &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Wintergale\"&gt;Chieftain Wintergale&lt;/a&gt; would personally send &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Talonga\"&gt;Talonga&lt;/a&gt; to serve as their &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile it is unusual to see taunka in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, they've built a small village called &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Tunka%27lo\"&gt;Camp Tunka'lo&lt;/a&gt; in the region, which has been safe from the Scourge attacks that destroyed so many other taunka villages, thanks to its remote location.\nAs the Horde worked with the taunka tribes, they were able to successfully provide aid towards &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Winterhoof\"&gt;Camp Winterhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Oneqwah\"&gt;Camp Oneqwah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Tunka%27lo\"&gt;Camp Tunka'lo&lt;/a&gt;, though despite their best efforts, the war with the Scourge made Taunka'le no longer capable of sustaining the Taunka population and the village was evacuated. However after the taunka formally joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, they prepared to strike back against the &lt;a href=\"Anub%27ar\"&gt;Anub'ar&lt;/a&gt; in order to take back Icemist and free High Chieftain Icemist. While the Horde attacked the Anub'ar by ground and sky to thin their numbers, &lt;a href=\"Banthok%20Icemist\"&gt;Banthok Icemist&lt;/a&gt; sent off to the village determined to rescue his father. After acquiring the keys, the pair free the imprisoned High Chieftain, and quickly came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Under-King%20Anub%27et%27kan\"&gt;Under-King Anub'et'kan&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the trio successfully killed Anub'et'kan, before retreating to &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. As they recovered their strength, Roanauk formally joined the Horde.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe taunka chieftain &lt;a href=\"Tormak%20the%20Scarred\"&gt;Tormak the Scarred&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Paluna\"&gt;Sage Paluna&lt;/a&gt; ended up leaving Northrend to journey Azeroth together. They eventually ended up on at &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; if the &lt;a href=\"Stables%20%28garrison%29\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt; are built.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; hoped that taunka and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; could find common ground now, but they were still a wary people, and some of them such has &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Ashtotem\"&gt;Chieftain Ashtotem&lt;/a&gt; doesn't seem particularly interested in making friends beyond the Horde. It was also revealed that while &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Oneqwah\"&gt;Camp Oneqwah&lt;/a&gt; had greatly expanded from the refugees fleeing from the other camps, while &lt;a href=\"Taunka%27le%20Village\"&gt;Taunka'le Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icemist%20Village\"&gt;Icemist Village&lt;/a&gt; were still lost to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; also visited &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Tunka%27lo\"&gt;Camp Tunka'lo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, where the sentries were wary of the dwarves when they greeted them from a safe distance, but then recognized they weren't &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and were polite after, if still a bit cagey. The dwarves chose not to overstay that small amount of welcome, however.\nCulture.\nTenacious and stoic, the taunka are well aware of the rigors of living in the harsh wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Although they may seem dour or even cold to outsiders, those who come to know them will soon recognize an embattled race of survivors characterized by colossal hearts and unshakable resolve.\nThe taunka are a stubborn and tenacious people as they have to be to live in Northrend. According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, while he didn't have many dealings with the taunka under the Alliance banner, every taunka he ever met as &lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Stormheart\"&gt;Yorg Stormheart&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;Frostborn&lt;/a&gt; had a great heart, and an even greater capacity to drink him under the table.\nShamanism.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, the taunka have survived only by forcing the land and the elements to yield to their will. Their relationship with nature has been one of constant struggle and grim perseverance. When asked if taunka were &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; said that \"taunka are taunka\".\nLocations.\nMost of the taunka camps are either destroyed, evacuating, or planning to evacuate.

Taunt is instant-cast, does not trigger the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, costs no Rage and has an 8 second cooldown.\nSome mobs (most &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es in particular) are immune to taunt. Taunt can be resisted, and cannot be used when silenced. Taunt has no effect on enemy players in PvP (although it can be used on players' &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s) and does not have any effect when the warrior already has aggro on the mob, except that the mob will be forced to target the warrior for 3 seconds.\nNotes.\nTaunt is one of the signature moves of a tanking warrior. It may help aggro buildup greatly, and it may be a life-saver in certain situations. On the other side it has a rather long cooldown, so it must be used with care and a good grasp of the overall situation (in multi-mob pulls in particular). It should also be well understood that after 3 seconds, the mob may immediately turn to another target, if the tanks aggro buildup was lower than that of the other player(s).\nA melee damage dealer has 1000 points of threat on a mob. A warrior taunts the mob, thereby immediately gaining a threat value of 1000, and forcing the mob to attack the warrior for three seconds. After that time, threat works normally for the mob, and if no one is at 130%/110% (ranged/melee) of the tank's threat, the warrior remains the mob's target.\nNormally, hunters can help a tanks initial aggro buildup with &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt;. If that's on cooldown, it's possible to use a combination of Taunt and &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; to achieve the same effect. The hunter pulls, using their most aggro intensive abilities. When the mob is about to hit the hunter, the warrior Taunts and the hunter Feigns Death. Misdirection is the safer method though, as both the Taunt and Feign Death can be resisted by the mob.\nHistory.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, Taunt cannot miss. Prior to this, it had a 17% chance to miss raid bosses (in contrast to the 8% chance to miss boss mobs for melee attacks). So even if you were melee &lt;a href=\"hit\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; capped (263 hit rating at level 80), Taunt's chance to miss was still 7%. This gap was covered with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Taunt\"&gt;Glyph of Taunt&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreviously, Warriors learned Taunt from the &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Stance%23Quests\"&gt;Defensive Stance quest&lt;/a&gt; at level 10."}

For countless generations, they were constantly harassed by the violent &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, who forced the tauren into a nomadic lifestyle in the harsh &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. However, during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren and the invading Horde became allies, and the Horde aided the tauren in driving off the centaur from the sacred lands of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; established the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, and to this day the tauren remain one of the most stalwart allies of the Horde, even after Cairne's death and the ascension of his son, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their enormous size, the tauren are a peaceful and honorable people who nonetheless are fierce fighters when roused. Hunting and shamanism are held in high regard in their culture, as is their worship of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and respect for the land and nature.\nHistory.\nOrigins and early history.\nThe intrepid &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes that the tauren may ultimately be descended from an unknown bull &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;, or some kind of animal spirit predating the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tauren are the descendants of a bovine race known as the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt;. Several millennia before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the yaungol roamed central &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and lived in peace with the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, but were eventually driven south due to not wanting to share hunting grounds with the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. There, the yaungol were enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; and twisted by the mogu &lt;a href=\"flesh-shaping\"&gt;flesh-shapers&lt;/a&gt;. Though they eventually regained their freedom along with the other slave races during the &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;pandaren revolution&lt;/a&gt;, much of their ancient cultural heritage had been lost. Heated arguments led many yaungol to migrate back north. While one group traveled as far north as the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, where they took up the name &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;, the other group settled in the balmy areas surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. There, they reunited with Cenarius and rediscovered their ancient traditions. Those who studied with Cenarius learned the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic magic of the natural world, while others mastered the art of wielding &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic powers. The energies of the Well soon began to change these yaungol into a new race, who would later take up the name \"tauren\". The taunka, tauren, and yaungol retained some contact with one another for many years, but the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; finally shattered the connections between the tribes.\nWar of the Ancients.\nThe tauren of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; were convinced to join an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and other races against the Burning Legion by the dragon-mage &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, and the tauren tribes were led by &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, wielder of the &lt;a href=\"Talonclaw\"&gt;eagle spear&lt;/a&gt;. The xenophobic night elf commander, &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt;, refused to use the tauren to their abilities, namely heavy melee fighters, on the grounds that they were apparently as likely to kill night elves and &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. After the \"tragic\" loss of the commander, the tauren were re-deployed to extreme effectiveness by his replacement, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. The tauren who survived the war maintained fairly good, or at least cordial, relations with the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to a blessing bestowed upon Huln by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; under Huln \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; tribes \u2014 were given the &lt;a href=\"Horns%20of%20Eche%27ro\"&gt;Horns of Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;-like antlers. After the war, these tribes would rename their home region &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; in honor of Huln's heroism during the war.\nThe rise of the centaur.\n1,100 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren wandered Kalimdor's forests and plains, living in harmony with nature. One region in particular was especially sacred: the verdant grassland of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Mashan'she&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Loom of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;\". Drawn by faint &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; whisperings, the tauren became convinced that somewhere beneath the meadows, the Earth Mother herself dwelled. After decades of attempting to rouse her from her slumber, the tauren &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; eventually succeeded, but to their horror they realized that what they had awakened was not the benevolent Earth Mother, but the enormous &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt;. The newly awakened Theradras reached out to the verdant surroundings for sustenance and consumed their energies in order to regenerate her weakened form. The tauren would later name this now barren land \"Desolace\".\nThe sudden monumental loss of life sent ripples throughout all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, son of the forestlord &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to Desolace to investigate, but though he had decided to imprison Theradras, he instead fell in love with her. Theradras requited Zaetar's affection, and the two became mates. From this forbidden and unnatural union, the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; were born. After having brutally murdered their father, the half-horse creatures quickly proliferated and spread out across Kalimdor, driving the tauren of Desolace from their homes and igniting a long and dark period of war that would come to last for many centuries.\nFor countless generations, the tauren roamed the plains of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; hunting the mighty &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;, and sought the wisdom of their eternal goddess, the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. Their tent settlements were scattered across the landscape and changed with the seasons and the weather. The wandering tribes were united only by a common hatred for their sworn enemy, the marauding centaur. For generations, the tauren had weathered intermittent attacks by the centaur, with the centaur seeing the tauren as weak for their mystical beliefs and hunted them for sport. The battles took a heavy toll on both sides. The tauren did not shy away from combat and made the centaur pay for every unprovoked attack, but they had no love for war and always opted to find a new home rather than throw their lives away whenever the horse men appeared. As such, the tauren lived in a constant state of upheaval, and a year of peace was always followed by a year of war. The shu'halo accepted this cycle of conflict as inescapable as it was the only life they knew, but that would eventually change.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; was originally founded by tauren &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; some time before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; to lead their people with wisdom and maintain the harmony between the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Third War and the Horde.\nAt the brink of extinction, the chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, desperate for help, turned to the strange green-skinned warriors from over the sea. Cairne quickly befriended &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and recognized that they shared a love for honor and battle. For their part, the orcs and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; that composed the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; found much in common with the tauren. Each of these races wanted to achieve a more &lt;a href=\"shamanism\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; culture, and the tauren, long versed in the lore of spirit and nature, were well-prepared to provide counsel and support to the budding &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism within the Horde.\nWith the orcs' help, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt; were able to drive back the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and claim the grasslands of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; for themselves. For the first time in millennia, the tauren had a land to call their own. For this alone they were forever indebted to their orcish allies. Upon the windswept mesa of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne built a refuge for his people, where tauren of &lt;a href=\"Tauren%23Tauren%20tribes%20and%20organizations\"&gt;every tribe&lt;/a&gt; were welcome.\nOwing a blood-debt to the orcs for their assistance, the tauren joined Thrall on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to defend &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; from an invasion by the demonic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Legion's defeat, the tauren who helped defend Hyjal returned to their new home in Mulgore.\nOver time the scattered tauren tribes united under Cairne's rule. There were but a few tribes who disagreed about the direction their new nation should take, but all agreed that Cairne was the wisest and best suited to lead them toward the future. Helping the mighty Cairne in the duties of ruling his race were the &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; and the elder crone &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the tauren had reclaimed their lands and battled alongside the Horde, not all was peaceful. The &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; tried to usurp the rule of Cairne, plotting to overthrow his leadership. In Mulgore, they had problems with the &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20tribe\"&gt;Bristleback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, realm of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, was tainted with a strange evil. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was trapped inside, and the green dragons acted strangely as they attacked all who passed near. Both &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; and tauren druids were researching these events since the Emerald Dream, home of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera the Dreamer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;the Green Aspect&lt;/a&gt;), had to be kept safe.\nSeveral tauren individuals have joined the organizations like the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nWhen a peaceful meeting between tauren and night elf druids was sabotaged by &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists posing as members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne mistakenly thought that the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, was responsible. As a result, Cairne challenged Garrosh to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; for the title of Warchief. The duel ended in Cairne's death, as the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; poisoned Garrosh's axe, &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;. After Cairne's death, the Grimtotem quickly seized control of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and other major tauren settlements. Cairne's son, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; became High Chieftain of the tauren and led an attack against the Grimtotem, retaking Thunder Bluff. He then banished the Grimtotem to &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their banishment, Grimtotem forces were able to corrupt several water wells within Mulgore, but their efforts were stopped by tauren &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and Baine personally killed &lt;a href=\"Orno%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Orno Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Grimtotem forces invading Mulgore. The Grimtotem, hunted by the Horde, were forced into an uneasy truce with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the likes of which was broken &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;shortly after&lt;/a&gt;. \nWithin Mulgore, the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; began attacking tauren caravans. While many tauren and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; wished to confront the attackers, Baine looked towards diplomatic measures to find a compromise. Several of the tauren began to express dissatisfaction with Baine's compromising attitude with Garrosh. Viewing his willingness to bow down to every demand made of him as an affront to their peoples' interests, they considered walking away from the Horde. Led by &lt;a href=\"Greyhoof%20Farwanderer\"&gt;Greyhoof Farwanderer&lt;/a&gt;, these tauren prepared to leave both the Horde and Mulgore. When yet another caravan was attacked, Garrosh and his &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; personally assaulted the quilboar, only to be nearly overrun. Baine, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; arrived to relieve the battle and help the orcs escape. Hamuul then demonstrated the power of the Earth Mother to Garrosh as he called upon a river. Baine stood over the defeated quilboar, and instructed them that this river would provide them with all the water they needed - provided that no more attacks were made on the tauren people. The quilboar anxiously returned to their tunnels. Later on, Baine was approached by Greyhoof Farwanderer and the tauren that had prepared to leave Mulgore prior, and having witnessed Baine's victory over the quilboar, apologized for doubting the high chieftain's ability to lead and requested a pardon for this rash action. Baine granted it, and urged them to remain strong and steadfast in these trying times for the good of their people.\nWhen Alliance forces invaded the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; was burned to the ground. The survivors fled to &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Una%27fe\"&gt;Camp Una'fe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vendetta%20Point\"&gt;Vendetta Point&lt;/a&gt;. To protect Mulgore from being invaded, the tauren created a mighty wall named the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt;. \nMists of Pandaria.\nWhen the Warchief issued a call for the leaders of the Horde to gather for a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Baine answered the summons despite not feeling right within the \"new Orgrimmar.\" Garrosh then informed them of his plan to &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; the Alliance port of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. While Baine and other leaders protested against such a plan, they all agreed in the end. Despite his personal misgivings, Baine ultimately resolves to join Garrosh's cause in an attempt to protect his people. Baine led his tauren forces from the Great Gate and then joined up with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; forces. Baine then co-led the combined tauren and Darkspear army as it marched from the Gate to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, killing any Alliance that got in their way. Baine ordered his forces to attend to the bodies of the fallen. He further ordered that that his people not desecrate any of the fallen Alliance soldiers. After they finally arrived at Theramore, Baine led his tauren in battle. When the battle was won with Theramore's destruction, Baine and the tauren returned to Thunder Bluff.\nDuring a period, Baine and several tauren of Thunder Bluff had dreams of a valley, golden with blossoms, filled with the hope of peace. Baine Bloodhoof ordered &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dawnchaser%20tribe\"&gt;Dawnchaser tribe&lt;/a&gt; to sail into uncharted waters in search of this mysterious place. Guided by the visions of Dezco's pregnant wife, &lt;a href=\"Leza%20Farwalker\"&gt;Leza&lt;/a&gt;, the last vessel was able to find &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and landed on the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. After heading inland by canoe, the group set up camp at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Cleft\"&gt;Thunder Cleft&lt;/a&gt;. The tribe continued on in their search for weeks until they finally discovered the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. They moved into the vale and settled at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; declared &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;open rebellion&lt;/a&gt; against Garrosh, Baine and the tauren pledged their support. The two forces, along with the rest of the Horde and the Alliance, then marched upon Orgrimmar, where Garrosh was ultimately defeated.\nLegion.\nThe tauren assisted the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Mulgore, or at least Thunder Bluff, was targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during their &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;. The tauren joined various &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s and fought against the Legion on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the demonic invasion, the tauren reunited with the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; and brought them to the Horde.\nCulture.\nThe tauren are a noble race that embrace the natural world. They have shed their nomadic roots and united in their ancestral lands. Their race may be one of spirituality, reverence for nature, and respect for elders, but it also possesses powerful warriors that willingly fight when the situation demands it. A calm and steady people, the shu'halo strive to live honorable and dignified lives filled with respect for nature and the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. Although strong and capable warriors when roused in battle, most tauren reserve combat for when all other options are exhausted. They prefer course of wise discussion and careful rumination before embarking on any great endeavor, and they have great respect for the wise, spiritual and elderly among their people. The tauren are not wrathful by nature, but sometimes a thirst for justice causes them to take up arms in anger.\nThough the noble tauren are peaceful in nature, the rites of the Great Hunt are venerated as the heart of their spiritual culture. Every tauren, warrior or otherwise, seeks identity as both a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; and as a child of the Earthmother. Tauren, young or otherwise, seek to prove their bravery by setting themselves against the creatures of the wild. Hunting is a tauren's greatest honor; at times they hunt for food, at times for honor, and at times to earn the Earthmother's teachings. Hunters are important to the tribes as a strong part of tauren tradition and history, and are respected and revered if they serve their people well. Young &lt;a href=\"gazelle\"&gt;gazelle&lt;/a&gt;s quickly learn to flee when they hear the war cries of tauren hunters in Mulgore. They don't hear the good hunters, unfortunately. While mighty &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s defend the tauren's homes, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s show the ancestors' past and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s discover the Earthmother's will, hunters learn many aspects of those roles and blend them together. They represent the heart of the tauren people, and are looked to for guidance and protection. Despite killing the animals, the tauren are taught never to waste anything given to them by nature and to give back what they can. They learn the fine balance that exists in nature and that if they honor the Earthmother, she will bless them in return.\nMany tribes claim that it is a gift to be blessed with the aptitude to use &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; or to talk to the ancestors, but tauren &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are taught that they are just as gifted. They are a special breed also, not unlike the druids and shamans, and are just as important. They are the ones called upon to defend the borders, to hunt the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, and to go to war. Every warrior plays a role in their tribe, and they must all go through the same rites.\nDespite their enormous size and brute strength, the remarkably peaceful tauren cultivate a quiet, tribal society. However, when roused by conflict, tauren are implacable enemies who will use every ounce of their strength to smash their enemies under hoof. They are noble and proud and have never, despite significant adversity in the past, succumbed to their enemies. Like the orcs, the tauren now struggle to retain their sense of tradition and noble identity.\nTheir buildings are called long houses and great tents.\nFaith.\nThe tauren worship the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; as their creator. According to the tauren myth &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20of%20the%20Earthmother\"&gt;Sorrow of the Earthmother&lt;/a&gt;, when the Earth Mother saw her children falling to the corrupting whispers from below the earth, (the work of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;) she tore out her eyes and set them spinning endlessly across the sky. Her left eye became &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;, the moon, and her right eye became &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun. Neither of both is better than the other, and together they see with balanced vision - they are the tauren's own \"Light\".\nThe earliest history of the tauren is recorded in a series of &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;myths&lt;/a&gt;. These chronicle the period of time from the creation of the world to the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, speaking of the creation of the tauren by the Earthmother, their meeting with &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, and the coming of the centaur.\nDue to &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; influence, tauren &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s long revered only Mu'sha, as Mu'sha is considered to be the tauren equivalent of the kaldorei moon goddess, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; engaged in a theological discussion about this matter with &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt;. Aponi pointed out that in all else, the tauren strived for balance, and she wondered if they had neglected a key aspect of balance in all things. As &lt;a href=\"An%27she%23Powers%20and%20worship\"&gt;a result of these discussions&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;, an order of tauren &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Seers\"&gt;Seers&lt;/a&gt;, an order of tauren &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, arose, wielding the power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; through An'she.\nBesides the Earthmother and her two eyes, an entity known as the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Father\"&gt;Sky Father&lt;/a&gt; is also worshipped.\nLast rites.\nThe tauren consider death to merely be the shadow of life and hold that the ending of things is as natural as the birth of them.\nDespite now having a permanent home in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren choose not &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;bury their dead&lt;/a&gt;, as they keep many traditions they held during their travels across Kalimdor. Rather, they prepare the body for its return to the elements and place it at one of their sacred grave sites. Only the most valiant tauren are laid to rest at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren's sacred burial ground. It is an honor bestowed upon the great warriors who helped found and defend Thunder Bluff and those who have given their lives for the greater good of their tribes and chieftains.\nWhen a tauren is cremated, it is done with ceremony and ritual. The body of the deceased is ritually bathed and wrapped in a ceremonial blanket before being placed atop a pyre, after which a fire is lit beneath them. The ashes are offered to the winds and rivers, to become one with &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Father\"&gt;Sky Father&lt;/a&gt;. As the ashes fall to the earth and the smoke rises to the sky, both the Earth Mother and Sky Father welcome the honored dead, and &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt; witness their passing. This death ritual speaks of the tauren's origins as nomads, and if their loved ones are freed to the wind and fire, they can wander in death as they did in life if they so choose.\nEach tauren tribe has its own rites to honor their dead, but nearly all perform their rituals at Red Rocks. The tribes differ in their sacred tinder for the funeral pyre. The &lt;a href=\"Eagletalon%20tribe\"&gt;Eagletalon tribe&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href=\"%3Aearthroot\"&gt;:earthroot&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt; prefers &lt;a href=\"%3Apeacebloom\"&gt;:peacebloom&lt;/a&gt;. The ceremonies themselves are focused on the same thing: sending off beloved family and braves to be reunited with their gods, the Earth Mother and Sky Father.\nOnce the proper rites have been performed, the spirits of the deceased join the Earth Mother to find peace, and deceased tauren ancestors are welcomed at the \"hearth of the ancestors\". It is believed that the spirits of dead tauren walk in the shadow of the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is customary for a widow, child, or grandchild to keep a pyrestone from the funeral pyre of an especially loved one. These stones are carried in a pocket and rubbed for courage, comfort, or in remembrance of a lost companionship.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dawnchaser%20tribe\"&gt;Dawnchaser tribe&lt;/a&gt; believes that honored ancestors who gave their own lives to save, or create, other lives become \"yeena'e\" (\"those who herald the dawn\" in &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;) \u2014 spirits who aid An'she in announcing the coming of dawn.\nThe Feast of Winter Veil.\nThe tauren and their &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic understanding of winter, along with their recent emergence into &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic endeavors, fit in well with the legend of &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt;. They focus almost entirely on the renewing aspects of the lore however, leaving legend worship to those races (as they view it) less in tune with the nature of things. Many tauren choose this time as the right time to give thanks for the blessings of their new home in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Furmund\"&gt;Some tauren&lt;/a&gt; disapprove of the modern Winter Veil celebrations, claiming that the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s have \"polluted\" the true meaning of the holiday.\nCustoms.\nIt is likely that each tribe has their own unique traditions, as the &lt;a href=\"Dawnchaser%20tribe\"&gt;Dawnchaser tribe&lt;/a&gt; is known to have customs rarely found in other tribes.\nCuisine.\nThe shu'halo use pine nuts in most dishes: meat, fish, vegetables, even baked into breads or sprinkled over sweet pastries. The very best pine nuts come from the trees upon the very mesas of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. The fine and noble &lt;a href=\"Mulgore%20Spice%20Bread\"&gt;spice bread&lt;/a&gt; of Thunder Bluff is traded in countless settlements in the most far-away lands, even by the tauren's staunchest foes. One of Thunder Bluff's most important staples is cornmeal; bowls of corn may be found in nearly every home, and &lt;a href=\"Cornmeal%20Biscuit\"&gt;cornmeal biscuits&lt;/a&gt;, once merely a staple food among the tauren tribes in Mulgore, have traveled along various trade routes and are now enjoyed in many regions across Azeroth. One of the great delicacies of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; is the crayfish that dwell in lakes and streams. They are particularly popular during weddings or the celebration of a birth.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; allied with the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Force%20Commander%20Valen\"&gt;Force Commander Valen&lt;/a&gt; asked &lt;a href=\"%22Cookie%22%20McWeaksauce\"&gt;\"Cookie\" McWeaksauce&lt;/a&gt; to cook up the finest of tauren cuisine; an offering no tauren, \"not even a grim tauren\", could refuse. It consisted of &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt; eggs, &lt;a href=\"ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt; meat and a special cheese kept by the local &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff%20Marzipan\"&gt;Thunder Bluff Marzipan&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional tauren &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; treat.\nMounts and pets.\nThe &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;s are the racial mount of the tauren. Swifter and slightly smaller than their wild cousins, kodo mounts nevertheless demonstrate the same resilience and fearlessness found in their untamed brethren, traits that serve them well when bearing their equally resolute riders. When the tauren settled in Mulgore, they also brought the kodos with them. Many kodos hold a special bond with the benevolent tauren race.\nLike rest of the Horde in Kalimdor, the tauren use &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s, which they consider sacred, as their flying mounts.\n&lt;a href=\"Brown%20Prairie%20Dog\"&gt;Brown Prairie Dog&lt;/a&gt;s are their racial pets.\nEquipment.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren%20halberd\"&gt;Tauren halberd&lt;/a&gt;s are used by &lt;a href=\"tauren%20chieftain\"&gt;tauren chieftain&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLanguages and naming.\nTauren speak &lt;a href=\"taur-ahe\"&gt;taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere follows a sampling of tauren names taken from \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;World of Warcraft Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dawnchaser%20tribe\"&gt;Dawnchaser tribe&lt;/a&gt; have a rare tradition of giving their newborn \"weaning names\" until they are old enough to receive a true name.\nAppearance.\nTauren are large bipedal ungulates, described as half-bovine beings. On average, tauren are towering, with females standing at 9 feet in height while males reach 10 feet. Tauren are roughly a foot shorter in-game, likely due to game limitations such as too small doorways. Females and males alike are known to have a very large bulk and weight, long tails, large hooves, and three fingers (two fingers, one thumb) per hand. Both males and females have horns of varying size and shape. Tauren are a mostly diurnal race.\nTauren are large, muscular humanoids and bovine in appearance, complete with hooves and horns. They weigh anywhere from 400 to 800 pounds. Their immense bodies are covered with fine, short fur that ranges in color from black to gray to white to red to brown to tan and any mottled combinations or variations thereof. When tauren grow old, their pelts start to become dotted with gray. During the summer months, tauren use their ears and tails to flick off &lt;a href=\"Fly\"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Master%20Seahorn\"&gt;Fleet Master Seahorn&lt;/a&gt; remarks that most non-tauren find them indistinguishable from one another. In fact, most non-tauren find them indistinguishable from &lt;a href=\"Cow\"&gt;a certain four-legged farm creature&lt;/a&gt;.\nTauren can see in the dark better than &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTauren tribes and organizations.\nTribes/clans.\n\"Note: These may not all represent tribes, but only special names given later in life or surnames.\"\nOrganizations.\nTauren are found as members in a multitude of independent organizations, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult. Some individuals are adventuring explorers such as &lt;a href=\"Trag%20Highmountain\"&gt;Trag Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; (who was one of the first tauren to appear in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;) and the ancient Watcher &lt;a href=\"Xarantaur\"&gt;Xarantaur&lt;/a&gt;, who is assisting the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, some &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s had journeyed to Kalimdor and recruited or impressed various tauren into their crews, and shu'halo pirates can be found as members of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Crew\"&gt;Dread Crew&lt;/a&gt;, just to name a few. As such, these criminal tauren were among the first to appear in the Eastern Kingdoms, and some even call &lt;a href=\"Rustberg%20Village\"&gt;Rustberg Village&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; home, becoming &lt;a href=\"Rustberg%20Fisherman\"&gt;fishermen&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Smite\"&gt;sole tauren&lt;/a&gt; was also a member of the infamous &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelations.\nThe Horde.\nThe tauren remain stalwart allies of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, even after &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne's&lt;/a&gt; death. The &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;, is, in fact, the only tribe to have never formally joined the Horde. When a great drought struck Horde-controlled lands in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; raids became frequent, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; demanded that the tauren deliver water from &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Farwanderers%20tribe\"&gt;Farwanderers tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who were not used to remaining static, disapproved of Garrosh's rule and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine's&lt;/a&gt; passive obedience at the Warchief's every command, and so considered leaving &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were eventually convinced to remain in Mulgore, and the Horde, after Baine dealt with the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; problem.\nFollowing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, a group of tauren were unsatisfied with Baine's rule, and so the High Chieftain banished them from &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; but did not take further action. Despite this, the tauren tribes retain respect for their High Chieftain.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sent out emissaries to various factions in order to protect her budding nation, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, the kind-hearted tauren of Thunder Bluff proved to be the most promising contact. Specifically, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; saw the potential for redemption in Sylvanas' people, even though he was fully aware of the Forsaken's sinister nature. Thus, the tauren convinced Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, despite his misgivings, to forge an alliance of convenience between the Forsaken and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. There are some tauren, such as the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, that wish to cure the Forsaken, and &lt;a href=\"Bena%20Winterhoof\"&gt;Bena Winterhoof&lt;/a&gt;, who wept when first seeing the undead, claims that she was given a mission by the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; herself to save their new undead allies from their curse. &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; herself was one of the original proponents of the alliance between the tauren and the Forsaken, and she, more than anyone among the elders, felt the tauren and their ways could help the Forsaken find a path back to being human. She claimed that to heal the land, the tauren had to first remove the disease upon it. She pointed out that the Forsaken know much of disease, and claimed that by aiding one another, the trust between the two peoples would be strengthened.\nThe Alliance.\nThe tauren are not as hostile to the Alliance as some of the other races that comprise the Horde, though many Alliance members consider them to be little more than beasts. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; notes that the tauren are the only Horde race that do not make him want to immediately reach for his weapon, but they, too, have made themselves untrustworthy by siding with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTauren have poor relations with the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, as the dwarves' constant digging in the earth has caused them to come into conflict with the tauren. The tauren see their digging as scarring the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;, and that the dwarves are hollowing and defiling the land. The &lt;a href=\"Stonespire%20tribe\"&gt;Stonespire tribe&lt;/a&gt; of tauren were nearly wiped out by the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Keep\"&gt;Bael'dun Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result &lt;a href=\"Gann%20Stonespire\"&gt;Gann Stonespire&lt;/a&gt;, one of the few survivors, severed all ties with the Horde and went rogue to exact vengeance or die trying. The tauren don't seem to get along well with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, either, as it was their &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s that firebombed &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Roon%20Wildmane\"&gt;Roon Wildmane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few cases of friendship despite the enmity between the two races.\nOf all the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; races, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; are the ones with the best relations to the tauren, due to their shared druidic tradition and connection to nature. Arch Druid &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; strives for diplomacy and willingly works side by side with the night elf druids in the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. The tauren have shown an incredible propensity to the tenets of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, and by their proxy the Horde is welcomed within the safety of &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. The preservation of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is a common goal that the two races both share. One notable example of close friendship between shu'halo and kaldorei is that of &lt;a href=\"Tholo%20Whitehoof\"&gt;Tholo Whitehoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anren%20Shadowseeker\"&gt;Anren Shadowseeker&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite the bond between the two races, there are some tauren who believe that the night elves' pride still limits their sight. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves and the tauren had apparently been involved in a blood feud dating back centuries. Some of the kaldorei during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt;, also seemed to regard the tauren who came to their aid as barbaric and uncivilized in nature, although this attitude seems to have considerably lessened over the millennia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;, after being driven from &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, briefly allied with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but the pact was broken shortly afterwards.\nThe Grimtotem.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; stand as an aggressive extreme of the usually pacifistic tauren, wishing to eradicate the \"lesser races\" from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and to retake the tauren's long lost ancestral holdings. Even before their exile, the Grimtotem showed open hostility towards the other tribes, going so far as to attack the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; and almost eradicate an entire village in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;battle for Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and the exile of the treacherous Grimtotem, they sought to ruin &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; itself as they were driven out, sending a force led by &lt;a href=\"Orno%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Orno Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Pass%20%28Mulgore%29\"&gt;Stonetalon Pass&lt;/a&gt; and poisoning several sacred tauren water wells throughout Mulgore.\nOther.\nTauren and &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; tribes have long feuded with each other over the lands that the two nomadic races shared. The centaur are known for their brutality and savagery, but support from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has turned the conflict in the tauren's favor, allowing them not only to survive but also to prosper. The barbaric centaur over-hunted &lt;a href=\"giraffe\"&gt;giraffe&lt;/a&gt;s for decades, but it was the tauren who saved them from extinction. The tauren claim that the centaur have always existed to scourge the land, even though the shu'halo were actually indirectly responsible for the centaur's creation by awakening &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite this, friendship between a tauren and a centaur can be made as seen with &lt;a href=\"Ironhoof\"&gt;Ironhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;Dorthar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vicious, boar-like &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; have long clashed with both the centaur and the tauren over land and food. One tauren group inhabited the southern parts of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; for decades and considered the land to be holy, but they were driven off by the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;. While some tauren were able to forgive being driven from their ancestral lands, others, such as &lt;a href=\"Auld%20Stonespire\"&gt;Auld Stonespire&lt;/a&gt;, were not and considered the quilboar's actions to be a sin worthy of the most severe revenge.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20tribe\"&gt;Bristleback tribe&lt;/a&gt; have long been at war with the tauren of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cloud%20Mesa\"&gt;Red Cloud Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, ambushing hunting parties and stealing from the village by dark. For years they encroached on &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt;, and the great &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; finally drove them from their dens to spread like locusts across the land. &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Squealer%20Thornmantle\"&gt;Chief Squealer Thornmantle&lt;/a&gt; set upon &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Hawkwind\"&gt;Greatmother Hawkwind&lt;/a&gt; and took her life. The &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20Thorncaller\"&gt;thorncallers&lt;/a&gt; began calling up great roots to choke out all other life in the mesa, and the Bristlebacks began training wild boars to be used against the tauren. A band of Bristleback quilboar also began ravaging the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt;, the holy burial ground of the tauren.\nDue to a drought that struck &lt;a href=\"Central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Central Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the Shattering, a group of quilboar began raiding Horde caravans and water shipments. Though &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; tried to put an end to the quilboar with force, it was &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt; who resolved the conflict by creating a new river for the quilboar to take their water from.\nAlthough centaur, tauren, and quilboar all hate each other, the three races come together to do trade at &lt;a href=\"Flayers%27%20Point\"&gt;Flayers' Point&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. But there is no love lost between them, and brawls erupt like clockwork every five minutes, earning the trading post the nickname \"Slayers' Point\".\n&lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;Harpies&lt;/a&gt; have clashed with the tauren on several occasions. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of harpies from the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; started poaching the tauren's precious &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; herds, slaughtering them mercilessly and leaving the beasts to rot in the sun. The threat was only dealt with once &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; set out to kill the witches. The &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20harpies\"&gt;Windfury harpies&lt;/a&gt; are one of the tauren's natural enemies in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, and the shu'halo collect their feathers for ceremonial headdresses. The tauren take pride as the protector of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, which unsurprisingly caused them to come into conflict with the nearby &lt;a href=\"Bloodfury\"&gt;Bloodfury&lt;/a&gt; harpies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s formed positive relations with the tauren after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelated races and tribes.\nYaungol.\nThough previously indicated to be an ancient offshoot of the tauren race, the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; are actually the ancestors of both the tauren and the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the two offshoot groups, the yaungol remained in the land later known as &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, even after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; separated them from their northern cousins. As a result of living in the harsh &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, a land they are forced to share with the dreaded &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, the yaungol are a much more violent people than their tauren or taunka descendants, using oil and fire to succeed in battle. They were introduced in \"\".\nTaunka.\nAn ancient offshoot of the yaungol race dwelling in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; were thought to have been lost forever but were rediscovered by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish forces based in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Due to dwelling in the unforgiving frozen wastes of Northrend, the taunka have taken to commanding the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; by force rather than asking them for aid. However, much like the tauren, the taunka have chosen to ally themselves with the Horde. They were introduced in \"\".\nHighmountain tauren.\nDirect descendants of the tauren led by &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; who fought in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; have lived in peace in the region of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; for millennia, until the shamanistic &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; rose up and stole the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, shattering their unity. They were introduced in \"\".\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nThe plains of Kalimdor have long been a home to these tremendous nomads. The tauren are a race of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s who long ago developed a complex culture and system of living without the aid of stonework, steel or conquest. This is not to say that the tauren are a race of pacifists, for when they are angered they are capable of retaliating with swift and decisive brutality. Tauren are, in a word, stoic, embodying the strong and silent type with their quiet contemplation. This introspective air combined with their immense size can lead a person to understand as to \"why\" many regard the tauren as a wise and dangerous race. Tauren rarely speak unless there is a true reason to, preferring to act instead of talk. However, once a tauren has learned to interact with a companion, there seems to be a more open and enthusiastic exchange of words. Since tauren warm slowly to non-tauren, they are usually silent and may sometimes appear brooding. If anything, a person could attribute the silence of the tauren on the strife of recent times. Tauren have no love for bloodshed, as their deep spiritual beliefs do not have a place for warfare. The elders of a tribe solve most issues, or two tauren might resolve a conflict with a ritual challenge resembling a duel. Having become members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the introspective race has been involved in more and more conflict, creating a demand for tauren warriors and healers. Many must spend time putting great thought into the actions they perform on the field of battle. Taking another life, whether it is man or beast, is an act filled with great significance and responsibility to the tauren.\nTauren ancestors dwell deep within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir history is relatively short compared to Kalimdor's other races. Ancient accounts suggest they were the result of magical experiments that fused titan with beast, but details are lost to the ages.\nRelations.\nWhen the tauren first encountered the orcs of Thrall's Horde, the tauren recognized the orcs as spiritual brethren. No other race shared such a similar outlook on the world, and the shamans of both races met frequently to discuss the matters of the spirit world. The tauren allied with the orcs out of a shared vision, one of a collective of allies keeping each other well guarded. While the tauren see the orcs and trolls as potential friends to welcome, they rarely trust the Forsaken with more than a nod and a place to set their withered feet.\nTauren also bear no ill will to the members of the Alliance unless threatened by them, although they do make an exception for high elves. The taint of magic on the high elven spirit is a poisonous air to the tauren, a stench of the soul that they cannot tolerate for long. Night elves are quite the opposite; tauren sometimes view them with awe and fear. Tauren and night elves have coexisted on Kalimdor for centuries, and tauren have long seen the Kaldorei as a mythic race of demigods, possessed of great magic and steeped in natural powers. Before the coming of the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the nomadic tauren fought a virtually eternal war against the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, living their humble lives from day to day and camp to camp. Deeply shamanistic, probably even more so than the early orcs, the tauren revered nature; this fact allowed them to maintain some level of peace with the night elves, whom they rarely encountered. The night elves and the tauren were well aware of the other's existence at this time and simply kept their distance without war or any major trade.\nTauren have an extremely close relationship with the orcs with whom they share a similar culture. Cairne is also extremely close friends with Thrall. They are less thrilled at the presence of the Forsaken at Thunder Bluff, who they grudgingly tolerate due to their alliance. The tauren place a strong emphasis on the value of life, and the unlife of the Forsaken stands as an affront to their beliefs.\nIn general, however, the tauren get along with the orcs well and the trolls almost as well; there's still a bit of distrust for the Darkspears, knowing that they only recently abandoned voodoo and cannibalism.\nFaith.\nFor the tauren, nature is the mother of the world, and their faith holds a deep and resonant tone within their hearts. Tauren are connected to the ebb and flow of the world. They revere the spirits of the land and of their ancestors, and they turn to these spirits for wisdom and guidance. This connection manifests in their deeply animistic culture, where druids and shamans stand side by side with warriors and hunters. Tauren do not see a separation between the veneration of nature and the hunt; to hunt is to honor the spirits of nature.\nSpiritual Hierarchy and Tauren Titles.\nThe tauren possess a structure of spiritual hierarchy. The most talented and powerful shaman traditionally hold positions of power, though rulership is not limited to spellcasters. Shaman interpret the voice of the Earth Mother and the wishes of the ancestors; sometimes these interpretations lead to the rise of hunters and warriors in the tribe. Such is the case with Cairne Bloodhoof, the former chieftain. The leader of a tribe uses the title \"chief\" and/or \"chieftain.\" The three most powerful healers in the tribe support the chief, the most powerful of whom takes the title \"seer.\" A chief generally consults his seer and her two contemporaries before making a decision, but this consultation is not required. The leader of the United Tauren Tribes \u2014 Baine Bloodhoof, these days \u2014 also uses the title \"chieftain.\" During council meetings, chiefs make recommendations to the chieftain, but again the final decision is the chieftain's alone to make. \"Chief,\" \"chieftain\", and \"seer\" are genderless titles. Aged female shaman sometimes take the title of \"crone\" or \"elder crone\", which others use as a sign of respect.\nLanguages.\nTauren tend to learn languages for trade or exchanging ideas.\nNames.\nThe language of the tauren is often harsh and low sounding, which is reflected in the names of their children. The last name of a tauren is usually a family name, handed down through the generations. If the tauren has performed some act that has made an impression on the elders of his tribe, however, he may choose to take on his own last name to commemorate that act. Tauren have several names. They receive a name at birth and another during a ceremony to celebrate reaching adulthood. This adult name describes some event in their lives or some notable individual characteristic: for instance, Blackhide, Earthborn, Halfhorn, Hidemaker, Riverwatcher, Scar, Splithoof, Stormchaser, or Windrunner. A tauren may also acquire a third name that he uses when dealing with outsiders.\nAppearance.\nTauren are large, muscular humanoids with bull-like heads. Tauren are mostly muscle, having incredibly developed physiques and brawny frames most suitable for combat. Soft, downy fur (usually quite short) covers the tauren body, with manes growing along head and neck, the lengths of the arms, and the shins. Tauren men and women almost always wear their hair long, and the males prefer braids to any other style. Coloration can range from solid black to blond and even to white, or mottled pelts with a range of spots and different colors.\nHorns are most prominent on males, although all tauren have horns. Tauren wear natural clothing \u2014 leather or hide, and some cloth. They prize jewelry, designing fine trinkets of ivory, bone and amber. From these materials they make bracelets or necklaces, and sometimes adorn their horns or locks with such beautiful displays of artistry."}

The bold Tauren seek only to safeguard their quiet culture from the deathly fires of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. When roused, Tauren are fierce fighters and use their flails and horns alike to smash their enemies. \nInformation.\nTauren are the most powerful ground melee unit, thanks to their Pulverize ability which allows them to spread a massive amount of damage onto nearby ground units in battle. They also have high damage and health, making them ideal for tanking like &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Giant%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain Giants&lt;/a&gt;, though with better offensive capabilities.\nCombine Tauren with &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shamans&lt;/a&gt; and if possible, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; so they can be given Bloodlust and Unholy Frenzy. This increases their attack speed and overall damage. Fast-attacking Tauren can quickly decimate groups of units they can reach.\nIn \"The Frozen Throne\", train several &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Walker%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Spirit Walker&lt;/a&gt;s to accompany the Tauren. Their master spell, Ancestral Spirit, allows them to revive any deceased friendly non-Hero Tauren unit, saving you both resources and training time. Spirit Walkers' Spirit Link spell also ensures the Tauren can survive longer thanks to their already high health.\nAny magic-heavy damage unit such as &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s can easily dispose of Tauren. If Tauren are being supported by spellcasters, have dispels on hand to remove their buffs.\nUpgrades.\nThis is a mandatory research - without it, Tauren are pretty much like &lt;a href=\"Abomination%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Abominations&lt;/a&gt; in combat.\nManual description.\nWhen roused, tauren are fierce fighters and use their &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20totem\"&gt;mighty totems&lt;/a&gt; to smash their enemies into the dust of the plains."}

Originally consisting of numerous scattered tribes, the tauren people came together under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt; and, after receiving their aid against the marauding &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, found fast friends in the newly arrived &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTauren begin their journeys in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cloud%20Mesa\"&gt;Red Cloud Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, an area of rolling plains atop the high cliffs in southern &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. Their adventures through the zone will eventually lead them to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, which is also their capital city. The mount of choice for tauren is the &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;. They speak &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt; as a main language, and &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; as a second.\nFor the Horde, tauren were the only race capable of being &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; gained access to the class in .\nBackground.\nCreation screen description.\n\"Always the tauren strive to preserve the balance of nature and heed the will of their goddess, the Earth Mother. Recently attacked by murderous centaur, the tauren would have been wiped out, save for a chance encounter with the orcs, who helped defeat the interlopers. To honor this blood-debt, the tauren joined the Horde, solidifying the two races' friendship.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"The spiritual and peaceful Tauren cultivate a kinship with the natural world around them in the name of their goddess, the Earth Mother. They live honorable lives and value peace over the warmongering ways of their allies.\"\nClassic opening cutscene.\n\"Once a nomadic people, the tauren roamed the endless plains of the Barrens, hunting the mighty kodo. Scattered across the land, the wandering tribes were united only by their common hatred for their sworn enemy, the marauding centaur. Seeking aid against the centaur, the great chieftain, Cairne Bloodhoof, befriended the savage orcs, who had recently journeyed to Kalimdor. With the orcs\u2019 help, Cairne and his tribe were able to drive back the centaur and claim the grasslands of Mulgore for their own. Upon the windswept mesa of Thunder Bluff, Cairne built a refuge for his people. Over time, the scattered tribes united under a single banner. Though the noble tauren are peaceful in nature, the rites of the Great Hunt are venerated as the heart of their spiritual culture. As a tribesman of Mulgore, you must test your skills in the wild and prove yourself in the Great Hunt.\"\nCataclysm opening cutscene.\n\"Great tragedy has rocked the tauren tribes and shaken their once-stalwart devotion to the Horde. A disagreement between the new orc Warchief, Garrosh Hellscream, and the beloved tauren chieftain, Cairne Bloodhoof, led to a duel that ended in Cairne's death. With his loss, the vile matriarch Magatha Grimtotem launched a murderous attack, attempting to seize control of Thunder Bluff for herself. However, Cairne's brave son, Baine Bloodhoof, successfully repelled the attack and banished the surviving Grimtotem to the farthest reaches of the land. Under Baine's hopeful leadership, the tauren people seek to heal their wounds and restore the balance between the various factions of the Horde. To this end, a new generation of tauren \"Sunwalkers\" has arisen to lead their people into the Light of a new dawn and the promise of rebirth. As a proud tribesman of Mulgore, you must uphold the honor of your people and safeguard the lands of your ancestors.\"\nHistory.\nFor countless generations, the bestial tauren roamed the plains of the Barrens, hunted the mighty kodos, and sought the wisdom of their eternal goddess, the Earth Mother. Scattered across the land, the wandering tribes were united only by a common hatred for their sworn enemy, the marauding centaur. Seeking aid against the centaur, the chieftain, Cairne Bloodhoof, befriended Warchief Thrall and the other orcs, who had recently journeyed to Kalimdor.\nWith the orcs\u2019 help, Cairne and his Bloodhoof tribe were able to drive back the centaur and claim the grasslands of Mulgore for their own. For the first time in hundreds of years, the tauren had a land to call their own. Upon the\nwindswept mesa of Thunder Bluff, Cairne built a refuge for his people, where tauren of every tribe is welcome. Over time, the scattered tauren tribes united under Cairne\u2019s rule. There are a few tribes who disagree about the direction their new nation should take, but all agree that Cairne is the wisest and best suited to lead them towards the future. \nThough the noble tauren are peaceful in nature, the rites of the Great Hunt are venerated as the heart of their spiritual culture. Every tauren, warrior or otherwise, seeks identity both as a hunter and as a child of the Earth Mother. Having reached the age of maturity, you must test your skills in the wild and prove yourself in the Great Hunt.\nCharacter.\nCharacter size.\nThe tauren character model is large. In the beginning, tauren player characters will not notice this; everything is tauren-sized and is scaled to the tauren point of view. Later, when the character interacts with other races, the difference becomes apparent. Occasionally, tight quarters will hamper the tauren player character's movement, especially when mounted and/or having any size-increasing buffs. Any tauren experiencing such problems can use items that decrease one's size or alter their appearance in certain ways (such as &lt;a href=\"Noggenfogger%20Elixir\"&gt;Noggenfogger Elixir&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Savory%20Deviate%20Delight\"&gt;Savory Deviate Delight&lt;/a&gt;) as a workaround.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Ceremoniously decked with the ancient totems of their Tribes, Chiefs uphold the honor and simplicity of Tauren culture. When roused by battle, the gigantic Chiefs employ enormous warblades which are capable of tearing through solid trees with one mighty swipe. The Chiefs are fascinated by the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s, especially their young leader, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. The Chiefs see an opportunity to help the Orcs return to their traditional roots by providing a strong example of honor and courage through all Tauren warriors.\nHero names.\n&lt;a href=\"Marn%20Thunderhorn\"&gt;Marn Thunderhorn&lt;/a&gt;, Tygore Dusthoof, &lt;a href=\"Tam%20Windtotem\"&gt;Tam Windtotem&lt;/a&gt;, Durn Harpyslayer, Kam Ghoststeer, &lt;a href=\"Kel%20Stonebull\"&gt;Kel Stonebull&lt;/a&gt;, Mull Stormhoof, Grok Bloodhorn, Malar Plainstrider, Taur Runetotem.\nInformation.\nThe Tauren Chieftain is useful for both &lt;a href=\"%23War%20Stomp\"&gt;War Stomp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Endurance%20Aura\"&gt;Endurance Aura&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the Chieftain's large size many players have difficulty controlling him. They don't understand how to use him correctly and fail to use him to his full potential. The key is to either keep him away from the enemy, toward the rear of the battle, or to rush him straight into the middle of the enemy then use War Stomp. Whenever he becomes \"stuck\" use War Stomp to clear some room. Top players have excellent success with the Chieftain.\nWar Stomp is a great ability. At its highest level War Stomp stuns for as long as 5 seconds and deals 75 damage; while not a lot, the stun is effective against both Heroes and common units alike for your or allied units to pick off the enemy. &lt;a href=\"%23Shockwave\"&gt;Shockwave&lt;/a&gt; is also effective at killing Heroes as \"nuke\" damage and support units, though generally getting into the most optimal position is unlikely. Endurance Aura is the Chieftain's most dangerous ability in team matches, as it provides all allied units in range an increase in both attack and movement speed, which stacks with Unholy Frenzy and Bloodlust. Reincarnation allows him to dodge death once every four minutes and thus save the cost of an occasional revive.\nFor point spending strategies it is recommended to with Endurance Aura and either Shockwave or War Stomp depending on your setup. Shockwave and War Stomp together is ill-advised because the Chieftain will not have enough mana to consistently use both spells at low levels.\nSpells and abilities.\nShockave.\nShockwave has a damage cap of roughly 12 units affected. Note that this limit will not typically be reached except in team games.\nCast Shockwave on lines of workers mining Gold. Try to cast Shockwave on any troops that are lined up.\nWar Somp.\nFor the best results move into a pack of enemy units then use War Stomp to hit them all.\nWar Stomp can be used to reveal nearby Shadowmelded units.\nndurance Aura (Passive).\nThe Endurance Aura is very helpful to the Orcs and especially helpful to allied units in large team games.\neincarnation (Ultimate).\nReincarnation can allow the Chieftain to take a lot of damage and die on purpose because he can come back to life again. It can also of course allow him to come back to life when he dies by mistake. Reincarnation can save the cost of reviving the Hero, especially at higher levels where the cost and revival time become very high. If the enemy has clearly won and is waiting for him to Resurrect they may kill him again very quickly. When you come back the second time and find yourself surrounded you may wish to use a Scroll of Teleport to get away since you cannot resurrect again.\nSince he dodges death once with Reincarnation, experience is only gained when he is killed before Reincarnation is reset."}

These various myths recount important events from the history of the people, and illustrate the virtues they hold to be important.\nSun rocs feature prominently in primitive tauren mythological cycles.\nA more elaborate version of the early myths is told in the &lt;a href=\"short%20story\"&gt;short story&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Eyes of the Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThunder Bluff scrolls.\n&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;Mists of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe earliest of the tauren myths, the \"Mists of Dawn\", recounts the creation of the world and the tauren race by a deity called the &lt;a href=\"Earthmother\"&gt;Earthmother&lt;/a&gt;. Before the Age of Memory, the Earthmother breathed the world into existence from the golden mists, transforming the clouds into rich, endless fields of grain. She created day and night by alternately opening and closing her right and left eyes, &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; (the sun), and &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt; (the moon), respectively. The shadow of her hands caused the tauren, the shu'halo, the children of the earth, to rise up from the soil. They swore to follow their creator until the end of the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20of%20the%20Earthmother\"&gt;Sorrow of the Earthmother&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next myth of the Shu'halo, chronologically, speaks of the falling away of the tauren from their initial state of grace. Whispers rose up from far beneath the world, where the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s had chained the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. The tauren fell under the sway of these whispers, and learned of malice and deceit. The Earthmother felt a great sorrow at this, and in her grief, tore out her eyes, the sun and moon, and sent them chasing one another across the stars. The Earthmother, now sightless, remained to listen to and guide her children.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Stag%20and%20the%20Moon\"&gt;The White Stag and the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis tale speaks of how the Earthmother gave the Shu'halo the love of the hunt. The tauren became great hunters, but one spirit eluded them, Apa'ro, the white stag (called &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;.) The tauren hunted Apa'ro to the ends of Azeroth, and finally the stag fled into the heavens, where his great antlers became tangled in the stars. As the moon, Mu'sha, chased her brother across the skies, she saw the helpless stag, and immediately fell in love with him.\nMu'sha saved the great stag, and in return he loved her, and they conceived a child, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, a demigod, union of the sky and the earth.\n&lt;a href=\"Forestlord%20and%20the%20First%20Druids\"&gt;Forestlord and the First Druids&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenarius grew to be as proud as his father, and in time befriended the tauren. He taught them the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic ways, how to speak to the trees and animals. With this knowledge, the tauren aided the demigod in keeping the land safe.\n&lt;a href=\"Hatred%20of%20the%20Centaur\"&gt;Hatred of the Centaur&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe last of the traditional tauren stories takes place after the fading of the Mists of Dawn and the beginning of the Age of Memory. When Cenarius eventually left the tauren they were saddened by the loss, and over generations they forgot the bulk of his druidic teachings, though they always retained their respect for the earth.\nThough the tauren forgot how to speak to the forests, they lived in peace, no longer tempted by the dark whispers from beneath the world. In time, however, a great storm rode out from the west. The barbaric &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; swept into the tauren's lands. The tauren fought nobly, but the power of the centaur was too great. The children of the earth were then forced to wander the world as nomads for eons, staying in no place too long."}

However, there was one historic sighting on Sunday, December 2, 2007, of what APPEARED to be the dead tauren rogue Qoi of the Emerald Dream server, found in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Horde denies all knowledge of tauren rogues and asserts that Qoi was an innocent &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; who mysteriously disappeared on a previous occasion, and therefore could not have been in Warsong Gulch as a rogue. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; has stated that, \"The notion of tauren rogues is as preposterous as getting &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; to go outside and get some fresh air. You are all insane.\" If YOU witness a tauren rogue or are victimized by their uncontrolled rampages (that we are sure happen) and live, please call the Society for Telling People That Tauren Rogues Do Exist.\nSecret tauren model info.\nBoth male and female tauren models DO have Stealth animations, complete with the transparency effect. However this is probably because of the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Deception\"&gt;Orb of Deception&lt;/a&gt; or one of the side effects possible from an Outland engineer's teleporter. Actually, several players (mainly level 80 rogues, as only they would know) have claimed to have seen tauren rogues using stealth (Orb of Deception, supposedly) but they have also been seen using &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, and even a few \"very\" stealthy rogue moves that only a rogue would know about.\nTauren rouges.\nFar less common than the ubiquitous (if entirely unseen) tauren rogue is the tauren &lt;a href=\"rouge\"&gt;rouge&lt;/a&gt;. Famous for their eye-raising \"Mulgore chapstick\" special ability, what they lack in stealth, they make up for in style!\nDragonflight.\nOn April 28th, 2022, the tauren rogues revealed themselves when &lt;a href=\"Holinka\"&gt;Holinka&lt;/a&gt; announced that every race would get access to rogues, mages, and priests.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Bluffwatcher\"&gt;Bluffwatcher&lt;/a&gt;s, the tauren rogue &lt;a href=\"Boarton%20Shadetotem\"&gt;Boarton Shadetotem&lt;/a&gt; showed up one day at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and insisted he had been around the whole time.

This structure allows the mighty tauren to make use of the Pulverize ability, a technique that damages enemy forces and adds a unique tool to the tauren's already wide-ranging arsenal.\nOther.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", tauren totems are often found in tauren lands, but not generally as a structure with a use, just as decorations. The flight path in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; is inside a giant totem.\nBig tauren totems frame Mulgore."}

He could take lives, and had, and was highly skilled at disguising himself as other races and working with the shadows. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; thought that &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; had blessed him with a gift, albeit a dark one.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces froze the &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to allow them to cross, Tavar arrived and informed Commander Summermoon that &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was on his way. Delaryn asked what Tavar's skills were, and he demonstrated by stepping into some nearby shadows and disappearing. Delaryn was impressed and told Tavar to gather a team of the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s who had informed him of Malfurion's arrival, then come with her to buy time for the &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt;.\nTavar eventually rounded up a group of druids as he had been told, though Delaryn's lover &lt;a href=\"Ferryn\"&gt;Ferryn&lt;/a&gt; was not among them. Tavar volunteered several vials of poison to Delaryn's plan of setting up an ambush in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt; by gathering night elf corpses and disguising them to appear as if they had been killed by Horde rogues. Delaryn thanked him for it and asked him to demonstrate his skill at disguises. He responded by making himself appear as a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; male, and when she asked how good he was at impersonating &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, he merely grinned. Over the course of hours, Horde infantry led by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Astranaar while the night elves hid in the trees. At Delaryn's signal, Tavar disguised himself as a Forsaken, approached the &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; in which Varok was standing, and told him to come outside by the orders of the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Varok was about to obey, but stopped when his soldier &lt;a href=\"Morka%20Bruggu\"&gt;Morka&lt;/a&gt; asked the disguised elf's name. When Tavar refused to answer, Varok charged at the rogue. Tavar tried drawing his daggers and slicing at Varok's legs, but Saurfang caught him under the chin with his boot and then cleaved through his neck with his axe, instantly shedding Tavar's disguise. Upon seeing how young his opponent was, Saurfang told Tavar to rest easy and that he had died with honor. With his dying breath, Tavar spat on Saurfang's boots.\nFollowing his death, his body was encountered by the Horde in their quest to resurrect Delaryn Summermoon as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;."}

Tavarok has unexpectedly been transformed by the unique emanations, losing the red-tinged corruption of Pathaleon's influence. The white colossus has gained his own free will and uses it to greedily consume all who would stand in his way.\"\nStrategy.\nThis is a straightforward tank-and-spank encounter requiring little to no mobility from the party. No special positioning is required except for possibly ranged and healing classes; they should attack and heal from as far away as possible.\nTavarok will occasionally cast Earthquake. This ability stuns players in a 35 yard radius from it while also inflicting approximately 800 physical damage every 1 second for 3 seconds. Ranged classes are able to out-range the ability. If necessary, step further out of range from Tavarok to bandage.\nTavarok will also cast Crystal Prison, which immobilizes a single target while dealing damage equal to 10% of that target's health every 1 second for 5 seconds; it has a 60 yard range and players should not attempt to out-range it. Party members should keep their health above 50% in the off-chance they are unable to receive heals. If the main healer is affected, then any extra healers, if available, should be ready to heal.\nWhen Tavarok is killed, it can be &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mined&lt;/a&gt;. It can yield 4-8 and various gems, as well as .\nHeroic strategy.\nTavarok retains the same abilities on Heroic mode as it does on Normal, but has Arcing Smash and deals more physical melee damage. Arcing Smash inflicts damage to players in a frontal cone in front of Tavarok. Excluding the tank, melee classes should attack from behind Tavarok to avoid the attack. Otherwise, the strategy is the same as on Normal.\nArcing Smash appears to have an extremely wide damage range; an appropriately-geared Warrior can take normal (non-crushing, non-critical) hits from it for over 11,000 damage! Be sure to keep the tank topped off as much as possible, and keep HOT effects up so that a sudden spike in damage does not cause them to die. Arcing Smash can be dodged and parried, and is mitigated by armor. If your tank does not have at least 12,000HP, you are at serious risk of being 1-shotted if you are unlucky."}

Taylor played a great part during the and campaigns. He was first seen as Captain Taylor when the Alliance began their push toward &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. After being captured and freed from the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, he joined an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; in several missions against them, mirroring &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter the events of Vashj'ir, Taylor was promoted to the rank of admiral and found himself shipwrecked on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; along with young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor and his crew and an adventurer searched for the lost prince throughout the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest%20storyline\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; and recruited the &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Jinyu\"&gt;Pearlfin Jinyu&lt;/a&gt; to the Alliance.\nFollowing the Invasion of Pandaria, Admiral Taylor was sent as a commander of the Alliance forces during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. There, Taylor established a &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. He agreed to protect &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; from the local ogres provided he stayed under house arrest and full-time guard because of his actions during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. His garrison was infiltrated by &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; traitors who killed most of his troops and assassinated him. Taylor's undead spirit still fought alongside the Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak%20storyline\"&gt;Spires of Arak storyline&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the land began to rise up in the area off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; ordered the Alliance navy to immediately claim the land. Taylor was the captain of a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Elite%20Aquatic%20and%20Land%20Forces\"&gt;Stormwind Elite Aquatic and Land Forces&lt;/a&gt; sent to reinforce the hotspot battleground. Along with his crew and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; Taylor sailed out from Stormwind aboard \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Briny%20Cutter\"&gt;The Briny Cutter&lt;/a&gt;\", a position that awarded him a &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Cutlass\"&gt;cutlass&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, they were soon attacked by &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt; and the ship sunk. Taylor, his crew, and the adventurers were rescued by the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Erunak%20Stonespeaker\"&gt;Erunak Stonespeaker&lt;/a&gt;. While Stonespeaker requested for reinforcements from the the Earthen Ring, Taylor and his rescued men were charged with defending the survivors until help arrived. However, his men were in no condition to fight and the Alliance adventurer was tasked with holding off the hostile &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and also acquiring food and armament supplies so that Taylor's unit was combat ready. Taylor's unit fought off a &lt;a href=\"Zin%27jatar\"&gt;Zin'jatar&lt;/a&gt; naga assault but their unit was overwhelmed and subsequently captured. Taylor was enslaved and forced to &lt;a href=\"pearl\"&gt;pearl&lt;/a&gt; mine in &lt;a href=\"Nespirah\"&gt;Nespirah&lt;/a&gt;, the giant clam-like &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; under the thrall of the naga. However, Taylor joined forces with other Alliance slaves, and have fought their way to freedom. When the Alliance adventurer rendezvous with them, they resume their war against the naga. Taylor tasked the adventurer to aid in freeing Nespirah from the naga's influence and succeeds in getting the ancient to revolt against their naga enemies.\nTaylor participated in &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Dvorek\"&gt;Admiral Dvorek&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Ruins of Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Alliance managed to significantly thin the naga's ranks, Dvorek's army suffered heavy casualties; including Admiral Dvorek himself. Taylor and the survivors retreated to &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Wash\"&gt;Tranquil Wash&lt;/a&gt;, where Taylor had the survivors hunker down until &lt;a href=\"Jorlan%20Trueblade\"&gt;Jorlan Trueblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Engineer%20Hexascrub\"&gt;Engineer Hexascrub&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer get help to rescue them. Eventually they succeed in making contact and Taylor dispatched the survivors to the surface and onto the safety of Alliance ships.\nCaptain Taylor went on to prepare for his next operation at &lt;a href=\"Voldrin%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Voldrin's Hold&lt;/a&gt;. There, he went on to hunt Ozumat on the \"&lt;a href=\"Pincer%20X2\"&gt;Pincer X2&lt;/a&gt;\". Although the &lt;a href=\"gnomish\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; engaged Ozumat, Ozumat escaped. The Alliance reconnaissance team in the meanwhile, established a base in &lt;a href=\"Darkbreak%20Cove\"&gt;Darkbreak Cove&lt;/a&gt;. After the adventurer reported the intelligence the reconnaissance team gathered about the hostile wildlife to Taylor at &lt;a href=\"Promontory%20Point\"&gt;Promontory Point&lt;/a&gt;, Taylor went on to aid his Earthen Ring allies in purging some of the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Fireplume%20Trench\"&gt;Fireplume Trench&lt;/a&gt; wildlife and freeing creatures such as &lt;a href=\"Wil%27hai\"&gt;Wil'hai&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Tentacle%20Horror\"&gt;Tentacle Horror&lt;/a&gt;s. Taylor went on to help the Earthen Ring in liberating a dying &lt;a href=\"L%27ghorek\"&gt;L'ghorek&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;'s influence. Taylor tasked the adventurer to slay the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Fiend\"&gt;Nether Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s protecting the Twilight Hammer &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Undershell\"&gt;Undershell&lt;/a&gt;. In L'ghorek's final moments, it revealed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;' intention to wage war on &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe naga inevitably revealed themselves to be allied with &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt;s, showing they were a part of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt; and have begun their invasion of &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;'s domain. Eventually receiving backup in the form of the crew of the submarine \"Pincer X2\", Taylor and the adventurer took part in the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt; from the naga and faceless ones. As Erunak was captured by Ozumat, Taylor and the adventurer followed it down into the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;, where the duo freed Erunak, slew &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt;, and defeated the naga and faceless one interlopers.\nTaylor later returned to Stormwind where he was promoted for his brave actions and was awarded with &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Ceremonial%20Sword\"&gt;a ceremonial sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nTaylor has been promoted to Admiral, and was given command of Stormwind's royal flagship, \"&lt;a href=\"Wreck%20of%20the%20Vanguard\"&gt;The Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;\", which would later run aground at the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor was found by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; as an unconscious prisoner of the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hozen\"&gt;Forest Hozen&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of fellow prisoner &lt;a href=\"Bold%20Karasshi\"&gt;Bold Karasshi&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer aided in rescuing their imprisoned comrades and found sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Village\"&gt;Pearlfin Village&lt;/a&gt;. When Admiral Taylor recovered, he met with &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt; who informed him that the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; was unable to provide support and advised him to make do with the agents and the friendly locals to secure the Alliance's foothold. As the SI:7 agents continued the search for Prince Anduin, they discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces had allied themselves with the Forest Hozen. To counter this new development, Admiral Taylor allied himself with the &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Jinyu\"&gt;Pearlfin Jinyu&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor trained the Pearlfin in their superior military knowledge and equipped them with Alliance weaponry. After training a contingent of jinyu troops, Admiral Taylor tasked the adventurer to lead them in skirmishes against the hostile Forest Hozen. The war with the Horde eventually culminated in a battle at &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, where Taylor led the Alliance forces. The violence and hatred from the battle however, broke the seal that the statue protected and released the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;. The sha killed many combatants on both sides and the adventurer rescued Taylor and other Alliance soldiers from the sha's fallout. \n&lt;a href=\"Commander%20Hsieh\"&gt;Commander Hsieh&lt;/a&gt; informed the adventurer of Taylor's awakening in &lt;a href=\"Binan%20Village\"&gt;Binan Village&lt;/a&gt; and they entered the room shared by Taylor and &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; (who was also heavily wounded in the battle) at &lt;a href=\"Binan%20Village\"&gt;Binan Village&lt;/a&gt;, witnessing the two nearly come to blows. Commander Hsieh decided to loan the Admiral &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Hunting%20Bow\"&gt;her hunting bow&lt;/a&gt;. With the adventurer's help, Taylor later made an appearance in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; where he and the adventurer worked to recruit the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Westwind%20Rest\"&gt;Westwind Rest&lt;/a&gt; by aiding them against the hostile &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandfall.\nHe later makes an appearance in &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, where he served as a major Alliance quest giver and aids in its defense during the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing%20%28scenario%29\"&gt;Lion's Landing (scenario)&lt;/a&gt;. He tasked Alliance adventurers to bring &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Connelly\"&gt;Agent Connelly&lt;/a&gt; out of retirement and aid him in his endeavors to spy on the Horde. Furthermore, Taylor directed Alliance adventurers to aid prominent Alliance heroes such as Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sarannha%20Skyglaive\"&gt;Sarannha Skyglaive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt; in their endeavors to support the Alliance war effort and prevent the Horde from utilizing the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;. After Anduin was attacked by Garrosh for destroying the Bell, Taylor was seen in the Lion's Landing keep with the hurt Anduin.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nTaylor is present on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; overseeing the Celestial Court with &lt;a href=\"Lyalia\"&gt;Lyalia&lt;/a&gt;, in Celestial Tournament along with his comrades. He also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; helping the Alliance kill &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; soldiers in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor his time in Pandaria, Taylor was awarded a &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt; as a gift from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20Boof\"&gt;Brewmaster Boof&lt;/a&gt; gave him a &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Keg%20Tapper\"&gt;Keg Tapper&lt;/a&gt; wishing to drink with him again, and the pandaren from &lt;a href=\"Paw%27don%20Village\"&gt;Paw'don Village&lt;/a&gt; gave him a &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Boot%20Knife\"&gt;boot knife&lt;/a&gt; for saving them from the Horde.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nTaylor arrived in and established his &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. However, his subordinate &lt;a href=\"Ephial\"&gt;Ephial&lt;/a&gt; betrayed him and turned the entire population into undead, including the admiral. Taylor's spirit was imprisoned and tortured, then turned by Ephial into the &lt;a href=\"bone%20wraith\"&gt;bone wraith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soulscythe\"&gt;Soulscythe&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing an extensive investigation, Soulscythe and Ephial were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; and Horde adventurers. Taylor's spirit was then released from the necromancer's control, and afterward joined the Alliance adventurer as a garrison follower. &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison%20Log\"&gt;Admiral Taylor's Garrison Log&lt;/a&gt; details these events. \nHis &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Staff%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; can also be obtained, which bears the faded note \"no hard feelings.\" The exact meaning of this remark has been debated, with speculation including it potentially referring to the battle of the Jade Forest and the destruction of the Jade Serpent monument or an overture of forgiveness to Horde adventurers who he had done battle with on numerous occasions.\nTaylor can also be seen watching fights between &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;garrison commanders&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Coliseum\"&gt;Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;. \nShadowlands.\nAdmiral Taylor has made it to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, lamenting his fate.

She is tall and has black hair.\nHistory.\nDue to her family being sympathetic to &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt;'s coup with &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, they were exiled by &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and threatened with execution if they returned. She subsequently joined the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; and served as a faithful friend and lieutenant to its leader &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt;.

However, Apari refused and began to become increasingly obsessed with vengeance against Talanji and Bwonsamdi. Though disheartened by her mistress's decision Tayo continued to serve up until Apari sought to injure and sacrifice children in order to weaken the loa of graves. Outraged by this Tayo personally stopped Apari which caused the latter to strike her across the face leaving her stunned. Apari then declared that she was on the precipice of death, sought to only live in order to see both Bwonsamdi and Talanji dead, and how no one would stop her. Disgusted by this declaration Tayo left, which Apari allowed due to her belief that she would come crawling back.\nAcknowledging that Apari was no longer the leader she knew and admired, Tayo sought to give her old friend a merciful end. Thus she made the decision to aid the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces within &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; against the Widow's Bite and the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; who were locked in combat with Bwonsamdi. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; noted that her aid proved instrumental in saving them from Blightcaller's traps and during the fighting itself she and Talanji killed Apari. Though Nathanos managed to escape the battlefield, the Horde was successful in preventing Bwonsamdi's death.\nDue to her aid, Tayo was allowed to rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. She then subsequently asked and was granted permission to serve as Talanji's ambassador to the Horde. Talanji sent her with the Horde leaving Zandalar to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;."}

Since the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; had abandoned such things, seeing an Ancient of Arcane would have been an extremely rare occurrence in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. This, however, could change when the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; are welcomed back. For example, Arcosin is affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and resides at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Estulan\"&gt;Tower of Estulan&lt;/a&gt;, which is staffed predominately by the Shen'dralar.\nThe Warp Splinter seems to be a twisted creation by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; researchers in the &lt;a href=\"Botanica\"&gt;Botanica&lt;/a&gt;.

Apparently the power contained by the Warp Splinter was too much for both the elves and the Splinter itself to handle, causing the nearby experiments to run amok and overpower the researchers. The Splinter itself is clearly confused with whether to refrain from fighting or to defeat the players, possibly due to its mind being twisted as well.\nThe night elves do not have any reservations about the existence of these ancients, or that they represent the arcane, seeing as their own druids wish to regrow Warp Splinter, this time free of all corruption. It may simply be that regular night elves do not need them, and as such do not actively seek to grow them."}

Andarin is a solid fighter and a good representative of member of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce, Lightblade, wielding a bastard sword, was fighting a losing battle against a &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;.

He cast his famous spell, \"Lightblade's Final Strike\", sacrificing much of his life (enough to make him unconscious but not kill him outright).

The undead, who was once a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, proposed him a deal: Trevor would not alarm the guards if Andarin would speak on Trevor's behalf asking the Argent Dawn to accept him as a priest in their ranks. The deal was made, and while the paladin kept the guards at bay, the undead freed two prisoners, a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and a young girl that Trevor knew well."}

She was the last obstacle of the &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20storyline%23Insurrection\"&gt;Insurrection&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAndaris is first mentioned in an undelivered message from &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;, appointed as the new First Arcanist during the Insurrection, Andaris and &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; collaborated on the time-locking spell wave that defeated the combined elven armies outside the front gates of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Andaris sent a fel crystal containing a message to &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, taunting her with Ly'leth's fate and to come face her at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt;. When the player and Thalyssra arrive with a few &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;Withered&lt;/a&gt; to confront the new First Arcanist, they are greeted by the sight of her image holding Ly'leth in chains and the Lunastre nobles being harassed by several Duskwatch soldiers. With her fel magic, she kills the Withered soldiers in one blow and disappears.\nThe Duskwatch erect a barrier around the Sanctum of Order in order to keep the Nightwell breach under the Sanctum contained, after disrupting several leyline conduits keeping the barrier up, it is soon brought down by Valtrois. Oculeth then sends the adventurer to the Sanctum, however, Andaris had already noticed the disruption and interfered with Oculeth's teleportation, which sends the adventurer to the Terrace of Order instead. Thalyssra anticipated this, and the telemancy orbs used to summon Fel-resistant Withered would allow the adventurer to fight through the Duskwatch defenses. Andaris sent her personal guard &lt;a href=\"Dalion\"&gt;Dalion&lt;/a&gt; to defend the entrance only for him to fall. Andaris was finally confronted before the way into the Sanctum Depths, the combined might of the adventurer and fel-resistant Withered overcame Andaris, and she was finally slain. Her death stopped the disruption of Oculeth's telemancy, allowing him to teleport Thalyssra and Khadgar to the Sanctum and secure the breach.\nRelatives.\nAndaris is likely related to &lt;a href=\"Allaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Allaris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt;."}

One of the largest cities in northern Lordaeron, Andorhal was the main agricultural distribution point in the region. It is from here that the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; started to spread. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; would eventually take control of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Andorhal\"&gt;ruined city&lt;/a&gt;, until the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; to expel the undead. The waters around Andorhal are still contaminated by the plague.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s reign of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, many humans expanded the nation settling in the &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;northern lands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, formerly ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s. These humans populated the &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt; some 2,700 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and founded new Arathi settlements.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, with its origins tracing back to the chaos of the Troll Wars, was founded some centuries later in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It became a predominant human religion and the church constructed temples and shrines throughout the human lands. Among the oldest and most revered of these holy sites were the temples in the Eastweald, including Andorhal. \nThe region eventually fell under the sway of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nScourge invasion.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Andorhal was the distribution center for all agricultural supplies in the northern provinces of Lordaeron, east of &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;. It was used by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; to spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, infecting the grain there, which was sent to different northern villages in the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Road\"&gt;King's Road&lt;/a&gt; and towns such as &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, Andorhal was gripped by the original outbreak of the plague but remained uncontrolled by &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; agents. When Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; entered the city to investigate, they found burning buildings and no villagers nor undead. Suddenly, Kel'Thuzad appeared to tell them who he was and what he had done but quickly escaped. The prince of Lordaeron initially searched the city for the empty granaries and then resolved to kill Kel'Thuzad. Galloping north of the city, Arthas killed any undead he found, and when he discovered the necromancer, he killed him.\nAfter Arthas became the first &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; and champion of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, he led the Scourge in the kingdom and began the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas set out to Andorhal to recover the remains of Kel'Thuzad as per his new instructions from &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, expecting no one but undead at the charred timbers around the city. However, despite the horrifying conditions, Andorhal was one of the few places in Lordaeron still under Alliance control. There, Uther and many of the surviving paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; had gathered in the city. They use it as a headquarters from which they launched attacks against the Scourge. Close to the ruined city, Kel'Thuzad's tomb was under the watch of &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ballador%20the%20Bright\"&gt;Ballador the Bright&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Truthbearer\"&gt;Sage Truthbearer&lt;/a&gt;, and their forces maintaining a strong hold over the city and the surrounding area.\nWhen the corrupted prince attacked, the paladins were overwhelmed as Andorhal fell at the hands of the Scourge. The watches of Andorhal, much like the large clock on the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, were all frozen in time at three o'clock. On the outskirts of the city, moving slowly along the road, on foot, was a small funeral procession, Arthas' next target. The death knight marched against the military funeral of several men in armor in a single file, with &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; in the center carrying the &lt;a href=\"urn%20of%20King%20Terenas\"&gt;urn of King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;. The former teacher and student dueled, and the death knight managed to kill Uther and take his father's urn.\nThe desperate defenders of the city, seeing no hope of rescue, had set the city ablaze so that the Scourge couldn't raise more warriors.\nThe city, however, remained in the hands of the Scourge for the years to come.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the consolidation of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; by the Scourge, Andorhal became a regional bastion effectively separating the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; from those still under mortal control. Later, Andorhal became the headquarters of the lich &lt;a href=\"Araj%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Araj the Summoner&lt;/a&gt; who used the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Andorhal\"&gt;ruined city&lt;/a&gt; as the base of operations, from which he oversaw the use of the mighty plague cauldrons situated throughout the Western Plaguelands.\nThe roads leading north out of Andorhal were occasionally patrolled by forces of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 either survivors of Andorhal or troops sent from nearby &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe flow of time was disrupted here and Chromie speculated to be the workings of the Scourge.\nFailed Retaking of Andorhal.\nDuring the time of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", Andorhal was &lt;a href=\"Retaking%20of%20Andorhal\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Maddox\"&gt;Maddox&lt;/a&gt; and an army of &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. However, the army consisted of just 100 soldiers and they were easily beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; started making major efforts to expel the Scourge from Andorhal. The ruined city became a warzone between the Alliance under the command of &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, and the Forsaken under the command of &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance established a hold on the southwestern side of the city, reinforced by &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken obtained a strong front on the northeastern side of the town. &lt;a href=\"Araj%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Araj the Summoner&lt;/a&gt; leads what remains of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s forces in Andorhal, their power diminished by the death of their lord. \nThis major conflict in this war effort came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, in which \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" players can participate. The combined forces relentlessly slaughtered Scourge and ultimately slayed Araj. Thassarian and Koltira exchanged pleasantries, and gave each other time before they had to ultimately come to battle with one another. Shortly after, battle was joined, with Alliance militiamen taking the field, having come North to reclaim and rebuild Lordaeron and in hope of farmland that was promised, but was actually unavailable. Despite this advantage, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; had been observing the battle, and would not have it lost. Using &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, she turns the tide of battle, forcing the Alliance to flee the city.\nDespite the Forsaken victory, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was displeased with what she perceived as weakness on Koltira's part, knowing of his long-standing comradeship with Thassarian and the truce they made in the field. Confronting him after the victory, Sylvanas had Koltira taken to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; so that he can be made to serve the Horde - or, more specifically, the Forsaken - exclusively, without any regard for his prior service to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nOne of the first human settlements to contract the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;undead plague&lt;/a&gt;, Andorhal is in the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s grip. The city was once the center for grain distribution across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and was instrumental in the Scourge's campaign. Beneath Andorhal is the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;School of Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, a sprawling subterranean labyrinth akin to &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; but on a much smaller scale. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; horrors, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Damned cultists&lt;/a&gt; haunt the tunnels. &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;, a mummified wretch, teaches students how to raise the dead in the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s name. Formerly a &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; wizard, he betrayed his masters for dark power and now revels in undeath. His graduates go on to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge's capital in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvolvement of the Infinite Dragonflight?\nThe appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and their role in the attempted altering of key events in the history of Azeroth may point to them as the ones who are truly behind the attacks on the timeline here, instead of the Scourge. Although Chromie suggests that it is the work of the Scourge she wasn't completely sure (hence the use of the phrase \"most likely\"), and so - as she and the other bronze dragons were probably unaware of the existence of the Infinite flight at that time - directed the blame to the most powerful malevolent force known to exist in the area."}

{"id": "93928", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=93928", "title": "Doomguard (warlock minion)", "text": "The Doomguard is a temporary &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20pet\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt; available to &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. It can only be summoned via &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Ritual of Doom&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThe Doomguard lasts for 25 seconds once spawned. Because it is a low probability occurance on an already difficult to achieve event (killing a target with Doom), it cannot be relied upon and exists more for class fantasy than any actual notable damage source.\nAbilities.\nThe Doomguard's single ability is &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Bolt\"&gt;Doom Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, which is cast on the warlocks' current target. Like all warlock minions, it also benefits from &lt;a href=\"Avoidance%20%28passive%29\"&gt;Avoidance (passive)&lt;/a&gt;, reducing non-player AoE damage taken by 90%.\nHistory.\nThe Doomguard used to be summoned via Curse of Doom (now simply &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Ritual of Doom&lt;/a&gt;. Curse of Doom, when dealing the killing damage to any mob that granted experience, would summon a Doomguard. However, the summoned Doomguard was not under the warlock's control, and would immediately attack the warlock upon spawning. The Doomguard was quite capable of killing the warlock and his allies, and had to be enslaved via &lt;a href=\"Enslave%20Demon\"&gt;Enslave Demon&lt;/a&gt; in order to control him, although he could resist enslavement, or break free later on and begin attacking the warlock again.\nAlternatively, Ritual of Doom could be used to summon a Doomguard, albeit by sacrificing the life of a random party member. The Doomguard summoned from the ritual was automatically under the control of the warlock for 15 minutes, and despawned after that time. The spell was later changed so that party members did not die outright from the summoning.\nThese two summon sources were removed in the expansion. In their place, the ability &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Doomguard\"&gt;Summon Doomguard&lt;/a&gt; was added as a single-target summon with a 10 minute cooldown. At the time, it would only attack targets with &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Bane of Agony&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Bane of Doom&lt;/a&gt; on them, and would cease attacking if no targets had one of those two debuffs. In the expansion, the reliance on Bane of Agony or Bane of Doom was removed, instead attacking the warlock's current target for the duration. In , Summon Doomguard's cooldown was reduced to 3 minutes and it became the primary single-target DPS cooldown for warlocks for all specializations, sharing a cooldown with &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Infernal\"&gt;Summon Infernal&lt;/a&gt; (which was used as an AoE cooldown). The Doomguard was also available as a permanent pet option via the talent &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20Supremacy\"&gt;Grimoire of Supremacy&lt;/a&gt;, available to all 3 specializations.\nIn , Summon Doomguard was removed entirely in favor of specialization-specific demon cooldowns, and the Doomguard itself was restored to a spawn from Doom killing blows, though now a low probability spawn rather than a guaranteed spawn as it was originally from Curse of Doom.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; can no longer summon Doomguards. Instead, &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Ritual of Doom&lt;/a&gt; was returned, although it has hefty drawbacks (requiring 5 people to do the ritual, of which one will die, and the Doomguard itself starts hostile and has to be &lt;a href=\"Subjugate%20Demon\"&gt;subjugated&lt;/a&gt; by the warlock)"}

{"id": "15300", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15300", "title": "Doomhammer", "text": "The Doomhammer is a powerful hammer that was crafted long ago in a pool of elemental lava on the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. It is a namesake relic passed down from father to son, and was given to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; as a testament of faith and honor during the salvation of the orcs. Although the hilt of the hammer has been replaced, the actual hammerhead itself has endured as a testament of the crafter's skill.\nBackground.\nDespite its name, Doomhammer is a weapon of good, bringing doom to enemies and upholding the family's honor. The head of the hammer was forged in a pool of &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; lava on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; by an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Gelnar\"&gt;Gelnar&lt;/a&gt;. When Gelnar crafted an oak handle for the weapon, the Doomhammer was complete. Both the hammer and the name was then passed down from father to son for generations until it was passed to &lt;a href=\"Telkar%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Telkar Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, father of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nYoung Orgrim came to admire the hammer, knowning one day it would be his own. In a meeting between Orgrim, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim told of a prophecy about the Doomhammer saying that \"The last of the Doomhammer line will use it to bring first salvation and then doom to the orc people. Then it will pass into the hands of one who is not of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;, all will change again, and it will once again be used in the cause of justice.\"\nAs is the nature of such prophecies, the orcs did indeed fall, all due to the manipulations of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. After using it in the First and Second Wars, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt;, last of the Doomhammer line, passed the weapon on to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the one who redeemed the orcish race and completed the prophecy.\n\"\"'Through blood the weapon shall pass, as surely as night begets day,\"\nUntil the elements cry unheard, and pride turns to unbridled rage.\nThe last of the line shall deliver salvation and doom upon his kind.\nHonor will be undone and all will be lost, before it is found again.\nA stranger will raise the hammer high, and with it justice shall reign.\nAll of the Doomhammer bloodline's successors bore this ominous prophecy on their great shoulders, divined long ago by the Blackrock clan's elder shaman. Yet for generations, these tidings of doom went unfulfilled. The legendary Doomhammer weapon became a standard of pride and honor, its immense black stone as indomitable as the orcs' fierce spirit.\nWhen the heirloom passed to &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and the mighty Orcish Horde rose to power, the weapon met no equal in battle. Innumerable foes suffered its wrath, the warhammer even shattering Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s fabled rune-etched &lt;a href=\"blade%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;blade of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; before crushing the human's skull.\nOnly too late did Orgrim realize that he was the harbinger of doom prophesied by his clan's ancestral shaman. Although he had slain the power-hungry Horde warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and many of the depraved warlocks who had destroyed the orcs' culture, Orgrim's people were ultimately defeated, and most of them were rounded up in human internment camps to live out their days in shame and lethargy.\nThe prophecy, however, had not yet run its course. So it was that Orgrim, mortally wounded while fighting to free his people from imprisonment, bestowed the Doomhammer on one who was not of his clan or bloodline: &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Wielding the hammer as a symbol of hope, the young orc liberated his race and rekindled the pride and heritage that the orcs had abandoned as the bloodthirsty Horde.\nThe image of a wolf was later added onto the Doomhammer to denote Thrall's hereditary ties to the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, but little else has changed about the weapon. Through war and peace, the hammer has remained at Thrall's side, an embodiment of his race's strength as it was in ancient times, and a symbol of doom to the enemies who would dare threaten the orcs' freedom and honor.\nLegion.\nDuring a battle at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Doomhammer falls from Thrall's grasp and into the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, where it lands in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. After it is retrieved by Thrall, &lt;a href=\"Stormcaller%20Mylra\"&gt;Stormcaller Mylra&lt;/a&gt;, and the new &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall gives it to the Farseer and leaves to think. Mylra wonders if the Doomhammer's prophecy was in fact about the Farseer, not about Thrall.\nThe hammer remained in the leader of the Earthen Ring's possession and was used in tandem with other legendary artifacts and heroes to combat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. It was used to seal the power of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; after it was stabbed into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; alongside the other gathered artifacts that the heroes of Azeroth had found to combat the demons. Drained of its mighty power, it is unknown as to the fate of the Doomhammer after this; as the Farseer either kept it or discarded it as &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;another artifact&lt;/a&gt; was.\nAppearance.\nAs a young orc, Orgrim described the Doomhammer to &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; as an enormous hammer with a black, blunt, and powerful stone; the shaft made of carefully crafted oak wood. Over the years, the shaft had had to be replaced, but the stone itself had never been chipped.\nTony Swatton of Man at Arms was commissioned to create a real-life version of the artifact skin Blackhand's Fate for Blizzard. The head is 16\" long with 10\" square faces, and a 22\" oak handle. If it was solid metal, Swatton estimated it would weigh in at 250-300 lbs.\nThe appearance of Doomhammer has changed over time. When it was first depicted in the \"\", it bore a jagged blade at the end and two spikes on each side. By the time it was passed onto &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Clans\"&gt;Lord of the Clans&lt;/a&gt;\", these blades and spikes had been removed.\nAfter the weapon was passed to Thrall, the wolf's-head symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; was added to the hammer's formerly plain head. This symbol can be seen in the cinematic where Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; battle &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; (it most visible just before Thrall throws it at Mannoroth when it glows brightly). \nIn the RPG.\nThis greathammer is composed of solid granite on an oak handle. The granite is wrapped twice around with gold-studded leather.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Doomhammer had a unique, black metal appearance. Within the game files, there was an unused Doomhammer model which resembled the hammer shown in the \"Warcraft III\" cinematic.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"PTR\"&gt;PTR&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.3\"&gt;patch 3.3.3&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall used the Doomhammer model instead of the previous look-alike hammer. When the patch went live, however, Thrall was given yet another plain hammer.\nCataclysm.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2\"&gt;patch 4.2&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Bonds\"&gt;Elemental Bonds&lt;/a&gt; quest chain, the Doomhammer had the model from the &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.3\"&gt;patch 3.3.3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"PTR\"&gt;PTR&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%204.3\"&gt;patch 4.3&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall was given an updated, seemingly smaller, version of the unique Doomhammer model.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall intended to end the warchief's life with the Doomhammer, but he was stopped by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. \nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn the alternate version of there were two Doomhammers, one wielded by Thrall and one wielded by the alternate . What happened to the latter after its wielder's death is unknown.\nLegion.\nDoomhammer is an &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; available to &lt;a href=\"Shaman%23Specializations\"&gt;enhancement shaman&lt;/a&gt;s in \"\".\nAfter killing &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall has been unable to use it properly as the elements have gone silent to him. During a battle at the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, it flies out of his hands into the great whirlpool and down into &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Elite (Boss), and has exactly the same abilities as the normal &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Reaver%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Fel Reaver&lt;/a&gt; except from the overrun ability that is described below. It is much stronger and hurts a lot more. He can crit tanks for 15k. It is interesting to note that this boss used to patrol the zone in the Burning Crusade Beta and for a short while during retail, but this function was later removed due to complaints.\nAbilities.\nIf you are killed by Doomwalker you gain the debuff \"&lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Death\"&gt;Mark of Death&lt;/a&gt;\". This debuff (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; bosses), means that you can only attempt this boss once every 15 minutes.\nDoomwalker at level 80.\nIt is possible to solo Doomwalker at 80 with end game raid gear, but is highly dangerous. As with most such adventures, it requires a balance of damage and self healing ability. As well, there are occasional people leveling in the zone, which on PvP servers may lead to &lt;a href=\"ganking\"&gt;ganking&lt;/a&gt;.\nA usual minimum approach is to have separate well geared Tank and Heals, with as many DPS (optional) as want to come along. Making use of his large aggro radius and position can help offset the chance of a chain lightning jump. When casting earthquake, all players will be stunned, but only around 8k damage is dealt. Most topped off players will survive and this can be healed through. Recommended you save your cooldowns for when it enrages at 20% health remaining, since all damage at that time will be doubled, and this will be the most likely cause of a wipe.\nDoomwalker will drop 2 level 70 BoE items and around 500 gold. He can be downed within 10\u201325 minutes depending on performance and attendance."}

Impressed by the sight of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, she then insists on visiting the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;other side&lt;/a&gt; of the portal as well.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", O'ros gives its blessing to Dornaa and the adventurer and tells the latter of the child's future potential, caused \"in no small part\" by the kindness the adventurer has shown her. O'ros then recommends the adventurer to bring Dornaa to Farseer Nobundo in the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Hall\"&gt;Crystal Hall&lt;/a&gt;. She recognizes the farseer from her dreams, and he asks if she can summon the elements as she'd shown him in those dreams. She successfully does so, much to Nobundo's amazement. He tells the adventurer that he'll send a letter to &lt;a href=\"Orphan%20Matron%20Mercy\"&gt;Orphan Matron Mercy&lt;/a&gt; requesting that Dornaa be allowed to move to the \"Exodar\" for training, and asks the hero to keep her safe until then. Dornaa also asks the adventurer to take her to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; to see a &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;.

Before they leave, the adventurer buys Dornaa a &lt;a href=\"Toy%20Dragon\"&gt;toy dragon&lt;/a&gt; souvenir, and she says that she hopes to one day have a real dragon as a friend.\nThe adventurer then brings Dornaa back to the orphanage, and she gives them one of her favorite pets to remember her by.

Dorthar went on to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; himself, the first of his race to do so.\nBiography.\nDorthar originally comes from &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; and claims to know the area better than anyone else. He is smaller, weaker, and more misshapen than most centaur, and he originally lacked the combat skills of the rest of his people.\nDorthar was one of the centaur who joined the army of the High Khan &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt;. While the army was camped in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Verdrak\"&gt;Verdrak&lt;/a&gt;\u2014whom Dorthar admired\u2014took him out for a nightly patrol, only to then reveal that they planned to kill him as he was deemed to be too weak and repulsive to fit in Aratas' vision of a \"pure\" centaur race. The execution was interrupted when &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; appeared and killed the perfect ones. Dorthar, who had at first mistaken Malgar for the vengeful spirit of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt; himself, surrendered and told the orc about the perfect ones and their plan to conquer &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Malgar left Dorthar alive and returned to Aratas' camp while Dorthar rejoined the centaur army.\nThe following dawn, a battle erupted between the centaur and the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; militia. Dorthar hid away from the fighting until Aratas tried to kill Malgar by throwing a spear at him. Dorthar saved the orc's life by jumping in front of him with his shield. The Garad'kra defeated Aratas' forces, but the khan himself escaped back to Desolace. Feeling abandoned by his kind, Dorthar approached the Garad'kra. He was nearly killed by &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra Valandril&lt;/a&gt; until Malgar intervened, allowing Dorthar to tell the Garad'kra about how Aratas had enslaved many orcs and planned to invade &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with his army. Dorthar accompanied Malgar and the Garad'kra as they set out on a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; journey to Desolace to stop Aratas.\nDuring the voyage, the Garad'kra's leader &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt; helped teach Dorthar how to fight and use his strengths and weaknesses to his advantage; she told him that although he was not as large and swift as other centaur, he had \"the heart of a wolf\". The rest of the Garad'kra soon joined in on the exercise, knitting the team closer together and training them to work as a unit. Dorthar also formed a friendship with &lt;a href=\"Ironhoof\"&gt;Ironhoof&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, despite the long rivalry between their two peoples. Malgar noted the irony in the situation: the Garad'kra had set out to kill centaur, and yet it was a discarded centaur who brought them together. \nOn arrival in Desolace, Dorthar provided Shagara and Ironhoof with information about the geography around &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; and helped them form a plan. While the Garad'kra confronted Aratas outside Maraudon, Dorthar and Malgar freed the orc slaves. Dorthar let Malgar do the fighting, since he couldn't bring himself to kill his fellow centaur. He then offered to lead the slaves to safety and convinced a reluctant Malgar to join his friends in the fight against Aratas. With Malgar's help, the Garad'kra were able to defeat both Aratas and his &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;elemental father&lt;/a&gt;, ending the centaur threat and saving the Horde.\nDorthar accompanied the Garad'kra back to Orgrimmar. Weeks after Aratas' defeat, in a ceremony in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; attended by Malgar and the rest of his new friends, Dorthar swore the &lt;a href=\"%3ABlood%20Oath%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;:Blood Oath of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; and joined the Garad'kra, thereby becoming the first centaur to join the Horde."}

Prior to the &lt;a href=\"shattering\"&gt;shattering&lt;/a&gt;, he was deceased, but could be resurrected as &lt;a href=\"Helcular%27s%20Remains\"&gt;Helcular's Remains&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Helcular%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Helcular's Revenge&lt;/a&gt; quest chain. If attacked by Alliance he summons &lt;a href=\"Puppet%20of%20Helcular\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; to attack them.\nBackground.\nHelcular was a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; living in the Hillsbrad Foothills, presumably having some affiliation with &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; (and later, possibly, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, as his appearance in Old Hillsbrad predates the debut of the Scourge plague). Helcular was preparing to transform himself into a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; when a human lynch mob from Southshore found the cave where he was performing the ritual, and subsequently murdered him. He was buried in the Southshore graveyard.\nOne of Helcular's apprentices, &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Thaivand\"&gt;Novice Thaivand&lt;/a&gt;, resides at the town of &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. Now a member of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, he directed members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Helcular%27s%20Rod\"&gt;Helcular's Rod&lt;/a&gt; and begin the process of resurrecting him, so the dead mage could have his revenge on the people of Southshore.\nFollowing his resurrection, and having survived his onslaught against &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, Helcular has decided to join the Forsaken just as his &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Thaivand\"&gt;apprentice&lt;/a&gt; did years before. Helcular now seeks to remove the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; threat from the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20Queen\"&gt;Banshee Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s sphere of influence, and expresses the belief that his new opponent &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; should have been killed in Silverpine. He seems to be eager to find a method by which to remove the worgen's immunity to the curse of &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt;s of Hillsbrad, Helcular led the forces of Azeroth in defending it, apparently having learned more powerful &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt; as he used a variety of spells against demons in &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. He was also mounted on a skeletal steed. He claimed that by defending Hillsbrad, the forces have successfully defended all of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from invasion, but that the fight with the Legion is far from over.\nQuotes.\nIn time, we will rebuild this place and restore it to its former glory - minus all of the annoying humans.\nConversation with Kel'Thuzad.\nAt some point during their patrol in Old Hillsbrad, Kel'Thuzad and Helcular stop and begin conversing... a conversation that seems to indicate that Kel'Thuzad taught him the art of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;:"}

In doing so, Helcular, a 44 elite mob, will be resurrected and wander around the &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; graveyard attacking nearby people until he is killed or until he expires (about 10 minutes).\nThis quest used to be incredibly disappointing, as &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt; is a 44 elite and the &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; guards used to be L55 non-elites\u2014easily capable of dispatching him solo. However, post-2.0, the SS guards have been dropped to L45, and now &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt; can wreak havoc quite effectively. At least until a level 60+ player shows up and kills him (and probably you as well, since &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; is contested).\n&lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt; wanders a bit, and will likely aggro any guards near the graveyard. As of patch 2.4.1, Helcular will not patrol outside of the graveyard, but just in a small circle close to his grave. If you want to use Helcular while he exists, pull a guard or citizen of Southshore and stand next to him. After a short time he and his minions will attack the enemy and take the aggro off you - however the guards may get a few hits in before they turn their attention to their attackers. In some cases the guards will not lose aggro and you may be killed. When Helcular's event period expires, he will exist for several seconds but will not react to any enemies - in which case you may need to flee or be killed.\nHe can't take out the wind rider master (an elite), but he can easily kill two or three guards at once, and will easily dispatch any player below L48 or so. He will summon three L42 (non-elite) skeletons every 10 seconds or so while in combat; they despawn after a minute or so. If he gets in combat with multiple guards, he'll build quite a dangerous army. If you watch him, Helcular will disappear from battle periodically and re-appear - sometimes with full health.\nObjectives.\nCharge the Rod of Helcular with the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Azel\"&gt;Flame of Azel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Veraz\"&gt;Flame of Veraz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Uzel\"&gt;Flame of Uzel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrive the charged rod into Helcular's grave in &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nHere, take the Rod of Helcular.

The Flame of Uzel lies in a cave above the caverns, further north in the mountains.\nThe Rod of Helcular must be charged from each of the three flames.

Here, the spirits of dishonorable &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; spend eternity in an endless futile battle, always seeking glory but never able to attain it. Helheim is separated from the world of the living by an endless ocean called the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Maw of Souls&lt;/a&gt;. The dread ship \"&lt;a href=\"Naglfar\"&gt;Naglfar&lt;/a&gt;\" delivers damned souls to Helheim by ferrying them across this sea. Helheim is connected to &lt;a href=\"Haustvald\"&gt;Haustvald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20Harbor\"&gt;Tideskorn Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. Despite touching upon the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Helheim is not contained inside it.\nFor his misdeeds, &lt;a href=\"Bryndaor\"&gt;Bryndaor&lt;/a&gt; was cursed to guard the gates of Helheim for eternity.\nHistory.\nAfter the corrupted &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; had restored &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;'s free will, she called upon the same powers she had used to secure the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; and sealed off &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s fortress \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 with an impregnable, magical barrier. She then proceeded to create Helheim as an enchanted refuge for herself and the other &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; far below the Halls, and bound it to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s great &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;s. Ocean mists soon enveloped her new home and shrouded it from sight, and the realm became the final destination for many &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; spirits after death.\nHowever, the darkness that had long festered in Helya's heart transformed Helheim into a place of nightmare and shadow, and the vrykul souls who arrived in the realm were soon transformed into the wraithlike &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;.\nHelheim is the polar opposite to the Halls of Valor: while the greatest &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; warriors are brought to the Halls, the unworthy were pulled into Helheim upon their death. The &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; also raided the coastlines and brought souls here before they could be judged, thus robbing &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; of potential champions for his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning that Helya had started stealing Valarjar souls, he started the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Trial of Valor&lt;/a&gt; to test the might of powerful champions which he would send to finish Helya once and for all.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Helya was defeated and banished from the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; back to Helheim by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nHelheim's exact location is unknown, but since Helya created it like the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, it is inside a &lt;a href=\"pocket%20dimension\"&gt;pocket dimension&lt;/a&gt;. \"\" states that Helya created it \"below the Halls of Valor\", then it was bound to Azeroth's oceans. It is possible it is inside the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;, given Helya's involvement in the creation of the Elemental Plane and the fact that &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s serve her in Helheim."}

The Oaf will melee and will once in a while grab a random player and crash him into the wall. Helix will throw Sticky Bombs which will explode after a while. The Lumbering Oaf may occasionally throw Helix onto a random player and before departing from the player, Helix will implant a Chest Bomb. Players must stay away from the bomb as it will give massive Fire damage to everyone in a six yard radius. During all of this, four members of Helix's Crew will be above the players on an overhead log. Each crew member will periodically throw a Sticky Bomb onto the ground below near a random player. Players should obviously stay away from all bombs at all times.\nPhase 2.\nPhase 2 begins after the Lumbering Oaf is killed. Helix will jump onto the face of a random party member, punching him in the face, giving him melee damage. He will rapidly throw Sticky Bombs, so the ridden player must move around so that the group can continue DPSing Helix without being hit by bombs. Every ten seconds Helix will jump onto someone else, but before departing the player he will leave a Chest Bomb on him. During all of this, four members of Helix's Crew will be above the players on an overhead log. Each crew member will periodically throw a Sticky Bomb onto the ground below near a random player.

Effects such as and &lt;a href=\"Concentration%20Aura\"&gt;Concentration Aura&lt;/a&gt; can be useful to reduce pushback.

This allows the warlock to save some repair costs when faced with certain doom. In such a scenario, a warlock will typically use life tap to get low on health fast, then use Hellfire. \nHellfire receives 21% of your spell power per tic, for a total of 294% over the full duration.\nTips and tactics.\nThis is a great spell to use with an experienced healer, if you're not being focused on, and in large groups of enemies. Once started you deal out tremendous damage but also receive as much. Compared to other AoEs, Hellfire is incredibly mana efficient, not taking into account the mana needed to heal. A popular combo is warlock/priest since minimizes channeling time lost, and if combined with other AoEs, mobs die fast and the warlock is never in danger of dying.\nWarlocks are unable to resist the damage that Hellfire does to themselves.\nIf you predict a Cat Druid's or Rogue's attack, you may break his stealth with a timely use of Hellfire."}

With the tanks now retrofitted to use &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;Fel&lt;/a&gt; energy, Siegemaster Mar'tak awaits &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Gul'dan's&lt;/a&gt; command to begin the assault.\"\nDesigner notes.\n\"Like &lt;a href=\"Spoils%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Spoils of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, this is a raid \u201cboss\u201d without a single named boss that must be defeated. Players must withstand waves of attackers, salvaging ammunition from their fallen vehicles, and using that ammunition to power the massive Hellfire Cannons that stand in the courtyard. Victory is achieved by breaching the gates of the Citadel.\"\nOverview.\nPlayers attempt to turn the massive Hellfire Cannons in the Citadel's courtyard against the mighty gate of the Citadel, while fending off Siegemaster Mar'tak and her militarized force. Throughout the encounter, waves of enemies rush at the players, periodically accompanied by huge siege weapons that seek to destroy the Cannons and the players defending them. Destroying these siege weapons allows players to salvage Felfire Munitions, which may be brought to the Hellfire Cannon, allowing it to continuously fire Hellfire Rounds at the Reinforced Hellfire Door. Once players successfully breach the Reinforced Hellfire Door, Siegemaster Mar'tak's forces retreat into the Citadel.\nStrategy.\nThis fight consists of safeguarding the Hellfire Cannons from the enemy adds and vehicles until the cannons can destroy the gate, at which point the fel orcs retreat and the fight ends. The group should have two tanks, one for each side that the fel orc adds come down to. The group should also have one or two designated carriers of the Hellfire Munitions who can quickly bring them to the cannons, speeding up the destruction of the gate. \nThe fight begins by fighting &lt;a href=\"Siegemaster%20Mar%27tak\"&gt;Siegemaster Mar'tak&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of miniboss. The group can use &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; here because Mar'tak must be forced to retreat as soon as possible due to her giving a stacking damage buff to all enemy adds. She uses a large Shockwave ability, which players need to dodge, and Howling Axe, which ranged players should spread out 8-yards for. At 50% she will retreat and adds will continue to be sent out at regular intervals until the fight ends. Among the adds, the Gorebound Felcasters are the most dangerous as, when they reach low health, they will turn into Gorebound Terrors and cast Felfire Volley very quickly and cannot be interrupted. DPS should try to focus Felcasters down individually since multiple Terrors being up at the same time can prove too much for the healers to heal through. Hulking Berserkers are next on the kill order, as they place a stacking debuff on the tanks that makes them take more damage. This damage is negligible at first, only really hurting the tanks when multiple berserkers are up at once. The Contracted Engineers use shock-pulse to stun random players. This should be interrupted by the DPS. Iron Dragoons can easily be AOE'd down and have no abilities. \nThe Felfire-Imbuded Siege Vehicles are at the top of the kill order as they cannot be tanked and most of them will head straight for the cannons, making them the biggest threat to success. Flameblechers shoot felfire in large areas and are difficult to dodge, but will usually target the players instead of the cannons. Its attacks are denoted by large green circles. Felfire Artilleries rush forward in front of the cannons and start firing on it, first spawning to the right, then switching to spawning on the left and back again as the fight continues. As they usually stand away from where the adds spawn, use DBM to know when they are going to spawn and move dps into position beforehand to ensure the least amount of damage as possible is taken by your cannons. Crushers are deadliest. They have a spinning drill on their front which will immediately kill players in its way and shoot fire in random directions. Melee DPS must stay to the side or behind it while dodging the flames and the drill. After each of these vehicles are destroyed, they will drop Felfire Munitions which must be taken to your cannons to increase their damage against the gate. \nOverall, this is the simplest fight in Hellfire Citadel. If the group can kill the vehicles quickly enough and manage to have only one Gorebound Terror up at a time, they should have no problem beating this fight. \nVideos.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOgDI4STbMzA\"&gt;Heroic Hellfire Assault - Mage&lt;/a&gt;"}

It was intended as the new headquarters of the Horde, where a standing army could be conveniently quartered, trained, and equipped, something of a scale that the orcs had never done as a people before. The clans of the Horde were then ordered to abandon their ancestral homelands and gather all together at this new location, ready to follow when Blackhand would order.\nThe fortress was originally also surrounded by other buildings: &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, storage silos, a flat expanse of training areas that were crowded with &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s. During its construction, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; considered the Citadel as &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt; and a blight upon the land, out of harmony with everything the orcs were, and an offense to the eyes and the spirit. It was also where the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s were integrated in the ranks of the Horde, despite the reluctance of several orc veterans who had fought against them all their lives. After the orcs' abandonment of the elemental spirits, the area around it became known as &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, and thus the citadel was given its current name.\nThe fortress was used as the primary staging ground of the military forces of the Horde, whereas the captured Temple of Karabor (now the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;) would be used for meetings of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. It was from this location that the final battle against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, was organized and carried out. After the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde was organized at Hellfire Citadel and marched up the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt; to what they called the \"&lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;\". When the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; entered Draenor, they managed to capture the citadel only to find that &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was no longer there and had moved to the Black Temple.\nIts fate after the destruction of Draenor was unknown until recently; it was presumably abandoned until &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief of the Fel Horde, and the fel orc minions of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; took possession of the Citadel as their base of operations. Illidan also used the citadel as a prison for &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, the former Lord of Outland; it is here that Illidan's fel orcs take the blood of Magtheridon and use it to create more fel orcs, much as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; was used to corrupt the original Horde.\nOfficial Info.\nHellfire Citadel from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//worldofwarcraft.com/\"&gt;the WoW site&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"On the blasted world of Outland near the Dark Portal stands the Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars. For years this gargantuan fortress was thought to be abandoned... until recently. This very much operation battle station has become inhabited by marauding bands of red, furious fel orcs. Where this savage new breed came from is a mystery, but whats worse is that their numbers seem to be growing. Hellfire Citadel is the first new dungeon that players will encounter in Outland. It will consist of three complete dungeon wings designed for 5-man groups, as well as an exciting raid encounter.\"\nSome info posted by Tigole on the WoW forums:\n\"This is the first dungeon players will encounter in the expansion. It lies in Hellfire Peninsula, the zone just beyond the Dark Portal. We're planning on making this a winged dungeon. Right now, two of the wings are scheduled to be lower level level up wings (for players leveling to 70). One of the wings is slated to be a maximum level 5-person dungeon. And lastly, there's &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;'s Lair, a raid wing similar to &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;s Lair in size and scope what I like to call a quick raid. Of course, during the development cycle this could all change. Same goes for the Beta. But thats how we're approaching this dungeon currently.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It is a &lt;a href=\"Council%20encounter\"&gt;Council encounter&lt;/a&gt; that tests the healers' ability to heal through large amounts of raid-wide damage. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Thousands of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; orcs accepted the &lt;a href=\"blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, but none grew as powerful as the three that stand before you. &lt;a href=\"Dia%20Darkwhisper\"&gt;Dia Darkwhisper&lt;/a&gt;, champion of &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magic and an outcast of the , rose quickly to power - the left hand of . , with his insatiable hunger for blood, emerged the victor in hundreds of trials by combat. He was bested only once, in a draw, by &lt;a href=\"Blademaster\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Jubei%27thos\"&gt;Jubei'thos&lt;/a&gt;. Tainted with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; sickness, they serve Gul'dan as both Highguard and Council of War.\"\nDesigner notes.\n\"We couldn\u2019t in good conscience make a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; raid set in Draenor without a throwback to &lt;a href=\"Gurtogg%20Bloodboil\"&gt;Gurtogg Bloodboil&lt;/a&gt;, the brutish &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; boss whose signature Bloodboil ability makes a return in this encounter. Accompanying Gurtogg are champions of other allied orc clans, expressing the core of each clan\u2019s power with a fel twist.\"\nOverview.\nEach member of the council has a special attack that they will only use below 30% health. These effects will persist until the end of the encounter.\nStrategy.\nTwo tanks are required: one to take Dia Darkwhisper, and the other to handle both Gurtogg Bloodboil and Blademaster Jubei'thos. Each boss has an additional ability unlocked at 30% health, meaning it is better to focus them down one at a time. The kill order is: Gurtog first, then Jubei'thos, and Dia last.\nGurtogg will stack Bloodboil on the tank that steadily stacks. The only way to get rid of it is to wait until he is finished with his Fel Rage, giving enough time for the stacks to fall off. As the stacks inevitably get higher, tanks and healers must keep an eye out and be prepared to use cooldowns in the moments before Fel Rage starts. Fel Rage will cause Gurtogg to fixiate on one of the DPS and only attack him. He runs too fast to outrun, so this will test the healer's ability to keep said player from dying to Gurtogg's attacks. He will also leap at players and hit them for some damage. At 30%, pop &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; because he will start casting Tainted Blood on the whole raid, steadily reducing their maximum hp by 10% per stack. Since this effect stacks quickly and remains for the rest of the fight, it is imperative to get Gurtog down quickly when he reaches low health. \nBlademaster Jubei'thos' attacks mostly consist of attacks that effect the whole raid as opposed to just the tank. Using Windwalk, he will randomly slash random players (Regardless of distance) in addition to hitting the tank. His Felstorm will cause unavoidable AOE damage to the whole raid. When he casts Mirror Image, he will split into multiple copies around the room and begin channeling a large amount of AOE fire damage to the raid which must be healed through. Any damage taken by the Mirror Images is also taken by Jubei'thos himself. The amount of damage the raid takes will decrease as more images are killed. AT 30%, he will start using Wicked Strike, which is similar to Windwalk, except it hits half the raid and deals far more damage. DPS should try to stack up to be more easily healed, especially if Jubei'thos happens to use Mirror Images during his Wicked Strike phase. Be mindful that he continues using Wicked STRIKE after being killed.\nDia Darkwhisper is arguably the most dangerous to tanks and her high damage output the reason she should be tanked separately from the other two. Use an interrupt to pull her further away from Gurtog and Jubei'thos. Her Nightmare Visage increases her attack speed and damage for about 8 seconds before changing back. Brewmaster monks excel here as they can stack &lt;a href=\"Elusive%20Brew\"&gt;Elusive Brew&lt;/a&gt; due to her normal attacks being undodgeable spells that do negligible damage, and pop it during Nightmare Visage to receive almost no damage by dodging all her attacks. Dia casts Reap on those who randomly have the Mark of the Necromancer debuff, causing those affected to spawn void zones underneath them. When you have been targeted by Reap, move to the edge of the room to drop it safely. Lastly, she will cast Wailing Horror which is yet another raid wide damage attack. The raid can avoid the worst of it by moving to the edge of the room, avoiding most of the damage the flying voidwalkers do. \nVideos.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcZ6y7Qlxg5o\"&gt;Hellfire High Council Heroic - Mage&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7YZY5sM1aO4\"&gt;Hellfire High Council Mythic - Boss Voices - Mage&lt;/a&gt;\nNotes.\nIon \"Watcher\" Hozzikostas has this to say about the many fixes and changes regarding Dia Darkwhisper's Mark of the Necromancer and Reap abilities:"}

It is a pivotal area of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; that has been the location of many of the most brutal battles in \"Warcraft\" history. This is where the other side of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; is located. Two of its past cities include &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27kur\"&gt;Zeth'kur&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs its name implies, Hellfire Peninsula is a grim place. In regards to topography, well, there isn't much. Aesthetically, the ground looks like it does in Durotar: reddish hue, barren, almost uninhabitable and hard-packed. There is one key difference, though \u2014 when you travel on the ground, you note bones cracking and shattering beneath your feet. These would be the remains of the countless &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; that the blood-crazed &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s systematically slaughtered prior to bringing their war to Azeroth.\nHellfire Peninsula \u2014 indeed, most of the areas that \"The Burning Crusade\" introduced \u2014 is much larger than what classic WoW players are used to. Part of the motive for this is to justify the relative speeds at which flying mounts travel.\nHistory.\nBefore the First War.\nA long time ago, the Peninsula was known as \"&lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;\" instead. Surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Sea\"&gt;Devouring Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the north, east, and south, the area was a wide stretch of forested wilderness. It was here the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s built &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;the Citadel&lt;/a&gt; as the capital city of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of their people. After the orcs' abandoned their &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; ways and the &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;elemental spirits&lt;/a&gt;, the whole region started withering under the corrupting effects of their new &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Fertile and verdant grounds desiccated and withered, leaving place to red dust and hard-packed mud instead. The sky even turned blood-red during the day. The whole area became known as \"Hellfire Peninsula\" and the fortress got its current name of Hellfire Citadel.\nWhile the Temple of Karabor (later known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;) served as the meeting place for &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, Hellfire Citadel acted as the staging ground for the Horde's military force. Both the final attack against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; and the march along the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, where the orcs committed genocide on the draenei, was planned here. At the end of the Path of Glory, the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was constructed. The portal was activated by the combined effort of the Shadow Council in Draenor and by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful human wizard possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs rushed through and unleashed the Horde upon Azeroth, starting the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; in which the orcs conquered much of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs that remained in Draenor became known as the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath of the Second War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; eventually managed to overpower the orcs during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and pull them back to the Dark Portal. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; attempted to destroy it, but discovered that even though he could shatter the structure, the rift connecting the two worlds still persisted. Blasting the structure still shattered many of the orcs' morale, and several were captured and put into internment camps under the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Internment%20Act\"&gt;Alliance Internment Act&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the end of the Second War. To watch over the rift, &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was constructed. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, one of the orcs eluding capture, played an important role. Kilrogg escaped back through the Dark Portal which had been reopened by &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;. Kilrogg met with Ner'zhul back on Draenor, telling him of Azeroth. Ner'zhul was intrigued by the tales and decided to open multiple portals across Draenor to new worlds for the orcs to conquer. To do so, he required several magical objects found in Azeroth, and sent Teron Gorefiend, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; and Kilrogg Deadeye to fetch them, two years after the portal had been closed (it was reopened by Teron Gorefiend). The Alliance believed the orcs were amassing a new attack against Azeroth and decided to follow the orcs when they returned through the portal back to Draenor. They formed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; whose goals were to retrieve some of the magical objects and defeat the orcs in their own home, crushing the orcs once and for all. The expedition's leaders, one of them being Khadgar, called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; in honor for &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; who had been slain by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the Second War.\nIn Hellfire Peninsula, the Alliance Expedition clashed together with the combined forces of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and the orcs that had escaped back to Draenor. The expedition founded the &lt;a href=\"Expedition%20Armory\"&gt;Expedition Armory&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; which was under siege for several months before successfully attacking Hellfire Citadel. They also attacked the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27kur\"&gt;Zeth'kur&lt;/a&gt;, later constructing their own warships to cross the Devouring Sea. The orcish clans were eventually defeated after several battles across Draenor and were nearly wiped out. This did however not stop Ner'zhul from carrying out his plan, tearing Draenor apart when he activated his multiple portals. According to &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, it seems Ner'zhul (also) opened the gates simply to escape the expedition. This sundering \"replaced\" the Devouring Sea with the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The expedition suspected that the sundering would spread through the Dark Portal and crush Azeroth as well, and decided to shut down the portal from the Draenor-side to prevent it - even if it meant their own deaths. Khadgar managed to use the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; to close it while his soldiers fended off the last orcs, and thus Outland and Azeroth were severed. What remained of the orcs' homeworld was a blasted continent of floating red rocks in the Twisting Nether. The remaining orcs were rallied by a &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; who settled down at the Black Temple. Ner'zhul himself was caught by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; who transformed him into the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and placed him in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. There, he would create the dreaded menace later known as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The fate of the expedition trapped in Draenor, now known as Outland, remained a mystery for 20 years.\nAfter the Third War.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; teleported to Outland, he discovered that Magtheridon was using the multiple portals that Ner'zhul opened to bring in demons from the Twisting Nether. However, Illidan was captured by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. Not knowing the geography of the broken world, Maiev discovered the Alliance refugees of &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; and set out to get their help. Before she could reach them, however, Illidan's servants, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; dispatched the Watchers, defeating the majority of the night elves. Maiev and her surviving followers were driven into the parched land of Hellfire for a time, and were forced to evade the fel reavers and local ravagers.\nAfterward, Illidan and his followers closed the Legion portals down and defeated Magtheridon, placing the fel orcs under Illidan's command instead. Kargath Bladefist became one of the orcs following him. Magtheridon was enslaved within Hellfire Citadel and acted as a new source of demon blood for Illidan's orcs to drink, as the &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;previous pit lord&lt;/a&gt; supplying this was killed at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs were performing several experiments on the blood, probably attempting to make themselves stronger.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kazzak%20the%20Supreme\"&gt;Kazzak the Supreme&lt;/a&gt; used some magical artifact to reopen the Dark Portal, the inhabitants of Azeroth discovered (to some degree) what had happened with the Alliance Expedition. Honor Hold is still standing, though most of its soldiers are getting old. Both &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and Nethergarde Keep has brought them supplies and imbued their militia. The Expedition Armory is however destroyed, now haunted by the ghosts of the Alliance soldiers raised by Ner'zhul's &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Honor Hold has become one of the two Alliance bases in Hellfire Peninsula. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Telhamat\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; is some old draenei ruins to the northwest, inhabited by draenei from the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;. The Sons of Lothar have had various fates - &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; where he became good friends with &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; became the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in Shadowmoon Valley (he later returned to Azeroth), and &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; is still the leader of Honor Hold. &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; have disappeared, but their son &lt;a href=\"Arator\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; can also be found at Honor Hold.\nThe (new) Horde have recently established their own base, &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;, to the north. &lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Watch\"&gt;Falcon Watch&lt;/a&gt; is another base built and inhabited by &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; allied with the Horde. Interestingly, it is discovered that Hellfire Peninsula is still inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, orcs that were never tainted by demonic blood. While their village is hidden in some mountains to the north, it's still a wonder how they've managed to elude the Burning Legion for so long. Kilrogg Deadeye's son, &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, is one of them. He is the current leader of the Bleeding Hollow clan. There is also a small group of &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; living in a crag to the west.\nThe area is still teeming with both demons serving the Burning Legion and fel orcs serving Illidan (who became an enemy of the Burning Legion after failing to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; - twice). A never-ceasing stream of demons is walking along the Path of Glory towards the Dark Portal, trying to invade Azeroth through it. Most of them are however killed by forces from both the Horde and the Alliance. Notably, Hellfire Peninsula is the most demon-influenced zone in Outland next after Shadowmoon Valley. Kazzak himself is an outdoor raid boss at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to the north.\nIt is also discovered that Kael'thas Sunstrider and his blood elves (presumably after he broke away from Illidan and Vashj) have been conducting some kind of experiment at &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Sky%20Ridge\"&gt;Fallen Sky Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, planting a massive red crystal in the ground there. The project is led by &lt;a href=\"Pathaleon%20the%20Calculator\"&gt;Pathaleon the Calculator&lt;/a&gt; and is apparently intended to somehow create and corrupt &lt;a href=\"colossi\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt;. The player helps the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; by foiling the experiment. This, along with the Burning Legion and Illidan's fel orcs, are the three major forces the player will fight against in \"World of Warcraft\"'s Hellfire Peninsula.\nTraveler.\n&lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; led an army from Azeroth through Hellfire Peninsula to invade the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; south of &lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Watch\"&gt;Falcon Watch&lt;/a&gt;. After a great battle, the demons were defeated, and the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt; threat thwarted.\nGeography.\nMap and subregions.\nHellfire Peninsula is a barren wasteland looking like a cross between the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. It remains mostly intact even after Draenor's sundering, although parts of it can be seen floating above and outside in the form of smallish islands. The eastern part of the peninsula is cut in two parts by the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, itself being surrounded by the ruined &lt;a href=\"human%20cannon\"&gt;human cannon&lt;/a&gt;s and orcish &lt;a href=\"blade%20thrower\"&gt;blade thrower&lt;/a&gt;s of the Second War.\nAccessing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to Hellfire Peninsula is the most common way to reach &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; for the first time; thus, it is typically the first zone encountered in the 60+ content of \"The Burning Crusade\".\nPortals.\nPortal to the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; capital cities:\nPortal to the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; capital cities:\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;:\nNotable characters.\nWhile Hellfire has a variety of NPCs the most known are &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Force Commander Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde.\nWorld PvP - Hellfire Fortifications.\nThree PvP objectives, small ruined forts of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Hill\"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Overlook\"&gt;The Overlook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Stadium\"&gt;The Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, stand in the center of the region just west of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. As with other &lt;a href=\"World%20PvP\"&gt;World PvP&lt;/a&gt; games each of these points may be captured by PvP flagged characters holding position within the objective. In order to flag a fort, you need to be non-stealthed, and the fort in question needs to be currently flagged by opposing faction, or unflagged (shown as gray on zone map). \nThe faction with the most flagged characters within the objectives vicinity will slowly gain ownership of the point. When all three points are controlled by a faction they will gain a zone-wide bonus of +5% Damage, applicable even within the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; instances. This bonus is called &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Superiority\"&gt;Hellfire Superiority&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, any opposing players killed while fighting for the objectives will reward the player and the player's party with a PvP token, for the Alliance and for the Horde. Grouping is encouraged as only the party that performs the killing blow will receive a token. \nThe repeatable quest, &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Fortifications\"&gt;Hellfire Fortifications&lt;/a&gt;, awards 150 reputation points for either &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;, and 3 tokens. The quest requires the player to capture each point once, is repeatable and cannot be completed in a raid. The quest can only be completed once per day.\nThe quest is available at the following NPCs:\n&lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Mark of Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; may be redeemed at the following NPCs:\n&lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Thrallmar\"&gt;Mark of Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; may be redeemed at the following NPCs:\nResources.\n&lt;a href=\"Herbs\"&gt;Herbs&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Leather\"&gt;Leather&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Ore\"&gt;Ore&lt;/a&gt;\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"\", some of the missions are played out in Outland. They are part of the human (&lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;) campaign \"&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt;\" which tells Illidan Stormrage's conquest of the Black Temple, here referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Citadel%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Black Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. On the Outland map seen in \"WC3\" (below), Hellfire Peninsula occupies a large portion to the south. As such, this map is often regarded as being a map of this zone in \"WC3\". There are however several geographical errors related to this map when compared with other maps:\nAs such, although the areas seen on the \"WC3\" Outland map here on Wowpedia are treated as being parts of Hellfire Peninsula, this is purely speculation.\nIn the RPG.\nThis great tract of land spreads before the distant &lt;a href=\"Black%20Citadel%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Black Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Orcs and humans clashed across the peninsula numerous times in the Second War; battle-scarred the ground and blood-soaked the soil. Ruined encampments and strongholds dot the landscape and derelict war machines stand, slowly rotting in the Nether's winds. The desolate battlefield is now a haven for ghosts and more terrible beings that prey on wanderers."}

{"id": "59628", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=59628", "title": "Hellfire Ramparts", "text": "Hellfire Ramparts (often known as just \"Ramps\" or \"The Ramparts\") make up the first wing of the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; instance in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The citadel itself sits in the center of the zone, in the middle of a broken-up wall that divided the zone before the conflict began. The Ramparts takes place atop this wall along the sides of the citadel. This is the first instance available to players of the Burning Crusade, and can be completed wearing dungeon set items. It gives rewards that are on par with &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; gear (or even slightly better).\nBackground.\nFor years, this gargantuan fortress was thought to be abandoned, but it's now inhabited by marauding bands of red, furious &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The presence of this new, savage breed presents something of a mystery, though what is far more disconcerting is that the numbers of these fel orcs seem to be... growing.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stand Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars.\"\nOverview.\nThis instance has three boss encounters and four bosses. The first boss is &lt;a href=\"Watchkeeper%20Gargolmar\"&gt;Watchkeeper Gargolmar&lt;/a&gt;. Up the tower beyond him, the path splits. The right path leads to &lt;a href=\"Omor%20the%20Unscarred\"&gt;Omor the Unscarred&lt;/a&gt; (which is usually killed second), the left leads to &lt;a href=\"Vazruden\"&gt;Vazruden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazan\"&gt;Nazan&lt;/a&gt;, which is the most difficult encounter in this instance. After killing the dragon and its rider a &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Fel%20Iron%20Chest\"&gt;Reinforced Fel Iron Chest&lt;/a&gt; appear. Curiously, despite most people and even various in-game sources placing Vazruden as the final boss, Omor is the only required kill for the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;non-Heroic achievement&lt;/a&gt;\nIn order to enter the instance in heroic mode, all party members must buy the key from the quartermaster in &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;, which requires honored reputation with Thrallmar or Honor Hold respectively.\nReputation.\nKilling monsters in this instance grants &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; reputation. Each normal orc grants 5 reputation, each wolf grants 2.5, and each boss grants 50. Vazruden and Nazan count as separate bosses for this calculation. Reputation stops at honored, bosses included. A normal Ramparts run will yield around 575 reputation.\nHeroic mode.\nChanges to Trash.\nMost mobs now hit for easily 3000\u20135000 melee on cloth. Ranged and Magical DPS has been increased somewhat, but generally only comes in at 1000\u20131500 per hit. As of 2.3 the casters can be seduced (verified 1/12/08).\nThe Beastmasters are immune to Sheep and traps.\nWhile the Warhounds aren't listed as elites, they can still tear apart most cloth armor wearing class. If they slip past your main tank, they will eat your healers alive. For this reason, tanking them is recommended. They can be &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;led (Hibernate, Sheep, and Trap).\nChanges to bosses.\nLargely unchanged. It's still possible to use traps or fear on the adds (but not seduce), and he himself does not hit particularly hard. The adds melee for around 600 to cloth, so they can easily be tanked by pets while being burnt. His charge does roughly 900 to cloth, so it is once again largely ignorable. His main change is the stacking of a 10% healing debuff on the main tank, which makes this something of a DPS race.\nThis fight is considerably more difficult as the Aura debuff he applies does ten times more damage, killing anyone near the afflicted within seconds, so good spacing is necessary. The debuff is not dispellable, but Rogues may escape the spell by using &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Fiendish%20Hound\"&gt;Fiendish Hound&lt;/a&gt;s are much more powerful, doing 3000 to cloth melee and possessing a 3000 point mana burn. They are still vulnerable to enslave, banish and fear, and do roughly 1000 a hit to Omor himself when enslaved. Omor drops a &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Nether\"&gt;Primal Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis fight follows the same basic principles as the non-heroic, but is much harder. Nazan drops fireballs from the air during the initial fight, which hit for around 2000\u20133000, but the tick from them is easily 4500 fire damage, so move immediately when hit. Nazan also gains a Bellowing Roar which fears the entire party. Hitting Nazan with DoTs or other ranged damage before he descends will cause him to use his fear while still airborne. If the group wipes after killing Vazruden and then restarts the fight, 250 reputation are gained for each Vazruden kill. It appears the fight bugs and does not respawn correctly if people leave the instance by running away during the fight."}
