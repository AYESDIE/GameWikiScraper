Claiming to have seen a future where Azeroth falls, Wrathion helped &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; gaining powers, usually in the form of magical legendary items. He is, however, ruthless in his goals and pursues what he perceives as the greater good for Azeroth with almost fanatical devotion. As the self-proclaimed last black dragon, Wrathion believes that the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s' mandate to protect Azeroth now falls to him, and he will do whatever it takes to fulfill this charge once entrusted to Deathwing, that he personally identifies as his father. Most dragons do regard their Aspect as their progenitor since they were the genesis of their kind out of the proto-drake stage of evolution, albeit through the direct hand of the titan watchers, but with Deathwing's infamous history it carries a bit more significance. \nAfter being purified and hatched during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion saw to the death of every other black dragon he knew of, including his father. He decided to take on the appearance of a dark-skinned human for his mortal disguise, and provided an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Father\"&gt;Fangs of the Father&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down the last dragons of the black dragonflight in Azeroth. After he nearly survived an assassination attempt by the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, he claimed to take his destiny into his own hands and disappeared. He later would claim to be the self-proclaimed leader of his flight.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; intensified on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion traveled to the once hidden continent and created his own &lt;a href=\"Black%20Prince\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;, he then sought to use an adventurer gifted with a &lt;a href=\"A%20Pandaren%20Legend\"&gt;powerful cloak&lt;/a&gt; of his own creation in a plot to have one side wipe out the other, making the world more secure against &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;greater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;threats&lt;/a&gt;. While his plan ultimately failed when King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; decided to make peace with Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; instead of dismantling the Horde, Wrathion's ambition to safeguard the world remained unchanged. After he helped &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; release &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; during his &lt;a href=\"War%20Crimes\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion stayed in the shadows, observing the conflict between the forces of Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and which side would win the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor years he traveled across Azeroth, seeking a way to fight the madness that once corrupted his flight. Near the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was the one primarily responsible for his father's corruption, Wrathion once again offered his assistance. This time, he created &lt;a href=\"%3AAshjra%27kamas%2C%20Shroud%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;:Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve&lt;/a&gt; to help Azeroth's champions resist the Old God's corruptive influence. Following the end of the Old God, Wrathion vowed that the black dragonflight would forevermore stand in defense of Azeroth, alongside its champions.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; rediscovered, Wrathion now contended with &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; for the right to become the new Aspect of the black dragonflight. This competition ended when the two brothers delved into &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that he did not need to be Aspect to aid his flight, and that his reasons for pursuing the position were skewed, Wrathion withdrew his claim for Aspect. Instead, he and Sabellian both realized they were not suited, instead turning to their brother &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, who had been counseling them the entire time, to become the new Aspect. After Ebyssian was acknowledged as the new Earth-Warder by Alexstrasza, Wrathion was made the diplomat of the black dragonflight to lead alongside him and Sabellian.\nBiography.\nCataclysm.\nThe ambitious &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rheastrasza\"&gt;Rheastrasza&lt;/a&gt;, also known by her &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; guise &lt;a href=\"Rhea\"&gt;Rhea&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; to research the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and to find a way to purify them. She hired a &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Dogs\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;, and has captured the black dragon, &lt;a href=\"Nyxondra\"&gt;Nyxondra&lt;/a&gt;, to force her to lay eggs for the experiments, in hopes of laying an uncorrupted black dragon egg. It was later revealed that Nyxondra was in fact a sister of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, and thus a daughter of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; himself, the grandfather of Wrathion. \nUnhatched.\nEventually, Rheastrasza and &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Hieronymus%20Blam\"&gt;Dr. Hieronymus Blam&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in creating a purified black dragon egg with an &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Watchers\"&gt;ancient titan device&lt;/a&gt;, a black whelp corpse, a wild black dragon egg and one of Nyxondra's eggs. She constantly moved around to avoid being found by agents of the black dragonflight, who wanted to destroy the egg. She was however killed by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in the end, who was after the egg. The egg he destroyed, however, was not the purified one, but Rheastrasza's own egg. &lt;a href=\"Hieronymus%20Blam\"&gt;Hieronymus Blam&lt;/a&gt; had already moved the real purified egg to a safer location, away from the Badlands, so it could continue to grow, out of Deathwing's sight. The egg was hidden under the care of &lt;a href=\"Corastrasza\"&gt;Corastrasza&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; outpost in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, six months later, shortly before he was born, the egg was stolen by the assassins of &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the red dragonflight sent the red drake &lt;a href=\"Mostrasz\"&gt;Mostrasz&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to find it. The trail led them to &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt;, in the northeast of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, where it was revealed that Wrathion has hatched and was now in charge of the whole operation.\nThe Black Prince.\nThough a whelping, Wrathion was wise and powerful beyond his years. Free of Deathwing's control, he saw with clear eyes what had become of the black dragons, and recognized the threat they posed to Azeroth. He knew of only one way to purify the flight: death. Thus, he launched a brutal campaign to assassinate the world's remaining black dragons.\nOn his first encounter with the rogue adventurer, he revealed that like all dragons he was conscious in his egg, listening to the plots and intrigues about him, and understood that he was born to be a prisoner. Therefore, he announced that he intended to stay free, and that the rogue adventurer were valuable to him, as they managed to reach him by eluding all his guards in the manor. At the same time, the right hand of the Black Prince, &lt;a href=\"Fahrad\"&gt;Fahrad&lt;/a&gt;, brought Mostrasz into the cellar after he captured him. Wrathion introduced himself to the latter as his former prisoner, and ordered him to serve as a messenger to his dragonflight, announcing that he was free from his father's corruption, that he intended to remain free, that Deathwing's minions should be afraid of him, and that this warning was the first and the last. He then ordered Fahrad to throw him out and to break his legs, before resuming his conversation with the rogue adventurer, explaining that dark dragons frequently disguise themselves as mortals to create chaos around them, and that the last survivors of the black dragonflight must be found and eliminated, as they are threats to Wrathion and Azeroth itself. In exchange for rewards, they agreed to help the Black Prince, and their first mission was located in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Ruins of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the only pure member of his dragonflight, Wrathion decided that it was his misson to make sure that all his corrupted brothers and sisters must be destroyed. The first of them was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hiram%20Creed\"&gt;Lord Hiram Creed&lt;/a&gt;, a black dragon disguised as an affluent &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; noble who manipulated a group of Gilnean &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; named the &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, secretly infecting them with his own draconic blood. As none of Ravenholdt's assassins were able to infiltrate the city, the rogue adventurer was sent to assassinate the &lt;a href=\"Drakonid\"&gt;Drakonid&lt;/a&gt;, and managed to kill him, to the surprise of the Black Prince who was greatly impressed. He rewarded them with the daggers named &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20%28dagger%29\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28dagger%29\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, and promised them more powers if they returned with some spell reagents acquired from Deathwing's minions.\nTo Wrathion's surprise, his rogue champion returned some weeks later with what he asked, and eager for another assignment. In order to improve the daggers he offered them, he ordered the elimination of &lt;a href=\"Nalice\"&gt;Nalice&lt;/a&gt;, a black dragon who served as the Ambassador of the Black Dragonflight in the Wyrmrest Accord, but who mysteriously disappeared from Wyrmrest Temple in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s reemergence and his &lt;a href=\"shattering\"&gt;shattering&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth. She was found by the Black Prince and his agents, hiding with her &lt;a href=\"Blackwyrm%20Cult\"&gt;Blackwyrm Cult&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Cellar\"&gt;Master's Cellar&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, researching arcane secrets buried beneath the foundation to perform some sort of arcane experiments. Pleasantly surprised by their victory, Wrathion used Nalice's blood to upgrade the vicious twin daggers of his favorite assassin, before dispatching them again into the fray to collect more resources.\nAfter some weeks, Wrathion greeted his rogue champion fresh and ready for his hardest assignment, ignoring Fahrad's warnings, he ordered the adventurer to kill his father. He warned them not to underestimate Deathwing, and that it would be necessary to annihilate him completely, otherwise the heart of his madness in his broken body would try to destroy them. He confessed that he wanted to help them, but couldn't bring himself to do so, as the Black Aspect was the only dragon he feared. In secret, he told himself that it was the last time he saw his champion, not imagining for even a moment that they could accomplish their mission. But once again, he underestimated them, and ultimately, his favorite assassin returned triumphant to collect their final reward after they destroyed the Worldbreaker with the heroes of Azeroth.\nHowever, prior to their arrival, the red dragonflight attacked Ravenholdt Manor to kill Wrathion, the latter managed to survive and killed Mostrasz himself, although many of its agents were killed in the battle. After rewarding his rogue champion one last time with &lt;a href=\"%3AGolad%2C%20Twilight%20of%20Aspects\"&gt;:Golad, Twilight of Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3ATiriosh%2C%20Nightmare%20of%20Ages\"&gt;:Tiriosh, Nightmare of Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary , he announced his final mission, to kill the last black dragon, Fahrad himself. The Black Prince revealed that he already knew the truth since the beginning, thanking the latter for saving him while he was still in his egg, but announced that as a black dragon he was also a victim of the corruption of the Old Gods and must be eliminated. Despite Fahrad insisting that he was in control, the Old Gods' voices in his head were angered by Wrathion's actions and forced Fahrad to try to kill the Black Prince, as he was too difficult to control. As Fahrad revealed his true nature, Wrathion announced that he would never be controlled, that the red dragonflight had no idea what they unleashed when they had experimented on his egg, before he immobilized his former ally and ordered the rogue adventurer to deal the killing blow with his new powers.\nFollowing their victory, Wrathion announced that to his knowledge he was the last black dragon in Azeroth, and that it was time for him to disappear, expecting to meet his rogue champion once again in the future. With his destiny in his own hands, he left the assassins of Ravenholdt behind to seek his destiny elsewhere, as he heard rumors of a new land \"beyond the mists of the sea\".\nWith his bloody work done, Wrathion stood as one of the last living black dragons.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion made his base in the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20in%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Tavern in the Mists&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Stair\"&gt;Veiled Stair&lt;/a&gt;, after experiencing a vision of Azeroth's destruction. To prevent his vision from becoming a reality, Wrathion sent &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Note\"&gt;invitations&lt;/a&gt; to adventurers from all walks of life to aid him in shaping the course of the coming conflict.\nWrathion foreshadowed a terrible threat to Azeroth coming, a threat that a divided Azeroth couldn't hope to stand against; the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Thus he believed the only way to prepare Azeroth for the coming threat was to have one faction win and dominate the other. He advised adventurers to bring a swift end to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; and gave his unwavering support to whichever faction the adventurer belonged to.\nWrathion challenged the adventurers he recruited to prove their strength to him by vanquishing the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; minions who inhabit &lt;a href=\"Shan%27ze%20Dao\"&gt;Shan'ze Dao&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; swarming the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. He also tasked adventurers to acquire sigils of power and wisdom from fallen heroes in the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;. After slaying enough of these enemies to earn an honored reputation with him, Wrathion challenged the adventurer to hunt down the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; and despoil it of its &lt;a href=\"%3AChimera%20of%20Fear\"&gt;:Chimera of Fear&lt;/a&gt;. After taking down the sha at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;, and accomplishing all of his undertakings, Wrathion took the adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Mason%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Mason's Folly&lt;/a&gt; where he used the combined powers of the sigils of power and wisdom; as well as the chimera of fear to create a sha-touched gem. After Wrathion gifted the gem to his champion, he asked them to let him know when their faction's naval fleet arrived; and also proclaimed that no matter how unsavory his methods become, he would remain resolute in his protection of Azeroth.\nLandfall.\nAfter the faction's fleet arrived in Pandaria, Wrathion wanted to test the adventurer's commitment to the Alliance-Horde war and thus tasked them to kill enemy faction soldiers at the shores in order to prove that their faction deserves to win the war. Then, in the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20in%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Tavern in the Mists&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion summoned images of &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to talk about their pasts and how they fared as leaders. Wrathion also wanted to test the adventurer's valor by having them gather 3,000 &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Points\"&gt;Valor Points&lt;/a&gt;. He used his blood to see through their eyes, thus monitoring their progress. Afterwards, Wrathion requested that they kill their opposing faction's commander in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to slaughtering the enemy commander, Wrathion required that they achieve a victory in both &lt;a href=\"Silvershard%20Mines\"&gt;Silvershard Mines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kotmogu\"&gt;Temple of Kotmogu&lt;/a&gt;. After all these tasks, he brought up the faction leaders again and discussed their merits as leaders and what he's learned about each respective faction. He asked the adventurers to continue to hone their skills in Pandaria and then armed them with the &lt;a href=\"%3AEye%20of%20the%20Black%20Prince\"&gt;:Eye of the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt; to increase their prowess. At last, he brought up about a new threat: &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Emperor Lei Shen, the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Thunder King.\n \nIn the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20in%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Tavern in the Mists&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Darkest%20Shadow\"&gt;recovering from his wounds&lt;/a&gt;, he played the pandaren board game &lt;a href=\"jihui\"&gt;jihui&lt;/a&gt; with Wrathion. Both of them have been discussing current events and as they played, they discussed &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; the Thunder King, and his leadership style; to which they disagreed with each other if whether his tyrannical and brutal reign should be applauded or not. Anduin disapproved of Wrathion's hard cutthroat outlook and Wrathion likewise thought Anduin too soft. At this point, Wrathion recruited the adventurer to act as his champion and to show his might by terrorizing any &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; they could find.\nAs Wrathion desired to know the origin and source of mogu power, Azeroth's adventurers aided the Black Prince in finding out what it was. The search for information took them into the depths of the Thunder King's Palace, the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, where they collected for him 20 &lt;a href=\"%3ASecrets%20of%20the%20Empire\"&gt;:Secrets of the Empire&lt;/a&gt; and 40 &lt;a href=\"Trillium%20Bar\"&gt;Trillium Bar&lt;/a&gt;s. Wrathion and the adventurer then progressed to the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Forges\"&gt;Thunder Forges&lt;/a&gt; where he planed to use all the trillium they gathered to forge an instrument of power that he claimed he would used for the purpose of \"world peace\". Once they got the Thunder Forge up and running, Wrathion tasked the adventurer to defend the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Celestial Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; until it finished forging the &lt;a href=\"%3ALightning%20Lance\"&gt;:Lightning Lance&lt;/a&gt;. Once completed, Wrathion's champion used the Lightning Lance to vanquish the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20Amalgamation\"&gt;Sha Amalgamation&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Lightning Lance proved itself a useful weapon, it needed to be charged by the power of the Thunder King in order to wake it from its dormancy. Wrathion then asked his champion to assault the &lt;a href=\"Foot%20of%20Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Foot of Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; and to use the Lightning Lance on &lt;a href=\"Nalak\"&gt;Storm Lord Nalak&lt;/a&gt; before slaying the beast. From the mogu artifacts the adventurer collected, Wrathion learned how to create the legendary metagem, &lt;a href=\"The%20Crown%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;Crown of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. After imbuing the Lightning Lance with Nalak's power, the adventurer and Wrathion returned to &lt;a href=\"Mason%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Mason's Folly&lt;/a&gt; where they created the &lt;a href=\"Sha-Touched\"&gt;Sha-Touched&lt;/a&gt; gem. There, Wrathion used the Lightning Lance to create the &lt;a href=\"%3ACrown%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;:Crown of Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, which he gifted to his champion.\nAnduin distrusted Wrathion and warned the adventurer to think twice before putting that thing on their head. As Wrathion needed more information to piece together how the mogu related to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, he sent the adventurer back to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; to collect 12 &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Runestone\"&gt;Titan Runestone&lt;/a&gt;s, which an image of Wrathion used to uncover mogu history as he translated the stones.\nOnce all of them have been translated, Wrathion wanted the adventurer to kill &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; himself, to bring him the &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;:Heart of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, and end the Thunder King's reign once and for all. Once the heart was given to Wrathion, he ate it and absorbed its titan magic. A glowing light appeared, showing Wrathion cosmic visions and spoke through Wrathion of a fallen titan that some mysterious power sought to rebuild. As the light faded away, Wrathion seemed to have forgotten all the information and thought the predecessors of the titans' power have forgotten as well. Not even Anduin could comprehend the message. To that regard, it was the message that the mogu didn't remember all this time, and Wrathion laughed at the irony of it. Anduin still didn't trust Wrathion, and the latter told him that it was wise that he didn't. He then asked the adventurer to give him time to \"digest\" what he has learned.\nEscalation.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; was dead, and his artifacts were in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion wanted to empower his champion with the full array of his draconic power, but their mortal body wasn't capable of holding such power. Instead, Wrathion planed to create a cloak of virtue that they could imbue with the power of the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s and some of his own as well. To create such a vessel, Wrathion required the blessings of all the August Celestials, which was only granted to those who completed their challenges. Thus Wrathion and his champion set off for the celestials' temples to fulfill their quest.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Niuzao%20Temple\"&gt;Niuzao Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt; tested the adventurer's fortitude; at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; tested their hope; at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; tested their strength; and at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt; tested their wisdom. With the blessing of each of the celestials, Wrathion was able to create the &lt;a href=\"%3ACloak%20of%20Virtue\"&gt;:Cloak of Virtue&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mason%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Mason's Folly&lt;/a&gt;, which he gifted to his champion. Although the cloak of virtue granted the champion the power of the celestials, Wrathion was still searching for a way to imbue his own draconic power onto the cloak.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nWrathion was eager to explore the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and with good reason: the island held the secret of imbuing celestial cloaks with his own formidable draconic power. Wrathion tasked his champion to collect 5,000 &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Coin\"&gt;Timeless Coin&lt;/a&gt;s so that he could deconstruct their mysterious power in order to enhance his champion's cloak. He also challenged his champion to showcase their capabilities to the public of the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt; by defeating the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s in combat. Bearers of this new legendary-quality cloak were able to do battle with the deadly &lt;a href=\"Ordos\"&gt;Ordos&lt;/a&gt; atop the Timeless Isle, but that wasn't Wrathion's ultimate goal. Instead, the black prince hoped to send his empowered cloak-bearers into the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; himself. Wrathion also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Tournament\"&gt;Celestial Tournament&lt;/a&gt; with his companions - &lt;a href=\"Alex%20%28whelp%29\"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dah%27da\"&gt;Dah'da&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cindy\"&gt;Cindy&lt;/a&gt;. After the Celestials are defeated, Wrathion, &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer return to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Seat of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; where they narrate the legend of the adventurer. Cho wished for the legend to portray the adventurer as a hero, liberator, and protector, while Wrathion wished to see them as a conqueror with none able to stand in their way. After the legend was done, Wrathion sent the adventurer to the Siege of Orgrimmar to fulfill his hopes.\nWhen the adventurer arrived back in the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20in%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Tavern in the Mists&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion was pacing around the room; awaiting information about what happened during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer told him about what happened in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and he was not happy with the outcome: calling &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; a fool for allowing the Horde to continue existing. &lt;a href=\"Tong%20the%20Fixer\"&gt;Tong the Fixer&lt;/a&gt; was infuriated with his constant speaking and his lack of understanding of the lessons of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Tong said that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were not strong despite each other, they were strong \"because of\" one another. Wrathion thought he was just a fool waiter, and started walking out the Tavern and proclaimed for the battle to come, he would leave nothing to chance.\nWar Crimes.\nWrathion, alongside his bodyguards, &lt;a href=\"Right\"&gt;Right&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Left\"&gt;Left&lt;/a&gt;, attended the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, frequently corresponding with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; during intermissions. He came to acknowledge the prince of Stormwind as a personal friend, though he told him that his kind heart and desire to see good in the world would be his undoing. He sat as far from &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; as he could.\nEventually, Wrathion revealed himself to be working with &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to free Garrosh and send him back in time to the of thirty-five years ago. After incapacitating the Chu brothers so he could lock up &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; for investigating Kairoz, Wrathion was confronted by Anduin, who attempted to deter his friend from freeing the captured warchief. Proclaiming that as the last of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, the protection of Azeroth now falls to him, Wrathion knocked Anduin out and took his leave. Despite his actions, Wrathion believed this would be best for Azeroth in the coming conflict with the Legion, and maintained hope that Anduin would eventually understand his motives and even stand with him as a brother when the time comes.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nWrathion, having traveled to the alternate Draenor after the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; became connected to it, traveled to &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison\"&gt;Admiral Taylor's Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, brought there by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Edward\"&gt;Sir Edward&lt;/a&gt;. Wrathion sought asylum in the Garrison, claiming he had somehow angered the local &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. As Wrathion was a wanted fugitive of the Alliance following the events of Garrosh's trial, the troops led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Claudia\"&gt;Lady Claudia&lt;/a&gt; took aim. &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor\"&gt;Admiral Taylor&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Wrathion would be a \"guest\" in the Garrison provided he stay under house arrest and full-time guard.\nWrathion provided Taylor's Garrison the resources to build an inn, and when Taylor confronted him about it Wrathion told him not to trust &lt;a href=\"Ephial\"&gt;Ephial&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor offered a group of guards money to keep a close eye on Wrathion, but Wrathion had already paid those very same guards to watch Taylor. When Taylor left to participate in the , Wrathion left the Garrison and took several of Taylor's best followers with him.\nWrathion remained in hiding somewhere on Draenor until he made a minor cameo at &lt;a href=\"Khadgar%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Khadgar's Tower&lt;/a&gt; once the adventurer had to return the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Tomes of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;. Wrathion was momentarily seen sitting on a &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; banner in whelp form until seeing his former ally, upon which he quickly flew off to parts unknown.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion wandered around Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; and an adventurer discovered that the former was going to die in the near future, they began searching for clues to who could be behind her assassination across the future Dragonshrines in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. At the pathway leading into the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, they found Wrathion, who was bemused by skeletons occupying the shrine even though the dragons had abandoned it for some years, musing that his father would never have approved. Chromie and the adventurer confronted Wrathion, thinking he may have known something, and Wrathion was ashamed that Chromie suspected him simply for being a black dragon. As Wrathion explained, he knew nothing about the attack and was simply visiting &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; for \"[his] own amusement\", but was surprised to see a demonic infestation at the Obsidian Dragonshrine. He reminded Chromie and the adventurer that if they were looking for someone who might take umbrage at a dragon, they should start with the undead and &lt;a href=\"Zorathides\"&gt;whoever&lt;/a&gt; was controlling them. Chromie agreed that Wrathion made a fair point and the two of them left him to search inside the dragonshrine.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter finding an &lt;a href=\"%3AUnscarred%20Black%20Scale\"&gt;:Unscarred Black Scale&lt;/a&gt; from a young black dragon while on an &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;island expedition&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer knew that Wrathion would want to hear about it and sought him out at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Though Wrathion was not there himself, one of his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon%20Agent\"&gt;Blacktalon Agent&lt;/a&gt;s was. She revealed to the adventurer that Wrathion was searching for the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and that other dragons had not been forthcoming in information.\nOne of Wrathion's &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon%20Watcher\"&gt;Blacktalon Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s was in the former &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt; of Deathwing, observing as another uncorrupted black dragon, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, took an essence of the black dragonflight's magic to help heal the world. Later, more Blacktalon Watchers could be found in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Wrathion was next seen, he had physically matured significantly, his humanoid form now resembling a young man with jet black hair, a short beard, and red, burning eyes. He sought out the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; library in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Lorewalkers\"&gt;Lorewalkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, in order to find a way to counter the Old Gods' corruption. He also traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Archavon\"&gt;Vault of Archavon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that it would contain information on the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; which, he felt, would be the key to defeating the Old Gods for good. Unfortunately, the giants that watched over the Vault were not trusting of him. Wrathion then journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, where he received information from the library that allowed him to craft a potion that could cleanse someone of Old God corruption. While within the tower, Wrathion also met with the shade of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who encouraged him that while Wrathion could not change the past, he could forge a new legacy to leave for the future. As all this was going on, the Old Gods reached out to another uncorrupted black dragon, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, and began to corrupt him. At the behest of &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer sought out Wrathion for aid, and it turned out that the Old Gods' servants were also in pursuit of the Black Prince. While neither of them found Wrathion himself, the adventurer was able to find Wrathion's potion in Karazhan and used it to save Ebyssian.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and in the process let &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; free from its prison, the Horde and the Alliance had to consider how to deal with the new threat looming. Wrathion, who had not been seen since &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; was freed, appeared in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;. He came to advise Anduin on how to deal with N'Zoth. Wrathion told Anduin that the armies of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; would be useless. N'Zoth will strike in the mind. Later he joined Magni back at the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; and guided the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;visions of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. Revealing that the best way to protect one's mind against the Old Gods required an object pure corruption, Wrathion and adventurers ventured to &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt; atop the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving, the pair discovered that N'Zoth's agents had seized control of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;'s liar, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Inquisitor%20Xanesh\"&gt;Dark Inquisitor Xanesh&lt;/a&gt; planned on making Nefarian's legacy &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; own. Amidst the fighting, Wrathion was captured with the Dark Inquisitor revealing her intentions to use his essence to resurrect both Nefarian and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; as tools of war for N'Zoth. However, Xanesh failed when adventurers freed Wrathion, who declared that the black dragonflight would purge N'Zoth from Azeroth. Following Xanesh's retreat into &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion destroyed the remains of Nefarian and Onyxia and used the &lt;a href=\"%3ACorrupt%20Black%20Dragonscales\"&gt;:Corrupt Black Dragonscales&lt;/a&gt; left behind to create &lt;a href=\"Ashjra%27kamas%2C%20Shroud%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;Ashjra'kamas&lt;/a&gt;. Declaring that this cloak was all that remained of the once-proud black dragonflight, Wrathion revealed that it would defend them from sanity loss and the corruption of N'Zoth.\nSometime after Wrathion arrived to the Chamber of Heart, Ebyssian inquired as to how the Black Prince had known he had begun to hear &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s whispers. In response, Wrathion admitted that he had one of his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon%20Watcher\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; watching over him due to knowing that Ebyssian would become vulnerable upon leaving &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. In a surprise, Ebyssian remarked that he was unaware that Wrathion had such a personal concern for his well-being, causing the younger dragon to remark that they were brothers and the only one that Wrathion had left.\nAs adventurers entered &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; they had to face &lt;a href=\"Wrathion%2C%20the%20Black%20Emperor\"&gt;Wrathion, the Black Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, who was supposedly a Wrathion who had given in to the Old Gods' corruption, but after killing it they discovered that it was a &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt; in disguise rather than the Black Prince himself. Wrathion \"was\" present within the realm of N'Zoth, however. He was given &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;the Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; by Azshara who told him to stab N'Zoth in the heart with it. Wrathion instead stabbed the &lt;a href=\"Carapace%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;Carapace of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; which during the fight with the &lt;a href=\"Fury%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;Fury of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; helped adventurers regain their sanity by teleporting back to him. Following the death of N'Zoth, when asked as to what lied next for him, Wrathion remarked that though the Old Gods had been vanquished, they were but one threat to Azeroth and that many more lurked on the horizon and in the shadows. He further declared that from this day forth the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; will honor its ancient charge and stand in defense of Azeroth, along with its champions.\nThe adventurers also brought forth young dragons of the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, ones which had been raised inside N'Zoth's carapace and so been exposed more directly to his corruption. Wrathion clears the dragons' minds of the whispers, with the promise that they, as well as he himself, will find themselves again one day despite their pasts.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nWhile staying at the &lt;a href=\"Summer%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Summer's Rest&lt;/a&gt; inn in Pandaria in his search for the Dragon Isles, Wrathion has a nightmare of transforming into Deathwing. In this nightmare he at first serves as the uncorrupted Earth-Warder and leader of the black dragonflight, only for a shadow to wash over him and turn him into his father. He is attacked by his allies, not only the Aspects and their flights but even his fellow black dragons.\nHe later attends the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. At the reception he encounters &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, who accuses all dragons of being unnatural but especially him because of the nature of his birth. Already stressed, Kurog's egging on makes Wrathion snap and threaten him, but &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; intervenes before Wrathion can go too far. With Thalyssra's arrival to see what the commotion was, Kurog leaves while threatening that soon they would all know the true power of the tauren. Wrathion is rocked by what he had almost done, and remembers his nightmare where he turned into Deathwing with fear.\nWrathion leaves for the vineyard, and Kalecgos follows him with two glasses of &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;. The two discuss the black dragonflight's poor reputation and the falls of both Neltharion and Malygos. They muse on how both of their flights' former Aspects had been best friends, and Wrathion wonders if the two of them couldn't spark a friendship as well. Kalec turns the conversation to the Dragon Isles, and Wrathion admits he has not learned anything new. &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; had seemed confused when Wrathion had asked, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; is dead so can't be asked, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't even grant him an audience. Even &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; had only told him that the isles were lost.\nKalec and Wrathion both realize that they are experiencing a sensation of loneliness, or a weight on their chest, of feeling something they could not articulate that they wanted but could not have. The two of them doubt both experiencing this could be a coincidence, and wonder if other dragons are experiencing it as well. The two travel to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; to ask Alexstrasza further questions, where they discover that many other dragons have also assembled in a mass gathering at the temple's base, all feeling the same sensation. Rather than wait, Wrathion flies to the top of the temple to speak to Alexstrasza personally.\nAtop the temple, he finds not only Alexstrasza but Nozdormu and &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; as well. Alexstrasza tells him that they have heard the call of the reawakening Dragon Isles, a sensation reaching out to the hearts of all dragons. The feeling that Wrathion and all the others were feeling is homesickness, and Wrathion realizes he is finally being welcomed, and has a place to belong. The feeling of emptiness in his heart becomes one of joy, and he decides that his recurring nightmare is not a forecast of doom, but a challenge to be conquered. Now that he has a home, Wrathion vows that it will be him, not Deathwing, that will guide the black dragons into a new future.\nDragonflight.\nWrathion struggled as to whether he truly desired to be the leader of the black dragonflight. Nevertheless, with the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to Azeroth, he returned to his flight's ancient homeland. Despite their past disagreements, Alexstrasza offered him guidance.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were uncovered, Ebyssian and Wrathion traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; and discovered the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, ancient creations of Neltharion that had been in stasis for 20,000 years. They helped the dracthyr battle the invading &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his arrival at the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion saw &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; breaking the vault seal and tried to stop him, but it was too late, and the Black Prince crashed to the ground after being knocked by debris from the just-destroyed prison. Coming to his senses, he faced the freed &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, who recognized him as a dragon of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing from Wrathion his wish to become the new Aspect of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragons\"&gt;black dragons&lt;/a&gt;, Raszageth asked him if he wanted to meet the same fate as Neltharion, whose she learned the death during her imprisonment, but finally decided to let him go as a messenger for &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, ordering him to announce that the Primalists would make sure to cleanse the world of the titans' \"stain\".\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; forced the Primalists to flee, the Bronze Aspect told the dracthyr to warn the nations of the world of the oncoming threat, and Wrathion took the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to introduce them to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, Wrathion went to ask the Aspects who Raszageth was, and learned that she and the rest of the Incarnates were ancient enemies of the Aspects who sought to cleanse the world of the titans' \"stain\". The Aspects decided to reclaim the powers they had lost when they defeated Deathwing, for without that power they wouldn't be able to defeat the Incarnates.\nWhen Wrathion brought &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Scalecommander Azurathel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, he mentioned that they would be well received through its connections with the leaders of the city. However, the opposite happened, and they were soon received by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; and the Spymaster &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; who reminded the black dragon that he has been warned against making unannounced visits, especially when he brings company. In order to calm the situation, Wrathion apologized and announced his request to deliver a message from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to Lord Commander &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. The Spymaster agreed to allow the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; to visit the city but warned them that the would be watching them closely and that the responsibility of their actions would fall on the Black Prince. In the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion briefed Turalyon on the recent events, and extended the Aspects' invitation to the Dragon Isles. During a conversation between them and Scalecommander Azurathel, he thanked Turalyon for accepting the invitation and then mentioned that the Dragon Queen insisted that the Alliance should not bring any conflict to the islands with the Horde. After Turalyon claimed that the Alliance would honor its truce with the Horde, and that he instructed the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; to work in concert with the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Prince announced that he was delighted with the turn of events, and that it was time to prepare the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; for departure to the Dragon Isles.\nAfter Khadgar arrived and shared that the Aspects sought to restore their former powers to fight against Raszageth, Wrathion directed adventurers with finding a &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;disc&lt;/a&gt; within , only to learn from them that the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; had attacked and sent the disc to be lost through time. After receiving the news, he declared that the infinites always had some kind of plan, and that he would let Alexstrasza know that they would need to find another way for the Aspects to restore their powers.\nHe then moved on ahead to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where he, alongside &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Selistra\"&gt;Majordomo Selistra&lt;/a&gt;, planned on awaiting at &lt;a href=\"Wingrest%20Embassy\"&gt;Wingrest Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt; for the Dragonscale Expedition to arrive. However when the expedition arrived they were nowhere to be seen, having left the area, and subsequently discovering that the &lt;a href=\"Djaradin\"&gt;Djaradin&lt;/a&gt; had awakened from their long slumber on the isles and destroyed &lt;a href=\"Dragonheart%20Outpost\"&gt;Dragonheart Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. After directing &lt;a href=\"Sendrax\"&gt;Sendrax&lt;/a&gt; and adventures with aiding the outpost, the pair left to keep the djaradin contained inside &lt;a href=\"Scalecracker%20Keep\"&gt;Scalecracker Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After the outpost was successfully evacuated, Wrathion noted that the &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s would be safe at the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Life%20Pools\"&gt;Ruby Life Pools&lt;/a&gt;, as not even the djaradin would not raise arms against the might of Queen Alexstrasza herself.\nTurning his attention to the djaradin within the keep, Wrathion called for the deaths of their leaders. He also called for the collection of the intel from his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt; agents within the keep, and welcomed any additional information that adventurers could discover. After discovering that the djaradin intended to claim the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight's seat of power, an enraged Wrathion immediately rushed off to stop them. However, he soon realized that he needed aid and so went to recruit Alexstrasza, only to discover her in the midst of conflict with Raszageth, and was quick to rush in to rescue her. An amused Raszageth decided to leave the pair, as she wanted Alexstrasza to watch as everything she cared for was destroyed before killing her.\nAlexstrasza offered her gratitude to Wrathion, who was quick to try and recruit her and &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;her flight&lt;/a&gt;'s aid in claiming the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza agreed to do, after they had seen to the safety of the eggs, a declaration that confused Wrathion now that Raszageth had left. However, Alexstrasza was quick to point out that Wrathion didn't know her as she did, that she was an unpredictable foe, and that for now the red dragonflight must remain at the Life Pools to safeguard their future. Wrathion was quick to question if it was the dragon's future or her flights that she sought to safeguard, as the Obsidian Citadel was built to defend all the Dragon Isles, and implored that she couldn't abandon the legacy of &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;his flight&lt;/a&gt; to the hands of their enemies. In response, she remarked that she would have expected him to care more for the protection of helpless eggs. Wrathion subsequently departed, determined to claim the citadel with the aid of his Blacktalon.\nHaving nothing but concern for Wrathion, she enlisted adventurers to go and aid him in her stead, while she helped focus on protecting the new generation of &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkind&lt;/a&gt;. Wrathion warmly welcomed their aid, believing that with their presence his plans could succeed. After having his forces tested and going over their intel, Wrathion was prepared to move forward, waiving away any concerns about their low numbers and arrogantly declaring himself an \"incalculable advantage\" and that he would not be denied his legacy. He then gave the order to begin the assault, taking control of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Ascent\"&gt;Burning Ascent&lt;/a&gt; in the process, and as the proper assault on the citadel itself began he was stunned to discover &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;his brood&lt;/a&gt; (including a clutch of black dragon eggs) arriving to aid in the fight. After a brief introduction with one another, the pair moved forward in striking against their enemies, ultimately resulting in them claiming the upper courtyard of the citadel and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Oathstone\"&gt;Obsidian Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. However despite this victory, Wrathion found himself surprised as Sabellian announced his own intentions to become the Neltharion's successor as Aspect, an act he rejected due to viewing that as his own destiny. Thus a competition between the two was born for the Aspectship of the black dragonflight.\nEach claimant was quick to try and enlist adventures to their side and their followers eagerly backed them up. However, while Sabellian's focus was on how he had helped his fellow black dragons, Wrathion was focused on the success of his ends-of-the-means approached, veering into propaganda with &lt;a href=\"Right\"&gt;Right&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Left\"&gt;Left&lt;/a&gt; justifying his liberation of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; from his trial as necessary to prepare Azeroth for the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, an invasion that was inadvertency started by Garrosh's liberation, since it ultimately led to 's arrival to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where he would start the said invasion. Wrathion's absence during the invasion was not commented on and it was shown that the bulk of Wrathion's support base was his Blacktalon agents, while the majority of Sabellian's support base were other black dragons.\nAs Sabellian went to deliver the black dragon eggs to the Ruby Pools, Wrathion insisted on accompanying him. As the pair traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Lifeshrine\"&gt;Ruby Lifeshrine&lt;/a&gt; via cart, Sabellian insisted they remain incognito, even when Wrathion pointed out that it was obvious that ruse had failed. After various attacks were fended off, the pair were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Thaladrax\"&gt;Thaladrax&lt;/a&gt;, who destroyed the cart and the eggs within. An outraged Wrathion viewed this as a sign that the others would see reason and pick their new leader and rushed off to inform Alexstrasza. When the Dragon Queen demanded answers, Sabellian revealed that he had used himself and Wrathion as bait to attract their enemies' attention, while his clutch of black dragons safely traveled by air to deliver the eggs. He then pledged his loyalty and that of his flight as &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;'s heir to her, to Wrathion's outrage. However before he could protest, Alexstrasza stepped in and remarked that while she would take care of the eggs, she would not get involved in their bickering and the matter of Aspectship between them was a matter for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, to decide.\nWrathion and Sabellian remained at the Ruby Lifeshrine for a time to see &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Elion\"&gt;Mother Elion&lt;/a&gt;, who described them as \"squabbling like children\", to restore their flight's place there and defended the area during the Primalist attack.\nWrathion and Sabellian then returned to the Obsidian Citadel, continuing their battle against the djaradin, while accepting pledges of loyalty from champions of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmbers of Neltharion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Incarnates\"&gt;Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; opened the way into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; called upon Wrathion, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer to enter and deal with &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;. After the adventurer arrived to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Seat of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion gave them the &lt;a href=\"Untranslated%20Obsidian%20Tome\"&gt;Untranslated Obsidian Tome&lt;/a&gt;, on the grounds that he didn't have the time to translate it himself and that he had always found them determined when it came to mysteries. While Sabellian and Wrathion immediately set off to the caverns, Ebyssian detoured and recruited &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; to their mission. Upon their arrival Wrathion found himself held at spearpoint by &lt;a href=\"Khasar\"&gt;Khasar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baba\"&gt;Baba&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Raidon\"&gt;Raidon&lt;/a&gt;, while Sabellian observed &lt;a href=\"Iridikron%27s%20Gambit\"&gt;Iridikron's Gambit&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;the Shikaar&lt;/a&gt; had worked alongside the adventurer before, Wrathion turned to them to resolve the matter and confirm what had transpired. After confirming that Fyrakk was responsible for the death &lt;a href=\"Shalkeel\"&gt;Shalkeel&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion joined Sabellian in observing Iridikron's Gambit. He noted how the tunnel was massive and couldn't help but wonder Fyrakk alone entered or if he came with an army.\nBelieving it to be a tactical mistake to wait any longer for Ebyssian and Emberthal to arrive, the pair ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt; and encountered &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; forces. As they prepared to battle, Wrathion heard a voice, but it turned to the back of his mind as he rushed forward to bring terror to his enemies. This strategy clashed with Sabellian, who wanted to take a stealth approach and believed that Wrathion was allowing himself to be baited by &lt;a href=\"Summitshaper%20Lorac\"&gt;Summitshaper Lorac&lt;/a&gt;. Even as they clashed side by side against the Primalists, the pair continued to bicker about who would ascend to the obsidian throne. In the aftermath of Lorac's death, Sabellian admitted Wrathion had acquitted himself well in the fight, causing the Black Prince to thank him, only for Sabellian to promise to find a place for him among his troops. About to argue, once more, about who were to be the Aspect of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion discovered Fyrakk approaching them and called out a warning to Sabellian, even as the Incarnate attacked. As they lay on the ground, the group was taken captive by deepflayers and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Deepflayer%20Nest\"&gt;Deepflayer Nest&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrathion was later rescued from captivity by the adventurer through the guidance of their new ally the &lt;a href=\"niffen\"&gt;niffen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Honeypelt\"&gt;Elder Honeypelt&lt;/a&gt;. The group then were able to escape and reunite with Sabellian, who was unimpressed with Wrathion and admitted that he expected more from the Black Prince after listening to him boast about he had single-handedly slain &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. Wrathion, however, retorted that it was a team effort, something Sabellian was incapable of understanding. This caused an outraged Sabellian to declare that they were the black dragonflight, that it meant something, and that Neltharion would have never fallen to such a foe. Wrathion was quick to call him out on comparing himself to their father and declared that he had shown his true colors, if that was his aspiration. Sabellian then broke away to investigate a relic that reminded him that used to belong to Neltharion, while Wrathion not realizing that his rival was doing merely thought he was walked away from, and decided to play that game.\nBefore the group moved forward, Wrathion admitted that while his relationship with Sabellian was strained, their behavior was out of line, and reveal that there was something within Zaralek testing their mental defenses. Though determined to speak to Sabellian at his own pace, Wrathion formally apologized to the adventurer and Honeypelt, and was subsequently forgiven. As infuriating as he found Sabellian, he directed with adventurers with checking on him, as he was still family and he had no wish to see become dinner to the deepflayers. In time, Sabellian, Wrathion, Honeypelt, and the adventurer regrouped and traveled as one to &lt;a href=\"Loamm\"&gt;Loamm&lt;/a&gt;, where Wrathion and Sabellian discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; had also arrived to Zaralek. Upon reaching the city, the dragons were reunited with Ebyssian and Emberthal. As the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and Emberthal gathered, Sabellian shared news of the Sundered Flame and revealed that they sought &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, a laboratory once used by Neltharion. In response, Wrathion declared that he would go and search for Aberrus, quietly and alone, a move given tactic permission by Ebyssian who warned him to stay hidden.\nAs Wrathion searched for Aberrus, Ebyssian and Emberthal set off to &lt;a href=\"Nal%20ks%27kol\"&gt;Nal ks'kol&lt;/a&gt;. While they were gone, Wrathion returned to the town and received from Sabellian an invitation to join his troops, with a high-ranking position, but Wrathion refused still convinced that he should become the Aspect of the flight. When Ebyssian and Emberthal returned, they found themselves questioned by the pair as to what treasures he and Emberthal had found. Unimpressed with their content, he questioned what was truly important was who was the rightful heir to a legacy of deceit, control, and fear. When Sabellian and Wrathion grew outraged at the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, Ebyssian called them out on their bickering, declared that Emberthal had done right for her people, and encouraged them to let go of the past, as their flight needed them here and now.\nAs Ebyssian and Sabellian departed to find Fyrakk, Wrathion himself left the town, either for his own reasons or to continue his mission of locating and observing Aberrus. As the hunt for Fyrakk unfolded, things went awry as the Incarnate was revealed to have consumed &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;, the very poison that corrupted Neltharion and bested the pair before leaving a blaze of destruction in his wake. Seeing the destruction brought, Wrathion returned to Loamm only to discover the town sent blaze and subsequently demanded to know what happened from his brothers. The black dragons then moved as one to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Seat of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to inform Alexstrasza and the others of what had transpired. Upon learning that shadowflame resided within Zaralek, Alexstrasza initially barred the black dragonflight from returning, unwillingly to risk losing them, before Ebyssian convinced her that they had the strength to resist what lies below.\nSometime later, Wrathion and his brothers returned to the Zaralek Caverns where they worked with a group of soldiers stationed by &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Rest\"&gt;Obsidian Rest&lt;/a&gt;, who remained loyal to the black dragonflight. Upon their arrival, Wrathion expressed that they were once again in a very unusual environment and believed that everything would change when they uncover the secrets of Neltharion's legacy. When adventurers questioned him about Aberrus, Wrathion called it a mysterious and foreboding place, that was hidden away from the rest of the world for a good reason. He further revealed that the very walls of the Laboratory seem to whisper with the echoes of dark magic and forbidden knowledge and that it was a place of danger and fascination, one they must explore if they hoped to confront their father's legacy head-on. When questioned about Sabellian, he admitted that the \"heir apparent\" had healed from his wounds but was sadly still convinced that the leadership of the black dragonflight was still his right. He further admitted to seeing Sabellian as the personification of the old days, a remnant of the past, and that was why he couldn't let him have leadership, and that he must take the flight forward, away from the old ways.\nWrathion later joined the rest of the black dragonflight in fighting against the djaradin within the &lt;a href=\"Battlefield%20Ruins\"&gt;Battlefield Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, with him declaring it was the day they reminded their enemies that these lands were under their protection. In the aftermath of the battle, they discovered that a group of djaradin had been killed by a group of unknown &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; force that still carried Neltharion's banner, and learned of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"slitherdrake\"&gt;slitherdrake&lt;/a&gt;s. Wrathion personally found the slitherdrakes to be extraordinary creatures. In contrast, Sabellian viewed them as Neltharion's failed experiments that could be made to serve the flight, as fodder for the battlefield. When Wrathion objected to his notion and questioned if he was just fodder to him as well, Sabellian confirmed that was precisely what he was, angering Wrathion who left in a huff.\nWrathion was later approached by Ebyssian, who successfully recruited him and his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalons&lt;/a&gt; for the assault on Aberrus. He was not surprised to find Sabellian present, when he arrived to aid Ebyssian and Emberthal. The black dragonflight united as one as they clashed against &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;'s forces within the &lt;a href=\"Brimstone%20Garrison\"&gt;Brimstone Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. During the fighting, Wrathion directed adventurers with securing weapons of historic value to the flight. After Emberthal and Ebyssian forced Sarkareth to flee into Aberrus, Wrathion and Sabellian chased him, determined to not him gain control of the lab. As they ventured into the lab, they were confronted by an echo of Neltharion, who tested each of them to see if they were his true heirs as they fought to claim Aberrus. In the end, both brothers failed as they balked at Neltharion's cruelty, though it was revealed that the echo was, in reality, a &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;, the events of Aberrus shook Sabellian as he confesses that in following Neltharion and aspiring to one day lead the black dragonflight as he did, he became unable, or perhaps unwilling, to acknowledge the malignancy of his father and commander's vision. He provides comfort to Wrathion of how the Black Prince only knew Neltharion as Deathwing, haunting his dreams and reveling in the certainty that he would become him. Both Sabellian and Wrathion then decided that the Aspectship of the black dragonflight should fall onto Ebyssian, one he humbly accepts.\nWrathion then joined the others in returning to the Seat of the Aspects as Ebyssian informed Alexstrasza of what had transpired and took his place as Ebyssian's diplomat.\nWorld of Warcraft Anniversary.\nMedivh and Wrathion were found partaking in the festivities of &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%27s%20Anniversary\"&gt;Warcraft's Anniversary&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nWrathion wields unusually powerful abilities for a &lt;a href=\"black%20whelp\"&gt;black whelp&lt;/a&gt;. He has displayed power over fire, magma, and magic on par with a full-grown black dragon. During &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Blessings\"&gt;Celestial Blessings&lt;/a&gt;, he claims that he wields the power of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, and was probably referring to the powers of &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Keeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; that he stole from &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; by devouring his heart. Wrathion also knows how to wield weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Lance\"&gt;Lightning Lance&lt;/a&gt; he used against the player. \nQuotes.\nMists of Pandaria.\nPre-90.\n&lt;The Black Prince looks you up and down.&gt;\nIt is very good to meet you, &lt;class&gt;.

I brought it with me here, but I do not believe I have ample time to decipher the texts of both.\n&lt;Wrathion pops an eyebrow at you.&gt;\nMind taking a crack at it yourself? I have always found you determined when it comes to little mysteries.\n \nNo need to dwell too much on the tome, &lt;name&gt;. Ancient history seldom calls for immediate action.\nWell... Unless it escapes from a vault after thousands of years and unleashes its havoc-wreaking siblings on the world.\nIt is nice to see you, &lt;name&gt;.\nHeritage.\nWhile Wrathion refers to Deathwing as his father, this claim is dubious, since &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; was previously established as the only dragon to survive mating with him after he succumbed to corruption. When asked about Wrathion's lineage, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the theory that Deathwing isn't Wrathion's literal father, and tweeted the following:\nWhile Wrathion's mother is clearly &lt;a href=\"Nyxondra\"&gt;Nyxondra&lt;/a&gt;, the identity of his father is unclear. &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;/Deathwing is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and as such is likely seen as the father of the entire flight (which could be why he refers to Deathwing's actions and why the legendary daggers are named Fangs of the Father). As there is no real shortage of other named (and unnamed) male black dragons, Wrathion's actual father could have been any of them.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Visual%20Guide\"&gt;Ultimate Visual Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" lists Wrathion as Deathwing's son and as Onyxia's and Nefarian's half-sibling.\nKosak later stated that Nyxondra was Onyxia's sister and tweeted out the following:\nThis would mean that Deathwing is Wrathion's \"grandfather\", not his father. This would also make Onyxia and Nefarian his aunt and uncle, respectively. This also corresponds with Wrathion's own words when he called Onyxia his auntie.\nOddly enough, an official page stated that Wrathion is a child of Deathwing, and \"&lt;a href=\"War%20Crimes\"&gt;War Crimes&lt;/a&gt;\" mentions Wrathion being sired by Deathwing. However, Wrathion was not technically sired by another black dragon, his egg was artificially created by the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Watchers%20%28Badlands%29\"&gt;Eye of the Watchers&lt;/a&gt; which magically combined the purified matter of one of Nyxondra's eggs with another wild black dragon egg of unknown parentage and a black whelp corpse. \"&lt;a href=\"Annual%202015\"&gt;Annual 2015&lt;/a&gt;\" also lists Deathwing as Wrathion's father.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Visual%20Guide%2C%20Updated%20and%20Expanded\"&gt;Ultimate Visual Guide, Updated and Expanded&lt;/a&gt;\", all mentions of Wrathion being related to Deathwing and his children are removed. In Wrathion's entry, Nyxondra is listed as his only known relative.\nDue to these contradictions, Wrathion's heritage was subject to much debate, with different sources giving different ideas as to how Wrathion fits into Deathwing's family tree.\nIn \"Battle for Azeroth\", there are still references of calling Deathwing his father. In \"Dragonflight\" Sabellian calls Wrathion his little brother, rather than his nephew, which he should be if Deathwing is his grandfather, though later questions Wrathion's 'lineage' at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDave Kosak on Wrathion.\nDuring an interview with WoW Insider in 2012 Lead Quest Designer &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; talked about Wrathion:\nIn Hearthstone.\nWrathion appears as in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Despite being a black dragon, his \"Hearthstone\" card lacks the Dragon minion type due to him using his human guise, a fact that is referenced by his flavor text:\"Wrathion, son of Deathwing, is a dragon. Why isn't he tagged as a dragon, you ask? WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING TO BLOW HIS COVER??\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Ki'merax's true form is revealed upon \"Wrathion's\" defeat.\nAdventure Journal.\n\"Despite all his precautions, Wrathion could not avoid succumbing to the madness that claimed &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;. With his mind twisted by &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, he believes that the only way he can truly defend &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is to rule it in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; name. A prince no longer, Wrathion now takes his rightful place as the Black Emperor.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: The Black Emperor\n Searing Breath: Inflicts 80 Fire damage to all players in a cone in front of the caster and applies a stack of Searing Armor.\nSearing Armor: Inflicts 6 Fire damage every 1 sec for 15 sec. Also, increases the damage of Searing Breath by 50%.\nThis effect stacks.\nIncineration: Ignites random targets, inflicting 15 Fire damage every 2 sec for 8 sec. Upon expiration, targets explode, inflicting 90 Fire damage to all players. Damage decreases the further targets are from the point of impact.\nGale Blast: Unleashes a gale blast, inflicting 65 Fire damage and knocking players back within 20 yards, as well as inflicting 45 Fire damage to all players outside of 20 yards.\nAfterwards, launches fire balls at random enemy destinations that inflict 35 Fire damage to enemies within 5 yards of impact.\n Burning Cataclysm: Wrathion teleports to a random spot within the room and spews fire, inflicting 5 Fire damage to enemies farther than 15 yards from the boss and 40 Fire damage to enemies within 15 yards every 1 sec for 8 sec.\nAdditionally, scorching blisters form throughout the area.\nScorching Blister: From the ash, scorching blisters form. Inflicts 25 Fire damage every 1 sec to enemies standing within them.\nThese blisters grow over 10 sec before exploding, inflicting 120 Fire damage to enemies within 20 yards.\nMolten Eruption: Slams the ground, causing lava to erupt, inflicting 34 Fire damage and knocking back players within 3 yards of point of impact.\nEach eruption leaves behind a Molten Pool.\nMolten Pool: Inflicts 25 Fire damage every 1 sec to a player standing within the pool.\nAny pools remaining when Wrathion returns are changed into a Gale Blast.\nTail Swipe: Inflicts 80 Physical damage to players in a cone behind him, knocking them back.\nCreeping Madness: While under the effects of this madness, players gain stacks of Slow while they are moving for 1.3 min.\nAt 50 stacks of Slow, the player receives 61 Shadow damage every time they move.\nStage Two: Smoke and Mirrors\nScales of Wrathion: Scales fall from Wrathion. Catching a scale inflicts the player with Burning Madness. Any scales not caught inflict 70 Fire damage to all players.\n Burning Madness: While under the effects of madness, any Crackling Shard you run over is removed and extends the duration of your Burning Madness. Each time this occurs one stack of Burning Madness is removed. (Normal, Heroic, Raid Finder)\n Burning Madness: While under the effects of madness, any Crackling Shard you run over cancels Hardened Core and extends the duration of your Burning Madness. Each time this occurs one stack of Burning Madness is removed. (Mythic)\nCrackling Shard: Summoned from molten pools. Any shards still remaining at the end of Stage Two are turned into Lava Pillars.\nHardened Core: The shard's hardened core makes them immune to damage. (Mythic)\nPyroclastic Flow: When a shard is destroyed, it inflicts 15 Fire damage to all players within 10 yards.\nLava Pools: Formed from unbroken shards, lava pools inflict 25 Fire damage every 1 sec to players standing within the pool.\nWith every lava pools created, an additional stack of Rising Heat is applied to players.\nRising Heat: As lava pillars consume the space, heat rises inflicting 0 Fire damage every 1 sec for the duration of the encounter.\nThis effect stacks.\nAshwalker Assassin: Conjured from smoke and ash, these servants of Wrathion stalk the players during Stage Two.\nSmoke Shroud: Shrouded in smoke, the assassin fades from view.\nRevealing the assassin from stealth or inflicting damage disperses the shroud from the minion.\nSap: While shrouded, Wrathion's minions incapacitate their victims.\nDark Ambush: While shrouded, Wrathion's minions will strike from the shadows inflicting 120 Shadow damage to their current target.\nOverview.\nAs the fight progresses, Wrathion teleports to random locations and uses [Burning Cataclysm] against the raid, igniting [Molten Eruptions] throughout the space. Doing so consumes Wrathion's energy, and when all his energy is depleted, he melds into the shadows and inflicts [Burning Madness] on enemies. Additionally, all [Molten Eruptions] transform into Crackling Shards.\nWhile hidden in the shadows, Wrathion regains energy, and once fully recharged returns to the fight space and turns any remaining Crackling shards into [Lava Pillars].\nTrivia.\n\"Despite all his schemes, Wrathion could not avoid succumbing to the madness that claimed &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;. With his mind corrupted by &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Prince is a force of unbridled hatred, capable of annihilating all who oppose him in blood and flame.\""}

Players can choose to support either &lt;a href=\"Sabellian%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; or Wrathion each week in the world quest &lt;a href=\"Allegiance%20to%20One\"&gt;Allegiance to One&lt;/a&gt;, unlocking new weekly quest options. Supporting one does not lock out the other, with rewards for getting both to exalted.\nReputation.\nThe Wrathion reputation can be raised by doing weekly quests in the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; region of the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of these quests, players can repeatedly farm the &lt;a href=\"Djaradin\"&gt;Djaradin&lt;/a&gt; in the area; obtaining &lt;a href=\"Key%20Framing\"&gt;Key Framing&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Key%20Fragments\"&gt;Key Fragments&lt;/a&gt;. Restoring these keys will grant a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Obsidian%20Key\"&gt;Greater Obsidian Key&lt;/a&gt; once each week, which can be turned into the chosen dragon for the week. Every subsequent restoration will create a &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Obsidian%20Key\"&gt;Restored Obsidian Key&lt;/a&gt;, which can be turned into Sabellian for 250 reputation.\nThe reputation also accepts &lt;a href=\"Sargha%27s%20Signet\"&gt;Sargha's Signet&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly drop from the Djaradin mobs for 50 reputation each. These marks can also be sold on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;; allowing enterprising players a shortcut to reputation. They will not, however, accept &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Sargha\"&gt;Mark of Sargha&lt;/a&gt;, which is for the Sabellian reputation; so be careful which is obtained.\nEvery 20 keys turned into Sabellian will cause the &lt;a href=\"Shas%27ith\"&gt;Shas'ith&lt;/a&gt; rare to be unlocked. Killing the rare will reward an additional 250 reputation every time it is slain.\nWrathion's reputation holds 6 ranks, each of which requires 8,400 reputation to rank through. Starting at Acquaintance, the player will rank through the following sequentially: Cohort, Ally, Fang, Friend, True Friend. Completing quests and returning keys for Sabellian and Wrathion will also reward &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken%20Accord\"&gt;Valdrakken Accord&lt;/a&gt; reputation.\nRewards.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

Obsessed with obtaining and devouring magic, they are a danger to both themselves and others, and are usually too violent to surrender. \nThey are considered to be little more than lowly parasites to blood elven society and serve as a reminder of the dangers of allowing their magical addiction to control them.\nThe Wretched are thin elves with thinning dark hair, a large bony forehead, claw-like fingers and toes, blue eyes, and strange growths on their backs that glow with an eerie blue light. With the recovery of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; summoning the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a new type of Wretched appeared. After the events of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; also became Wretched.\nBackground.\nThe Wretched are currently scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; and lack any general leadership, but a few notable Wretched have stepped up and organized raids. The Wretched have infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ruins of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunsail%20Anchorage\"&gt;Sunsail Anchorage&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Falthrien%20Academy\"&gt;Falthrien Academy&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20Isle\"&gt;Sunstrider Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Though considered more of a pest than a true threat in blood elf society, the Wretched represent a failure to reach the equilibrium between deficiency and overindulgence that all blood elves strive to maintain, and serve as an important reminder of the dangers that overindulging in magic can present. This \"kind\" of blood elf is believed to be relatively new, considering the fact that they can only have existed since after the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gershala%20Nightwhisper\"&gt;Gershala Nightwhisper&lt;/a&gt; feared this transformation might occur before the events of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\". He even sent adventurers in &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt; to get corrupted brain stems from &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;. The Wretched can be compared to both &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; because their magical dependence caused them to undergo physiological changes. Unlike those two races, this transformation can occur in an instant as soon as the blood elf succumbs to his or her thirst for magic (as &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Elosai\"&gt;Magistrix Elosai&lt;/a&gt;'s transformation into the Wretched shows).\n&lt;a href=\"Felblood%20Initiate\"&gt;Felblood Initiate&lt;/a&gt;s use the wretched model when emaciated, indicating a connection between the two.\nNext generation.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;events of the Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; being used to summon the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a new type of Wretched was created. While some have mild symptoms of this advanced mutation, others have major physical changes. The basic symptoms include bulging green eyes, black rot-like mouths with what looks like black drool coming from them, less hair, green growths, feet, and hands that are more claw-like and are of an almost demon-like brown color, and small holes where growths should be from their Wretched transformation. The ones with the most dramatic changes have deep sucked-in chests, more holes that look like they appeared from popped growths, markings near their eyes, and more of a monster-like appearance, barely resembling their former selves.\nThese more serious mutations have appeared from tapping into the energies granted by the Burning Legion; in fact, some blood elves trying to become &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;felbloods&lt;/a&gt; have become Wretched due to absorbing too much fel energy. These Wretched served Kael'thas fiercely, and he rewarded them by supplying them with mass amounts of fel energy for them to feed on. So far these Wretched have only appeared on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, likely because this mutation is fairly new still and can only exist after a blood elf or Wretched has absorbed mass amounts of fel energy \u2014 which is mainly located in those two areas.\nMagic-addicted elves too small and frail to serve in &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s army were relegated to servant roles for the higher-class &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith the Legion's defeat at the Sunwell and Kael'thas' death, the spreading of this new breed of Wretched will probably slow down.\nCataclysm.\nThe high elves of the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; have become Wretched, revealing that both high and blood elves can become Wretched.\nIn the RPG.\nBlood elves are evolving from their high elven cousins due to the use of fel magic (the first sign of evolutionary change are \"glowing green eyes\"). It is said in time they may become as distant to high elves as satyrs are to night elves. The Wretched may be examples of further evolution, though it is somewhat of a devolution.\nSpeculation.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; has been restored, providing a constant supply of magical energy to both blood elves and high elves, it is unknown if the Wretched have access to the energies of the restored Sunwell, or if their transformation has turned them into a new species cut off from this supply. It is also not clear if the transformation into Wretched is reversible."}

The slumbering titan was shrouded in &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energy and being corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s which led to Sargeras destroying it, in order to prevent the birth of a &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt; that would end the universe. This event caused a schism within the Pantheon and ultimately led to Sargeras leaving them to begin the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWhile hunting the universe for &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, the titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; discovered a black, desiccated planet radiating cold, &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energies. Much to his horror, he realized that the planet was a &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of the joyous and peaceful dreams he was used to hearing, the world-soul screamed in horrific nightmares. Earlier in the universe's history, a group of &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s had found the world-soul first and had embedded themselves on the planet's surface, corrupting it with their shadowy tendrils.\nA conclave of &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; had also discovered and settled on the world to bask in the Old Gods' dark power. Captured and interrogated by Sargeras, the demons revealed the Old Gods' plan to corrupt the world-soul so that it would awaken as an unstoppable, &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt; who would consume all matter and energy in the universe and bring all of existence under the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s' will. While he already knew of the Void, this was the first time Sargeras realized the extent of the void lords' plans. He killed the nathrezim and then, believing the world-soul too far gone and knowing there was no other way to stop the dark titan from rising, used his blade to cleave the planet in two, killing the nascent titan within.\nWhen Sargeras returned to the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon%20of%20Order\"&gt;Pantheon of Order&lt;/a&gt; to tell of these events, the other titans chastised him, arguing that it might've been possible to save the world-soul without killing it. A quarrel ensued, resulting in Sargeras storming off and cutting all ties with the Pantheon. After much pondering and terrified at the thought that the void lords' might already be corrupting other world-souls, Sargeras came to the conclusion that the only way to stop their plans was to destroy all life in the universe. Sargeras freed all the demons he had captured to form the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and initiated the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. He thought that once all traces of the Void had been cleansed, life could maybe take root again, as it had once before.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient world existing on the brink of the Void, may be the remnants of the corrupted planet. &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt; states that Telogrus \"echoes with the whispers of the great ones who were slain... and the hatred of he who broke this world\", possibly referring to the Old Gods and Sargeras respectively. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt; refers to the rift as \"a very old place\", \"broken by rage, yet sculpted by the threads of fate\".\nIn June 2023, a \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" developer interview published by \"Game Rant\" mistakenly referred to Telogrus as a titan, seemingly confirming the above theory. However, both the interviewed developers and the article author quickly clarified that the mention of Telogrus had been an editorialization by the author and not official information from Blizzard; the mistake was removed from the article shortly thereafter."}

The rubbings you recovered have allowed us to recreate the glyphs on this crystalline prism. They are apparently a means for the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals.\nTake the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold. She might be able to help.\nProgress.\nOh my! What do you have there, &lt;name&gt;?\nCompletion.\nThe reason the dwarves could not decipher the glyphs is because there is nothing to decipher. The shifting outer layer of the prism must properly align with the inner crystal's markings in order for the message to be transmitted. Clever...\nWhile we should be able to translate this data, we must first unlock the code. There is only one clue on the surface of the prism - assuming the rubbings were transferred correctly - and it looks grim.\nNotes.\nUpon completing this quest, a player would receive the error message \"You do not meet the requirements for this quest\" in their chat logs. This is because the game is trying to access the follow up quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Calling\"&gt;The Calling&lt;/a&gt;, which was removed from the game in patch 4.1.0 (due to it leading to a major event in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;), thus trying to find a quest that no longer exists. Therefore, it is normal for the quest line to abruptly end following completion of this quest, and the error the player gets afterwards is a bug and cannot be fixed by any rep gains or leveling. The game's failure to find the quest in its code is what triggers this message."}

Instead, the &lt;a href=\"Global%20Cooldown\"&gt;Global Cooldown&lt;/a&gt; of any other ability following Overpower is cut down to 1 second, while Overpower itself is on a 1.5 second recharge. To maximize damage, you should keep aware that Overpower will cause a syncopation of sorts in your rotation, allowing you to start the next ability in your rotation half a second sooner.\nThe ability also causes a curious synergy with &lt;a href=\"Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt;. Revenge is enabled for several seconds after a successful &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt;.

It was founded on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Namuria%20Gladesong\"&gt;Namuria Gladesong&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and was blessed by the eagle spirit &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;. When the elves who founded the Unseen Path left &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to return to the Broken Isles, the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; recognized the nobility of their cause and offered them friendship. It was the descendants of &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; who led the Unseen Path to its peak. Since the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s return, the Highmountain have helped restore the lodge, such as replacing two damaged watch towers with tauren structures. The Unseen Path is providing secret protection for &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; at the request of &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe order apparently has always provided assistance to those in need (as long as those in question are not evil, of course). One particular example is their sending at least &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf, to help &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; against an &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; troll incursion. She fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Talanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Talanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenturies ago, select leaders were given special emergency flares that were only to be used in times of great need.

It would be 10,000 years later before they crossed paths again. After the war Thaon advocated that the surviving satyrs the night elves had rounded up should all be killed, but he was overruled and they were put into a sleep beneath &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nYears later during &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Moonclaw%20Vale\"&gt;Moonclaw Vale&lt;/a&gt; comes under attack Thaon enlists the assistance of an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to save his grove before he will leave to aid &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they exact vengeance on Xandris the Dishonored, but Thaon afterwards leaves &lt;a href=\"Kagraxxis%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Kagraxxis the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; to be dealt with alone by the adventurer, having sensed an even darker presence that requires his personal attention.\nThe \"darker presence\" is revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, Nightmare Lord of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. When the adventurer catches up, the Image of Xavius gloats that although the archdruid had put up quite a fight, he now belongs to Xavius. With there being no other choice, the adventurer is forced to kill Thaon at the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Claws\"&gt;Den of Claws&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Xavius is killed, Thaon's spirit is found within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThaon appears in the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;, aiding his fellow druids and the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; forces.

He was not among the druids in the &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shady Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; when they were rallied. He could, possibly, have come with Ysera from Ardenweald/the Emerald Dream. Alternatively, his inclusion in the bough might be a developer oversight."}

The massive tree was named \"Thas'alah\", and from its enchanted branches, the entire region seemed to bathe in the glow of an eternal spring.\nTo protect themselves from attacking &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, the Highborne created a series of monolithic &lt;a href=\"Runestone\"&gt;Runestone&lt;/a&gt;s that both acted as wards against intruders and hid the elves' &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The wards succeeded in keeping the elves' enemies out of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; partly due to their anchor: the elven arcanists had linked the Runestones to Thas'alah, tying the power of natural magic to their arcane spells. However, the tree's power could not keep the Highborne safe when they left the city.\nYears later, during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the fighting order of &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; was founded, led by the first &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Talanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders of Silvermoon declared that their champion be given a weapon befitting his new status, and so a trio of artisans joined together to create a great bow for Talanas. They carved its body from a limb taken from Thas'alah and infused the wood with the waters of the Sunwell, causing the weapon to harden and become nearly indestructible while still maintaining its connection to the natural magics of Thas'alah. When it was retrieved from the Sunwell, the bow radiated power. Talanas was humbled by the gift and named it &lt;a href=\"Thas%27dorah%2C%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Windrunners\"&gt;Thas'dorah&lt;/a&gt;, \"Valor of the Forest\".\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Thas'alah was cut down by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; citadel of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; now stands atop its withered roots.\nSpeculation.\nAccording to legend, &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Ironstar\"&gt;Thane Ironstar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; carved his &lt;a href=\"Ironstar%27s%20Petrified%20Shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; from a sacred &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; tree and then enchanted the item to turn it hard as stone. If the legend is true, it could have been Thas'alah."}

Thassarian followed &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; on his expedition to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where he was slain and reanimated by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. He was forced to kill his own &lt;a href=\"Vivian\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; to prove his loyalty and took part in the scourging of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. One of the few death knights of &lt;a href=\"Acherus\"&gt;Acherus&lt;/a&gt; who maintained a genuine sense of honor and brotherhood, Thassarian developed a strong bond with the elf &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; despite being enemies in life, considering themselves brothers in death.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, he was freed from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s control along with many other death knights and joined the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;. Thassarian then traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to serve &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt; and became the first death knight to rejoin the Alliance. He reunited with his sister &lt;a href=\"Leryssa\"&gt;Leryssa&lt;/a&gt; while fighting in the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, Thassarian remained a loyal soldier to his king while also maintaining his friendship with Koltira, even when they were forced to confront each other during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThird War.\nBefore the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Thassarian was a simple farm boy being trained by his father, who was a farmer but also a soldier. His father taught him a lesson that he would follow for the rest of his life If soldiers don't follow orders, defeat is sure to follow. After the death of his father (presumably by the orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;), Thassarian became the man of the house and watched over the farm, his mother &lt;a href=\"Vivian\"&gt;Vivian&lt;/a&gt;, and his sister &lt;a href=\"Leryssa\"&gt;Leryssa&lt;/a&gt;. When word of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; reached them, Thassarian became more vigilant over his home and stayed up almost every night. His sister passed the plague off as simple rumors. One day, he decided to fulfill his dream and follow in his father's footsteps. He enlisted in a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; nearby and went to train with his family friend &lt;a href=\"William%20Allerton\"&gt;William Allerton&lt;/a&gt; under a commander known as &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Yuval\"&gt;Sergeant Yuval&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne day, a promotion was offered to the best combatant in a melee and Thassarian wanted to win it badly. After defeating three combatants, the fourth one threw a dagger at Thassarian's head. Luckily, it hit him with the hilt. After the battle, Yuval approached Thassarian to tell him that he should forget about rising through the ranks and be proud to be a simple skilled soldier that wins battles. While this was hard to bear, he remembered what his father had told him. One day, William came rushing with an urgent message that the prince wanted every available soldier to join him in a hunt. Thassarian accepted but his mother and sister knew that this would be the last time they would see each other. After drying her tears, Vivian gave Thassarian an amulet that used to belong to his father as her blessing.\nSubsequently, he traveled with &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;1st Legion&lt;/a&gt; to Northrend to hunt &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, fighting side by side with William against the undead. When Arthas and Captain &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; went missing, Thassarian went to search for them alone. He discovered &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20Cavern\"&gt;Frostmourne Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, where he found Falric who had already been converted to a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; by Arthas. The death knight slew Thassarian. He was then raised as a death knight by Arthas, serving him as his &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThassarian returned to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; with Arthas and assisted in the massacre of its citizens. Arthas forced him to slay his mother, Vivian, to prove his loyalty. This horrific event continued to haunt him, and it remained, perhaps, his last scrap of humanity for some time. After the death of Vivian, Thassarian tossed the amulet she gave him. William survived the massacre and retrieved the amulet, and after this he left Lordaeron.\nArthas' assault on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; introduced Thassarian to the high elves &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira&lt;/a&gt; and his brother, &lt;a href=\"Faltora\"&gt;Faltora&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"An%27owyn\"&gt;An'owyn&lt;/a&gt;, where he pursued the mooncrystal to open the second moongate and proceed with their attack. Thassarian nearly killed Faltora, but, upon remembering his mother, he decided to show a moment of mercy. He returned to Arthas with the mooncrystal that he recovered. Koltira later confronted Thassarian and questioned why he didn't murder his brother, hoping to convince him to regain his humanity. This attempt failed, and Thassarian killed Koltira, who was returned to undeath as another death knight. Koltira and Thassarian developed a significant friendship that lasts to this day.\nYears later, after the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; had awoken, he ordered his death knights under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; to attack &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; using the necropolis with the goal of raising the thousand or so Alliance soldiers buried beneath it to bolster the ranks of the Scourge and deal a significant blow to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Thassarian, Koltira, and &lt;a href=\"Orbaz%20Bloodbane\"&gt;Orbaz Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt; were stationed at . Their first mission was to go behind enemy lines and find out what they could about the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Dawn\"&gt;Crimson Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. During the process &lt;a href=\"Koltira\"&gt;Koltira&lt;/a&gt; got captured and Thassarian was willing to break the Scourge code concerning the weak to free him.\nThe attack on Light's Hope Chapel ended with a defeat for the death knights. Many of the family of the death knights were buried at Light's Hope Chapel, and the spirits of their relatives rose to convince them to lay down their weapons. Thassarian was convinced by his father, &lt;a href=\"Killoren\"&gt;Killoren&lt;/a&gt;, to stand down. Mograine declared the independence of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Thassarian traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and met with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; who accepted the Knights of Ebon Blade as allies and readmitted its members as members of the Alliance. After this, he went to the Blue Recluse for a drink. He chose this place because he used to come here for the great food, drinks and conversation. He started such a conversation with the innkeeper &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Lohan\"&gt;Steven Lohan&lt;/a&gt; when he ordered a mug of ale. Steven told him he heard of the king's announcement and asked him what he'll do when the Lich King is dead. When Steven asked him if he'll return to his family, Thassarian simply said he had no family.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAfter joining the Alliance he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and enlisted in with the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. There at first he had to kill random Scourge in the area but later he was called to return to the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where Counselor Talbot made him the leader of &lt;a href=\"Unit%20S\"&gt;Unit S&lt;/a&gt; and under orders he marched to &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Ziggurat\"&gt;Wailing Ziggurat&lt;/a&gt; to dispose of it and use the Scourge technology against the Lich King. When Unit S approached their destination, they got attacked by terrible beasts. During the battle, he raised a skeletal warrior, naming him &lt;a href=\"Lurid\"&gt;Lurid&lt;/a&gt;. Thassarian thought why would Talbot send the Unit to meet their death. They eventually discovered that one of the soldiers in the unit was actually a spy for the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Only two men are known to have survived from Unit S. Thassarian and Lurid continued to the &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt;. He found (in-game with the help of an adventurer) &lt;a href=\"Tanathal\"&gt;Tanathal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt; and started to interrogate him and the &lt;a href=\"High%20Deathpriest%20Isidorus\"&gt;High Deathpriest Isidorus&lt;/a&gt;. After getting what he wanted, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Naxxanar\"&gt;Naxxanar&lt;/a&gt;, where he killed &lt;a href=\"Luthion%20the%20Vile\"&gt;Luthion the Vile&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, he confronted &lt;a href=\"Counselor%20Talbot\"&gt;Counselor Talbot&lt;/a&gt; who was truly &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Prince Valanar&lt;/a&gt;. Atop of Naxxanar, Prince Valanar was speaking with the projection of the Lich King and was about to give him General Arlos and Leryssa. After a fierce battle, Thassarian defeated Valanar and rescued his sister and the general. After this, he said farewell to his sister and promised her that he will return to her once his task is done.\nAfter his victory and rescuing his sister in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Skybreaker\"&gt;The Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt; where he sought to further damage the Scourge. Being a former Scourge minion, he knew many things about the Scourge and sent random soldiers to gather information about the cult, find flesh giant spines, neutralizing plague cauldrons, and kill important Scourge members. His efforts and those of &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; allowed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces to break through , and , each made almost entirely of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;, near indestructible, and manned by massive Scourge constructs, as it was the sole way for any kind of force to invade &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later appeared with Koltira and their brethren of the Ebon Blade in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, arriving in time to battle &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; himself and relieve the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; of their unfavorable predicament. After Tirion destroyed what remained of the Lich King's heart, however, Darion was more in favor of patience and everyone pulled back through a &lt;a href=\"%3ADeath%20Gate\"&gt;:Death Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Thassarian regretted having to let the Lich King live in his weakened state.\nCataclysm.\nThe Alliance and Forsaken were fighting over control of Andorhal and the remaining Scourge presence there. The Alliance, led by Thassarian, took control of the western portion of the town while the Forsaken, led by Koltira Deathweaver, took control of the eastern portion. Over the course of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, Thassarian sent Alliance heroes to deal with the remaining Scourge forces and after defeating their leaders, Thassarian and Koltira entered a truce. Some time afterward, human farmers formed a militia and launched a sneak attack on Koltira's Forsaken forces. With his hand forced, Thassarian resumed the war with the Forsaken. Victory was almost in the Alliance's grasp until the Forsaken started employing the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. With the Val'kyr raising their dead, the Alliance forces were overwhelmed and were forced to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;. Thassarian's minion, &lt;a href=\"Lurid\"&gt;Lurid&lt;/a&gt;, was killed in the Forsaken assault.\nWith the Battle of Andorhal over, Thassarian was said to head off to &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; to hunt &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to find out what happened to Koltira.\nThassarian later reappeared in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to do battle with the forces of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThassarian accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; to raise the new &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; was raised as Thassarian told him that he was called to the battle. When the Deathlord arrived in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; had told them remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; still lingered behind the keep. After the Deathlord took care of the remaining trolls, Galen exclaimed that his kingdom is his alone and will not have it be taken away by anyone. As Nazgrim saw this as treachery, Thassarian had lost his patience with the situation and told the Deathlord to take the &lt;a href=\"Trol%27Kalar%20%28item%29\"&gt;family heirloom&lt;/a&gt; to open the tomb themselves. The Deathlord then raised Galen's father &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; back from the dead, who demanded to know where his son is and what has happened to his kingdom. Thassarian responded that they took his life and that the kingdom lies in ruins for time has not been kind. Even though &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; was no more, he told Thoras that there was still hope to save &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nA personal request to free &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; from his imprisonment in the Undercity was in order, even if it meant displeasing the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Dark Lady&lt;/a&gt; in this dire hour. The &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; was where the third horseman &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Whitemane\"&gt;High Inquisitor Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; would be raised. He said that the Knights of the Ebon Blade would offer her a chance at atonement. The price would be high, but Thassarian had little doubt she would pay it and they would see it through together.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, Thassarian and Nazgrim participated in fighting against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;. Thassarian admitted that he was beginning to have second thoughts about Nazgrim after the orc demanded they stop continuously so he could &lt;a href=\"Strangulate\"&gt;Strangulate&lt;/a&gt; each individual demon invader.\nShadowlands.\nThassarian and Koltira Deathweaver have made their way to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; and are looking at the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. When spoken to, he recalls how he was raised into undeath after defending &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He also contemplates how the Alliance's wars with the Horde seem paltry compared to the horrors beyond the veil, but the citizens of the Alliance only realize it now that the veil has been shattered, lamenting that \"Such is the curse of the living. They know not what truly matters until their time has come.\"\nAbilities.\nPlaguelands: The Scarlet Enclave\nAs a champion follower.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers\"&gt;Class Hall champion&lt;/a&gt;, Thassarian is a Frost Death Knight with the following abilities:\nHe can also be assigned as a &lt;a href=\"bodyguard\"&gt;bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; with the following abilities:\nQuests.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nHe is first encountered in as a level 55 standing next to and .

She is the Harvester of &lt;a href=\"Pride%20%28Revendreth%29\"&gt;Pride&lt;/a&gt;, bearer of the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Medallion of Pride&lt;/a&gt;, which gives her control over the &lt;a href=\"Ceremony%20Ward\"&gt;Ceremony Ward&lt;/a&gt;, thus has authority over the Halls of Atonement and is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; to openly oppose &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, the player initially fights to thwart her rebellion during the &lt;a href=\"Revendreth%20storyline\"&gt;Revendreth storyline&lt;/a&gt;. As the story progresses and Denathrius' treachery comes to light, she becomes one of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;'s most important allies in Revendreth. The Accuser is coldhearted and ruthless, yet unflinchingly loyal to the venthyr's purpose of reforming the wicked. As such, she despises how Denathrius' pride has corrupted his original mission.\nBiography.\nMortal life.\nHer name was once Harriett the Crimson Shade. According to her &lt;a href=\"sinstone\"&gt;sinstone&lt;/a&gt;, Harriett murdered countless innocents and orchestrated the deaths of even more, all for personal profit. She was also apparently misled into murdering her own daughter, &lt;a href=\"Camille\"&gt;Camille&lt;/a&gt;. Despite all the other murders she committed, this act would be the one sin she would end up regretting well into her afterlife. It is unknown when she became the Harvester of Pride, or what happened to the previous one.\nRevendreth storyline.\nWhen the Maw Walker first meets with Sire &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; to request anima to aid in the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, he asks that they help end the rebellion in Revendreth before any deals are made. The adventurer is dispatched to seize the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Atonement\"&gt;Halls of Atonement&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Echelon\"&gt;Echelon&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Chamberlain\"&gt;Lord Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt;. After dispatching the troops and inquisitors protecting her &lt;a href=\"sinstone\"&gt;sinstone&lt;/a&gt;, the trio face off against the Accuser with her sinstone in-hand. Despite reading off her sins, it has no effect as the Accuser feels no remorse for the acts. Eventually, the Lord Chamberlain reads the final sin and uses his amulet to bring an image of the Accuser's mortal daughter Camille to life, shaking the Accuser to her core. This allows him to defeat and capture her.\nThe Accuser is brought in a cage before Denathrius, who denounces her and sentences her to be hunted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Fearstalker\"&gt;The Fearstalker&lt;/a&gt; until humbled. The Accuser is unshaken, stating that Denathrius, once a true lord of fear, is now defying the will of Revendreth. She is then brought to the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Grove of Terror&lt;/a&gt; to await being hunted.\nWhen the Fearstalker and the Maw Walker corner her, the Accuser sends Fearstalker away with a teleportation mirror. Granting the adventurer the power of &lt;a href=\"Door%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Door of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, she shows them the true scope of Denathrius' madness, being the cause of the anima drought and keeping it all stored in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt;. As Denathrius notices the two, he orders his guards after them. Now on the run, the adventurer joins the Accuser and &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt; in the resistance. Luring the Fearstalker and her hopebreakers to the &lt;a href=\"Dredhollow\"&gt;Dredhollow&lt;/a&gt; lodge, she uses a trap to lure a swarm of &lt;a href=\"Devourer\"&gt;Devourer&lt;/a&gt;s to consume the hopebreakers, with the Fearstalker being finished off shortly afterward. The Accuser then claimed Fearstalker's amulet and sends the adventurer to the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt; to seek &lt;a href=\"Theotar\"&gt;Theotar&lt;/a&gt; for clues to the location of the true leader of the rebellion: &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter reclaiming &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;, Theotar, Draven, and Accuser make it their primary base. The adventurer eventually returns from the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; with both the prince and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt; in tow. With their forces assembled, they launch a united assault on Castle Nathria. The rebellion cuts a swath through the Master's venthyr and &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; forces, seizing all the anima they can. As they charge Denathrius, a stoneborn grabs the Accuser and flies off, leaving the prince to face Denathrius on his own. She returns in time to witness Denathrius' plan come to fruition: Sending all the purloined anima into the Maw to empower his true master: &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. The rebellion then falls back to regroup at Sinfall.\nVenthyr Campaign.\nUpon deciding to join the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the Harvesters that remain decide to empower the Maw Walker with their gift, after the Maw Walker takes the Oath of the Harvesters before them, including the Accuser.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; is directed by Prince Renathal to enter the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Atonement%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Halls of Atonement&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the Lord Chamberlain, seizing the Medallion of Pride.\nDuring the siege upon &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt;, the soul of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; is rescued and placed under the direct care of the Accuser as his soul was on the verge of destruction due to burdening him with the sins of others through his sinstone. After instructing him to release his anima to help awaken various &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; loyal to the Prince, the Accuser successfully extracts the sins Denathrius burdened upon his soul. Thanks to the efforts of Kael'thas and the Maw Walker, a conspiracy between &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Tithelord\"&gt;the Tithelord&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Blackbale\"&gt;House Blackbale&lt;/a&gt; was revealed, which the Accuser goes to inform Prince Renathal while the Maw Walker and Kael'thas continue investigating.\nAfter General Draven recovered the Medallion of Dominion, Denathrius whispers to Prince Renathal through it, tempting him to join him again. The Accuser reminds Renathal of the things Denathrius has done, solidifying Renathal's will against Denathrius and convincing him that Revendreth will be ruled by the Court of Harvesters in unison.\nThe Accuser has since regained control of the Ceremony Ward and has resumed pontificating from her pulpit in the Halls of Atonement.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nGreetings, mortal.\nAre you ready?\nThere is much work yet to be done.\nDo you see now what the Lord Chamberlain has done to these souls? It is abhorrent.\nThe souls of Revendreth need absolution... they deserve it.\nWhat do you think, &lt;name&gt;? Is &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; worth saving?\nMaw Walker. I am willing to acquiesce to the request from &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;the Baroness&lt;/a&gt; for Kael'thas to accompany you on this mission.\nHowever, keep an eye on the two of them. I am not convinced she is a good influence and may cause Kael'thas to regress into former practices.\nHe has shown promise lately, but I would feel more comfortable with this if he had another century or two of penance in place. \nDespite my reservations it would appear that Kael'thas and the &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Baroness&lt;/a&gt; did compliment each other well.\nWhere it was due to your involvement or their own initiative is irrelevant to the end result that Kael'thas has been able to let go of more of the burdens his soul clings to.\nHe shows much promise, and power.\nEven here, surrounded by enemies in the darkest depths of the Maw, we cannot forget our charge.\nVenthyr are not called to destroy. We are called to desperately pursue every possible avenue that might avoid destruction.\nThere are souls in the Maw that deserve to be here. I know that because I have ent many here myself.\nBut the Jailer has claimed souls far beyond his right, and we must not rest until every last wrongfully convicted soul is rescued.\nThe calling of Revendreth has never been easy, but it has always been important. I believe you understand this now.\nThe truth must be revealed. Sometimes painfully."}

What a wonderful surprise! Now I can focus on teaching an eager pupil.\nThe important thing to know when trying to pick winter's kiss is that any exposure to heat before it is harvested can cause the flower to wilt.\nTo prevent that from happening, bury your hands in the snow right before you harvest it. By reducing the temperature of your hands before touching the plant, you can usually get a couple extra petals without issue.\nGood luck!"}

Candy is most often encountered at &lt;a href=\"Event%23Seasonal%20Events\"&gt;holiday event&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPresumably, since candy is not one of the food types that are referenced as being able to be eaten by &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s cannot feed candy to their pets. \nLike other kinds of food, not all candy is \"food\" (provides health recovery over time).

Fans of World of Warcraft will undoubtedly feel at home as ECW '05's heroes are based off their respective classes. The object is to crush your opponent's Candy Mages who channel an invulnerable shield around their Candy Vault. Once the Candy Mages are down, destroy their Candy Vault to win! This year's version features updated hero abilities, new items, and faster paced gameplay.\nWinning strategies are heavily reliant on teamwork rather than individual effort. For example, it is extremely important to know when to push down certain lanes in small groups to eliminate strategic targets, such as a farm to decrease your opponent's aeon mob spawning or a tower that is hamstringing your efforts. A word of caution: beware the Extreme items and remember to upgrade your units!&lt;a href=\"http%3A//classic.battle.net/war3/maps/war3xbonusmaps.shtml\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"}

Newly hatched mantid have only two instincts: kill and feed. They turn on one another, devouring the weak and leaving the strongest to mature. Those hatched during a swarm - the swarmborn - are turned loose on their enemies instead. After the transfer of power from one mantid empress to the next, remains of the previous empress are fed to her successor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nerubian%20spiderlord\"&gt;spiderlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorus%27arak\"&gt;Vorus'arak&lt;/a&gt; and his brood escaped the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; through tunnels, but as his great strength flagged he was forced to consume much of his own young.\nBroken draenei.\nDesperate &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; will sometimes resort to cannibalism.

The soldiers considered orc meat to be tastier than &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragons.\n&lt;a href=\"Proto-dragon\"&gt;Proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s are not normally cannibalistic although they taste the blood of their rivals in duels but do not consume the dead. This changed with &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; who devoured other proto-dragons to absorb their life essence and then vomited them back up as the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;, undead proto-dragons who would attack the living. It was noticed that proto-dragons that were bitten by them would develop a hunger that would cause them to act like Galakrond and try to devour their living companions. &lt;a href=\"Coros\"&gt;Coros&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to gain protection from Galakrond had started to emulate him by practicing cannibalism and encouraged his companions to do the same. This didn't work however and they were all devoured by Galakrond.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s are known to occasionally devour mortals; dragon &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt;s in \"\" had the \"Devour\" ability , &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; swallowed her captor &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; whole and alive and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; tried to eat the adventurers who faced her in her lair.\nEttins.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; eat &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; that have been cooked over bonfires.\nGnolls.\nIt is a common tradition that when a &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; dies, the members of his/her clan devour the body. To a gnoll, meat is meat, and they will even go so far as to kill and cannibalize outcasts who return to their territory. They absolutely hate &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; meat, however. \"More bones to gnaw on\" is commonly said by gnolls when they encounter another humanoid race.\nMagnataur.\nThe notoriously long-lived &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; are rumored to engage in cannibalism during times when food is scarce.\nMurlocs.\n&lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; only eat three things: crabs, fish, and people.\nOgres.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres were known to eat orcs and &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; are said to eat humans, elves, and presumably other humanoid races they've had conflict with. They even keep slaves just to eat them later, as seen in many &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mound\"&gt;ogre mound&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen eating humans, Gordunni ogres prefer to devour them alive due to it being \"fresher\". When it is cooked, however, the body is cooked with the blood still inside the carcass. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt; meat is considered horrible-tasting to ogres.\nThe ogres' progenitors, the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, had similar habits before their slaughter. Most of the world's other races were beneath their notice, save when they could serve as food or slaves. Even their relatives, the ogres and orcs, quickly learned to fear the ogron's attention.\nOrcs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s practiced cannibalism, as well as decorating themselves with the remains of their victims. Members of the clan were witnessed eating a human soldier alive during the infiltration of &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; In the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; could recognize dried orc blood by taste and threatened to drink a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;'s bone marrow.\n&lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt; cuisine was notable for its complex spices and unusual ingredients sourced from the island of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, often including sentient creatures such as &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lobstrok\"&gt;lobstrok&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Pale%20orc\"&gt;Pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s are known to eat their victims alive.\nPodlings.\nUsually found in groups, &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s do not seem afraid of taking on prey several times larger than themselves. They are capable of overwhelming and devouring &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and other larger &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSaberon.\n&lt;a href=\"Saberon\"&gt;Saberon&lt;/a&gt; cook and eat other humanoids such as &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSaurok.\n&lt;a href=\"Saurok\"&gt;Saurok&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Skumblade%20tribe\"&gt;Skumblade tribe&lt;/a&gt; consider their enemies to be walking meat. The Skumblade view all outsiders as a threat, but enjoy reaping the rewards of their conflict, as the corpses left behind mean more meat and filth for the scavengers to collect. A dead Skumblade is food for the tribe and filth to keep the enemy away. Flesh and the consumption of flesh denote strength to them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Trapped%20Saurok\"&gt;Trapped Saurok&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt; at the time of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s return can be seen devouring one of their own.\nSirens.\n&lt;a href=\"Siren\"&gt;Siren&lt;/a&gt;s use their enchanting voices and songs to lure &lt;a href=\"sailor\"&gt;sailor&lt;/a&gt;s into shipwrecks to devour them.\nSkardyn.\n&lt;a href=\"Skardyn\"&gt;Skardyn&lt;/a&gt; have a mouth full of sharp, reptilian teeth they use to devour any kind of meat they come across, no matter what state it's in.They consider dwarves from the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; good eating.\nTroggs.\n&lt;a href=\"Trogg\"&gt;Trogg&lt;/a&gt;s are known to engage in cannibalism; they consume stone and anything else they can acquire \u2014 including other troggs.\nTrolls.\nMost trolls seem to practice cannibalism. Several specific &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s have been confirmed as cannibalistic, including the &lt;a href=\"Mossflayer%20tribe\"&gt;Mossflayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; tribes. Furthermore, all of the currently known tribes of &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s practice cannibalism. &lt;a href=\"Sand%20troll\"&gt;Sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s are also frequently cannibalistic, though not always. Even the mysterious &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s are believed to be cannibals for the most part. Yet there are several notable exceptions. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; tribes do not consume troll flesh, although individuals like &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt; might. The &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, too, was cannibalistic until it joined the Horde, at which point the Darkspears officially gave up cannibalism.\nWhen eating humans, trolls prefer to drain the body of blood and stripping the stringy meat from the bone to make into jerky.\nForest trolls.\nIt seems that forest trolls practice cannibalism more for the meal than the magic, seeing it as more of a food source than a method to tame spirits. It should be noted that not all troll tribes engage in this practice. The &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; trolls, for example, describe the cannibalism of their enemies, the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt;, as \"depraved.\"\nBlood trolls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Natha%27vor%20tribe\"&gt;Natha'vor tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s is known for its heavy ritualistic practice of cannibalism, the women eating the males of the tribe and anything they capture believing that the practice grants them greater power. Their three most powerful &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s are called \"corpse mongers\".\nUndead.\nCreatures of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, or the &lt;a href=\"flesh%20titan\"&gt;flesh titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thaddius\"&gt;Thaddius&lt;/a&gt; are compelled by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to eat cadavers. It is meant both as a way for the undead to renew their strength and to spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, as the partially-eaten corpses later rise as undead. &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of the Scourge are also known to have eaten meals consisting primarily of humanoid meat, vermin, and insects. \nFree undead like the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; can still &lt;a href=\"cannibalize\"&gt;cannibalize&lt;/a&gt; other beings, and some do in fact have a hungering for living flesh.\nWendigo.\n&lt;a href=\"Wendigo\"&gt;Wendigo&lt;/a&gt; are cannibalistic.\nWorgen.\n&lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; without morals or those struggling for control have been tempted by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; flesh.\nIn search of his son in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ambrose\"&gt;Ambrose&lt;/a&gt; spoke to a feral worgen &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cultist&lt;/a&gt;, who said he has eaten many young men before. Later at &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;, they were stalked by &lt;a href=\"Shagra\"&gt;Shagra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorfang\"&gt;Gorfang&lt;/a&gt;, who called them meat and food. While Gorfang wanted to share the meat with the pack, Shagra did not, and attacked Karlain and his companions declaring his intent to eat them. Both were killed by Ambrose, who died when the rest of the pack arrived. Later, after Karlain's son &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt; was turned into a worgen, he was found drooling over the corpse of Ambrose.\nAfter the Wolf Cult attacked &lt;a href=\"Stormglen%20Village\"&gt;Stormglen&lt;/a&gt; and killed those that resisted, &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; recognized the scent of blood from his detective work. Where he should have been repulsed by the scene, he was excited. While &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; lead the worgen attack on &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, Halford Ramsey saved a woman and child from being eaten by worgen, but in doing so found himself tempted to eat them himself, and was scared off by gunfire.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Berserker\"&gt;Bloodfang Berserker&lt;/a&gt;s enjoy meat found in piles, and when &lt;a href=\"Packleader%20Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; tells them to dispose of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Baron Ashbury&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse, they begin to salivate heavily.\nIn the RPG.\nBlack dragons.\nMost black dragons follow the instructions of another only if they expect a benefit or they're confident that the other dragon could eat them.\nCentaur.\nCentaur are occasionally cannibalistic.\nMagnataur.\nThe massive &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; are constantly hungry due to their ever increasing size, and when raiding human caravans will eat the humans, horses, and anything they can find that won't break their teeth.\nMurlocs and mur'gul.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mutant%20murloc\"&gt;mutant murloc&lt;/a&gt; is a new breed of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; which has appeared in recent times, originating from an unknown source beneath the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures surpass their brethren in cruelty, hunting humans and others not for sacrifices but for pure joy of torture. Mutant murlocs enjoy blood sport and their victims' agony. Many eat victims over a period of days, careful not to kill them too soon. More prosperous mutant murlocs use healing magic to sustain the entertainment longer. They were said to become increasingly common than their normal counterparts.\nThese creatures were once &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, but were cursed and twisted by the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The mur'gul delight in capturing both &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and murlocs \u2014 torturing and then eating their victims. They infest the sea, clambering aboard vessels and slaying everyone onboard.\nUndead.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and certain other &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; also engage in cannibalism, eating humanoids and undead when they require sustenance.\nForsaken are undead, and thus are unable to heal without magical aid. Studying ghouls and abominations, some Forsaken mimic their ability to devour flesh to restore their own.\nWendigo.\nSavage &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt; have been known to be cannibalistic. It's implied that they eat their own species.\nWorgen.\nWorgen never challenge leadership; the patriarch leads until he is physically incapable of doing so any longer, at which point his younger kin devour him. The worgen see this not as cruelty, but a great honor \u2014 they consume the bodies of their fallen unlike that of their victim's bodies. They believe the flesh and blood of their own kind improve their strength and cunning. \nPure killing beasts, worgen tend to attack any creatures that they encounter, regardless of whether animal, humanoid, Scourge or something even more fearsome. Strangely, however, worgen refuse to feed on the remains of their victims, preferring to shred and tear the corpses and then to return immediately to prowling. Rumors suggest that worgen somehow receive sustenance continually from their native dimension... as well as guidance from a distant force.\nIn the film universe.\nThe was one of the few known orc clans, the other being the , to have rejected joining 's . Due to 's hardships (longer winters, short springs, and summers, a shortage of game to hunt) the Red Walkers struggled to find enough food to survive, so they turned to eating &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and later orcs as well, convinced that flesh was flesh. When led a party north to aid the spirits, the Red Walkers took advantage and struck out against the Frostwolves in order to wound them and use them as a food supply, but they were annihilated when Durotan came back in the midst of the fighting.\nSpeculation.\nDefinition.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", cannibalism appears to be the practice of consuming the flesh of a sapient humanoid species by another sapient humanoid species, whether one of their own or one of another.\nThis is in contrast to the English definition which describes cannibalism as being performed exclusively among members of the same species.\nOther possible cannibalism.\nWhile described as cannibals by some sources, or seemingly meeting the criteria of cannibalism as described regarding the trolls, the status of these races as cannibals is unconfirmed."}

Studying ghouls and abominations, some Forsaken mimic their ability to devour flesh to restore their own. Historically, trolls are cannibals, and have learned to consume flesh to accelerate their own healing. Cannibalizing the corpse of a good or intelligent neutral creature is an evil act. A cannibalized corpse is befouled.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s have learned how to cannibalize through a Cannibalize spell. With the spell, the caster gains some of the traits of a ghoul, especially the creature's bone-cracking jaw and extended tongue. The caster may consume flesh from a corpse to regain health. The spell works only on dead creatures and heals only the caster. The corpse must be mostly intact and must have a true anatomy (e.g., the caster cannot cannibalize oozes). Once a corpse has been consumed, very little flesh remains and the corpse is no longer considered intact. A corpse can thus be the target of the spell only once."}

A barely noticeable humming emanates from the spine. Despite the name, no souls are actually trapped within the book. Instead, the pages are inscribed with mystical images and words that strengthen and toughen the reader's soul - which of course extends to the body as well. Anyone studying the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; diagrams and runes for a full day finds himself suffused with the book's power. Afterward, the material inside the book vanishes, leaving the pages empty. A given individual may benefit for no more than one of these grimoires in his lifetime."}

Some items and abilities that can help you tame this elusive wolf are:\nPatches and hotfixes.\nUntil shortly after &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.2\"&gt;Patch 2.3.2&lt;/a&gt;, Grimtotem Spirit Guides were the only tamable &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20wolf\"&gt;Spirit wolves&lt;/a&gt;. The bizarre appearance of the wolf, in addition to its unusual taming method, had made some people suspicious that the Grimtotem Spirit Guide was not intended to be tamed and would be removed as a potential pet. Although a post from a Blizzard Poster, Issuntril, claimed that Grimtotem Spirit Guides would be left tamable, the ability to tame them was removed in a hotfix as of January 14, 2008.\nThe reason for the Spirit Guide's removal is that Blizzard felt that the \"Undead appearance did not fit with the Hunter class.\" Considering that there are several other mobs that also look Undead, but are still tameable (notably, the Plagued Swine and Diseased Black Bears of the Plaguelands, and the Bears and Wolves in Felwood), the removal of the Spirit Guide is inconsistent with the reason for its removal.\nIt was later returned to the game as Grimtotem Spirit Wolf, an untameable version of the Grimtotem Spirit Guide. As of , hunters can now tame a wolf with the same skin, &lt;a href=\"Karoma\"&gt;Karoma&lt;/a&gt;."}

They stand as an aggressive extreme of the usually pacifistic tauren, wishing to eradicate the \"lesser races\" from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and retake the tauren's long lost ancestral holdings. The Grimtotem tribe fights to eliminate the enemies of the tauren; to the Grimtotem, almost all races are enemies of the tauren. They are known for unprovoked attacks, slaughter and mayhem, in great contrast to the peaceful, spiritual nature of all other tauren clans.\nFrom early childhood, while other tauren their age learn the rites of the Great Hunt and to be in harmony with nature, the Grimtotem are taught how to fight each other. They learn to kill quickly and cleanly with hands, horns, and whatever weapon they can get their hands on. In any given conflict, the odds are with a Grimtotem to emerge victorious. They do not fight honorably; they fight to win.\nThe Grimtotem are currently split into two main camps: those led by the powerful shaman &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, who gained leadership after marrying the previous leader, who had died shortly after in an \"unforeseen climbing accident\"; and those led by &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, who are loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and renounced Magatha after the part she played in &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;'s death. Jevan's Horde Grimtotem are about a quarter of the pre-split Grimtotem population.\nInstead of learning to respect the land and elements, the Grimtotem do nothing but take land, power, and lives. They are skilled and relentless, and believe that no others have a right to be here, even the tauren who disagree with them.\nHistory.\nWhile their matriach lived on &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and the Grimtotem enjoyed all rights of being a tauren, the Grimtotem are in fact the only tauren tribe to have never formally joined the Horde. The noted few Grimtotem to directly work with the Horde include the likes of Magatha and &lt;a href=\"Ravak%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Ravak Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;. Ravak was sent by Magatha herself to study the other races in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s. Meanwhile, Magatha enlisted the aid of Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to deal with the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Grimtotem tauren found in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; are hostile to both the Horde and the Alliance. As a matter of fact the Grimtotem have directly attacked their fellow tauren by striking out against those in &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; and are responsible for attacking a tauren village in Stonetalon. With these hostile actions the Horde forces at &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; and send out Horde adventurers to strike back at the Grimtotem. Horde forces at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt; are also actively hostile to the Grimtotem within the region. \nThe Grimtotem within Dustwallow were revealed to have been responsible for the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Rest%20Inn\"&gt;Shady Rest Inn&lt;/a&gt;. A move which has resulted in the Horde and Alliance to engage them in conflict. The Grimtotems in the marsh were supplied armor by &lt;a href=\"Mosarn\"&gt;Mosarn&lt;/a&gt;.\nShaman.\n&lt;a href=\"Shotoa\"&gt;Shotoa&lt;/a&gt; led the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; where he betrayed them to the Grimtotem tribe who attacked the shaman.\nSplit.\nDispleased with the new Warchief, Cairne challenges &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to an honorable duel to the death. Secretly, Magatha Grimtotem poisons Garrosh's axe, and Cairne falls after only a shallow wound in the duel. The Grimtotems take advantage of Cairne's death and quickly seize control of Thunder Bluff and other major tauren settlements. Narrowly escaping an attempt on his life, with the help of a Grimtotem defector named &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan \"Stormsong\" Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; steps up to become High Chieftain of the tauren and leads an attack against the Grimtotem, retaking Thunder Bluff. Baine gives the surviving Grimtotems a choice: swear loyalty to the Horde and be led by Stormsong as a reformed tribe, or be banished to the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; with Magatha. About a quarter of the Grimtotem agree to swear loyalty to the Horde, the rest leaving with Magatha.\nCataclysm and aftermath.\nThe remaining Grimtotem under Magatha have not fared too well following their banishment. The Horde army led by &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt; burned down &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Aparaje\"&gt;Camp Aparaje&lt;/a&gt;, and all that remains are Horde &lt;a href=\"General%20Salaman\"&gt;generals&lt;/a&gt; patrolling its ruins. In desperation, the Grimtotem strike up an alliance of convenience with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces within &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt;. Magatha herself becomes captured by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult in Thousand Needles.\nYet despite these setbacks, Magatha's followers were able to successfully conquer &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt;, albeit due to &lt;a href=\"Cliffwatcher%20Longhorn\"&gt;treachery&lt;/a&gt; from within. The tauren of Freewind were not the only ones to suffer from the Grimtotem as &lt;a href=\"Orno%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Orno Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; and his forces were successfully able to corrupt the water wells in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. However, these victories would be short-lived. \nNot only would Baine's tauren forces heal the water wells but Orno would die at Baine's hands. Later on both the Horde and the Alliance, due to hostilities being re-opened between them and Magatha's Grimtotem, would begin attacking the Grimtotem based in Thousand Needles. This combined assault would lead to the death of the Thousand Needles Grimtotem leadership, with aid and blessing of their Magatha Grimtotem herself. For her part, Magatha claims to have done this to remove her clan of incompetent leaders.\nWhile the future of Magatha's Grimtotem is uncertain Magatha was able to escape her containment and acquire the &lt;a href=\"Doomstone\"&gt;Doomstone&lt;/a&gt;, a magical device capable of absorbing and amplifying elemental power.\nThe Grimtotem tauren besieged &lt;a href=\"New%20Thalanaar\"&gt;New Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; for several months. Tauren and quilboar had banded together and expelled the Grimtotem from &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gordok%27s%20Elite\"&gt;Gordok's Elite&lt;/a&gt; later encountered and killed a group of the Grimtotems near the Feralas' border and took their boat.\nEver mindful of outside world it was discovered that the Grimtotem of Feralas were planning an attack on the Horde forces in the region, while they were distracted from their victory over &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. However it is unknown if the local leadership or Magatha herself was planning the attack.\nUp to the time before the mists lifted from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, all the Grimtotem who had joined Stormsong to create the Horde's Grimtotem faction, such as &lt;a href=\"Tarakor\"&gt;Tarakor&lt;/a&gt; and his family, have fared much better. They have proven to be as good as their word, and remain loyal to Baine.\nLegion.\nThe Grimtotem of &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; come under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, forcing Magatha to turn to the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; for aid.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;'s report after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren in Mulgore are still facing the Grimtotem tribe who desperately strike at them in Mulgore, going after Thunder Bluff's water. Similarly, the Grimtotem still attack the Horde in Thousand Needles. When &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; were traveling through the area, the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; made sure to keep them out of sight of their scouts, but it wasn't easy. They still seek to reclaim all tauren territory.\nAppearance.\nGrimtotem tauren are easily identifiable by their black fur and distinctive white, red or even blue warpaint.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nWhile the Grimtotem name is generations old, the clan as an organization has existed only for a few years. Magatha Grimtotem and her tribe felt that &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;'s friendship with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s was a bad idea; the tribe felt that Kalimdor belonged to the tauren and that no other race held claim to it. In recent years, the Grimtotems have conducted raid after raid on &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, and orc settlements. Some dark tales even hint that the Grimtotems kill tauren who live in non-tauren settlements, considering them as traitors. No one seems to know why the Grimtotems feel this way, though most believe the sentiment either originated from Magatha Grimtotem or her father.\nThe Grimtotem tribe operates mainly in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, though some also live in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Two main settlements of Grimtotems exist: &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20Village\"&gt;Grimtotem Village&lt;/a&gt; in the Stonetalon Mountains, and &lt;a href=\"Darkcloud%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Darkcloud Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; in Thousand Needles. Magatha Grimtotem, leader of the clan, once made her home on &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rise\"&gt;Elder Rise&lt;/a&gt; in Thunder Bluff. Several hundred Grimtotems used to live in Thunder Bluff as well, to be close to the Elder Crone, but their influence was limited. Today, Magatha Grimtotem continues to hold power and influence over the tribe.\nMembership.\nTauren disillusioned with Cairne Bloodhoof's message of peace and harmony often seek to join the Grimtotems. Those tauren who do choose to side with the Grimtotems are mostly older tauren who are used to peace and solitude and do not appreciate the new interlopers. Warriors and hunters seem the most likely to join \u2014 not many shaman favor the Grimtotem philosophy, though there are a few who subscribe to Magatha's \u201cthe spirits are angry\u201d philosophy. These tauren are convinced that the land is sick and requires \u201cpurging.\u201d \nThe Grimtotem tribe does not have an organized structure or a complex hierarchy. Their numbers are just over a thousand, scattered evenly between the major Grimtotem settlements. The chief of each settlement reports directly to Magatha, and she uses her magic to keep in touch with them. Their information might influence her, but the Elder Crone makes all the decisions herself.\nAllying with the Grimtotems is not an easy task. Individuals cannot just walk up and ask to join; the Grimtotems are always suspicious of potential spies. Traditionally, newcomers must first bring an offering. Up in the Stonetalon Mountains, the head of a goblin is customary to prove a new recruit is serious about aiding the Grimtotem cause. Usually the chief sends a tauren who wants to join on a series of increasingly dangerous raids against centaur or goblin encampments. If the recruit survives and does a good job of killing, he's in, though the leaders watch him carefully for the first little bit.\nNew members have to keep killing to stay in, too. A Grimtotem who loses his taste for carnage is killed by his tribe mates rather than letting him leave. A Grimtotem who balks at killing a \"traitor\" tauren may have his war party turn on him and tear him apart. Grimtotems allow only tauren to join. If a non-tauren tried to join they'd probably laugh at him before they killed him. The only exception to this rule is the Forsaken.\nForsaken allies.\nThe Grimtotem have allowed Forsaken into their clan, but even then their involvement is rare. Several Forsaken reputedly belong to the Grimtotem organization. These Forsaken are special consultants who aid the Grimtotems in brewing virulent toxins with which to fight the intruders on their land. Forsaken and the Grimtotems may have a lot in common, and both seem to hate everybody.\nGrimtotem relations.\nThe tauren seem almost embarrassed by the Grimtotem tribe's actions, and they are upset with their kin. The Grimtotems reject the peaceful spiritual teachings of tauren shaman and cause pain to the Earth Mother. They are worried that it could further strain the relations between the Horde and the Alliance, and all it would take to make all sorts of trouble would be for the Grimtotems to slaughter a pack of humans. The tauren aren't able to just walk in and wipe out the Grimtotems, though; they're not into wholesale slaughter, and not all the stories about the Grimtotems are true.\nGrimtotem class titles.\nOrdinary Grimtotem warriors have different titles depending on who you ask. Other Horde members, like the orcs, use the term \"raiders\" or \"bandits.\" They don't necessarily understand the cause the Grimtotems fight for; to the Horde, the Grimtotems seem to be an undisciplined, bloodthirsty mob, which isn't too far from the truth. Individuals outside the Horde who have dealings with the Grimtotems use the term \"brute\" or \"mercenary\" to identify Grimtotem tauren. Most of these individuals have never heard the name Grimtotem; they don't use clan names at all. Among themselves, Grimtotems call their fighters \"warriors\" or \"hunters\" without any extra distinction.\nSome enemy Grimtotem mobs are &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s and bandits (possessing the ability to stealth like a rogue). \nThis shows the different philosophies of the various groups in relation to Grimtotem members.\nThe male version of the title \"Elder Crone\" is \"Elder Sakem\".\nSpeculation.\nConnection to the undead races?\nMany \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" players have speculated over the relationship between the Grimtotem Tribe and the undead. Some believe that there may be a shady connection between the Grimtotems and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. This is because the Scourge is more interested in dismantling the Horde than the Forsaken are. Additionally, Darkcloud Pinnacle is very close to the Scourge-allied areas of &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;. However, evidence suggests that it is actually the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; with whom the Grimtotems are conversing. \nBelow are some documents and conversations that can be found in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" related to this subject.\nCylla.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Direhorn%20Post\"&gt;Direhorn Post&lt;/a&gt; there is &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Cylla\"&gt;Apothecary Cylla&lt;/a&gt; with her direct &lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Letter%20%28Dustwallow%20Marsh%29\"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrimtotem Spying.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Cliffwatcher%20Longhorn\"&gt;Cliffwatcher Longhorn&lt;/a&gt; gives a quest called &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20Spying\"&gt;Grimtotem Spying&lt;/a&gt; to Horde players. He says:\n\"The Grimtotem Clan is up to something secretive. Three agents of unknown origin were seen visiting the Grimtotem over the recent weeks. We discovered that separate chests in Darkcloud Pinnacle hold these guarded messages.\"\nThe following three &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Note\"&gt;secret notes&lt;/a&gt; can be found in Darkcloud Pinnacle. Note that each note is addressed to \"&lt;a href=\"Agasham\"&gt;Agasham&lt;/a&gt;\", an individual not currently present in any \"World of Warcraft\" database. However, this name is an anagram of \"Magasha,\" which is suspiciously close to \"Magatha,\" the leader of the Grimtotem.\nHighborne tablet.\nAnother example is the quest &lt;a href=\"Delivery%20to%20Magatha\"&gt;Delivery to Magatha&lt;/a&gt; that requires the player to deliver the &lt;a href=\"Tablet%20of%20Beth%27Amara\"&gt;tablet&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; wizard to &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;. The quest description states:\n\"The first tablet goes to a tauren female... one called Magatha. She is among the elders in Thunder Bluff, and is one of the proponents of the alliance between the tauren and the Forsaken. She, more than anyone among the elders, feels the tauren and their ways can help the Forsaken find a path back to being human. Bring her the Tablet of Beth'Amara. The tablet may be the link she needs in finding a way to help the Forsaken... or so she claims...\"\nMagatha is also involved in a Horde quest chain to stop the encroachment of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The player is asked to consult with Magatha the elder crone. She says: \"...I fear that to heal the land, we must first remove the disease upon it. Is it not fortunate, then, that the Forsaken are allied with us? They know much of disease. I believe they can aid us, and by doing so they will strengthen the trust between our people.\" This eventually leads to the evil Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Lydon\"&gt;Apothecary Lydon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, who is experimenting with poisons and new forms of the Scourge. His solution is to release a toxic fog that will supposedly \"bleed the violence from the Venture Company, rendering them weak and docile.\" \nArikara.\nAnother quest line that involves Magatha is the &lt;a href=\"Arikara\"&gt;Arikara&lt;/a&gt; quest chain starting in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. The quest line starts with the player investigating an egg protected by the native wind serpents as though it were their own. The egg is in fact that of &lt;a href=\"Arikara\"&gt;Arikara&lt;/a&gt;, a deadly creature of vengeance holding some significance in tauren lore. The player is sent to consult Magatha as to how to deal with the menace, who warns that Arikara may be stalking &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. After Arikara is defeated, the tauren of &lt;a href=\"Whitereach%20Post\"&gt;Whitereach Post&lt;/a&gt; are surprised to hear this prediction, but accept it, respecting Magatha's position as one of the most powerful tauren shamans.\nMagatha certainly has a connection to wind serpents; in the aforementioned &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; quest chain, she sends a wind serpent &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Messenger\"&gt;messenger&lt;/a&gt; ahead to inform her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; allies of her proposition. That a massive, vengeful wind serpent should emerge and appear to have Cairne as its target seems entirely too coincidental.\nAn alternative interpretation is that Magatha may be using the player to deal with a potential threat to herself before it grows too powerful. In her own words, Arikara is \"a deadly creature born only to seek vengeance against those who have committed heinous acts.\" Perhaps Magatha is the intended target..."}

He is so named because he lost his left eye. Leading his clan in both the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second Wars&lt;/a&gt;, Kilrogg was one of the older and more cunning &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; chieftains. During the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, he was killed in a duel with &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLords of War.\nTired of watching his clan slowly walking towards extinction because of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, Kilrogg went to his father and confronted him about the situation. His father then suggested that he would go through the clan's ancient, sacrificial ritual just as he did. Kilrogg accepted, sacrificing his left eye and receiving a vision of the future. He saw his clan becoming superior again and his own death at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; formed by the the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He then proceeded to kill his father and take over the clan.\nRise of the Horde.\nKilrogg was present at the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg%20celebration\"&gt;Kosh'harg celebration&lt;/a&gt; in Nagrand. Later, when &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; promised the orc chieftains unlimited strength and power, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; were among the first to drink the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; with Kilrogg and the other chieftains, save &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, following.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; began to attack Draenor's other races. Kilrogg and his forces slaughtered the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt; and burned down its forests.\nFirst War.\nAs an older chieftain, Kilrogg Deadeye had become more unwilling to throw lives away in combat. In orcish politics older orcs become more pragmatic, which is often mistaken for cowardice by the younger generation. Prior to the sacking of Stormwind, Kilrogg had killed three of his sons and two grandsons already who thought they could rule the clan better.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Kilrogg and the Bleeding Hollow led a few raiding parties into the western jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, as the region reminded them of their ancestral home and they had aims of claiming it for themselves. However, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s who dwelled in the jungles united to fight back against this new threat and began a guerrilla campaign against the orcs. The fighting between the two groups was unspeakably vicious. While the Bleeding Hollow seemed to outnumber the Gurubashi in every skirmish, they were still at a severe disadvantage against the trolls' knowledge of the region. The Gurubashi were willing to give up vast swathes of jungle to draw the orcs deeper into their territory, only to then launch bloody ambushes from all directions, resulting in horrific losses for the Bleeding Hollow. When Blackhand learned how many orcs were dying in Stranglethorn for no apparent gain, he ordered the Bleeding Hollow to retreat and join the fight against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The Horde would deal with the trolls later.\nLater still, Blackhand ordered Kilrogg and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clan to lead an assault against &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself. After the Horde bombarded the city's walls with siege engines through the night, Kilrogg and Cho'gall launched their attack at dawn. Orcs charged the battlements while warlocks engulfed Stormwind's soldiers in fel fire, and it seemed like the city would fall by midday. However, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; led a charge of &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and launched an attack on the orcs' rear lines, forcing the Bleeding Hollow and Twilight's Hammer to break off their aggression and try to push back the knights. When Stormwind's gates opened and soldiers poured out of the city, the orcs were forced to flee from the two-pronged assault. It was the biggest disaster the Horde had ever suffered, and Blackhand only restrained himself from executing Kilrogg and Cho'gall because he suspected their clan members would revolt.\nSecond War.\nKilrogg fought under Blackhand, and then later under &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, his clan was stationed throughout &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, where it controlled the Horde's vital mining and oil refining operations. When Orgrim Doomhammer was forced to withdraw back into Khaz Modan, after sending a large part of the Horde away to kill the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and regain the lost honor of the orcs, Deadeye was one of the few that agreed with his decision. He also revealed that the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; continued to be a problem as he had been trying to reach them for months during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Siege of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Doomhammer told him to stay here and slow the enemies down. At the end of the war with the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and the defeat of the orcs; the aging Kilrogg refused to surrender, even after Doomhammer was captured. Kilrogg escaped and managed to avoid capture by the Alliance forces.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nKilrogg and his remaining Bleeding Hollow orcs managed to evade the Alliance for two years. He, like most of the remaining orc leaders, was summoned to the site of the Dark Portal to discover that &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; had reopened the portal, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his Warsongs already being there and that the Horde had united under &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership. Kilrogg informed Teron about the status of orcs on Azeroth and returned home. After returning to Ner'zhul in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the old shaman decided to keep the wise tactician and his orcs with himself acting as his bodyguards. When Ner'zhul was ready to move, Kilrogg insisted to give Hellscream new orders, but Ner'zhul disagreed.\nOn the way from Hellfire Citadel to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; to begin the ritual, Ner'zhul \u2014 accompanied by Kilrogg and Teron Gorefiend \u2014 made a stop in the ruined draenei necropolis of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, a prospect that frightened the usually-fearless chieftain, believing that it would doom them if they went there. However, he eventually gave in, accepting that it was necessary to rest there for a time on their way to &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. It was there, in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Shadow Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 slowing the Alliance forces enough for Ner'zhul to make his escape \u2014 that Kilrogg met his end. In a duel with Alliance force commander &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; (honorable, to the latter's surprise), the human threw his blade at Kilrogg's throat, taking advantage of the chieftain's half-blindness. Kilrogg's throat was slashed open, but he managed to declare that by his blood the Horde would live and that he was returning to his ancestors. His eye glazed over, and he toppled sideways landing heavily on the floor.\nKilrogg's tenacity lives on with his son, the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetconned and not released content.\nAfter the War.\nWhen Ner'zhul used the items to open more portals, Grom Hellscream and Kilrogg Deadeye realized Ner'zhul's mad plans would doom their entire race. They abandoned Ner'zhul and rallied as many orcs as they could find, driving them through the Dark Portal to the questionable safety of Azeroth just before Draenor was destroyed. Their clans passed through just before Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; closed it completely. Hellscream and Deadeye hacked their way through the human ranks in a desperate bid for freedom, the Dark Portal exploding behind them. For them, and the remaining orcs on Azeroth, there would be no going back. Though Grom Hellscream and his Warsong clan managed to evade capture, Deadeye and his Bleeding Hollow clan were rounded up and placed in the internment camps in Lordaeron.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Kilrogg Deadeye was still the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;.

With his people nearly decimated by the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, Kilrogg refused to wait for defeat. He sought the hidden chamber for which his clan was named and carried out a grim ceremony. It granted Kilrogg a vision of his own death far in the future, so he knew he would survive the day. Emboldened, he seized control of the clan and led the Bleeding Hollow to crush the arakkoa, then to victory in many battles after. In the years that followed, he brutally silenced his challengers, even those who were kin, and anticipated the destiny he saw for himself.\nA member of the newly forged &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Bleeding Hollow clan is composed of some of the most savage orcs on Draenor.

With this knowledge, he led his clan fearlessly on countless campaigns, marching toward the glorious end he desires. Now, with demon blood coursing through his veins, Kilrogg awaits you in Hellfire Citadel, awaiting the moment of his death, or yours.\"\nDesigner notes.\n\"Ever since the Lords of War shorts highlighted the gory ritual that lies at the heart of the Bleeding Hollow clan\u2019s traditions, we knew that visions of death would have to feature prominently in the encounter. It\u2019s unclear whether these visions are immutable, or whether knowing one\u2019s destiny gives one the power to alter it...\"\nOverview.\nKilrogg's Visions of Death transports players to the moment of their doom. The more demons a player kills during this phase, the greater stacks of Undying Resolve they receive. Failure to send anyone to this phase results in heavy raid damage. As the fight progresses, Kilrogg calls for his clansmen to drink the fel blood within the chamber. If these Salivating Bloodthirsters reach the blood, they transform into Hulking Terrors.\nStrategy.\nKilrogg Deadeye requires 2 tanks: one for the boss and one for the Hulking Terror adds. Save &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; for the end of the first set of visions so the empowered players can benefit. Position on the front of the altar in front of Ariok. This is close enough for melee dps to quickly switch to the adds that spawn on the altar and far away enough for ranged dps to kill the adds that approach the alter/Kilrogg. Assign 6 players as the 2 \"Vision teams\" who will go into the Visions of Death. \nThe main mechanic of this fight is Visions of Death. Kilrogg will channel a spell facing his left, causing 3 magic circles to spawn in that direction. One player must stand in each of the three circles. If any one of them is not occupied by the time Kilrogg finishes casting, the spell will fail, no one will get the buff and the raid takes fire damage. Send two DPS and one healer into the visions. Once inside, they will enter a vision of either &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s throne room or the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. The two dps must kill the waves of incoming demons while the healer keeps both them and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; alive. The imps are weak and die quickly, the Hellblaze Fiends leave felfire on the ground which must be avoided, and the Hellblaze Mistress fires a cone of flame in front of her. With each demon killed, the players will gain a stack of Undying Resolve (dps) or Undying Salvation (healers). This buff is absolutely necessary for beating Kilrogg before his stacks of Death Throes becomes too high and wipes the raid. Once the players reach 20 stacks, or they die, Khadgar sends all three back to the fight with Kilrogg, with the DPS now having a massive boost in damage and the healer's Undying Salvation serving to purify the tanks of the fel corruption that the Hulking Terrors put on them. The healer should stand close to the tanks until the corruption is completely gone and then move back with the rest of the ranged and healers.\nKilrogg will call adds called Salivating Bloodthirsters that will move toward the altar at the front of the room, becoming Hulking Terrors when they reach it. One will immediately drop down on the altar a few seconds after Kilrogg calls out \u201cCome brothers, seize your destiny!\u201d while several others will spawn at the sides and back of the room. Melee DPS should focus on the hulk that spawns immediately, while ranged DPS focus on the ones coming forward. Use any slowing effects you can keep them from the altar. Having 2 hulks on the add-tank at once will require cooldowns to survive, three will likely lead to a wipe. The hulks themselves have attacks that will cause Fel Corruption on the add-tank that needs to be dispelled by the vision-healer standing next to him/her. The add will use Savage Strikes which hits in a cone in front of it, so point it away from the melee dps at all times. Rending Howl should be interrupted, but the hulk casts faster the more times it is interrupted, so bring it down as soon as possible. \nFor ranged and healers, Kilrogg will also be throwing Heartseeker daggers which will go through and damage whoever is between Kilrogg and the target. When the dagger hits, it will spawn a blood globule one the ground where the player is standing that will start inching toward Kilrogg. Kill it, as if it touches the boss, it will cause raid-wide damage. The targeted player should move to the back of the room so the ranged DPS will have as much time as possible to kill the blood globule. \n&lt;a href=\"A%20Race%20Against%20Slime\"&gt;A Race Against Slime&lt;/a&gt;\nThis achievement is easier than others in Hellfire Citadel. If the raid is sufficiently geared, has vision teams that know what they are doing, and none of the DPS die to Death Throes, the raid should get this achievement by simply doing the fight normally."}
