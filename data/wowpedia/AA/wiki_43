After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s finest warriors followed the prime naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; across the cosmos in an eternal war to bring about the Legion's end. Since then, other survivors of the Burning Crusade have joined the ranks of the Lightforged.\nAfter finally achieving &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;victory on Argus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; believed that it was time to take up arms alongside their brothers and sisters of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and pledged their forces to &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and rescued the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; from the fury of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, they promised that the &lt;a href=\"Exiled%20Ones\"&gt;Exiled Ones&lt;/a&gt; would one day be part of a grand force. When the \"Genedar\" split into two different ships, the \"Genedar\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\", the draenei's finest warriors followed Xe'ra aboard the \"Xenedar\", becoming &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt; to fight the demonic Legion. This Army of the Light battled the demonic army for thousands of years.\nFor millennia, the Army of the Light waged battles, skirmishes, and sabotage against the Burning Legion. They all knew they might not survive their final assault on Argus. They engaged in tactical guerilla strikes on the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; using their warship. While outnumbered, they continued to fight with cunning, striking at points of opportunity quickly and moving on.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; joined the Golden Army, becoming infused with the Light, to fight against the Legion as its High Commander.\nAfter the crash of the \"Genedar\" on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei led by Velen tried to study &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; and its kin, analyze them, and hopefully learn enough to communicate with the other naaru and draenei beyond Draenor. They awaited the day when the Army would emerge for more than twenty millennia. One of the Prophet Velen's many visions was of a grand coalition of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 and even the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei themselves are foretold as the backbone of this mighty army, with many naaru joining the fray against the darkness, along with an innumerable amount of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and naaru. The leader of this great coalition, clad in &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-imbued armor with a matching blade, is a human of unclear identity. The vision met its end after a great and terrible shadow cast its darkness over the defenders of the Light, though the army only charged to meet it in battle.\nRight before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and Velen reached out to the naaru independently, both seeking aid against the dark forces amassing on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The Army of the Light heard their pleas but the Army's battles with the Legion were costly and ceaseless, so they could not spare soldiers to protect Outland. Instead &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to help the people of Outland and arrived with &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecent events.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, an \"elder naaru\" (Xe'ra) appeared to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and showed him a vision of himself transformed into a champion of the Light, leading \"the Legions of Light\" against the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; said the Army was losing the war against the Legion and as such sent &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the core of Xe'ra, as a last resort to Azeroth for it to be handed to Prophet Velen. Xe'ra sought the \"child of Light and Shadow\", Illidan Stormrage, to bring the battle to an end. Lothraxion was sent by High Exarch &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to protect it.\nShortly after, the Army of the Light's flagship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\", crashed on Argus's surface and the resident &lt;a href=\"Krokul\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; saved Turalyon's life. More members of the Army of the Light are encountered at the crash site of the \"Xenedar\" and they proceed to aid Azeroth's forces on Argus.\nAfter the Legion's defeat during the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the Army of the Light traveled to Azeroth aboard their new home and base of operations, the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", itself orbiting around Azeroth, and reunited with the other draenei. Foreseeing the upcoming war between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightforged and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Fareeya\"&gt;Captain Fareeya&lt;/a&gt; decided to stand alongside their brothers and sisters of the Alliance, even accepting new recruits from their \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" kin, such as &lt;a href=\"T%27paartos\"&gt;T'paartos&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; and Turalyon thus pledged to defend the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and seek to spread the Light's justice across the land.\nThey subsequently participated in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, sending the &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; along with some of their technology to protect civilians in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt; later willingly sacrificed his life to help the Alliance win the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Siege of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the latter arguing that if the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was not stopped, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would eventually suffer the same fate as &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\n&lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20ship\"&gt;Dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCurrent\nFormer\nReputation.\nFaction description.\n\"After the fall of Argus, the draenei's finest warriors followed the prime naaru Xe'ra across the cosmos in an eternal war to bring about the Legion's end.

The main thing to be aware of is to remain close, and to keep Damage over Time effects on the lizard-like foe.\nThe most important abilities to keep note of are Vanish and Smoked Blade, the Saurok - much like a rogue - will suddenly disappear, and a player will have around four seconds to find the saurok before it closes in on the target. Often using AoEs or applying Damage over Time effects on the saurok will prematurely force it out of its invisibility. Otherwise - not much will save you from the sudden grievous strike of 55% of a targets maximum HP.\nVicious Rend turns the saurok into a timed fight - while kiting the saurok is indeed possible if one does not stray far enough for it to grapple its foe, it also can leave the saurok open for vanishing and ambushing you. Viscious Rend is simply a soft enrage - taking too long will allow the bleeding to worsen as the saurok continues to apply Vicious Rend every ten seconds or so - and while initially able to be healed or mitigated, will become more harsh over time.\nGrappling Hook is not as strong as a Pandarens Chi Burst, but 450% weapon damage is nothing to scoff at - stray too far from the Saurok, and he will pull you right back in to continue the fight. Generally, you want to remain up close and personal with these reptilian bandits so as to prevent them from Vanishing.\nIn short:"}

Arom was the one to defeat &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, the Drust king at &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Osigr\"&gt;Gol Osigr&lt;/a&gt;. For leading the victory, he became the first Lord of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, and as a Lord, the founder of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;. He befriended &lt;a href=\"Athair\"&gt;Athair&lt;/a&gt;, a white &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Drust war began when humans started to settle on the land of Drustvar. Little did they know that the land was already occupied by humanoid creatures known as Drust. Despite the human's intention of living in harmony with them, the Drust would not have it. The large humanoids attacked the human settlements and drove them away. It wasn't until the Order of Embers was born that counter-attacks began.\nIt is at this time that Colonel Arom Waycrest is first mentioned in history. He and his second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Lilian%20Nottley\"&gt;Captain Lilian Nottley&lt;/a&gt;, led the &lt;a href=\"Drustvar%20Militia\"&gt;Drustvar Militia&lt;/a&gt; in the war against the Drust.\nArom would lead the final assault against the Drust. With his men pushing back against the &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;Drust construct&lt;/a&gt;s, they would make the final push on &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Osigr\"&gt;Gol Osigr&lt;/a&gt;. While Captain Nottley led a defensive line, Arom led the direct assault on their leader, &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;. With one stab, the Drust king's armies faltered at once; he was presumed to have been killed by the blow. From this victory, Arom was made a Lord and became the founder of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after the war, Lord Arom was apparently on a hunting trip alone when he met the massive white stag, &lt;a href=\"Athair\"&gt;Athair&lt;/a&gt;. He found the stag injured after it had killed several Drust while defending himself. Despite his people being in need of food, Arom instead chose to heal him, thinking that someone who can fight the Drust is someone worthwhile to have roaming his lands. Once healed, the stag returned to the woods and Arom made camp for the night. That very night, he was attacked by ten Drust. Despite his best effort, Arom knew he couldn't win and resolved instead to take down as many as possible. All of a sudden, the stag he saved rushed in and helped Arom take care of his attackers. Arom thanked the stag and was utterly shocked when the stag responded with words, saying that he was simply repaying Arom's kindness. Introducing himself, Athair vowed to protect Drustvar's people should they come to him, for as long as he exists. With that, the stag disappeared in the woods again and since then, any valiant and true soul who wanders the woods may find shelter with the stag.\nArom would eventually pass on, but his descendants would live in fame and power for the next two thousand years to come. A statue of Arom can be found standing vigil in the town of &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, down the mountain from Gol Osigr. North of it is the mountain pass of &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Arom's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, also named after him. The statue at Arom's Crossing is accompanied by a plaque simply reading:"}

He is a noted explorer of the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. During his journey in the &lt;a href=\"Southland\"&gt;Southland&lt;/a&gt;, he traveled through the well-known territory of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Zul%27Kunda\"&gt;Zul'kunda&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Reef\"&gt;Vile Reef&lt;/a&gt;. His journey was in search of &lt;a href=\"Azotha\"&gt;Azotha&lt;/a&gt; ruins and evidence of the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s. His journey lasted for the better part of a month, and the expedition included three mercenary swordsmen, a pair of freeborn archers, one &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei\"&gt;Quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, and six &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; camp adjuncts.\nHe traveled around locations four days' east of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; in early summer. On the first five days of his expedition,he established a base camp, and made contact with nearby villages and gathered information, as well as local myths and legends about the area. Over the course of the next few days, he made his first journey into the hills in search of the Azotha ruins; where he discovered the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Hills\"&gt;Savage Hills&lt;/a&gt;. However, during the trip he got into a skirmish with local &lt;a href=\"jungle%20trolls\"&gt;jungle trolls&lt;/a&gt;, and had to return back to his base camp. Due to the battle, he planned a new course of action; he decided to scout the troll encampment with &lt;a href=\"Tohas%20Steelarm\"&gt;Tohas Steelarm&lt;/a&gt; (likely one of the mercenaries) to gather more information which apparently proved to be uneventful.\nOn next two days of the trip, the trolls enacted a midnight raid on his base camp, and kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Quellan%20Maisara\"&gt;Quellan Maisara&lt;/a&gt; (the high elven sorcerer) and he received news from a local village (likely including location of Quellan and information about a brewing war among the tribes), and as expected a few days later the war began. Kodo's expedition tracked some of the trolls through the jungle to the beginning of a dark ritual. Two of Kodosbreath's goblin adjunts, the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Brothers\"&gt;Goblin Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, made a heroic sacrifice to stop the ritual, however the witch doctor escaped with Quellen; this led to the discovery of a temple.\nOn the nineteenth day of the journey Aron entered the temple and confronted the witch doctor, who offered him a challenge. Kodo accepted the challenge and was given an ancient prescription. Kodo left the temple and made the preparations for the prescription. After following the prescription, Aron was visited by two ghosts and received visions of the Titans.\nHe returned to the temple where he found ancient evidence of an ancient civilization (lost mosaics). However he was given a warning by Quellen just before he was attacked by the witch doctor, however Aron did survive the duel with the witch doctor. It took several days to go over the evidence found in the temple. While studying his findings he learned of the aftermath of his ordeals, and the Azotha were revealed to him (it is unclear where he discovered a lost tribe still living in Stranglethorn Vale or if he simply found evidence of the Azotha previously living there). During this time there was an unexpected departure by member of his expedition, as well as a wedding. Undeterred, he continued to sift the debris of the mosaics.\nOn the twenty-fourth day of his trip, the tribes gathered together and the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Hills%20Treaty\"&gt;Savage Hills Treaty&lt;/a&gt; was signed. Aron struck camp twenty-seven days after he had first set it up; he finally knew it was time to return home.\nAron's reports.\nHe sent back several reports of his journey to Ironforge which included, \"Update on Events in Zul'kunda and the Vile Reef (File Index #3SV-42K47)\" (the main report of his travels), Report to the &lt;a href=\"Excursion%20Council\"&gt;Guild Council&lt;/a&gt; on A Journey to the Southland in Search of Azotha Ruins and Evidence of the Titans (report on his findings about Azotha and Titans), and expense report form 5674.\nRelatives.\nHey may be related to &lt;a href=\"Nuji%20Kodosbreath\"&gt;Nuji Kodosbreath&lt;/a&gt;."}

Over time, he harnessed the weapon's energies and used them to research new types of warding spells.\nIn pursuit of his studies, Arrexis gathered his apprentice magi and from &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Kirin%20Tor%20Camp\"&gt;his camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Arrexis was performing research on &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and the way it bends reality. He found a way to stop the warping from happening within special wards, but while bringing the wards up reality was weakened. &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and secretly killing members of the Council of Tirisfal in \"accidents\", came to the camp and encouraged Arrexis to try his ritual on demonic realms. Arrexis caught the attention of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balaadur\"&gt;Balaadur&lt;/a&gt;. The catastrophe ended with Arrexis and all of his apprentices dead, Balaadur taking Ebonchill, &lt;a href=\"Daio%20the%20Decrepit\"&gt;Daio&lt;/a&gt; exiled from the Kirin Tor for his part in it, and all records of Arrexis destroyed and stripped from Kirin Tor records so that no one would repeat his mistakes. Even &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Winterstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining founding member of the Order who was absent for much of these events, was not told of what had happened to the missing Arrexis."}

These large spiders are quite common in Ashenvale. There are several types, each 3 feet in diameter with dark amber or greenish coloration. In some places, several swarms weave masses of webs throughout the forest, catching birds and deer. While forest spiders will avoid mobile humans, they will attack any helpless animals as prey. Forest spiders are accompanied a variety of scavengers and carnivorous plants. Corpses are covered in silk to disguise them and keep the area clean. Unlike their tiny brethren, forest spiders are social creatures. They hunt together, dropping down on large prey. Several poisonous bites will usually fell even large animals. Prey are wrapped in silk, another effort often done as a group, keep digested flesh from leaking into the soil before the spiders can feed."}

The forest trolls as a whole are also referred to as &lt;a href=\"Amani\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, after the ancient &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; of the same name, but that name can also refer to the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt; in particular.\nLong before the rise and fall of the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had built an enormous troll empire. After &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;centuries of war&lt;/a&gt; and hate, an alliance of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s finally dealt a crushing blow to the Amani when they defeated a great troll army at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The empire did not recover from the defeat, and the trolls never rose as one nation again. Yet some forest trolls survived, each generation nurturing their hatred of the elves in the dark forests of the north for thousands of years. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani trolls were briefly allied to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the forest troll &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; was one of the greatest heroes the trolls have ever known.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nThe Amani were one the troll tribes that arose to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; for territory and power.\nTogether with the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; jungle trolls, they &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;fought&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, eventually disrupting the insectoid empire. The Amani tribe had set out to the northeast to hunt down and destroy the aqir leader the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;. Where they had slain Kith'ix they built the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and with it, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; was born.\nWith the arising of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani Empire was all but dismantled with the magics the night elves wielded. With the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;arrival&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; the forest trolls retreated into the wilderness and took no direct part in the conflict.\nThe Troll Wars.\nIn the aftermath of Kalimdor's shattering, the forest trolls began to once again expand their lands across the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, naming their new territory &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. However, the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; lead to a burning rivalry that would last millennia. The high elves founded their new Kingdom on an ancient troll city that was sacred. This led to the forest trolls attacking the fledgling elven kingdom for the desecration of their city. The stubborn elves, by using magic, drove the trolls back and for a time no conflict arose between the elves and trolls.\nAfter two thousand years had passed the Amani warbands struck out of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; determined to destroy the high elves once and for all. They scored victory after victory against the elves, pushing them slowly back. The desperate elves forged an alliance with the human empire of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, teaching &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;one hundred humans&lt;/a&gt; the way of magic. The combined human and elf armies met the trolls at the base of the Alterac Mountains. For days the trolls assaulted the allies' lines until at the right moment when the human and elven &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; unleashed a fury of fiery magic onto the forest troll army. The searing flames stopped the troll's wounds from regenerating and then the humans charged, slaughtering most of the troll army and driving them back into &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. The trolls suffered a defeat from which they would never recover.\nThe Second War.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to invite the forest trolls to join the horde. The trolls declined, having little interest in anything beyond their own forests. However at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; orc forces rescued the trolls' leader, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, from Alliance soldiers and in gratitude Zul'jin pledged the forest trolls to the now Warchief Doomhammer. Zul'jin had done what no other forest troll had done since the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;: he united the numerous tribes of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; under one banner and joined the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He hoped that by joining the orcish invaders they could attempt to retake Quel'Thalas from their sworn enemies, the elves. Besides the elves, the warriors of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; were also then considered traditional enemies of the forest trolls.\nThe forest trolls contributed their &lt;a href=\"axethrower\"&gt;axethrower&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20berserker\"&gt;berserkers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer ships&lt;/a&gt; to the forces of the Horde fighting with the Orcs throughout the Hinterlands and Quel'Thalas, slaughtered thousands of humans and elves and razed to the ground all villages they found in their way. Orgrim Doomhammer and Zul'jin attacked the elf homeland and made it to Eversong Woods until Alliance reinforcements could arrive. Doomhammer, however, focused his strength on Lordaeron and did not destroy Quel'Thalas as Zul'jin wanted. When defeat for the orcs seemed inevitable, the forest trolls as a united race abandoned the Horde as suddenly as they joined, but some tribes decided to stay with their orcish allies, notably by being brought to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and then spread among the various clans of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, or joining up with &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecent times.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the forest trolls returned to the old ways of rivalry and fighting between the tribes. Two tribes, the &lt;a href=\"Smolderthorn\"&gt;Smolderthorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firetree\"&gt;Firetree&lt;/a&gt; joined &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; and have taken up residence in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; the forest trolls stayed away from the main conflict however a fair percentage of forest trolls fell to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s powers. They have lost their will and are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. The recent fall of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; led to a unique opportunity to once again attempt to reclaim their ancestral lands, in the wake of the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; several tribes attacked the weakened elves. Zul'jin also returned after years missing to lead the trolls against the elves and, much to his frustration his old allies - the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The warlord was killed during the raid of adventurers seeking ancient treasures within the troll bastion, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. The Amani forces were scattered for a long time, until the Zandalari started to send their emissaries to every troll tribe, with Amani being no exception. An individual that dubbed himself 'the Invincible', &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt; received the message and became the new warlord of the Amani. He quickly started to gather all remaining trolls of Zul'Aman in order to unite the tribe once more.\nOne tribe, the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt;s who still felt some loyalty toward the Horde agreed to a pact of friendship and mutual assistance with the new Horde under &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, but declined to rejoin them as they also remembered the recklessness and corruption of the first Horde.\nThe recent &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; has seen &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Torntusk\"&gt;Elder Torntusk&lt;/a&gt;'s return to the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Village\"&gt;Revantusk Village&lt;/a&gt; and the Revantusk tribe openly supporting the Horde. The Revantusk are battling the other forest troll tribes in the region and the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to claim the Hinterlands for themselves and the Horde.\nAmani forest trolls were part of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Invaders\"&gt;Zandalari Invaders&lt;/a&gt; sent to conquer &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; by prophet &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;. Forest trolls as representatives of different tribes can be found at &lt;a href=\"Tal%27aman\"&gt;Tal'aman&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Speakers\"&gt;Terrace of the Speakers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nMagic and religion.\nLike other trolls, forest trolls practice &lt;a href=\"Voodoo\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; magic as well as &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; magics. The forest trolls also worship a serpent goddess named &lt;a href=\"Ula-tek\"&gt;Ula-tek&lt;/a&gt;. She appears to be one of the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; appears to be unpopular among forest trolls and &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%20Markhor\"&gt;Huntsman Markhor&lt;/a&gt; said they dislike how other races abuse arcane magic.\nA small minority of forest trolls also worship &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, though his cult never achieved the dominance it enjoyed among the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nForest trolls erect large slabs of stone adorned with ceremonial masks along their border as warnings and border marks. The border marks also act as shrines, and offerings are placed at them and at times even the skulls of the trolls' enemies.\nRelationships.\nForest trolls are vicious and cunning. As cannibals, they eat the flesh of their enemies and even sometimes each other. Forest trolls have few allies, they hate &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who they see as weak and who failed on their promise to return the forest trolls to their former glory. Many tribes of forest trolls are also hostile towards each other. The Revantusk tribe is the only tribe friendly towards the Horde. Relations between the Alliance and forest trolls are unknown as it has not been stated anywhere, but they no doubt hold a grudge towards the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s for helping the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the conflict between the trolls and high elves.\nForest trolls and high elves.\nForest trolls and high elves see each other as sworn enemies. The trolls hate the elves as they invaded their lands and almost wiped them out, and the elves see the forest trolls as barbarians intent on destroying their homeland. The high elves had been in the dominant position for centuries since the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20War\"&gt;Troll War&lt;/a&gt;s. However, with the recent destruction of their homeland, the elves are weakened and the forest trolls see a chance for revenge.\nTechnology.\nForest trolls know how to build and use &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;wave riders&lt;/a&gt; were armed with such guns, which they put to use again during their assault against &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; after the fall of the high elves.\nAppearance.\nForest trolls are leaner, more agile, and taller than &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s; but still significantly smaller than the tallest of trolls, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike other trolls, forest trolls have long beak-like noses and pointed chins. They have tusks, typically coming from their lower lip, these tusks can vary between a foot long and barely visible. Forest trolls are fairly strong but are also extremely agile. The third toe on their feet helps forest trolls to maintain balance and climb trees.\nDue to a mutation that took place many millennia ago, the forest trolls' bodies can support plant life to a limited extent, considered by some to be a strong affinity for plant life. A thin layer of moss inevitably grows on the skin of forest trolls shortly after they are born and gives them their characteristic green coloring. Their bodies could also support other simple forms of vegetation, such as algae.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; compared forest trolls to &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s when he first saw them. After finding out that they were agile, cunning and smart, he eventually concluded that the trolls were more similar to &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s despite their ogre-like size and strength.\nSome forest trolls have long, taloned fingers that are perfect for digging through rock and earth.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nAs their name suggests, these trolls are found in forests \u2014 at least, forests not dominated by elves or other humanoid species. Some forest trolls are jealous of their jungle and ice kin, as these forest trolls have never known the glories of their own kingdom. Forest trolls hold all other races in contempt \u2014 especially high elves, whom they consider the despoilers of their ancient homeland. (The civilization of the forest trolls of Lordaeron predates that of the high elves by several thousand years.) They will only work with others if it means the elimination of an even more hated enemy. They allied with the Horde during the Second War in this manner, abandoning the orcs after their defeat.\nForest troll culture is tribal and as primitive as their dark troll cousins. Though not as violent as dark trolls, forest trolls nonetheless have a fearsome reputation in battle.\nThe trolls aren't so fond of elves. The forest trolls of northern Azeroth, led by the mighty &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, spent much of their lives staging hit-and-run attacks on the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Once, these trolls might have assaulted the elves directly, but the combined power of the human and elf nations whittled the forest trolls down to a mere fraction of their former strength and power.\nAppearance.\nForest trolls resemble their jungle troll cousins but are taller and more muscled. Though in comparison to orcs, Forest Trolls are noted to be more lithe and agile. Their hair ranges from blood red to midnight black, while their skins are a deep olive green. Forest trolls decorate their bodies with ritual scarring and piercings, and they prefer white or dark warpaints symbolizing their power and glory. These humanoids are easily seven feet tall, with an impressive build and mottled, dark green skin covered with moss. Yellow teeth show under a large, hooked nose.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", the original introduction cinematic showed &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; fighting against an enslaved forest troll in the arena of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; before his escape. The troll's appearance was directly based off of the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Axethrower%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Troll Axethrower&lt;/a&gt; model in \"Warcraft II.\"\nSpeculation.\nPossible war of Draenor retcon?\nIn ', many forest trolls were brought by the Bleeding Hollow clan to Draenor and were divided among the clans of Draenor. Later lore such as ' and the \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\" novel make no mention of forest trolls being in the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, but it hasn't officially been stated if there's a &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt; or if they simply weren't mentioned."}

They all can trace their origins back to eggs of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; taken through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, which were accidentally exposed to a great deal of nether energies when &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart. Free of any bonds to their parent dragonflight, the nether dragons now seek a new life in the turbulent, and often hostile, world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. A large portion of these dragonkin are part of the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt; dragonflight; which seeks to liberate their kind from enthrallment by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife cycle and appearance.\nNether dragons are highly unstable. As a result, they age rapidly but soon burn themselves out as their energies fade, giving them considerably shorter lifespans than other dragons.\nNether dragons, as with all other dragons, go through various life stages before they are fully grown. These stages are divided into &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Whelps are the children of their kind, while drakes are adolescents and young adults. The oldest of their kind become dragons, though they appear to still grow in some capacity as far older dragons are usually larger than their younger kindred. Traditional dragons look largely the same, akin to an immense lizard with four legs and wings sprouting along their spine. In their youthful stages, whelps seem to exclusively travel by way of flight, with older dragons flying or walking depending on their whims.\nNether drakes in particular have an ethereal form that gradually appears to grow more and more translucent as they age; giving them a unique appearance in contrast to their Azerothian brethren. Unlike dragons from Azeroth, whose skin tone is usually a specific color depending on their brood, the nether dragons appear to come in a variety of hues. Their adult form, however, has only appeared thus far as a transparent teal.\nHistory.\nNear the end of the Second War, the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; Deathwing traveled through the Dark Portal to Draenor. Believing Draenor to be a relatively safe haven for his offspring, he secreted away a cache of black dragon eggs before having to suddenly retreat back to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; recklessly opened multiple portals on Draenor, and the magical stress tore the planet apart. The energies released in this catastrophe altered Deathwing\u2019s eggs, resulting in the nether dragons. They are ethereal dragons whose bodies are composed of energies from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Without Deathwing's guidance, these otherworldly nether drakes ended up finding their own way among the blasted ruins of Outland.\nOne faction of netherwing dragons, named the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt;, were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; and many were enslaved by Zuluhed, including &lt;a href=\"Karynaku\"&gt;Karynaku&lt;/a&gt; who was the leader of the brood. Their son &lt;a href=\"Mordenai\"&gt;Mordenai&lt;/a&gt; wanders the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Fields\"&gt;Netherwing Fields&lt;/a&gt; seeking adventurers to help free his mother and eventually help the Netherwing escape enslavement.\nAnother brood found at the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Ridge\"&gt;Celestial Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in Netherstorm, is ruled by the corrupted crazed &lt;a href=\"Veraku\"&gt;Veraku&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; seeks to defeat Veraku and take control of the brood for their own safety and to study their physiology.\nNexus Point.\nSometime during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt; sought to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and become the new Lord of Outland and, eventually, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To these ends, Ragnok united a band of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s under his strict rule and bargained with &lt;a href=\"Kadavan\"&gt;Kadavan&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt;, in order to gain his help with enslaving nether drakes and dragons to bolster his forces.\nEventually, he managed to defeat his rivals, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, and took their surviving warriors and nether dragons to strengthen his army. With them, he set out to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. His machinations were foiled by &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; and a combined &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; army; who defeated his forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Jorad Mace destroyed Ragnok's device which controlled his nether dragons and called on the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to judge Ragnok, blasting apart his chest with a radiant swing of his hammer and sending his disintegrating body tumbling from the back of his nether dragon mount. With their leader dead and losing the nether dragons' support, the Alliance and Horde armies drove off the remains of Ragnok's forces.\nFollowing the battle, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; took the enthralled nether dragons to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of freeing them from their enthrallment.\nTyrygosa learned in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; that nothing could save the &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s unless an extremely powerful source of arcane power could revitalize them enough to free themselves. Tyrygosa, &lt;a href=\"Kadavan\"&gt;Kadavan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; opened a dimensional rift to Azeroth and brought a group of enthralled Netherwing dragons to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; where they absorbed its magical energies. Yet Zzeraku and the nether dragons grew mad with power, and frustrated with everyone they've ever encountered trying to use them, decided to be masters of their own destinies and conquer Azeroth for themselves. Tyrygosa tried to reason with Zzeraku, telling him that by following Deathwing's path, Azeroth would rise up against them leading to their destruction. Though conflicted with Tyrygosa's sincere concern for his kind, Zzeraku believed that only by gaining power could he safeguard his people. The Netherwing dragons attacked the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and in the midst of the chaos, Malygos woke up from his slumber. In his insanity, Malygos misinterpreted the Nether dragons' arrogant proclamations of being the embodiment of the Nexus and absorbed them and their power. The dragons' nether-warped physiology began to affect the Spell-Weaver himself, ultimately helping him regain some of his lost sanity. With his sanity restored to him, Tyrygosa's patron declared &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; on mortal spellcasters, sending his flight out to do his bidding. Only Zzeraku managed to escape.\nBeing unable to guide the nether dragons to a better end weighed heavily on Tyrygosa. She later returns to Outland where she decides to look after a new generation of Netherwing eggs.\nCataclysm.\nOne of the nether drakes was captured within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Halls of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Caverns\"&gt;Blackrock Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, by the members of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Corla%2C%20Herald%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Corla, Herald of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; used his raw energies to transform the \"worthy\" into &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt; was also said to spend his life absorbing the essence of captured nether dragons.\nThe said nether drake and dragons might possibly be a gift from &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Lady Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, who abducted many of the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt; eggs with the help of &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Overlord Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nNether dragons vary from being highly friendly to mortal races to downright hostile towards all beings. Many inherited the temper of their sire, the dark &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; Deathwing. Many others, specifically those in the twisted lands of the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, have fallen prey to a mysterious corruption. The nether dragons often see themselves as orphans, abandoned on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as it began to shatter, uncared for and unwanted by their father. The energies that changed also allow them to hatch and mature at a far more rapid pace than other dragons. \nThey are fully sentient intelligent beings and speak Draconic like normal dragons. They also share the ability to learn magic and take humanoid forms.\nNomenclature.\nNether dragon names tend to have an \"-aku\" or \"-ku\" at the end. Others have names similar to those of their predecessors, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficial info.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/burningcrusade/townhall/netherdrake.html\"&gt;Nether Drake&lt;/a&gt; info from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/burningcrusade/\"&gt;official EU Burning Crusade (En) site&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\", &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Nether%20Dragon\"&gt;nether dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drake%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Nether%20Drake\"&gt;nether drakes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Whelp%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Nether%20Dragon%20Hatchling\"&gt;nether dragon hatchlings&lt;/a&gt; poured out of the &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s, and were implied to have demonic origins and are shown to have been brought to Outland by Magtheridon, having come from another world or the Twisting Nether through his gates.\nIn \"\", these nether dragons instead look similar to the \"World of Warcraft\" version, appearing to have retconned this origin.\nIn the RPG.\nTFT's explanation was referenced in the RPG and expanded upon;\nIn a &lt;a href=\"short%20story\"&gt;short story&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20%26amp%3B%20Light\"&gt;Shadows &amp; Light&lt;/a&gt;\", the protagonists of the tale had eight nether dragons circling around them, and beyond the nether dragons a full-grown netherwyrm. They killed off half the drakes, but the mother was roaring to call more of her children."}

It stood on a high bluff along the only road into the Blasted Lands, a road often traveled by both the Horde and the Alliance as they prepared to do battle with the demonic forces in the region.\nNethergarde Keep was a heavily defended &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; town located in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. Although technically it was a castle like &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the Barrens, none of the guards were &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;-enabled except the &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Master\"&gt;Gryphon Master&lt;/a&gt; and a few questgivers. Before its destruction in \"\", it had two &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;. Its defenses were no match for the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSecond War.\nNethergarde Keep was built after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 following the destruction of the first &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 at the behest of Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that there would be no further invasions from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe construction of Nethergarde was funded by the various kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; (though some more willingly than others), and constructed by the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;. The archmages of the Kirin Tor, along with the help of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; and the young king of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, convinced the members of the Alliance that the high costs involved with constructing the fortress were well worth it considering the dangers involved with a possible \"second invasion\". It was primarily staffed by members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, who were also tasked with stopping the spread of the &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;taint&lt;/a&gt; that had &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;corrupted&lt;/a&gt; the orcish homelands and threatened to spread over all the continent. The magi managed to preserve the northern &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;swamps&lt;/a&gt; and the human realms beyond. At the same time, while humanity began to distance itself from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; still participated in the defense of Nethergarde Keep, but that was as much from their fascination with all &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; as from any desire to help humans.\nAt some point, back when only the walls, the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;, and a single &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; were finished, all the remaining kings of the Alliance visited Nethergarde, including &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, Terenas, Thoras and Varian. For most of them it was their first visit to the newly-christened &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhadgar was master of Nethergarde until the reconstruction of the Dark Portal by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, and his clans, on Draenor. When the orcs began attacking Azeroth once more, they besieged the Keep. Khadgar and his friends &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; rallied their troops and led the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; through the Dark Portal in order to destroy the Horde and seal off the Portal once and for all. When Ner'zhul opened more portals, which began to tear Draenor apart, the five leaders remained behind to seal it from Draenor in order that the backlash would not affect their beloved world of Azeroth.\nFor twenty years thereafter, the Dark Portal was silent.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter the Portal was sealed, the mages of Dalaran kept Nethergarde in operation both for the Kirin Tor and the Alliance. They focused their efforts on studying the effects that the Portal's energy had on what had become known as the Blasted Lands - the mutations to the wildlife and the tainting of the soil. When Dalaran was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; during the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Nethergarde's continued survival depended on support from the nearby Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and by warriors of the Alliance who traveled into the Blasted Lands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; were also conducting researches in the keep, research vital to their understanding of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which required nearly constant supplies. Nethergarde Keep was thus supplied by &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20caravan\"&gt;a caravan&lt;/a&gt; from Stormwind City.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Kazzak%20the%20Supreme\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;, the demon commander in Azeroth, found an artifact to reopen the Dark Portal, and join the Legion's ranks in Outland. With the way to Outland open again, Nethergarde became a major hub of activity between Stormwind and the Dark Portal. Alliance, Horde and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; came to help.\nThe Keep also sent some &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn the years following the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the southern wall of the &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; was opened. After the &lt;a href=\"shattering\"&gt;shattering&lt;/a&gt;, which largely destroyed the eastern mountain range, this allowed direct access to the &lt;a href=\"Shattershore\"&gt;Shattershore&lt;/a&gt;. To the west, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has retaken the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces of Nethergarde Keep into direct conflict over territory and resources.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nNethergarde Keep was destroyed when the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; invasion force, the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt;, aided by the area's &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, invaded through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. It was their first target and the Alliance was not prepared for their advanced weapons. After the fall, the Horde from &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt; took the opportunity and attacked. They defeated them at first, but after reinforcements arrived even they fell to their firepower and soon after the Iron Horde conquered Dreadmaul Hold as well.\nEventually, both the Alliance and Horde led another assault on the Keep, their forces attacking enemy soldiers, while adventurers killed &lt;a href=\"Gar%20Steelcrush\"&gt;Gar Steelcrush&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the newly taken keep, and the lieutenants &lt;a href=\"Mokrik%20Blackfingers\"&gt;Mokrik Blackfingers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rukah%20the%20Machinist\"&gt;Rukah the Machinist&lt;/a&gt;, in order to gather their orders, as well as collected mementos of fallen inhabitants and soldiers from the previous fighting.\nIn the RPG.\nNethergarde Keep could be described as a dam holding back the evils of a blighted land \u2014 and a building full of uptight perfectionists. This &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwindian&lt;/a&gt; fortress is home to about 300 members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. It was built by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who led an &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; long ago which was eventually lost. The &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s who occupy it today serve in honor of his memory.\nBeing the only building for miles, Nethergarde Keep stands stark and alone by the road. &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s man the walls at all times, watching for movement, to welcome &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt;s or food trains from Stormwind, to turn back travelers, or to mount a defense against the enemies.\nDescription.\nThis medium-sized &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; sits at the very north of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, guarding the sole road into the region. Its mages and warriors have given up fun for duty and a constant struggle against &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. Some may think they are losing, but they continue to fight to protect the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and watch over any foe that would abuse the portal's power, especially &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; and his forces.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; thought that the Keep's greatest problem was not the threat from the outside but the threat from inside. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Thas%27ranan\"&gt;Archmage Thas'ranan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Lordenson\"&gt;General Lordenson&lt;/a&gt; share leadership, the first leading the mages and the second the warriors. They are rarely at odds, but when they are, the other inhabitants make themselves scarce as the sparks fly. Nethergarde's people are a solitary bunch under a great deal of stress. The place is basically a powder keg. This tightly knit community experiences little crime; however, those found breaking the agreements they take on when accepting a post at Nethergarde are sent for a time to the &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. These mages cannot afford any dissention in the ranks."}

Velen believed that the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Essence of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; taken from Nhal'athoth's remnants would be exactly what they needed to bring balance to the Netherlight Crucible and give them the edge they need against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack at the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; believed it to be the right time to revive &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;. After assembling Xe'ra's components and combining them with &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, Xe'ra was consequently restored. Xe'ra was delighted to have found the Chosen One, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and wished to restore Illidan to his original state from before his demonic transformation. Illidan was reluctant to be transformed once more by Xe'ra, however, being content with seeking the Legion's end in his own form. When Xe'ra tried to transform Illidan by force, he resisted and destroyed Xe'ra with his &lt;a href=\"%3AEye%20Beam\"&gt;:Eye Beam&lt;/a&gt;.\nXe'ra's death distressed Turalyon and many others. To lift their spirits Velen told Turalyon that the Light did not die with the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Naaru\"&gt;Prime Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, that it still shined within all of them, and that it was imperative that they press on as they still had a world to save. Furthermore, not willing to let Xe'ra's passing go to waste, Velen gathered the &lt;a href=\"Vestige%20of%20Light\"&gt;essence of Xe'ra's Light&lt;/a&gt; and imbued it into Netherlight Crucible.\nWith the Netherlight Crucible thus empowered, the weapons of the \"Vindicaar\"'s champions could be imbued by both the Light and the Shadow."}

To aid their quest, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; called together many priesthoods from all over Azeroth to work in unison, forming an order known as the Conclave. These worshippers of both the Light and Shadow alike gathered in the building's two wings, themed respectively after the Light and the Shadow. Turning the prison into a temple, Netherlight became their &lt;a href=\"Order%20Halls\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they eventually managed to pool their energy and bring Saraka back to its original form, the naaru &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaa'ra's case is the only known occurrence of a Void god returning to the Light, and probably the first time this has ever happened too given the amount of time the naaru and draenei spent studying it, and that the participation of the most powerful priests in existence was necessary in order to achieve this feat.\nPoints of interest.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hall%20of%20Balance\"&gt;The Hall of Balance&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Light&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Void&lt;/a&gt;\""}

A large army of demons came through under the general's command until Arax'ath himself shows up. In a one one fight, Arax'ath would fall and the First enslaves the Wrathsteed.\nAlong with the Council and Mor'zul, the First dominates the demon and it eventually yields."}

She is an apprentice to &lt;a href=\"Pathaleon%20the%20Calculator\"&gt;Pathaleon the Calculator&lt;/a&gt; and she may be in charge of the production of &lt;a href=\"manacell\"&gt;manacell&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Thanks to her skills at quickly summoning creatures to destroy any enemies, Sepethrea was chosen as an apprentice to Pathaleon the Calculator, the blood elf in charge of the Mechanar.\"\nStrategy.\nNormal.\nWhen the fight is initiated, she summons two Raging Flames (Fire Elementals) that are immune to all forms of crowd control. They move slowly, and will chase a randomly selected target, leaving damaging trails of fire behind them. Their targets should flee, kiting them around the room. Every several seconds, the elementals will cast Inferno (like &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt; except the caster does not take damage) around them, which should be avoided. After the Inferno is cast, they will randomly change to a new target. \nThe boss herself makes tanking difficult, as she can repeatedly disable the tank. Quick dispelling can deal with her Dragon's Breath, anyone who gets aggro, especially if the tank is snared, will need to run to the tank. \nAttempting to pull her beyond the room will reset the encounter.\nA useful tactic for this encounter involves using her own slowing attack against her. When the tank is slowed by her Frost attack, he can pull her around the edges of the room at a moderate pace, maintaining enough distance from the Fire Elementals and allowing ranged DPS to unload when they can. Just be sure to keep an eye on the healer. When she disables the tank temporarily, she quickly runs to the next player on the threatlist, so be sure to recover that aggro quickly when this happens.\nBe sure to avoid going down the hallway towards the Final Boss, as you may accidentally pull the waves of mobs down there, which will invariably lead to a quick wipe.\nHeroic.\nThree Raging Flames spawn, rather than two. As of 2.2.0, the elementals act like the Normal mode elementals, except that they run at 80% speed, not 50%. They will switch targets quickly if kiting is attempted. Fire resistance can be helpful, as fire damage is almost guaranteed here.\nOne method is to have your tank stand in the very middle of the room and have your DPS (Ranged or caster preferably) spread out into the 4 corners of the room. She will slow the tank when she hits him so the tank will only move when the fire elementals walk near him and leave the fire path/adds come near him and begin Hellfiring. This way, when the adds come the DPS immediately has distance on its side. The DPS/healer will move around the four corners, something of a throwback to the Razorgore fight. It is absolutely imperative that the DPS and healer stay within max range of the tank so that when the adds are not chasing them, they can remain static and do their jobs.\nAnother method used successfully (pre-patch &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.2.0%20%28Release%20Notes%29\"&gt;2.2.0&lt;/a&gt;) is to have your healer stand down the hallway (after having cleared the final boss) and then run in once the tank has pulled. This gives your healer a better chance of not starting out with initial aggro.\nAlternatively, a method that has worked well on numerous occasions is to take 2 well geared warlocks who can cast &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Seed of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; on all targets and a decent paladin tank to then use &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Defense\"&gt;Righteous Defense&lt;/a&gt;. With 3 elementals and the boss, around 1100 damage (plus damage modifiers) per mob per tick can be achieved."}

{"id": "66393", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=66393", "title": "Netherspite", "text": "Netherspite is an immense &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; found lurking in the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Watch\"&gt;Celestial Watch&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh's personal observatory. As the only dragon found inside the dark tower, he will use his otherworldly powers to vanquish any creatures that attempt to go near him. This dragon's death is not required for further progress into the tower but he does control the trash between the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Aran\"&gt;Shade of Aran&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;Chess Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to Battle.\nNetherspite patrols the back section of his room, but his aggro radius is not particularly large allowing the entire raid to comfortably enter the room before the pull. The fight is entirely tactical: other than the enrage time the players' gear does not play as large a part in this fight as it does others.\nThe room itself is enormous, allowing plenty of room for players to maneuver. It is shaped like a square with a semicircular balcony attached to the far end.\nAttacks and Abilities.\nNOTE - unlike most dragons, Netherspite will neither cleave nor damage players with his tail.\nEDIT - As of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, Netherspite does do ~1000 damage per hit with his tail. This is easily negated by high armor and high avoidance.\nStrategy.\nThere are two phases to this fight that Netherspite alternates between. The Portal phase, (the first one) lasts for one minute, and the Banish phase (the second one), lasts for half a minute. He alternates between these two at the given rate until dead or enraged.\nPortal phase.\nAt the beginning of this phase, three portals of different colors will spawn at fixed locations in the room and will begin emitting a beam of their respective color (see below) towards Netherspite. The beams do not slowly move toward him, but rather appear touching Netherspite once they are created.\nIf the beams are allowed to hit Netherspite freely, they grant him stacking buffs which strengthen or even heal him. The buffs on Netherspite last 5 seconds from last application (instead of the 8 to 20 seconds they do on players). The beams can (and must) be blocked by players who position themselves between a portal and Netherspite. Players blocking the beams are also affected by a stacking buff, having both a positive and a negative effect which grows more extreme with each second that the player spends blocking a beam. Although the positive effects are quite helpful for the fight, the negative effect makes it difficult (but certainly not impossible) for one player to block a beam for the complete duration of the Portal phase.\nOnce a buff \"ticks out\" (player leaves the beam long enough to lose the debuff \u2014 8-20 sec), another debuff is applied to the player called &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Exhaustion\"&gt;Nether Exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents him from intercepting that color beam for the next 1 minute and 30 seconds.\nBlue Beam.\nPortals will always spawn at the same locations in the room during all Portal phases, but their colors will semi-randomly change each time after the first Phase.\nBeam Blocking Assignment.\nThis part of the fight relies on individual player responsibility in that all players designated to block a beam ahead of time (see below for suggestions) must be aware of what beam they are supposed to be blocking and when so as to intercept it as quickly as possible.\nThose not blocking a red beam deal damage or heal the raid. Because of the red beam's unique abilities, healers should not ever waste time healing the tank. Damage dealers need not worry about threat, since the tank has guaranteed aggro while standing in the red beam.\nFor each Portal phase, one or two players are needed to block each beam. Using one player is simpler, but requires much better gear. Using two players avoids stacking debuffs to dangerous levels, but requires intelligent coordination.\nBlue Beam.\nThe blue beam is taken by damage-dealing classes (preferably with high health and/or shadow resistance). While their damage output increases rapidly, the damage received by them from Netherspite's shadow aura also increases rapidly and healing spells on them become less effective. Players staying inside this beam for too long becoming prone to be killed by a Void Zone.\nMost raids do best by assigning one damage-dealer to take the blue beam for twenty ticks, then switching to a second damage-dealer for the rest of the phase. This avoids stacking the debuff to dangerous levels.\nA Warlock is especially useful here, as he can replenish the health lost through the increased damage from his &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Life\"&gt;Drain Life&lt;/a&gt; spell and can reduce his shadow damage taken. A shadow priest is also a good option since &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt; also scales with damage and heals the caster for a considerable amount. These classes are most easily able to take the entire duration of the blue beam. One healer should be designated to heal only the person in the blue beam.\nThe death of a blue beam blocker is not always a disaster. Any class and any spec is capable of blocking this beam. If the blocker happens to go down during the portal phase, any available player can simply hop in and ride the beam for the duration until the snag can be worked out.\nGreen Beam.\nThe green beam rapidly heals Netherspite to full if it is allowed to touch him. It must be blocked at all times.\nA manaless class (warrior, rogue, or feral druid (\"Note that a feral druid's mana will be drained, and prevent them from shifting. Don't try and use a bear tank in cat form in the green beam or he won't have the mana to change back to bear\") can stay for a whole beam's duration and not receive any relevant debuff. The reduced energy / rage cost of abilities from this beam allows them to do more damage. A tank that is not currently taking the red beam is a good option.\nHalf the green beam can be taken by a healer to temporarily greatly increase his power. This makes it easy to keep up whoever is taking the blue beam. A healer that takes the beam for 20 seconds finishes with mana 4,000 below his maximum. This may be higher than his mana before the beam, so it is often a very good idea to put a healer in the green beam. Restoration Druids are especially effective in this - their HoTs tick for very high numbers, which can be useful to recover from the Netherbreath - however, Paladins and Shamans can more easily recover from the reduced mana pool.\nDamage-dealing classes that use mana may touch the green beam for one tick. This refills their mana to full. They must be careful to get out of the beam quickly, so the designated green beam blocker does not get Nether Exhaustion.\nRaids that have problems with the blue beam blocker dying usually are raids that keep healers out of the healing beam. If this is a problem, try \"using\" the green beam with a healer instead of just neutralizing it with a rogue or warrior.\nRed Beam.\nClasses with high armor (i.e. Warriors, Bear Druids, Moonkin Druids in full leather, Paladins, Shamans, and Hunters) can block the red beam. The red beam gives them the massive healing and health needed to tank Netherspite. Despite the replenishment to full health every second, Netherspite can sometimes crit for very high numbers (upwards of 11k on a plate-wearing non tank). So leather and cloth wearers can still get easily one-shotted despite the augmented health maximum. Resilience from PvP gear is useful.\nThe red beam may be blocked two different ways. One way is to have one character block it for 20 seconds, and another character block it for the rest of the beam. The other way is to have a single tank-class character dance in and out of the beam for the entire duration.\nIf two characters share a red beam, they must be druid bears, moonkins in full leather, or wear chain mail or plate. One player takes a beam for 20 ticks, then the next player does.\nIf one player takes the entire red beam, they must be druid bear or have plate mail and a shield. Any character will eventually be one-shotted if they stand in the entire red beam, so they must dance in and out of the beam to avoid some of the debuffs. To do this, they repeatedly take five stacks of the debuff, then shift to the side to let Netherspite take the next five stacks, then shift back in. To avoid Netherspite moving, they should not move backward.\nBeam Rotation.\nBecause of Nether Exhaustion (see above), two shifts of players must be used to block the beams. A solid rotation looks like this:\nSHIFT ONE: PORTAL PHASE\nBANISH PHASE\nSHIFT TWO: PORTAL PHASE\nBANISH PHASE\nSHIFT ONE AGAIN, etc.\nBanish Phase.\nThe Banish phase lasts for about 30 seconds:\nThere are two techniques for handling the Banish phase.\nOne technique is to leave Netherspite at the door with the designated red-beam tank for the next Portal phase and one healer. Everyone else runs to the far side of the room, by the telescope. The tank faces Netherspite toward the door, and the healer stands to the side. The players on the far side of the room bandage up and recover mana. This is generally the easiest maneuver.\nThe second technique is to make a tight circle around Netherspite and continue attacking. Non-tanks stay out of melee range. When he faces a player to perform a Netherbreath, everyone runs to his tail. If executed quickly and properly, this prevents anyone from getting hit, and Netherspite dies more quickly this way.\nAnother trick is to have a shaman drop a &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Totem\"&gt;Searing Totem&lt;/a&gt;. Netherspite tries to kill the totem with his Netherbreath(an AoE spell that does not kill it). It also aggroes Netherspite as soon as the banish phase ends, providing time for the tank to pick him up.\nAfter 30 seconds, Netherspite starts a fresh Portal phase and clears his aggro table. This means that no damaging or healing spells can be used before the tank can gain aggro. This means that he will have to pick up Netherspite and \"then\" drag him over to the red portal or healers will be stuck. Other players should run to where their portals have appeared as quickly as they can.\nNetherspite does not always leave the Banish phase immediately when his cooldown is up. Do not run back to him too soon."}

Before the sundering of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Farahlon had a coastline on the &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Sea\"&gt;Devouring Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the Primals, Farahlon was also home to some &lt;a href=\"Farahlon%20Giant\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;, and the presence of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon%20Breaker\"&gt;Farahlon Breaker&lt;/a&gt;s in modern Netherstorm indicates that more &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; might have been present as well.\nRecent history.\nFarahlon was also once home to a &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; city of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Farahlon\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;.

Its isolated location also made it one of the few places on Draenor unaffected by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. After crossing the ocean with the help of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; shipwrights, orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s leeched life from the Primals and used the stolen power to set the island's dense forests alight while Kilrogg and his army slaughtered every &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; they could find.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; members of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; settled on Farahlon and created &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Draenor and transformed it into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Farahlon was transformed into the Netherstorm. The &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; constantly ate away at the Netherstorm's borders, and its chaotic magics slowly bled into Outland.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nYears later, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the Netherstorm aboard the dimensional fortress &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid the peoples of Outland. Although the region was broken, Netherstorm was still comparable to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; with its fields. But when the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; reached Netherstorm, they captured Tempest Keep and used its machinery to harness the storm's magic, further compromising the already unstable land. They dismantled parts of Tempest Keep and strategically built five tremendous &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s across the Netherstorm, siphoning mana from the Twisting Nether itself and storing it in &lt;a href=\"Mana%23Manaforges\"&gt;mana cells&lt;/a&gt; for the elves to feed on. The more energies they produced, the more unstable the region would become, turning Netherstorm into a barren, twisted wasteland. Over time, the manaforges weakened the fabric of reality in the Netherstorm, attracting the attention of the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, who arrived on Outland to ply their trade or pursue their war against the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s however, the forges were stopped soon enough preventing the entire destruction of Outland.\nSeveral areas of the region have been influenced by goblins who performed research and experiments in the unique environment. Signs of their influence can be seen on the architecture of bridges and signposts. They have erected a major base in the form of &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt; on the southwestern island, and another smaller base in the east called &lt;a href=\"Cosmowrench\"&gt;Cosmowrench&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Netherstorm is also home to two factions of ethereals, the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate\"&gt;Protectorate&lt;/a&gt;, respectively based at the &lt;a href=\"Stormspire\"&gt;Stormspire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate%20Watch%20Post\"&gt;Protectorate Watch Post&lt;/a&gt;. Great magical domes constructed by the ethereals dominate the view from nearly any point in the region. Within these domes, the ethereals worked to preserve an environment that was to the liking of their flesh-based clients.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; also took a stake in the zone. They established two principal bases, and , and overran the &lt;a href=\"Arklon%20Ruins\"&gt;Arklon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt; ruins. Their representatives could also be found close to Kael'thas' blood elves, namely the manaforges spread across the region.\nGeography.\nThe region known as the Netherstorm is comprised of the lands situated on seven relatively large floating islands and thousands of smaller rock fragments interspersed amongst them, which are the remnants of the once-lush Fields of Farahlon. The original color of the rock is unknown, but since the deterioration of the land began, the bedrock and soil have assumed a sickly purple color that supports absolutely no plant life (barring netherbloom). As the original landmass was ripped apart and warped into its current state, great fissures opened and jagged, lopsided spires and platforms of rock were thrust upward. Like many other regions of Outland, great floating islands hover unnaturally above the landscape, some found spinning listlessly hundreds of feet above the surface.\nBy land, the Netherstorm can only be entered by crossing the goblin-built &lt;a href=\"Gyro-Plank%20Bridge\"&gt;Gyro-Plank Bridge&lt;/a&gt; which spans the gap between the eastern border of the Blade's Edge Mountains and the Netherstorm's westernmost island. A short hike down the road from the bridge leads to the goblin outpost of &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt; where the goblins under &lt;a href=\"Rocket-Chief%20Fuselage\"&gt;Rocket-Chief Fuselage&lt;/a&gt; work to perfect their nether rocket technology.\nSeveral draenei ruins also populate the region. The &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Enkaat\"&gt;Ruins of Enkaat&lt;/a&gt; lie to the northwest of Area 52 and are inhabited by the restless spirits of fallen draenei who once lived there. The &lt;a href=\"Arklon%20Ruins\"&gt;Arklon Ruins&lt;/a&gt; further to the east are inhabited by demons of the Burning Legion hunting for draenei artifacts of power. In the far north of the Netherstorm lie the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Farahlon\"&gt;Ruins of Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, also infested with powerful demons.\nThe Burning Legion has several holding in the region in addition to the draenei ruins. Forge Bases: Gehenna and Oblivion, dedicated to the construction of monstrous &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;s see scores of demons working furiously to construct the reavers. Invasion Point: Overlord and Invasion Point: Destroyer are sites dedicated to the summoning of powerful demonic reinforcements. The Legion's commander in the region, Socrethar, has taken over the entirety of the smallest of the major islands in the northwest. The island has gained the name Socrethar's Seat as a result.\nOn the northeastern side of the northeast island lies the Celestial Ridge, a great forest of arcane crystals and nesting grounds for a large number of nether dragons of the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt; faction. On the eastern side of the southernmost island is the human settlement &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt;. Built as a base for many of the Kirin Tor mages that came through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; at the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, it is now inhabited only by ghosts and strange magical apparitions.\nOne of the most notable features of the land are the five Manaforges scattered across the floating archipelago. Constructed by the forces of Kael'thas using naaru technology discovered in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, these abominable devices provide a potent source of arcane power to fuel Kael's insidious plans. Of the five, four of the Manaforges (Ara, Coruu, B'naar, and Duro) are operational and garrisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; blood elves and a scattering of the Legion's demons. The fifth; Manaforge Ultris, has been destroyed and infested by shadowy void creatures. Two rival ethereal bands: the Ethereum and the Protectorate, vie for the rights to the potential profits that might be reaped from such a disaster. Great tube-like conduits that span the region channel the energies amassed by the Manaforges to Kael's seat of Tempest Keep in the east.\nFinally, in the central and northern regions of the Netherstorm are the holdings of the ethereals of the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt;. There they have constructed massive arcane domes inside of which they have engineered conditions favorable to plants and animals that could never survive in the Netherstorm otherwise. Known as Eco-Domes, they serve as lush oases in the arcane desert surrounding them. The southernmost, Midrealm, is home to creatures such as lynx, moths, and crocolisks. To the immediate north is the largest in the region, consisting of three conjoined eco-domes. Eco-domes Sutheron and Skyperch flank the Stormspire to the north and south. Adopting a series of draenei ruins atop a tall cliff, the ethereals have made the Stormspire the center of all Consortium activity in the Netherstorm and indeed in all of Outland. North of the Stormspire is the smallest of the domes, Eco-Dome Farfield. It is uninhabited by ethereals but is home to several varieties of exotic dinosaurs.\nNotable characters.\nThe Netherstorm contains several characters of note. &lt;a href=\"Spymaster%20Thalodien\"&gt;Spymaster Thalodien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Karja\"&gt;Anchorite Karja&lt;/a&gt; lead the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; forces, respectively, against &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas'&lt;/a&gt; blood elves and &lt;a href=\"Socrethar\"&gt;Socrethar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces. &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt; is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt;'s business ventures atop the &lt;a href=\"Stormspire\"&gt;Stormspire&lt;/a&gt;. \nResources.\n&lt;a href=\"Cloth\"&gt;Cloth&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Leather\"&gt;Leather&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt;):\n&lt;a href=\"Metal\"&gt;Metal&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;):\nOther:"}

Occasionally Destromath will summon packs of felhounds; let Hamuul taunt them off you.\nLyessa will notify you as the ritual progresses:\nWhen the ritual is complete, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt; appears and engages Destromath with Winds of Hyjal.\nStage 5: The Moment of Truth.\nYou can now stop healing the party.

The term became popular in season three of the &lt;a href=\"arena%20PvP%20system\"&gt;arena PvP system&lt;/a&gt;, when multiple 3v3 \"double melee\" compositions began to climb arena ladders. The original \"Cleave\" setup (Warrior/Rogue/Restoration Druid) became prominent in high tier arena and LAN tournaments. Cleave compositions including Warriors, Rogues, Retribution Paladins, and Enhancement Shamans were commonly high ranking and live tournament arena teams.

In &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, they can only be found in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, but they are still plentiful on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. They are &lt;a href=\"skinnable\"&gt;skinnable&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Thick%20Clefthoof%20Leather\"&gt;Thick Clefthoof Leather&lt;/a&gt; and drop &lt;a href=\"%3AClefthoof%20Meat\"&gt;:Clefthoof Meat&lt;/a&gt; when killed.\nLarge enough to quake the ground, covered with a thick valuable pelt, and armed with enormous tusks, these gigantic beasts are a hunter\u2019s most treasured prize and worst nightmare rolled into one. The meat of a single adult clefthoof can feed an orc clan for days, but their inclination to travel in large packs makes them dangerous prey - beware their devastating headbutt or swiping attacks with their formidable tusks. Fortunately, it\u2019s nearly impossible to be surprised by these massive beasts \u2013 heroes will be able to see and hear them coming from far away! They are known for violently defending their young.\nThe clefthoof are the \"wooly cousins\" of the &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;, but are not biologically related, having developed independently on separate worlds. Clefthoof became sickly and corrupt as a result of Draenor's fel corruption and subsequent transformation into Outland.\nIt appears that ancient &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s hunted clefthoof and used their neck plating as ritual ornamentation for various sites. The &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Grounds%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ancestral Grounds&lt;/a&gt; is an example of this. It is known that the animals would migrate every winter, with the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; - who hunted the herds alongside their &lt;a href=\"Frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolves&lt;/a&gt; - following in their wake.\nNotable clefthoof are &lt;a href=\"Brokentoe\"&gt;Brokentoe&lt;/a&gt;, an old clefthoof who is the first challenge faced in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, and the ancient &lt;a href=\"Banthar\"&gt;Banthar&lt;/a&gt;, whose horn is wanted as proof of hunting skill by &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery year, great herds of clefthoof migrate through &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, causing tremors and dust storms.\nBiology.\nClefthoof meat and milk are both suitable for consuming.\nClefthoof fat can be used in a ritual with a &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;'s eyeball and a few &lt;a href=\"roc\"&gt;roc&lt;/a&gt; beaks to be granted visions of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir hides can be crafted into armor, and the have long hunted the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Bull\"&gt;bloodhoof clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; to use their crimson-hued skin for battle standards. \nShed clefthoof hair gets in everything. Witherhide clefthoof have notches that cover their hooves, allowing them to scale mountains in search of food. They are not just sturdy pack animals, but also powerful instruments of war.\nAs a hunter pet.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", clefthooves became tamable and had the &lt;a href=\"rhino\"&gt;rhino&lt;/a&gt; pet family merged into this one. Only Beast Master hunters will be able to tame these exotic beasts. Despite being decent tanks, they are not as popular in instances, due in part to their large size.\nSpeculation.\nBiology.\nClefthoof are large herbivores native to the plains of Nagrand. They seem to have adapted to complete exposure, their wooly coats and thick skin protecting them from the elements, and living only in open areas. They have evolved with large, powerful horns and bony neck plating, both of which can be assumed to function mainly in dueling between males over mates due to the absence of a predatory species in Nagrand able to take down the clefthoof. Their great size is most likely the only deterrent the clefthoof needs against natural predators. \nAlthough stated by a strategy guide, it would seem impossible for kodos and clefthoof to be related to each other (except through a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; connection). During the original Horde incursions into Azeroth, any such animal accidentally finding its way through the Dark Portal would have found itself in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; where no currently-living animals resemble the kodos or clefthoof. Although both are plains animals, the &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; is native to the plains of Kalimdor, where it was domesticated by the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, long before the Dark Portal ever linked Draenor and Azeroth. That said, it should be noted that there are many other races native to Azeroth that are also native to Draenor, including &lt;a href=\"skunk\"&gt;skunk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tallstrider\"&gt;tallstrider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s and even &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, among other things.\nAnother possible reason for their similarities is parallel evolution, where in different environments with similar conditions, animals tend to take the same body shapes.\nAnother strong argument against their biological relationship is the fact that kodos officially are named to be reptiles, while clefthooves are mammals, as plainly can be seen from their thick fur. Thus, any mention of clefthooves and kodos as being cousins should probably be taken as meaning in terms of their similar cultural roles as large grazing pack animals, rather than any direct biological link.\nUsage.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Orc%20Kodo%20Beast\"&gt;Fel Orc Kodo Beast&lt;/a&gt;s serving the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; might have been clefthooves instead."}

Since the capture and refurbishing of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, the dark clerics spread their faith through the undead lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and began to accept other races into the cult.\nThe cult preaches balance, mandating that their &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s and dark clerics must never forget the dangers of falling too deep into the dark energies they manipulate, for it is often too hard to find one's way back to the Shadow from the deep reaches of the darkness.\nIn the RPG.\nThe leader of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Order%20of%20Northshire%20Clerics\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt; during the war was &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Archbishop Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, and his apprentice was a devout lad named &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;.

Their ability to channel the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;spirit of humanity&lt;/a&gt; through their bodies makes them truly wondrous, and stories of their ability to heal the sick and injured, as well as being able to affect the perceptions of others, are miraculous in nature. The transgressions against Humanity by the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s have forced them to devise ways to defend themselves, but their true path remains the healing of men's souls.\nInformation.\nThe basic healers of any army, Clerics are extremely useful when fully researched. Their spell Far Seeing can make up for a scout by removing the fog of war from previously undiscovered areas, mainly to find a new &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Mine%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Gold Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Their spell Healing is extremely useful, as it keeps an army at its maximum potential. Their most useful spell is Invisibility, as it creates the possibility of stealth strikes at critical points (important enemy structures), usually best done by casting invisibility on a couple of &lt;a href=\"Water%20Elemental%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Water Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and sending the Water Elementals to the enemy's city.\nClerics use Mana to cast spells. Mana will slowly regenerate over time, up to a maximum of 255.\nSpells.\n- The &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20of%20Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbot of Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;\nThe invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish hordes&lt;/a&gt; has necessitated our divining a method to protect not only ourselves, but the whole of the people of Azeroth, as well. The use of physical violence is not the calling of our order, but each force must be met with an equal force for the balance of good and evil to be preserved. As the &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;archangels&lt;/a&gt; took up swords of light to defend the heavens, so must we take up holy arms to defend our lands. The pure essence of the casters heart, mind, and soul strikes out to defend him from threat, and enters into the soul of the target. This is especially effective against the Orcs because of their dark and evil origins.\nThe aiding of our brothers and sisters in times of sorrow, grief, and illness is the primary concern of the disciples from &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. This has required us to devise a way to ease the burdens of those about us, with out causing another an equal burden. This has led us to using the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;spirit of humanity&lt;/a&gt; itself to heal all forms of injury or disease. The effect is that the pain and injury of the one afflicted is divided amongst all humanity, making the burden easier to bear (carrying the cross of another).\nThis is the ability to cloud the perceptions of others so that they do not recognize the physical existence of the caster. This was originally employed as a tool to make the confessing of secrets that weighed heavily upon the souls of worshippers easier to speak. The clerics of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; have found it very useful in assisting the armies of King Llane in ridding Azeroth of the Orcs.\nAs dispensers of peace and understanding to the people, the need to keep a clear perspective is a vital one. This ability has developed from that need, and therefore allows the caster to see in an all encompassing fashion, as &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; does. His vision extends to all corners of the land, and his view is omnipotent. The power of this divination is limited, for when one strives to see the world as God does, the human mind can only partake of a meager portion before it is forever blinded by the clarity of that sight."}

In more recent times, the Guard has played a role in such conflicts as the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;Worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, where they have fought against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s alongside their king.\nServing the current King of Gilneas, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, many members of the Royal Guard have subsequently become &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; themselves (along with much of the Gilnean population).\nHistory.\nNorthgate Rebellion.\nWith the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, tensions began to rise within the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; as a result of &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;'s controversial isolationist policies. When the notorious &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; was eventually completed, it pushed many into open rebellion against the monarchy. Led the nobleman &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, rebel forces clashed with those loyal to House Greymane in the streets of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. At such a moment of unrest in the kingdom, the Gilnean Royal Guard are presumed to have been extremely active in the protection of the royal family and the prosecution of the war.\nAfter a bloody civil war that tore much of Gilneas apart, King Greymane, the Royal Guard, and other loyalist forces emerged victorious over Lord Darius and his rebels. While the Northgate Rebellion was decisively crushed, it left the kingdom of Gilneas in a desperately weakened state.\nGilneas in chaos.\nAs &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;\u2014victims of the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;\u2014began to grow in number within Gilneas, the situation grew more dire. Eventually, entire packs of worgen attacked &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; itself, overwhelming many of its defenses and throwing the city into chaos. The Gilnean Royal Guard were deployed to Gilneas's streets, accompanying &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, and fought to drive the wolf-men from the city. Although &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and other Northgate rebels were released under the King's orders, joining the fight, the worgen onslaught proved relentless. Only through a last stand by Crowley and some others were the royal family and guard, as well as many civilians, able to escape.\nHaving fled to &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;, the Gilneans soon discovered &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;the imminent invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, who had begun to arrive with a large fleet on Gilneas's shores. At this time and during the conflict against the Forsaken to come, any of the remaining Royal Guard are presumed to have stayed with &lt;a href=\"King%20Greymane\"&gt;King Greymane&lt;/a&gt; or other members of the royal family. It is unclear how many remained at this stage, and whether they played a role in the coming battle for &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; against Forsaken forces. In the wake of this conflict, the majority of Gilneans in the kingdom began to leave with the aid of their new &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nThe King and remaining members of the royal family (&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Prince Liam Greymane&lt;/a&gt; having been slain in the fighting) departed for &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, before eventually reaching &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. It is likely that the Royal Guard accompanied them.\nThe Broken Isles.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; became the first engagement of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, as large armies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the demons' position on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, off the south coast of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance forces were led in the battle by both the King of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of Gilneas, among others. Gilnean &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; troops also formed a large portion of the Alliance attack force, and when King Greymane led a charge onto the Broken Shore in person, he was accompanied by a contingent of the Gilnean Royal Guard, now worgen themselves reflecting both the transformation of their king, and many other Gilneans.\nThe Battle for the Broken Shore ultimately proved disastrous, however, with Alliance and Horde forces having to retreat from the area. King Greymane himself, along with his Royal Guard and others, were only barely able to escape aboard the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the sacrifice of King Varian. Returning to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, Genn Greymane began to rally his forces, namely the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, in preparation for another attack on the Broken Isles. The &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Warrior\"&gt;Captured Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s were members of the Royal Guard captured by the demons.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; is accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Greyguard\"&gt;Greyguard&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nStandard royal guards do still appear, however, protecting &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; as she aids the Kaldorei in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Tess later promotes a worgen hero to a member of the Greyguard at the end of the worgen heritage armor quest chain, in thanks for their help.\nAppearances.\nIn most of their appearances, the royal guards wear the same armor as the majority of the Gilnean guards, such as the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Gilneas City Guard&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Guard\"&gt;Gilnean Guard&lt;/a&gt;s. Their appearance in Darkshore has them wearing the Stormwind footman set, while Greyguards wear a unique set of unobtainable armor.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Walden\"&gt;Lieutenant Walden&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Guard\"&gt;Wounded Guard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Guard\"&gt;Slain Guard&lt;/a&gt;s might be members of the Royal Guard or the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Gilneas City Guard&lt;/a&gt;s."}

{"id": "617697", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=617697", "title": "Gilnean military", "text": "The Gilnean military is the armed forces of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; people, serving under King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. The military of Gilneas defended the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;peninsula&lt;/a&gt; kingdom for centuries; having been strong enough to even be considered a formidable entity in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one of humanity's strongest nations, despite being much smaller than its &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;closest neighbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSecond War.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; rebuffed &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s calls for unity, stating that Gilneas' armies could fend off any foe. Regardless of this, however, Gilneas did relent and send part of their military as a token force to ensure trade relations by the end of the war. Gilneas was said to have fought with bravery; using tactics that required them to stay united. Despite this being noted as a token force, Greymane himself notably was said to have partaken in combat versus the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;; describing his battles with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s during the Second War to leaders of the Alliance later on.\nTowards the end of the Second War, however, Gilneas' desire to remain with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; soured, as they called for the extermination of the orcs instead of &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s. However, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; showed them mercy and began building &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; for them. This bill, coupled with the expenses that led to rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and to make matters worse, as Gilneas refused to fund the construction of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, led to disagreements between the kings. Years later, while the Alliance of Lordaeron was unaware of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;death cults&lt;/a&gt; forming in their lands, the departure of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; who stated that the humans' poor leadership had led to the burning of their forests during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, led to the departure of Gilneas and its military from the Alliance, and the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. This ended all contact with the other Alliance nations and closed off the nation from the rest of the world.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Gilneas' military remained stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. King Genn Greymane hadn't sent any Gilnean soldiers to fight the Scourge, as he saw the fall of Lordaeron as confirmation that he had made the right choice in isolating his kingdom from the world. However, the Scourge never flagged, more and more undead appeared outside Gilneas, and the army battered the wall day and night. On Greymane's orders, his army amassed and a tide of Gilnean soldiers poured into Silverpine Forest when the gates swung open. From atop the wall, Greymane watched disaster unfold as the Scourge crushed his men. The soldiers who fell in battle arose as undead and turned against their former comrades. Though the Scourge could not initially penetrate the wall, the Gilnean military was unable to repel the Scourge on their own, and it was only a matter of time before the undead would completely overrun their forces.\nWithout hope of success, the king turned to his royal archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; to find a solution. The magi proposed a summoning spell, which would invoke lupine creatures known as the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; into their service. Despite many generals advising Greymane against it, Arugal himself among them, the worgen were their only hope. As battle raged outside the wall, Arugal performed his summoning. The wolf-beasts wasted no time in turning their fury on the Scourge, then they turned on the Gilnean armies to satisfy their bloodlust. The surviving Gilnean soldiers retreated behind the wall, and the gates slammed shut. What no one knew was that the beasts carried the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;, which spread to Gilnean soldiers who had been bitten by the worgen, the same who had retreated behind the wall.\nIn addition to the Wall, a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; was sent to aid Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; across the sea in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. This group was sent outside of the permission of King Greymane, and instead, by &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;; a Gilnean lord who had disagreed with Genn numerous times since the construction of the wall, and an advocate of the Alliance.\nNorthgate Rebellion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;Northgate Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the Gilnean military supported &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and his loyalists, and fought against the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebels\"&gt;Northgate rebels&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;. The final conflict occurred when Crowley's army marched upon the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, setting it ablaze with artillery fire. Much street fighting likely followed, but the rebels were ultimately unable to overcome Greymane resistance. Having broken upon the city's defenses, the Northgate Rebellion was defeated, with the majority of its leaders, including Crowley, captured and imprisoned within &lt;a href=\"Stoneward%20Prison\"&gt;Stoneward Prison&lt;/a&gt; for high treason.\nCataclysm.\nSeveral days prior to the attack on Gilneas City by the wolfcult of &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;; Genn Greymane ordered his son, &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, to increase the presence of the military across Gilneas; concerned with the growing number of attacks across the kingdom, of which included the &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20Slasher\"&gt;Starlight Slasher&lt;/a&gt; murders. When questioned on if these troops should be moved from the wall, Genn refused to allow it; stating the neighboring Forsaken would use any opportunity to exploit a weakness on the wall. Not wanting to potentially alarm the civilians of Gilneas with the sudden upsurge of military forces; Liam was instructed to simply state that the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebels\"&gt;Northgate rebels&lt;/a&gt; were acting up again.\nPrior to the destruction of the Greymane Wall, the worgen attacked Gilneas City en masse, swarming it under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Gilneas City guards&lt;/a&gt; were rallied under the leadership of King Greymane and Prince &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, later joined by the freed &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebels\"&gt;Northgate rebels&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the guards were wounded or slain, eventually having to start killing the very civilians they were protecting as they &lt;a href=\"Afflicted%20Gilnean\"&gt;turned into the worgen themselves&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, caused by the re-emergence of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the earthquakes destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; and allowed the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; a way into the kingdom; as well as having destroyed the reefs that protected the kingdom. During the initial breach, the military had managed to hold off the Forsaken's advance, despite the presence of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;; who desired the area as a port for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. They fought with muskets, burning oil, and flaming arrows, as well as having several of the recently cured worgen, by way of alchemy, on the walls aiding them. Because of this, the Wall, despite being destroyed, held.\nFollowing the continued lapse in the Gilnean countryside to the worgen, the Cataclysm destroying the southern portion of Gilneas, and eventually the Forsaken's inclusion, the wall was eventually breached, either by the military retreating or having been destroyed by the Forsaken. Following the defeat of the Horde and the crashing of a Horde Gunship into the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Forward%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken Forward Command&lt;/a&gt;, whatever remained of Gilneas' fighting forces regrouped under &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, forming the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, Genn Greymane and the remaining civilians of Gilneas were evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, and later petitioned to rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining the Alliance.\nWhen Genn Greymane and the representatives from Gilneas met with the delegates from the Alliance, it was decided to make a show of power so that the Alliance would recognize Gilneas as a formidable ally, rather than a drain on the Alliance. As a result, the Gilnean military marched in formation with Genn Greymane, carrying the banner of Gilneas and playing the Gilnean anthem. They had, despite Gilneas' beleaguered state, made a point of matching the amount of forces sent by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20army\"&gt;Stormwind army&lt;/a&gt; during this encounter. They capstoned this display by having the Gilneans in procession transform into Worgen as Greymane spoke about the benefits of bringing Gilneas into the Alliance's fold. Soldiers under &lt;a href=\"Eadrik\"&gt;Eadrik&lt;/a&gt; would later join &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; as they attempted to discover the culprit of the Highborne assassinations in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, though Eadrik was slain saving Jarod's life from &lt;a href=\"Neva\"&gt;Neva&lt;/a&gt;, who was later killed in turn to avenge Eadrik.\nWhen the Horde marched into &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, with several &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; under their command, the Gilnean forces attacked the magnataur en masse to aid &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, the Liberation Front continued their fight in Gilneas and beyond under Crowley, eventually recruiting the refugees of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, transforming them into worgen, and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;. They would later receive aide from Stormwind now that Gilneas had rejoined the Alliance in the form of &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt;, whose forces landed in &lt;a href=\"Keel%20Harbor\"&gt;Keel Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, liberated &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, and marched beyond the wall into &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the groups wreaked havoc across Silverpine, before being forced to retreat after the capture of &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt;. While this soured relations with the Bloodfang Pack, the groups continued to work together. The Liberation Front was also active on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Headlands\"&gt;Northern Headlands&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to rebuild a holding for Gilneas from attackers by the sea.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Gilnean soldiers were found guarding the mine in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by a warhound.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Gilneas fielded soldiers under the command of their king at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Royal%20Guard%20%28Broken%20Shore%29\"&gt;Gilnean Royal Guards&lt;/a&gt; made the bulk of their representation. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Gilneas was the main presence on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance; serving under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt;. There, they combated the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in various fronts, such as destroying their fleet, fighting the &lt;a href=\"Queensguard\"&gt;Queensguard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Tower\"&gt;Warden Tower&lt;/a&gt;s, stopping Sylvanas from corrupting &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt;, and established the base of &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey also represented the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, having taken over the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and renamed it to the &lt;a href=\"Greyfang%20Enclave\"&gt;Greyfang Enclave&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Gilneas was present at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Mauler%20%28Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron%29\"&gt;Gilnean Maulers&lt;/a&gt;, cannons, and &lt;a href=\"Knight-Captain%20Emery\"&gt;Knight-Captain Emery&lt;/a&gt; represented their troops. Genn Greymane led the charge alongside &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, acting as one of the on-field generals. Following the battle, Gilneas' military returned to their kingdom under &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, leading an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt;, which were preparing an army of their own to attack Gilneas.\nThey later were &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Footman\"&gt;deployed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, by orders of Greymane, to assist the kaldorei and show them they had not been abandoned by the Alliance. There, they were led by &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Princess Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Commander Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on, the forces of Gilneas deployed &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Ambusher\"&gt;Gilnean Ambusher&lt;/a&gt;s to aid with a suicide mission in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt;, to distract the Horde from forces heading for &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. They broke off from the group alongside &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sentinel\"&gt;sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jan%20Ruins\"&gt;Zul'jan Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, King Genn deployed Gilnean soldiers into the field, the king himself leading the strike team against &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of the . Gilnean footmen faced off against orc &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s and their Zandalari allies at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. They fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwindian&lt;/a&gt; footmen and dwarven &lt;a href=\"Rifleman\"&gt;riflemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance and equipment.\nThe Gilnean military, in the majority of its appearances, shares its basic &lt;a href=\"footman\"&gt;footman&lt;/a&gt; appearance with that of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Gilneas City Guard&lt;/a&gt;'s armor. This is depicted in the \"Curse of the Worgen\" comics, though it is inaccurately given a green color scheme. This color scheme is referential to an original design for Gilneas that was in the early \"Cataclysm\" beta, but was changed before release, thus leading to a mix of the two appearances. This armor is also worn by the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Gilnean Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; in most appearances.\nThe Gilnean military differs from that of the other human nations by deploying less &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, but more &lt;a href=\"Rifleman\"&gt;riflemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. From their appearance in Darkshore, their footmen have been upgraded to using the Aspirant's version of the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Gladiator\"&gt;Dread Gladiator&lt;/a&gt; armor.\nThey are often accompanied by &lt;a href=\"mastiff\"&gt;mastiff&lt;/a&gt;s, either as hunting hounds or as wardogs. A &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Gilnean%20Wardog\"&gt;Lost Gilnean Wardog&lt;/a&gt; can be found wandering Silverpine Forest as a rare mob.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Gabriel\"&gt;Marshal Gabriel&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Knight\"&gt;Stormshield Knight&lt;/a&gt;s that appear in \"Warlords of Draenor\" may have been Gilneans, as they use the voice files (the latter using more than just simple poke quotes) for Gilnean humans."}

It is ruled by King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20family\"&gt;Greymane family&lt;/a&gt;. After the events of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Gilneas rejoined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and they have been trying to reclaim their homeland ever since. The nation's colors are described as a red design consisting of a circle with three vertical lines, akin to lances, and another line bisecting the circle itself, all set within a field of gray.\nDescription.\n\"The human kingdom had supported the Alliance during the Second War, but King Greymane had no qualms about severing all ties to the outside world when it became clear that the Alliance needed Gilneas more than Gilneas needed the Alliance. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, darkness fell on Gilneas after the Greymane Wall's gates had been closed, and the worgen curse ravaged the nation. Before long, Gilneans were fighting against Gilneans in a bloody civil war that left the kingdom in tatters. Remarkably, the people of Gilneas have somehow managed to hold on to the last vestiges of their humanity... for now.\"\nGilneas is a large peninsula that juts into the sea south of western Lordaeron. Silverpine Forest lies to the north-east and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; awaits across the sea to the south. The kingdom was founded following the splitting of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and besides the peninsula, the kingdom also included the island of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;, and formerly held lands in southern Silverpine Forest including &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;. The southwestern reaches of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; in the area around &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt; were also part of Gilneas.\nIts king, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, never ardently supported the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, after the war, he constructed the Greymane Wall: a massive barrier spanning the entire northern border. The enormous wall barricaded Gilneas from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for around two decades.\nIt was later discovered that the '&lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;' has swept mercilessly across the nation, eventually turning nearly all of its inhabitants into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;savage beasts&lt;/a&gt;. Escalating tensions among the survivors escalated into bloody &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; that all but wrecked the nation. Following the \"\" and an &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, some of these &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Gilnean worgen&lt;/a&gt; have regained their free will. After Gilneas fell to enemy hands, Gilneas rejoined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFollowing their victory in &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;their war against the trolls&lt;/a&gt;, the empire of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; entered into a period of prosperity and growth. After the death of King &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; the empire began to expand, founding new city-states in the wilderness - including Gilneas. Unable to compete with &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;'s burgeoning navy, Gilneas focused on bolstering its land-based armies and mercantile capabilities. The military of Gilneas became one of the most powerful in Arathor, equaled only by &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;. Gilneas and Alterac often combined their forces and led grand expeditions to secure the borders of Arathor. Such expeditions made contact with the &lt;a href=\"dwarves\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time the power of Gilneas and the other city-states grew as that of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; waned, eventually they developed their own customs and beliefs, and the empire splintered into &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;independent kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Archibald%20Greymane\"&gt;King Archibald&lt;/a&gt;, the nation thrived, evolving into a formidable middle-power capable of rivaling even Kul Tiras or &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; Gilneas had become recognized as a significant entity in the political landscape of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Emboldened by this fact, the kingdom's ruler, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, was not a strong supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, believing that his own armies would be more than enough to deal with any threat. However, wanting to ensure trade relations with the other kingdoms, Genn sent a &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20military\"&gt;token force&lt;/a&gt; to assist the Alliance. Some Gilnean soldiers joined &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s armies and fought against the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, though in lesser numbers than those sent by Lordaeron and Stromgarde. When &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; was occupied by Alliance troops for its treachery, &lt;a href=\"Isiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Isiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, a cousin of the &lt;a href=\"Perenolde%20family\"&gt;royal family&lt;/a&gt;, fled to Gilneas in order to gather support.\nShortly after the Horde was defeated, Gilneas' desire to remain with the Alliance of Lordaeron soured, as they called for the extermination of the orcs instead of &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s. However, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; showed them mercy and began building internment camps for them. This bill, coupled with the expenses that led to rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and to make matters worse, as Gilneas refused to fund the construction of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, led to disagreements between the kings.\nGreymane made a last bid during the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20crisis\"&gt;Alterac crisis&lt;/a&gt;, trying to put Isiden Perenolde on the throne of Alterac to gain a direct stake in the kingdom's welfare and favored status through the realm's many mountain passes. This eventually failed however, leaving the king even more disillusioned with the Alliance.\nIn a discussion with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Vincent Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, King Greymane questioned the wisdom of listening to the advice of Crowley and Godfrey in joining the Alliance, stating that it had gotten them nothing but dead Gilneans. Greymane stated his plans to withdraw from the Alliance and wall off Gilneas from the rest of the world. Upon looking at the map of Gilneas, the King's decision to close Gilneas's borders and construct the great wall would cut through the lands of a newer, but still well-respected nobleman by the name of &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, as the noble's lands had the mountains as a natural barrier the wall could be built into. Should the wall be finished, it would separate the towns of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of Gilneas. Greymane agreed and was confident that Crowley would understand his reasoning.\nThe Greymane Wall and the Third War.\nYears later, while the Alliance of Lordaeron was unaware of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;death cults&lt;/a&gt; forming in their lands before, the departure of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; who stated that the humans' poor leadership had led to the burning of their forests during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, led to the departure of Gilneas and its military from the Alliance. Consequently, King Greymane started the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, an enormous stone barrier that now separates Gilneas from Lordaeron, attempting to forever remove his nation from what he considered \"other people's troubles\". The construction of the Wall was completed prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite managing to isolate his kingdom, King Greymane had other worries on his mind. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he barricaded the majority of Gilneas behind the Wall and closed off the nation from the rest of the world. As the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; had devastated Gilneas' neighbors and not long after were outside the Wall, no one, not even other humans were allowed to enter the kingdom, King Greymane even refusing to help Lordaeron, who weeks before had begged Gilneas for help. The lands of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; including Pyrewood and Ambermill were notably separated from their liege and nation by the Wall, having no choice but to survive on their own. The Greymane Wall even remained closed to human &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s begging to be allowed in during and after the Scourge's invasion of Lordaeron. The status of Gilneas became unclear to the outside world.\nAt the peak of their strength, the Scourge relentlessly assaulted the Greymane Wall and threatened to devour all Gilneas. Their number was small at first, but it increased over time and they did not flag. King Greymane's armies held the wall for days against a massive sea of undead hordes, but for every undead that fell, another took its place. Fearing it would break, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; opened the gate and Gilnean soldiers poured from Gilneas into Silverpine Forest. The Scourge, however, defeated the soldiers and raised them into undeath.\nIn a desperate attempt to hold the seemingly-unstoppable Scourge at bay, Greymane ordered his court archmage, &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, to unleash a 'secret weapon' against the Scourge \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, who had been contained for millennia in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. At first, everything went according to plan, unfortunately, after the Scourge were driven off, the worgen turned on the Gilnean soldiers stationed beyond the Greymane Wall, infecting them with &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;their Curse&lt;/a&gt;, and began attacking other humans living in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, King Greymane ordered the return of his troops as well as the permanent closure of the Greymane Wall's doors, however, as some retreating soldiers were infected, they began secretly to spread the worgen curse. Over the years, reports of strange attacks and disappearances rose, fear took root in the hearts of Greymane's people, while the curse continued to spread in the kingdom through the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;, gradually eating away at Gilneas' humanity.\nGilneas was shielded from the rest of the world, by the Greymane Wall by land and by its high cliffs and treacherous reefs by sea. Refugees and other nations long entreated Gilneas for aid, but these unfortunates never so much as saw a Gilnean. Many became easy prey for the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; that occasionally strayed south from &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. For many years King Greymane forbade any attempt to leave the self-isolated, and all ports were closed, leaving sailors and people of other nations stranded in Gilneas (such as &lt;a href=\"Tobias%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Tobias Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt;, and the pirates of &lt;a href=\"the%20Brashtide%20Crew\"&gt;the Brashtide Crew&lt;/a&gt;). Gilneans that were themselves locked out of their homeland were a rare sight, but not unknown (such as &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Longshore\"&gt;Baron Longshore&lt;/a&gt;, captain of the pirate ship \"Heedless\").\nWhile Greymane's efforts to stem the tide of the Scourge kept Gilneas from the grasp of the undead, the Greymane Wall inadvertently subjected the Gilneans to a dark fate all the same. Many fell under the worgen curse, as it did with their neighbors to the north in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt; before them.\nA small group of soldiers known as the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; during the Third War, but these were actually sent by Lord Crowley as an act of defiance against Genn.\nCivil war.\nAlthough once a close friend of Genn Greymane, his staunch isolationism led &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; to eventually take up arms against his king. Leading his armed supporters into Gilneas City in an attempt to depose King Genn, a bloody civil war erupted between the two factions, pitting Gilnean against Gilnean, brother against sister. The so-called '&lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;Northgate rebellion&lt;/a&gt;' officially ended when Crowley and his leading allies were captured by Greymane's forces, although rebels and their sympathizers continued to hoard weapons and supplies around Gilneas. Political divisions had led to a deep and bitter hatred between 'rebels' and 'royals', something that has only just begun to heal with the Gilneans' focus shifting to their common enemies.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Sickly%20Refugee\"&gt;Refugees&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and neighboring lands, under the care of &lt;a href=\"Dalin%20Forgewright\"&gt;Dalin Forgewright&lt;/a&gt;, tried to enter the kingdom but were stopped by the then-closed &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Those refugees were not killed when the Scourge rampaged the land, and were presumably killed by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the worgen of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nUnbeknownst to many of the kingdom's citizens, a war between beast and man raged within the worgen themselves. To compound the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; threat, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; started battering at the nation's gates in a bid to conquer Gilneas. Under orders from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, now Warchief of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was commanded to conquer the lands of Gilneas to secure resources and its safe ports. Sylvanas had her own objective \u2013 the retrieval of the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact capable of summoning complacent worgen that could spread their curse to all humanity.\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Wolfcult\"&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; of the ancient 'Alpha Prime' of the worgen, &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt;, the worgen epidemic grew with fervor. Ultimately his &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; of wild worgen launched a massive attack on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, overrunning the kingdom's capital. Crowley and his Northgate Rebels were released from &lt;a href=\"Stoneward%20Prison\"&gt;Stoneward Prison&lt;/a&gt; by Greymane's edict and quickly agreed to give aid to King Genn, who had ordered the evacuation of Gilneas City to &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;. In order to divert the worgen's attention from the fleeing citizens, Crowley led a group of Gilneans to stand against them at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Crowley and his followers were overwhelmed and became worgen themselves.\nOnly with the aid of a night elf priestess &lt;a href=\"Belysra\"&gt;Belysra&lt;/a&gt;, a secret counselor of Greymane, were the cursed Gilneans shown a way to retain control of their human minds once transformed into worgen. &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Many&lt;/a&gt;, however, remained feral and under the sway of &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;, an ally of Sylvanas, until his death at Tal'doren.\nFinding a short-lived refuge in Duskhaven, &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;, Greymane's court alchemist, managed to restore temporary sanity to a number of captured feral worgen. The Gilneans' respite was to be short-lived, as the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; destroyed some of the jagged reefs that protected Gilneas from sea and breached the famed &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; itself, allowing the Forsaken to pour into Gilneas by land from Silverpine as well as land at &lt;a href=\"Duskmist%20Shore\"&gt;Duskmist Shore&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Forsaken invasion&lt;/a&gt; progressed, the whole south-west of Gilneas began collapsing into the sea, destroying Duskhaven. Gilnean survivors fled to abandoned &lt;a href=\"Stormglen%20Village\"&gt;Stormglen Village&lt;/a&gt; as Greymane and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Tal'doren to ask Darius Crowley and other worgen healed by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; to help unite Gilneas against the Forsaken. Due to Lord Godfrey's tyrannical command, Crowley was hesitant to accept. Greymane told Crowley that he is asking him as a friend and not as a king, and after revealing that he too had succumbed to the worgen curse, they agreed to join forces. Though the Gilneans, worgen and human alike, led a valiant attempt at driving off the Forsaken by reclaiming occupied Gilneas City, Horde reinforcements and the use of the Forsaken's &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; would soon overwhelm them. With his son &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt; killed by Sylvanas herself, Genn decided to seek sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, abandoning his beloved kingdom, but one day return to reclaim Gilneas.\nDriven by their curse and the threat of the Forsaken, Gilneas was finally driven back into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s fold, owing a great debt to the night elves who helped heal the minds of many who fell victim to the worgen curse. Lord Crowley and his loyal worgen; the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, have renewed the war against the Forsaken, advancing as far as northern &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of a &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20submarine\"&gt;gnomish submarine&lt;/a&gt; used to break the Horde's blockade of Gilneas, the elite &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded a vast Alliance offensive to reclaim all of Lordaeron from the Forsaken, starting with Gilneas The combined forces of the Alliance (including Gilnean and now-allied &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; worgen) quickly bested the Forsaken occupiers of Gilneas City, eventually pushing them past the Greymane Wall.\nHowever, the Horde managed to rally in Silverpine, holding back the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; and enabling the Forsaken to resurrect Lord Godfrey as one of their own, a fact that none of the Gilneans were aware of. Sylvanas' use of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect fallen humans as allies forced the Alliance to rely on soldiers of other races. Crowley later surrendered to Sylvanas after she took &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;his daughter&lt;/a&gt; hostage, threatening her with &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. This signaled an end to the Alliance offensive in Silverpine, although the Bloodfang Pack expanded their activities into the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, Lord Godfrey rebelled against Sylvanas and killed her (although she was quickly resurrected) and took over &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; as an independent power. Sylvanas returned to &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; to recover.\nAt some point, a &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hiram%20Creed\"&gt;Creed&lt;/a&gt; disguised as Lord Hiram Creed and his &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl&lt;/a&gt; forces took control of Gilneas.\nThen the Alliance was constantly under assault by the Horde as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; raged on.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter the defeat of Garrosh Hellscream in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; said that they would cleanse Gilneas and keep Sylvanas Windrunner at bay.\nLegion.\nGilneas participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. They are later responsible for the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt;, led by the King himself. Following this, the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; comes to blows with the Horde across the isles, battling with the &lt;a href=\"Queensguard\"&gt;Queensguard&lt;/a&gt; for control of the &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Tower\"&gt;Warden Tower&lt;/a&gt;s spread across the regions and leading the search for the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nBy the time of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom was referred to as fallen, with nothing but \"wind, sorrow and ruin\" in the land. When Genn arrived at &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; before the events of the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, he told Anduin that both kingdoms were now in ruins, with Gilneas being home to the Forsaken and Stromgarde being overrun with criminals, ogres, and trolls.\nWar of the Thorns.\nSylvanas is cited as hoping to use the ruined status of Gilneas as an inciter among the Alliance after &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; is captured. She erroneously attributes Genn Greymane's desire to reclaim his kingdom to cloud his judgment, causing a division within the Alliance between supporters who wished to reclaim Teldrassil and those who wished to reclaim Gilneas. Unbeknownst to Sylvanas, Greymane immediately claims that Teldrassil will need to be reclaimed first, with Gilneas coming after, as a gesture to repay the debt owed to the night elves by the Gilnean people.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGilneas participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt; also established a foothold once more on Fenris Isle after defeating &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Hayward\"&gt;Deathstalker Hayward&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the Forsaken needing to pull their forces out of position in order to evacuate across the Lake. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; is leading an offensive into Hillsbrad. The &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; has also sent aid to Gilneas, led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tobias%20Zaren\"&gt;Captain Tobias Zaren&lt;/a&gt; (who has replaced &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Zaren\"&gt;Pietro Zaren&lt;/a&gt;), surrounding &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which is in the hands of Forsaken Apothecaries attempting to unleash a new bio-weapon upon the Gilneans to the south under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Plaguebringer%20Harris\"&gt;Chief Plaguebringer Harris&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde also moves towards the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and attempts to take control of the city of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent the Alliance to obtain full control over the Eastern Kingdoms, and also to use Stromgarde as &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;a launching point&lt;/a&gt; to attack the restored Gilneas.\nAfter Stormwind refused to send aid to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, due to their forces being spread too thin, Gilneas opted instead to aid the Kaldorei. King Greymane sent a large force, led by &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and Princess &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; to aid their allies on their warfront; as well as to show the Alliance had not abandoned the night elves. He stated this was to repay the elves for everything they had done for Gilneas.\nPeople and culture.\nGilneas' &lt;a href=\"Team%20color\"&gt;national color&lt;/a&gt; is black. A person from Gilneas is referred to as Gilnean. Founded centuries ago, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; spread its faith in Gilneas, the citizens of the kingdom thus becoming followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, as indicated by the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; with its priesthood and clergy at the center of Gilneas City, and the graves with the symbol of the church at the &lt;a href=\"Aderic%27s%20Repose\"&gt;Aderic's Repose&lt;/a&gt;. Though some formerly reclusive ruralists practice a form of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism known as the \"old ways\" such people were known as &lt;a href=\"harvest-witch\"&gt;harvest-witch&lt;/a&gt;es by the majority of the population.\nFree from outside influence, the kingdom of Gilneas had relied only on the indomitable spirit and tenacity of its citizens to make its own destiny in the world. Gilneans have a culture of self-reliance. They are proud, stubborn, and loathe to accept the aid of outsiders. Of late, however, a series of events that occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; has shaken Gilneas to its core. Recognizing the evil and chaos that had taken over the world, the Gilneans have begun to acknowledge that they serve an important role in safeguarding the sanctity of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and in doing so, have embraced the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; cause of fighting for a just and peaceful world. Now, these self-disciplined worgen and tenacious humans have rejoined the Alliance as powerful allies, prepared to fight to keep their humanity and their place in society.\nLike the other realms, the Kingdom of Gilneas can apply the death penalty for its criminals, the task being accomplished by an &lt;a href=\"executioner\"&gt;executioner&lt;/a&gt;, including hanging and beheading, as gallows and guillotines were notably present in the courtyard of the &lt;a href=\"Stoneward%20Prison\"&gt;Stoneward Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is tradition that a small memento be buried on top of a Gilnean's graveyard, beneath the shallow earth. &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; and roses appear to be common symbols of Gilneas. Several roses and a wolf skull adorn the nation's coat-of-arms, and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Thorn\"&gt;Lieutenant Thorn&lt;/a&gt; describes her Gilnean patriotism by stating that her blood \"runs rose red\".\nBefore the Cataclysm, Gilneas was known for its unique atmosphere. The nation's distinctive character was epitomized both by the inhabitants' style of dress and by the cobblestoned streets and foreboding architecture of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, which were unlike anywhere else in the world.\nGilneas in Warcraft.\nWarcraft II.\nLeader: \"&lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;\"\nNation Color: \"Black\"\nBackground: \"Despite the impending Orcish invasion, Gilneas has remained separate from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As ruler of one of the strongest &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; nations, Genn Greymane is convinced that his own armies can deal with any threat, and has therefore remained unmoved by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lord Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s pleas for unity. Despite this apparent disdain for the Alliance, the denizens of Gilneas harbor no fondness for the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s or their allies and are prepared to meet them blade for blade.\"\nDespite being described as a faction in the , Gilneas was never actually seen fighting in the game.\nWarcraft III.\nIn the \"\" &lt;a href=\"The%20Invasion%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Orc Campaign: The Invasion of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cry%20of%20the%20Warsong\"&gt;Chapter Three: Cry of the Warsong&lt;/a&gt;, one of the human factions you face has the force name &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, implying that people from Gilneas traveled to Kalimdor with Jaina. It was later revealed that they were sent by &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Crowley&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, in the south of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, has been in the game since release, but &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; itself remained a closed &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;. With the \"\" expansion, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; was finally opened to players as the heavily-phased level 1-12 &lt;a href=\"starting%20area\"&gt;starting area&lt;/a&gt; of the new playable &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; race. Players enter the story as a human. The level 1-5 quests take place a year before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and will teach them how the worgen curse came to be, how the humans of Gilneas came to be affected by it and lastly with the player him/herself being infected with the worgen curse. After a cutscene, players will be in worgen form and the game time skips to just before the Cataclysm. For the remainder of the starting experience, players will experience the dual threats of the effects of the Shattering upon Gilneas and the Forsaken siege. An offer of aid from a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic sect brings Gilneas into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a counterpart to the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-allied &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;. In-game, Gilneas appears to be a dreary and rainy territory, reflecting the cursed nation itself. The Greymane Wall received a graphical update to match the new style of Gilneas (a regency style).\nIt must also be mentioned that, much like when &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in \"\", the peninsula of Gilneas has a considerably different landmass than it does on pre-\"Cataclysm\" maps, which appeared as a small, thin peninsula roughly the same size and shape as Silverpine Forest to the north. After \"Cataclysm\", the Gilnean peninsula appears slightly shorter but significantly wider (even accounting for the land that sinks into the ocean during the worgen starting experience).\nGenn Greymane is still alive, being among the first NPCs encountered by &lt;a href=\"worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen players&lt;/a&gt;. After the player's transformation into a worgen, Greymane is seen advising Krennan to give the player a treatment for the worgen curse.\nOutside the battleground, Horde players are sent into a phased version of Gilneas from quests in Silverpine to stop the worgen and fortify their hold on the kingdom; an effort that ends up failing and players witness Gilneas' reclamation by the Alliance (thus setting the basis of the Battle for Gilneas). One of the new battlegrounds in Cataclysm, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, and features the ongoing siege of Gilneas by the Forsaken following the Silverpine quest chain and the eradication of all Forsaken land bases by the Alliance in Gilneas.\nThe unphased version of Gilneas, &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Ruins of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, is devoid of any life except for a few critters.\nPost-Cataclysm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; curse that started from Shadowfang Keep and swept across Gilneas left its people irrevocably transformed. Almost the entire human population has been turned to the beastly &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, a humbling failure for Genn Greymane in his efforts to keep his people safe. The reaction of the people to this change will likely be greatly varied and has yet to be revealed. Preliminary dialogue from \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" has revealed that Gilnean mages and healers went to great strides to fight the affliction.\nGilneas has undergone deep changes in the wake of its cursing, and while the people maintain their free will, the impact of the curse remains to be seen.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Thyala\"&gt;Dark Ranger Thyala&lt;/a&gt;, have begun the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuture of Gilneas.\nAt &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; 2011, during the World of Warcraft: Lore and Story Q&amp;A, in response to a question from &lt;a href=\"Red%20Shirt%20Guy\"&gt;Red Shirt Guy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; stated the following in regards to the future of Gilneas:\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20Shirt%20Guy\"&gt;Red Shirt Guy&lt;/a&gt;: In Gilneas, the questlines end with the strong feeling of to be continued and that we're going back, and the only other zone in the game that had that same type of ending was Hyjal, and we did go back to Hyjal two patches later, so does that mean we're also going back to Gilneas?\n&lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt;: Two patches later, maybe? ...Maybe, back to Gilneas? I don't know. You know, the- the, uh, Gilneans have such cool architecture and such a cool vibe to it, and it's really hard just because of the nature of their story, we can't really incorporate that outside in the rest of the world, it's hard to do. So it'd be fun to go back to Gilneas and really kind of reclaim that. I don't think it's on the cards right away, but its a really, we just love the feel of that area and everything that they're about.\nIt is later that after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s would speak to &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; about the future of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. He said that they would cleanse Gilneas and keep &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; at bay.\nThe Gilneas area is still plagued but pockets of safety exist.\nBy \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", the kingdom appears to have been restored enough to the capacity that it requires Stromgarde to be taken by the Horde before they can assault it. In addition, several forces have seemingly already mobilized from Gilneas, such as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;, whom claim Fenris Isle again, and &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, who leads an assault into Hillsbrad. On the other hand, King Rastakhan refers to Greymane as \"an exile without a homeland\" as an insult, implying that Gilneas is still mostly in ruins.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Lord Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, a brawny &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; who may be in his seventies, has ruled Gilneas for decades. Greymane never supported the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and argued against its existence from beginning to end. In his own words, he despised the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the Alliance stating that the last thing Gilneas needed was sponges from other nations drawing from their resources, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s meddling with their affairs, and someone else's enemies killing their own soldiers. Gilneas was its own nation and it would always be.\nHistory.\nGilneas joined the Alliance in the Second War, but offered only token support, refusing to send more and resolving to confront the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s on their own. After the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Genn and his people constructed the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; effectively separating the peninsula from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, not allowing anyone in or out. None knows what has been transpiring there ever since.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s from the north camped at Greymane Wall, pleading to be let inside. The gates remained closed, and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; patrols slaughtered them. Perhaps something dire has befallen Gilneas. Rumors of what was transpiring there became the subject of rumors throughout the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; - the renowned explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; theorized that the nation had fallen to the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; as one such example.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, seeking allies to help drive the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; from Lordaeron, intended to send a diplomatic party to Gilneas. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s to ferry the diplomats and summoned &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s as escorts. Yet no one knew what to expect in Gilneas, so Magni also hired a few trusted mercenaries to accompany his ambassadors.\nPeople and culture.\nLike their leader, Gilneans are burly and gruff. Extremely isolationist, they supported the Greymane Wall's construction. They are probably still beyond the wall, farming, hunting and otherwise supporting their nation. They speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, and have their faith in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Hearthstone.\nGilneas is the setting of the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". In this scenario, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; was apparently restored, the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt; was twisted by &lt;a href=\"Hagatha%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Hagatha the Witch&lt;/a&gt; into the Witchwood, &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Prince Liam&lt;/a&gt; returned as a ghost, the &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl&lt;/a&gt; joined the Alliance, and &lt;a href=\"Houndmaster%20Shaw\"&gt;Gilnean citizens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20in%20White\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; engaged in hunting corrupted monsters such as &lt;a href=\"Splintergraft\"&gt;treants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shudderwock\"&gt;aberrations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Face%20Collector\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;.\nFilm universe.\nGilneas participated in the council that would eventually lead to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;."}

Word reaches the Gilneas Brigade of Sylvanas' intentions to sail for Stormheim, which causes King Greymane to become an attache to a &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; deployment upon the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLorna fought alongside King Greymane on the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" as they assaulted Sylvanas' fleet and brought Alliance reinforcements to the Broken Isles. At Stormheim, Lorna would lead Gilneas Brigade scouts and aid Greymane's mercenaries in undergoing the various ancient trials necessary to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Gilneas Brigade uncovers that the Forsaken means to plague Greywatch like they did Gilneas. Greymane commands his forces to destroy the plague caches and the invading Forsaken apothecary to secure Greywatch and later sends Lorna to uncover what Sylvanas seeks in &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt;. As Lorna discovers that Sylvanas means to create more &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; by subjugating &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;, Genn musters the Alliance fleet in trying to assault &lt;a href=\"Dreadwake%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Dreadwake's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. The battle at &lt;a href=\"Greymane%27s%20Offensive\"&gt;Greymane's Offensive&lt;/a&gt; goes poorly and his offensive is repelled.

It was a dark and foreboding place of narrow cobblestone streets and crowded, Gothic houses, divided into four districts, centered around the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the city was struck by a &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; assault and, later, a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; invasion. After its abandonment by the Gilneans, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; initially managed to retake the city, although it was ultimately left ruined and abandoned.\nHistory.\nInvasion of Gilneas.\nIn dissatisfaction about the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; started a &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; that quickly spread trough the kingdom. Soon, his &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebels\"&gt;Northgate Rebels&lt;/a&gt; marched onto the city itself. The final battle erupted when Crowley's men marched upon the city, setting it ablaze with cannon fire. Yet Crowley's coup d'etat eventually failed and he, as well as the other leaders of the rebellion, were imprisoned for treason. Following Crowley's capture, the rebels went into hiding. The rebels had stashed weapons throughout Gilneas, including a large cache in the city. Though the Northgate Rebels had enough firepower to take out half of Gilneas City, with Crowley's imprisonment, the rebellion came to an end and the weapon caches never saw use until a new threat arose.\nNot long after calm had returned to the city, the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; began terrorizing the forests of Gilneas. Not wanting to scare his people following the end of the civil war and the fragile state Gilneas found itself in, Greymane and several other nobles began hunting down and killing these wolf men. The worgen lurked throughout Gilneas for years, isolating the Gilnean harbor towns from support from the rest of the kingdom. Eventually the worgen amassed and assaulted Gilneas City in a massive invasion. Unable to withstand the invasion alone, the Gilnean people reunited at last. Darius Crowley and his Northgate Rebels were freed from prison under Greymane's orders; the two forces combining to combat their common foe. In the end, Crowley, several volunteers, and a majority of the Northgate Rebels had opted to make one final stand against the worgen within &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; as the Gilnean civilians evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, the Gilnean forces under the command of &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam Greymane&lt;/a&gt; fought their way through Gilneas City, destroying Forsaken forces positioned there. Soon they were attacked by a large number of &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, however, the villagers of Emberstone brought powder cannons that helped in defeating them. After Liam's forces met and united with &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Crowley's&lt;/a&gt; worgen forces around &lt;a href=\"Stoneward%20Prison\"&gt;Stoneward Prison&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken unleashed upon the Gilneans one of their most powerful creations - the &lt;a href=\"flesh%20beast\"&gt;flesh beast&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Gorerot\"&gt;Gorerot&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Gilneans took control of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20catapult\"&gt;Forsaken catapult&lt;/a&gt;s and used them to take down Gorerot quickly. Soon Liam and Crowley caught Sylvanas herself at the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Court\"&gt;Greymane Court&lt;/a&gt;, while his father came and attacked from the other side. As the tide was turning against Sylvanas, she used her dark powers to stun every one in the immediate area and aimed a poisoned arrow at Genn Greymane. Liam jumped in front of the bowshot, saving his father from certain doom. As Sylvanas fled the scene, Liam died with the knowledge that the city had been freed from Forsaken control.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Gilneans were forced to abandon the city and escape to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; claimed the city for their own. However, with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was able to retake the city. During this moment of time, the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Quarter\"&gt;Cathedral Quarter&lt;/a&gt; in front of the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; was filled with &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Submariner\"&gt;7th Legion Submariner&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Master%20Sergeant%20Pietro%20Zaren\"&gt;Master Sergeant Pietro Zaren&lt;/a&gt;. The 7th Legion placed a &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Telescope\"&gt;telescope&lt;/a&gt; near the water to spy on the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Forward%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken Forward Command&lt;/a&gt;. The city itself was covered in burning debris from attacks during the several battles taken place here, and the &lt;a href=\"Stoneward%20Prison\"&gt;Stoneward Prison&lt;/a&gt; courtyard still held the remains of the &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; creation lab from its initial capture. After the Silverpine quest chain is completed, Gilneas City remains in Alliance hands; the Forsaken did not push forward into Gilneas following Godfrey's betrayal, as Sylvanas was too weak to lead after being resurrected.\nAt the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; battles between the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; surrendered the city to the Forsaken in order to save his daughter Lorna. Darius, his daugher, and the remaining Gilneans fled toward Gilneas and escaped.\nIt was later revealed that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hiram%20Creed\"&gt;Lord Hiram Creed&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl&lt;/a&gt;, rules over most of the Gilneans in the area. In reality, Creed was a &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; disguised as a Gilnean nobleman. He and his Blackhowl servants occupied much of Gilneas City, having taken out several Forsaken assassination attempts on him. He had apparently used his own draconic blood to further the Blackhowl's obedience and skills. It is likely that the Blackhowl had been working with the Alliance, albeit possibly with the intention to betray them later on as no one had known of Creed's true form within the Alliance ranks. With his assassination, it is unknown what becomes of the Blackhowl group. It's likely they simply continued to live with their Gilnean brethren of the Alliance without draconic manipulation, assuming they were even aware of it to begin with.\nIt has since become abandoned and was left ruined.\nAfter the Fourth War, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the city remains isolated.\nAreas.\nGilneas City is arranged in a few areas:"}

It was formed following the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and is made up of &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; soldiers who chose to remain behind after the evacuation of most of Gilneas's citizenry.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, the front's main objective is to defend &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; from the Forsaken and their &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; allies, and also to take back &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. In this effort, they have since enlisted the aid of several other like-minded groups, including the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Worgen\"&gt;Hillsbrad humans&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nThe origins of the Gilneas Liberation Front can be traced back to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. The upheaval caused by the Cataclysm would shatter the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; and, coupled with the new outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;, saw the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; descend into chaos. The subsequent attack by the Forsaken overwhelmed Gilneas's defenders and caused most of the population to evacuate the peninsula. Those who remained behind, under &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, remained determined to hold what was left of their kingdom against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nSilverpine campaign.\nThough they secured major gains during the opening stages of their invasion, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; army eventually began to meet serious resistance in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. In their new quest to drive the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; from their lands, the Gilneas Liberation Front expertly mobilized its forces in a large campaign. Silverpine Forest would become a central battlefield, as the Gilneas Liberation Front began taking control of nearby farmholds and causing havoc amongst the Forsaken roads and supply lines.\n&lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; soon made an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;, a faction made up of the remaining &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of Silverpine following the Forsaken crusade against them. These devastating new allies outmatched the Forsaken, making use of unorthodox guerrilla warfare tactics and devious traps to great effect. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her troops were taken off-guard by these strategies, which had never before been adopted by Alliance forces in such a way.\nAt this point, the Gilneas Liberation Front had cut off the Forsaken armies in Gilneas itself from their main force in Silverpine, allowing them to decimate the surrounded undead. Despite the setbacks, the Forsaken in Silverpine slowly but surely carved through the opposition (which became bolstered by newly-turned worgen from &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;) as they attempted to reach their stranded troops in Gilneas. Before the Forsaken arrived in the southern reaches of Silverpine Forest, the Gilneas Liberation Front were able to seize &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; as a defensive position. Sylvanas's forces were subsequently able to retake the village in their advance, though at cost and in the face of fierce resistance.\nThe Gilneas Liberation Front had failed to prevent the two Forsaken fronts from reuniting, but they now unleashed another advantage on their opponents. A detachment of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Gilneas harbor with the intention of bolstering the worgen offensive. Having amassed their forces, the Gilneas Liberation Front and their allies launched a withering attack on the weakened Forsaken stationed on the Gilnean side of the Greymane Wall. Though the assault was resisted with determination, the undead garrison was completely overwhelmed. While some managed to escape back through the Greymane Wall, those who did not were slaughtered. All occupying forces had now been fully driven from the peninsula and back into Silverpine Forest.\nAlthough the tables had now tipped in the Gilneas Liberation Front's favor, the newly-raised Gilnean traitors (now Forsaken) in the forms of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Baron Ashbury&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Walden\"&gt;Lord Walden&lt;/a&gt; changed the playing field. The worgen and 7th Legion pressed their advantage by pushing past the Greymane Wall, once again occupying Pyrewood Village. Under Lord Godfrey's leadership, however, the Forsaken now waged a truly ruthless campaign, going as far as to burn Pyrewood once it had been lost. Further undead successes began to cripple the Gilneas Liberation Front's support base, while the capture of Gilnean Commander &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; proved a major blow.\nThe battlefront.\nWith the Forsaken ejected from Gilneas proper, the Gilneas Liberation Front, &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; and Hillsbrad worgen, and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; continued their advance by marching further into southern &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. There, they came head-to-head with the Forsaken army, which was now itself reinforced with newly reanimated &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; marines arrived by sea. The ensuing battle proceeded with heavy casualties on both sides.\nA breaking point would eventually come when &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; used Lorna Crowley as a bargaining chip. Lorna was not herself a worgen, and could thus be raised as undead. Unless Sylvanas's ultimatum was accepted and the Alliance pulled out of Silverpine, she threatened coldly to make the girl one of the Forsaken. Unable to watch this fate befall his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; ordered the retreat and surrendered &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; to the Forsaken. Darius, Lorna, and the remaining Gilneans fled towards Gilneas and escaped, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt; in the contested areas of Gilneas. \nFollowing this, the Gilneas Liberation Front is not seen again. Given its leadership is later seen in the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, it may have been reformed as the latter."}

He was a deckhand on a moonshine transport between &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The ship was sunk by &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; zealots and Firebough, the only survivor, was captured and imprisoned in a tower at Northwatch Hold. He is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thalo%27dan%20Privateers\"&gt;Thalo'dan Privateers&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Free%20From%20the%20Hold\"&gt;Free From the Hold&lt;/a&gt; \nHe was towards the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, although once the escort quest was started he became to the Alliance\u2014thus allowing Alliance players to attack and kill him.\nCataclysm.\nThough commonly believed to be missing as of \"\", Gilthares was still very much present in Northwatch. The tower that once housed him had been damaged in-game, and due to there being no damaged &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt; models, the model had been swapped to that of a damaged &lt;a href=\"scout%20tower\"&gt;scout tower&lt;/a&gt;. This caused various issues with his placement, causing him to appear on the floor under the tower. Gilthares could be tracked by hunters/druids using &lt;a href=\"Track%20Humanoids\"&gt;Track Humanoids&lt;/a&gt;, as well as targeted by typing/target Gilthares. He serves no purpose and the quest he once offered has been removed, his presence may have just been an oversight when developers were remodeling Northwatch.\nThis has since been fixed and is seen sitting in the tower.\nRace.\nIt is interesting to note that, though apparently a &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; and not a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, he wore an abundance of red, which is a practice usually avoided by high elves. The reason for this may have been because he is not a part of the Alliance, and therefore not afraid of wearing red clothes. He also expressed open hostility to the Alliance due to his enslavement.\nPrior to \"\", blood elven and high elven NPCs were distinguished by two different models, Gilthares used that of the blood elven model. However with the expansion, his model was updated but used the high elven skin rather than the blood elven one. It is possibly an over sight by the developers (as in the case of &lt;a href=\"Astromancer%20Darnarian\"&gt;Astromancer Darnarian&lt;/a&gt;), although the same model is now used by &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei%20Wraith\"&gt;Quel'dorei Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s, which are high elf ghosts in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Given that the leader of his organization is a high elf as well and that his clothing could have just been intended to be red, Gilthares is likely a high elf."}

When Rhonin left to find his wife the twins were presumably in the care of &lt;a href=\"Jalia\"&gt;Jalia&lt;/a&gt;, who was like a grandmother and second mother to them.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;present&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;dangers&lt;/a&gt; were defeated, Giramar, along with his family, witnessed the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of Rhonin and Jaina's appointment to lead the Kirin Tor, Giramar, his brother, and mother were present during the funeral service held in honor of the Kirin Tor's former leader.\nIt was thinking of Giramar and his brother that prevented Vereesa from going through her initial plan of poisoning &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; and joining &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;her sister&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa, who hadn't spent as much time with her boys in recent years due to &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;events&lt;/a&gt;, left the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; and returned to Dalaran, vowing to never forsake her boys again. Honoring her promise Vereesa spent time with her children by playing with Dalaran fountain with them.\nWhen Vereesa was going to meet with her sisters Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;, Giramar and Galadin expressed interest in the thought of being together as a family. However, Galadin began to argue with Giramar, accusing Sylvanas of being evil and now leading the people who killed their father. Giramar argued that you should not call other people evil or else they will show you how evil they can be. Vereesa broke up the fighting by reminding the twins that they were brothers and had to be each others' best ally.\nSpeculation.\nSince the twins were born some time after the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, they are around 15 - 17 years old in ."}

Every second it will attempt to give party and raid members a 6 second buff (Lightwell Renew) that heals for a notable amount while the buff is active. \nIt is an exclusive choice node with &lt;a href=\"Lightweaver\"&gt;Lightweaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%205.4.0\"&gt;patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, Lightwell did not heal targets automatically but instead required players to click on the well in order to receive healing. This functionality engendered a significant amount of complaints from priests and non-priests alike, although some argued that the greatest factor in the failure of Lightwell as a useful healing tool lay in the lack of education of the playerbase. Over time &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; granted progressive buffs to Lightwell, but the spell failed to receive whole-hearted acceptance by most players due to the requirement for their own active interaction, preferring to leave the healing to the healers. \n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; introduced &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Lightspring\"&gt;Glyph of Lightspring&lt;/a&gt;, providing priests with an alternative functionality for the well. Apparently this alternative was well-received, as with Patch 5.4.0 the new design was adopted as the default functionality of Lightwell."}

Initially rejecting life as part of the Forsaken, she began a single-minded campaign against the Crusade.\nThe adventurer assists in killing her father and she later enlisted their aid after she had infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Hooded%20Crusader\"&gt;Hooded Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Anointed\"&gt;Blades of the Anointed&lt;/a&gt; to permanently destroy &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Whitemane\"&gt;High Inquisitor Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;.

Surviving the experience, she is later seen hunting necromancers again during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Lilian joined the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. After aiding in the Legion's downfall, she observed that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was raising more Forsaken and felt that she should help the newly raised adapt to their situation and avoid the pain she had to go through. She is a major character in the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Horde War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, where she serves as a mentor to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Amalia%20Stone\"&gt;Captain Amalia Stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tidesage\"&gt;Tidesage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Lilian would finally begin to accept her place in Forsaken society, stepping up as representative of the Forsaken on the Horde Council following Sylvanas abandoning her position as their Queen. After the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, she assisted in reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately joined with &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; to create a reformed Desolate Council.\nBiography.\nLife.\nLilian was raised by her father &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Voss\"&gt;High Priest Voss&lt;/a&gt; to be a weapon against the plagued undead as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, giving up her childhood. She studied stealth, sorcery, martial arts, and anything else that would make herself stronger.\nCataclysm.\nLilian would grow up into a young woman, and was friends with &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Lieutenant%20Gebler\"&gt;Scarlet Lieutenant Gebler&lt;/a&gt;. After she died, her corpse ended up at the &lt;a href=\"Deathknell%20Graves\"&gt;Deathknell Graves&lt;/a&gt; and Lilian was raised as an undead by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. When Forsaken adventurers approached her to recruit her into the Forsaken's ranks, she ran away in denial of her undeath, claiming that her father would protect her. She was later found by &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Elreth\"&gt;Novice Elreth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt;. To show her what she really was and encourage her to join the Forsaken, Novice Elreth gave the Forsaken adventurer a hand mirror. When Lilian saw her own face in the mirror she ran away, again calling for her father and denying her life as an undead.\nShortly thereafter, she was captured by the Scarlet Crusade and imprisoned. She was informed by Gebler that her father had disowned her and had ordered him to carry out Lilian's immediate execution. Enraged by this, Lilian passed through the bars of her cage, ignited herself in purple flames, and instantly killed her former comrade.\nSome time later, &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Derrington\"&gt;High Executor Derrington&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt; was approached by Lilian swearing enmity against the Crusade, so he directed her to the north. Dozens of Scarlet Crusaders were found that had been killed in the same fashion at the &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Outpost\"&gt;Crusader Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Encampment\"&gt;Scarlet Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. Lilian was again encountered by a Horde adventurer and escorted to her father. Lilian grabbed Benedictus and climbed up the walls of the towers, strangling and killing him in the process, before escaping again.\nDerrington later received reports of Scarlet Crusade activity at a small camp east of &lt;a href=\"Felstone%20Field\"&gt;Felstone Field&lt;/a&gt;, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Outpost\"&gt;Charred Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. He sent Horde adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to inspect the camp. Upon reaching the camp, all the Crusaders are found dead and engulfed in purple flames, implying that Lilian had passed through the area.\nMists of Pandaria.\nFor a long time, she seemed to have tried to find her place in the world, working with the Alliance and Horde alike to destroy the Scarlet Crusade.\nLilian appeared again in revamped &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; instances as a &lt;a href=\"Hooded%20Crusader\"&gt;Hooded Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, directing adventurers to clear up any rebuilding Scarlet forces inside the Monastery and to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Anointed\"&gt;Blades of the Anointed&lt;/a&gt;, the only weapon that is able to permanently kill &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Whitemane\"&gt;High Inquisitor Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;. After the deed was done, Lilian finally revealed herself and took the blades, venturing to eradicate the Scourge remnant in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;.\nTurning her wrath against the Scourge necromancers, Lilian fought her way through Gandling's domain, only to be subdued by the darkmaster himself. Now turned against her allies, she had to be freed from the necromancer's control by defeating her in combat. After the Necromancer fled, Lilian begged the adventurers to leave her to die alone. However, she managed to survive the wounds she sustained during the battle and is still active in the world somewhere.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nLilian appears in &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, enlisting adventurers to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Soulsever%20Blade\"&gt;Soulsever Blade&lt;/a&gt; from the necromancers in to fight against the undead on Draenor.\nLegion.\nLilian has moved to the Halls of Shadow in Dalaran. She sits on a flight of stairs reading a book. When &lt;a href=\"The%20Uncrowned\"&gt;The Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; received word of a large cave at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was plotting against the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, Lilian and &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Admiral%20Tethys\"&gt;Fleet Admiral Tethys&lt;/a&gt; formulated a plan to stop them. With &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-infused gun powder taken from the &lt;a href=\"Blacksail%20Crew\"&gt;Blacksail Crew&lt;/a&gt;, Lilian and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadowblade&lt;/a&gt; sneaked their way into the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Temple\"&gt;Lost Temple&lt;/a&gt; and blew the cave up.\nLilian discovered that the Legion was using &lt;a href=\"Homunculus\"&gt;homunculi&lt;/a&gt;, a type of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; construct so lifelike that even she couldn't identify them, to infiltrate cities since the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s made demon incursions impossible. She dispatched the Shadowblade to go after them.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nNow part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Lilian explains that her services were \"requested\", not unlike &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, another member of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;, who said that she was \"conscripted\" and had to fake her loyalty to the Horde for her own safety. While she still served the Uncrowned, she also recognized that Sylvanas was going to raise more Forsaken, and saw the opportunity to help the new Forsaken adapt to their situation, sparing them the suffering she herself experienced. She has also come to blame the human kingdoms for fostering malice against her kind by shunning their undead brothers and sisters, and believes it is time for the cycle of hatred to end and that the Alliance deserves to fall.\nLilian attacked the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Bridgeport\"&gt;Bridgeport&lt;/a&gt; to slay &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Amalia%20Stone\"&gt;Captain Amalia Stone&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve her corpse. Once Captain Stone was raised Lilian helped her adapt to undeath, and then she and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; had Stone lead them to the highest-ranking Kul Tiran soldier at &lt;a href=\"Barrowknoll%20Cemetery\"&gt;Barrowknoll Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, which turned out to be &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20M.%20Valentine\"&gt;Marshal M. Valentine&lt;/a&gt;. But Valentine's grave was empty because he had died at sea in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, so Lilian and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; sought out a dying &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; who could find Valentine for them, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;.\nZelling was dying of an illness but was interested in becoming undead so that if he helped the Horde they would protect his wife and children, despite Lilian's best attempts to talk him out of it. Relenting, Rexxar and Lilian agreed to keep Zelling's family safe and then Lilian called a &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to raise him. She watched as his family rejected him as a monster, and then she accepted him into the Horde. Alongside Zelling, Lilian joined the expedition to recover Valentine's body, during which the Horde also found the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of Vengeance.\nKeeping to her promise to Zelling, Lilian ensured that his wife and children found a home at &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; and were well fed.\nAfter Sylvanas raised Derek as a Forsaken, Lilian was not surprised, unlike most of the people aboard the \"Banshee's Wail\" who were horrified. She knew that Sylvanas only saw them as arrows in her quiver, and said that this changed nothing for Lilian, nor for what she needed to do. When &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and Zelling was killed for their parts in freeing Derek from Horde captivity, Lilian vowed to keep helping Zelling's family and, if they asked what became of him, to tell them he died a hero. Seeing how Sylvanas had been planning to deprive Derek of his free will, Lilian wondered if Sylvanas took any pride in what should have been the distinction between the Forsaken and Scourge.\nRise of Azshara.\nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries clashed with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s loyalists, which saw the conflict ending in Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. As the Horde united once more, Voss caught wind of rumors that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was going to meet with her brother &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze%20Village\"&gt;Seabreeze Village&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling that she has to atone with Derek, Voss requested for the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to spy on the meeting between the siblings and report to her anything of interest. It was there that the Speaker witnessed Jaina confirming that the war was over to her brother and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. After witnessing Jaina and Derek remark that &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; would benefit from Calia's guidance, the Speaker left to report to Voss. Once informed of the conversation, Voss remarked that she must act quickly.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nWith Sylvanas' defection, many of the Forsaken felt abandoned and came under suspicion from some members of the Horde. Voss felt that the Forsaken needed to regain their allies' trust, which they could only do by accepting themselves. To this end, she arranged a meeting with Calia and Derek at the &lt;a href=\"Calston%20Estate\"&gt;Calston Estate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, where she apologized for her role in Derek's rebirth and introduced the two to &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; dark rangers, who had likewise been abandoned by Sylvanas. Calia and Derek quickly offered to help the night elves. As they departed, Voss stated that the meeting had gone exactly as she had hoped and that she would speak to the Speaker again soon as there was more work to be done.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the Horde leadership forewent selecting a new warchief in favor of a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;council-style&lt;/a&gt; leadership, with Voss representing the Forsaken on the council. In a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;, Voss mentioned that while some Forsaken believed their home was with the Horde, there were still many who loved Sylvanas. When Geya'rah asked where Voss' own loyalties lay, she responded that they were with the Forsaken, since a caring hand could offer comfort through the trauma of being raised into undeath. However, Lilian stated that while she would speak on her people's behalf, she would not rule as there was another more suited to the task.\nDeclaring that peace with the Alliance had come at a price, Voss felt it was best to hope it was not paid in vain.\nShadows Rising.\nLilian, being considered as interim leader of the Forsaken, knew that the Forsaken couldn't remain in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; forever and believed that the ruins of Lordaeron could one day be reclaimed and their homes there restored. Despite the truce between the Horde and Alliance, Lilian and Calia knew that Alliance ships wouldn't be happy to see Horde flags at sea, though Calia was confident that Derek could intervene on their behalf if they were intercepted. Voss and Calia then attended a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting where &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; noticed that Calia appeared to be watching Voss's every move, as if she might be tested on it later. When Calia and Voss explained why they had been late to said meeting, Calia brought up her belief about Derek causing &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; to declare that &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; could do nothing for them as she blamed them for the death of her father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and objected to peace with Jaina. However, Voss was quick to remind her that she had to accept that Derek was one of the Forsaken and that the Forsaken were the Horde. Talanji was unmoved and declared that the Zandalari were Horde as well. The subsequent friction in the meeting forced Thrall to call the meeting adjourned.\nAfter an assassination attempt was made on Talanji, Voss joined with the rest of the council in empowering the young &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, still grieving the loss of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her. Upon learning that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council, another meeting was held. Voss voted in favor of Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; meeting with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; declaring that any chance to capture Sylvanas couldn't be wasted.\nDeath Rising.\nVoss alongside her &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;fellow council members&lt;/a&gt; convened atop of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; where they informed Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the abduction of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. They also learned from &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; that Jaina Proudmoore and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had also been abducted, and that an attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who neutralized her attackers. These champions were subsequently sent to unite with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the returning enemy.\nVoss reflected how the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; had taught her many lessons, such as those who could she trust and those she could not. Noting that Sylvanas's actions have proven that she doesn't care about &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s fate, Voss declared that they've endured too much to allow her betrayal to unravel what they have built. She then questioned if the champions thought her words harsh and reminded them that Windrunner had chosen her path and allies, as they all did. After admitting that she once sought vengeance and retribution, Voss admitted that now she cares that the Forsaken have a future, and stated that for that future the right leaders need to be in place. She then hints that she feels she isn't the right leader by stating that she will lend her voice to the council and speak for Forsaken only for a time.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;, the champions returned to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to inform the council about the events that occurred in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;dark powers&lt;/a&gt; that Sylvanas had allied with.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Lilian briefly traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; to attend Sylvanas' trial alongside Calia. \nSometime later she joined the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in mustering in the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as they sought to reclaim as much as they could of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. Voss, alongside other influential figures that had risen to prominence among the Forsaken, joined Calia in a meeting to determine their next course of action. While Voss wanted to directly focus on dealing with the plague in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, Belmont questioned what they should do about Calia, only for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; to declare that they should focus on the blight. She then turned to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; and questioned if he had more plague eaters, only for him to reveal to Calia and the others that he only had one left, and that while he could make more for them to be effective, they must be formulated to survive the plague. This in turn inspired Calia to point out that they might be able to turn to the plague-lords of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; for insight. When Faranell revealed that he required an undiluted sample of the plague from deep within its reaches, Calia vowed to acquire it for him, but both Faranell and Belmont were skeptical of her being able to acquire it and survive.\nCalia then called upon the light and with the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; by her side, she ventured into the plague and successfully acquired the plague sample, which greatly surprised Belmont. With the sample in their possession, Calia, Voss, the champion, and the plague eater went to Maldraxxus, where they met with &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;, who directed the group to meet with &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Deviser%20Marileth\"&gt;Plague Deviser Marileth&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt;. Though happy that Marileth decided to aid them, Voss was stunned when the Plague Deviser walked directly into the plague in the area, causing her to rush in, in order to provide him cover. As the plague eater was empowered, the blight turned into a living manifestation known as the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Blight\"&gt;Lordaeron Blight&lt;/a&gt;, which was quickly slain, and proved the plague eater could aid them in reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After these events, Voss admitted that she felt hope about their chances. With this accomplished, Voss and the others returned to Tirisfal Glades to deliver the plague eater to the apothecaries, where Calia informed Faranell of how the blight sample became a living manifestation, to which Faranell was quick to declare it ingenious, as it would be easier to kill.\nThis plan was ultimately successful as the plague manifested as an &lt;a href=\"Amalgam\"&gt;Amalgam&lt;/a&gt; and was slain, liberating the Ruins of Lordaeron from the plague. Following this, Voss declared that the Forsaken have many points of view and should be led by a council, not a single ruler, a motion accepted by the other Forsaken leaders. While Belmont had his reservations about having a Menethil on the council, Calia was quick to declare that she had no desire for a throne, that her place was amongst them, with a vow to serve all their people. Thus a new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; composed of Voss, Calia, Belmont, Faranell, and Velonara was created to lead the Forsaken. With the council's formation, Calia journeyed into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;Lordaeron Throne Room&lt;/a&gt; room where she reflected on the past and the tragedy of her family, of how she was all that remained of the Menethil line, before being comforted by Voss, who talked about how the Forsaken were their home. However, Calia questioned if the other Forsaken would truly ever accept her, to which Voss admitted that while it was a long road, they could use her help, which gave Calia the encouragement she needed to step forward.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nVoss, accompanied by Calia and Derek, was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken spoke with &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; during the reception. After they realized that &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt; had gone to the wedding in &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;her husband's&lt;/a&gt; stead, the three Forsaken exchanged uncomfortable glances, with Calia remarking that it was a pleasure to see the queen again.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Forsythe\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Forsythe&lt;/a&gt; seized control of &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; to use as a staging ground to strike against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Voss called upon Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their arrival, she sent them to aid &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt;, who was leading the defense of the southern wall of the Ruins of Lordaeron. She, alongside &lt;a href=\"Calia\"&gt;Calia&lt;/a&gt;, later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;, where they tasked the champion with killing &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Hawlsey\"&gt;Lieutenant Hawlsey&lt;/a&gt; and obtaining &lt;a href=\"Hawlsey%27s%20Armor\"&gt;their armor&lt;/a&gt; in order to spy on the crusade. When questioned about her feelings on the crusade, Voss admitted that it was both complicated and simple, for in life she was one of them and believed as they did. However, in death, she turned into the very thing they hated, that they were taught to hate. She further stated that blindly hating anything, living or dead, wasn't the answer, and what truly mattered was what they did. She then declared that the Forsaken were her family and that she would protect them as such.\nVoss also called for them to strike against &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Recruit\"&gt;Scarlet Recruit&lt;/a&gt;s in order to leave Fenris Isle standing on its own without fresh blood. With these tasks done, she sent them to spy upon the scarlet forces within Fenris. After the crusade's defenses on the isle were weakened, the Forsaken launched an all-out assault, where Voss and the champions fought side by side and killed Commander Forsythe. In the aftermath, Voss returned to the Ruins of Lordaeron, where she personally informed the champion that their courage and strength were inspirational to the Forsaken and alongside her fellow members of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; declared that they represented what it meant to be Forsaken.\nAbilities.\nAs a follower.\nLilian Voss is also a Subtlety Rogue &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers\"&gt;Class Hall champion&lt;/a&gt; with the following abilities:\nShe can also be assigned as a bodyguard:\nLilian Voss is also a Subtlety Rogue &lt;a href=\"War%20Campaign%20followers\"&gt;War Campaign champion&lt;/a&gt; with the following abilities:\nQuotes.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nGo away.\nLegion.\nFinally... my time to shine.

This is the reason Voss should be tanked in a corner, as players on fire should try to stick to the walls to leave as much room as possible for running around and positioning.\nAt around 50%, Gandling will stun Voss and start separating her soul from her body. Keep attacking Voss' body while it is possible! The less health she has in phase three, the easier that part of the fight will go. Well-geared groups (on either difficulty) can actually kill Voss before Gandling tears out her soul, skipping the next phases entirely.\nVoss' soul cannot be tanked normally\u2014she fixates on random players and chases them around the room. All other players should unload on the spirit, while the runner should trace the outside walls of the room to ensure maximum run distance.\nWhen Voss' soul runs out of health, Gandling will resurrect Lilian's body with whatever amount of health it had left before it was \"killed\". Quickly pop cooldowns once the tank has control and move all DPS back to her body to finish her off. The soul cannot be attacked, but it still has all its abilities, so it is imperative that it last for as little time as possible. The soul will continue fixating on players, so that player will have to DPS Voss' body on the run."}

Most &lt;a href=\"abilities\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; attacks require that you have line of sight to your target to &lt;a href=\"cast\"&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt; them, and will give a message when you don't, canceling the activation.\nWhen casting a &lt;a href=\"channeled\"&gt;channeled&lt;/a&gt; spell on an &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;ed enemy, when that enemy moves in such a way as to block your LOS at any point in that cast, it will cancel your spell. For example, if you are on the ground, and you begin casting &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; or any such spell on a &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; that is in an elevated shack, when that mob comes at you, he will cross behind pillars, most likely, and at that point your cast will be canceled. (For those that recognize the region, the islands in the southeast of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; have such shacks.) For channeled spells, however, the mob may not be attacked one second or another, or perhaps the effect that the spell gives (such as &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt;) may not &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt;, but the next &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; where there is no obstruction during that span, it will continue.\nObstructed LOS is often inconvenient, forcing the player to move to regain LOS before attacking an enemy or healing an ally. One can also intentionally obstruct LOS, e.g. by running around a corner, to force an enemy to move to a more advantageous location.\nLoS can also be exploited by players to &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt; difficult groups. The puller (usually the tank) should attack one mob, then quickly run behind an obstacle. This breaks the monster's LoS to their aggro target, causing them to follow the puller around the corner. It is imperative that no other characters draw aggro while the mobs are running - DPS should not attack and healers should not heal. As soon as they turn, they can be tanked at short range.
