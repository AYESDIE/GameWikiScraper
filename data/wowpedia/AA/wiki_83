She is a female &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; and leader to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and a servant of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;. \nAdventure Guide.\n\"Jedoga dreams of apocalypse. She is rumored to be one of the most fanatical adherents of the Twilight's Hammer. Under the guidance of the ruthless &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, she learned to twist her shamanic powers to serve the Old Gods. Not long ago, Jedoga journeyed into the bowels of Ahn'kahet to prepare for the glorious day when Yogg-Saron will arise and envelop the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in shadow.\"\nStrategy.\nThe boss is floating in the air, untargetable. At her feet, a slew of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Initiate\"&gt;minions&lt;/a&gt; will need to be AoE down. They have about 6700HP and die quickly. Once the last one goes down, the boss descends and the fight begins (you do, however, drop out of combat briefly). If your party is not standing near the middle of the platform, several caster elites will spawn and wipe your party quickly.\nWhen she descends, a slew of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Volunteer\"&gt;new minions&lt;/a&gt; appear, but do not attack (and are not attackable).\nThe boss is a tank and spank save for an AoE that will target a random party member. This is a very visible circle of lightning on the ground and can be cast on the tank. It does significant enough damage to warrant canceling any casts and moving immediately. She also does Cyclone Strike, which deals damage to players near her.\nEvery so often she will go immune and float back into the air. Then a random minion will become active and walk toward the center of the room. If the minion reaches the circle of light below the boss, they will \"sacrifice\" themselves and their health will be added to the bosses. The boss will gain a buff (Gift of the Herald) that increases damage by 200%. Therefore, burst down the minion as quickly as possible before it reaches the center.\nOnce the minion is sacrificed or killed, the boss lands and it's back to tank and spank. Boss phase and sacrifice phase repeat alternately until boss is killed.\nThe key to this fight is to kill the minion as quickly as possible. The minion is immune to stun, snare and other crowd control. When the sacrificing minion is selected, the white shield will disappear from it, and it will become targetable. All the party members including the tank and healer should use their highest dps &lt;a href=\"direct%20damage\"&gt;direct damage&lt;/a&gt; abilities to burn down that minion immediately. (You will not have enough time for &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s to work the full effect.)\nBoth the amount healed and the duration of the 200% damage buff seems to be dependent on how much health the minion has when it is sacrificed. Because of this, every bit of damage on the minion helps even if the minion is not killed outright by the time it is sacrificed. While enraged you can disarm her - this will help a lot. Also, the duration of buff is usually short. If the group fails to kill the minion before it is sacrificed (easily noticeable as the boss turns all red), the tank should run to the periphery of the room when boss is descending, then try to kite the boss. Other group members with taunt (including Hunters) can taunt the boss off the tank if it is getting close. Using this strategy it is possible that the boss would spend the whole duration of the buff chasing players without touching anyone.\nThat being said, a decently geared tank can easily soak the damage from the buff. However, her cyclone strike can and will one-shot melee dps'ers while under the buff. Thus, it is imperative that melee dps move out of range until the buff wears off.\nAlternative Strategy.\n\"Note: This no longer works after patch 3.08 - she will not pull to the entrance of the room after the set of mobs are killed\"\nThere is a work around for her enrage. The last set of mobs you pull to start this engagement. have the entire group run all the way back to the entrance of the room, then the tank will range pull them and run back to the group. Kill them as usual. She descends and starts the fight. Tank and spank like usual but you want the group to stay on the side that you cleared. Let her run back and forth, the sacrifice will take place and she will waste her buff running back and forth to you, so long as your group stays in the proper place the fight should go smooth.\nSpeculation.\nIt is possible that she is one of the original members of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, dating back to the days of their founder, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;."}

The guild had many world-first raid kills, and is attributed to helping shape \"EverQuest\" and the MMO genre in general towards extreme emphasis on &lt;a href=\"endgame\"&gt;endgame&lt;/a&gt; content. The guild was formerly run by &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Pardo\"&gt;Rob Pardo&lt;/a&gt;, a long-time Blizzard employee and developer on \"Diablo II\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\". He was invited to Irvine to the Blizzard campus but wasn't aware of what Blizzard was at the time. Pardo advised him to check the Blizzard jobs page the next day, where he found an offer for lead quest designer. The job required a degree in creative writing, which Kaplan possessed. He joined Blizzard and began working on \"World of Warcraft\" in May 2002 as one of the original two Quest Designers, the other being &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Nagle\"&gt;Pat Nagle&lt;/a&gt;. Kaplan briefly served as a playtester on \"Warcraft III\", which shipped in July the same year, before going back to working on WoW. In addition to designing quests, he also became one of the point people on &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; design after presenting his idea of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; placements in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; to the rest of the team.\nOn February 12, 2009, Jeff announced that he was leaving WoW to work on \"\". He is currently the game director of \"Overwatch\".\nIn an \"Ask Me Anything\"-style thread in the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch subreddit&lt;/a&gt; on March 13, 2017, Jeff revealed that he left WoW because he had been \"feeling very fatigued after 6.5 years of working on WoW\", while \"Titan\" presented a new challenge."}

A leader of the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Blade\"&gt;Searing Blade&lt;/a&gt; Cultists, Jergosh dwelled within &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, concocting a scheme dangerous enough that drew the attention of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; himself.

Jergosh, having survived his prior encounter with a group of adventurers in Ragefire Chasm, was sent with &lt;a href=\"Braelyn%20Firehand\"&gt;Braelyn Firehand&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.

He will cast &lt;a href=\"Immolate\"&gt;Immolate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Weakness\"&gt;Curse of Weakness&lt;/a&gt; throughout the fight, which are identical to the Warlock versions and equally strong. Immolate is a somewhat strong &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; spell, and Curse of Weakness will reduce the damage dealt by the target by 6.\nBe wary of the other Searing Blade Cultists around him. It is best to clear the area around him until only Jergosh and his close followers are left. Once that happens, take down Jergosh, and eliminate the cultists around him. Be careful of the curses he will apply, and his spells, which do slightly higher damage."}

He is known to all as Stormsong because of his affinity with the air and water. Ever since &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal and exile from the Horde, Jevan has remained loyal to the Horde and leads the Grimtotem who remain in Thunder Bluff.\nHistory.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nStormsong was a loyal servant of his tribe's elder, &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, for many years. Despite this, he also admired the High Chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, as a strong and honorable leader, even if he did not agree with Cairne's policies. When Magatha poisoned the blade of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the acting leader of the Horde, in the duel that resulted in Cairne's death, Stormsong felt that his mistress had betrayed what it meant to be a shaman.\nActing quickly and without notice, he managed to secret away a haft fragment of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Runespear\"&gt;Bloodhoof Runespear&lt;/a&gt;, which had been shattered in the duel. Thus it was, when he was sent by Magatha to lead a group of Grimtotem warriors to kill Cairne's son and heir, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt;, Stormsong separated from his group under false pretense and snuck to Baine's tent, warning him and his guards of Magatha's treachery. As such, he was the first person to refer to Baine as \"Chieftain\". After convincing Baine of the truth in his words along with the fragment as physical proof, Stormsong engineered Baine's escape from Bloodhoof Village, thus tipping off the other Grimtotems that he had turned against them. They escaped to &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, where with &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; they started planning their next options.\nStormsong aided Baine in rallying support for his eventual retaking of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; from Magatha and her loyalists. Acting as an undercover agent, he visited the goblin port of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; to hire skilled mercenaries, &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s, and explosives from its leader, &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;. He then conjured a false storm to cover the approach of the three &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s Gazlowe had provided to bring Baine's forces into the city. After Magatha's banishment, Jevan accompanied Baine as part of his retinue at a meeting with Garrosh on the border of &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. As a Grimtotem who condemned the evil his tribe's matriarch had committed, Stormsong remained in Thunder Bluff as part of Baine's trusted inner circle, becoming the leader of any other Grimtotems who chose to disassociate themselves from their treacherous brethren.\nReferences.\n "}

{"id": "21959", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21959", "title": "Jewelcrafting", "text": "Jewelcrafting is a &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; which was introduced in &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;. Players are able to make &lt;a href=\"ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necklace\"&gt;necklace&lt;/a&gt;s, and statues, as well as cut &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"socketed%20items\"&gt;socketed items&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Figurine\"&gt;Figurine&lt;/a&gt;s are jewelcrafter only items, and are a type of trinket that is Bind on Pickup. Special in are jewelcrafter only gems, which have stats bonuses that exceed the standard gems; they are varying cuts of dragon's eye and three jewelcrafter only gems may be equipped at one time.\nOriginally, those who had not purchased the expansion were able to use items created by Jewelcrafting, although only those with \"The Burning Crusade\" were able to learn the Jewelcrafting profession itself. Since , it has been available to all players.\nJewelcrafting also allows a player to obtain gems from mineral ores (copper, iron, mithril, etc.) via &lt;a href=\"Prospecting\"&gt;Prospecting&lt;/a&gt;. Five pieces of ore are used up each time Prospecting is cast and the type and level of the gems prospected is dependent on the type of ore used as reagents. \n&lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Glass\"&gt;Brilliant Glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Prism\"&gt;Icy Prism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Prism\"&gt;Fire Prism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart%20%28item%29\"&gt;Serpent's Heart (item)&lt;/a&gt; are jewelcrafting recipes which combine lesser gems and reagents and create rarer gems. \nFrom the official site.\n\"Jewelcrafters unlock the surprising power in precious stones, creating potent jewelry and trinkets. They craft rings, amulets, and other objects of known mystical power, but they also cut gems to fit in socketed items like weapons and pieces of armor, granting those pieces of equipment unique properties. A talented Jewelcrafter can count on a demand for their services in crafting special items, improving equipment, and shaping rare gems.\n\"Jewelcrafters accrue many of the gems they need for their art from mineral veins, so Jewelcrafters are often also familiar with the gathering profession Mining. Jewelcrafting requires a Jeweler's kit.\"\nStatues.\nStones can be crafted into statues which are a bind on pick up, jewelcrafter only items. They are one use items which can restore health.\nLow level gems.\nLow level gems are used as reagents in jewelcrafting recipes. These gems can not be cut, can not be socketed, nor do they have specific stats attributes.\nHigh level gems.\nHigh level gems are only found in ore nodes in Outland and Northrend and can only be prospected from ore mined from those continents. Each high level colored gem has a color type:red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple and can be cut to have specific attributes which boost stats. Uncut gems can be used in crafting recipes to make other pieces of jewelry, and cut gems are placed within sockets to customize stats bonuses. Items with colored (&lt;a href=\"Red%20Socket\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Socket\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Socket\"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;) gem sockets have an additional \"socket bonus\" that can be activated if cut gems of the appropriate color are placed in all its sockets. Red, orange, and purple match red gem sockets, orange, yellow, and green match yellow sockets and green, blue, and purple match blue sockets. Mismatched gems can be socketed in any socket, albeit the socket bonus will be lost. Uncut gems can be stacked in piles of 20, whereas each cut gem takes up a bag slot and can not be stacked.\nAside from colored gems, there are two additional types of gems, prismatic and meta gems. Prismatic gems match any color socket, except for meta-gem sockets. Meta gems are uncolored gems which only fit in special meta gem sockets and have a set of prerequisite gems of specific color types which must already be socketed in any of the equipped gear for the meta gem to be activated. However, a gem which can fit in two color sockets, can also be counted twice to meet the meta gem prerequisites. For example, 1 red gem, 1 purple gem, can meet the prerequisites for a meta gem requiring 2 red gems and a blue gem to be activated.\nCertain items from Outland and Northrend have gem sockets. &lt;a href=\"Blacksmiths\"&gt;Blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt;, however, can add colorless sockets to their own bracers and gloves, and create for players to add a colorless socket to high-level belts.\nLearning Jewelcrafting.\nSince Patch 4.2 made the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; available to all paid accounts, anybody can learn Jewelcrafting. Before patch 4.0.1, initial training required a trip to &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;The Exodar&lt;/a&gt; (for Alliance) or to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; (for Horde), as these were the only places you could learn jewelcrafting on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Trainers have since been added to other cities (&lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; (for Horde) and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; (for Alliance)) making them more accessible to low level characters.\nOne of the racial abilities for the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; is a 10-point bonus to the jewelcrafting skill (up from 5 in TBC and Wrath). As with other racial profession bonuses, this has two main effects:\nThe most basic recipes are &lt;a href=\"apprentice%20jewelcrafting%20designs\"&gt;apprentice jewelcrafting designs&lt;/a&gt;. More advanced are &lt;a href=\"journeyman%20jewelcrafting%20designs\"&gt;journeyman jewelcrafting designs&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"expert%20jewelcrafting%20designs\"&gt;expert jewelcrafting designs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"artisan%20jewelcrafting%20designs\"&gt;artisan jewelcrafting designs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"master%20jewelcrafting%20designs\"&gt;master jewelcrafting designs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Master%20jewelcrafting%20designs\"&gt;Grand Master jewelcrafting designs&lt;/a&gt;. Though early Illustrious designs can be obtained from trainers or world drops, high-end recipes (475-525) are almost exclusively purchased with &lt;a href=\"Illustrious%20Jewelcrafter%27s%20Token\"&gt;Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token&lt;/a&gt;s. Tokens can be earned, one per day, by completing a daily quest in your faction capital (Stormwind or Orgrimmar). Patterns, JC-only gems, and other JC-related goods can be purchased for one to four Tokens each, making this a profitable venture even when you've reached the skill cap.\nSince patch 4.0.1, jewelcrafting trainers in the capital cities have been updated to offer training up to and including certain &lt;a href=\"Illustrious%20Grand%20Master%20jewelcrafting%20designs\"&gt;Illustrious Grand Master jewelcrafting designs&lt;/a&gt;. \nFaction Designs.\nSome designs are only learnable after achieving a certain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; level with a particular faction. These are listed at the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20recipes/Jewelcrafting\"&gt;faction designs&lt;/a&gt; entry.\nGem Cutting.\nOnce you reach level 300 in Jewelcrafting, you can begin to learn to cut gems for sockets. These cuts are not taught by a trainer, but must be bought from the Master Jewelcrafter of your faction in Hellfire Peninsula, or various faction vendors that require a certain level of reputation with them before you can purchase the designs. \nMost cuts are purchasable from a faction quartermasters in Outland, although one cut (315 blue) is a world drop. Most cuts at 350 skill are learned from world drops. See &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting%23Gem%20Attributes\"&gt;Gem Attributes&lt;/a&gt; below for more information about specific cuts.\nList of cuts for Wrath:\nSocketing.\nEquipment with &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;s on them are found in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gem\"&gt;Gem&lt;/a&gt;s are cut by &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafter\"&gt;Jewelcrafter&lt;/a&gt;s can cut raw &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s into jewels which can then be placed into the socket, giving the item bonus stats. A socketed gem can be replaced with a different gem, but this will destroy the original gem.\nColors.\nGems come in eight colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, prismatic, and meta. Excluding meta gems and sockets, any colored gem will fit into any colored socket. However, matching the gem and socket colors allows for the socket bonus to be activated. Primary-color gems - red, yellow, and blue - will only match sockets for their color. Secondary-color gems - green, orange, and purple - will match either of the two slots that correspond to their color. Finally, tertiary-color gems (which include only the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Sphere\"&gt;Void Sphere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Sphere\"&gt;Prismatic Sphere&lt;/a&gt;) will fit into any color slot (excluding meta) and still activate the slot bonus. Secondary gems also have combinations of two different bonuses, while primary gems only boost one stat. Meta gems possess their own color requirements to activate, so a player might choose to forfeit an item's socket bonus in favor of a more desirable meta bonus. The two prismatic gems (Void and Prismatic Spheres, which are crafted by &lt;a href=\"enchanters\"&gt;enchanters&lt;/a&gt;) will, since they are a combination of all colors, provide resistance to all forms of magic.\nFor example, a basic red cut is to turn a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Garnet\"&gt;Blood Garnet&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Teardrop%20Blood%20Garnet\"&gt;Teardrop Blood Garnet&lt;/a&gt;, giving +13 healing spells. A basic yellow cut is to turn a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Draenite\"&gt;Golden Draenite&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Golden%20Draenite\"&gt;Brilliant Golden Draenite&lt;/a&gt;, giving +6 intellect. However, a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Spessarite\"&gt;Flame Spessarite&lt;/a&gt; is an orange gem that can be cut into a &lt;a href=\"Luminous%20Flame%20Spessarite\"&gt;Luminous Flame Spessarite&lt;/a&gt;, a gem that gives both +7 healing and +3 intellect and will match either a red or yellow socket.\nThere are many gems that can be cut to fit in sockets. For each color, there is an uncommon gem, which can be cut using patterns from vendors and quartermasters that are learnable at jewelcrafting skill 300 to 325; and a rare gem, which can be cut according to rare, &lt;a href=\"world%20drop\"&gt;world drop&lt;/a&gt; designs learnable at jewelcrafting skill 350. Meta gems fit into meta sockets, which only appear on high-level head-slot items, and cuts for them are learnable at jewelcrafting skill 365, although some meta-slot jewels are boss drops and cannot be crafted. Raw meta gems are produced by alchemists by transmuting a number of raw minerals and primals into special diamonds. \nThere are also epic equivalents of each gem color, obtained through mining nodes in the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; instance, drops from mobs in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; or they can also be traded in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Badges%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Badges of Justice&lt;/a&gt;. The designs for their respective cuts are available through reputation with &lt;a href=\"Scale%20of%20the%20Sands\"&gt;Scale of the Sands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;. \nMaterials.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Gem%20Materials\"&gt;Gem Materials&lt;/a&gt;\nDesigns.\nLootable Designs.\nThe following designs are dropped and can be sold on the auction house or traded between players.\nTrainable Designs.\nSee:\nJewelcrafter-only designs.\nThe following tables lists all &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; jewelcrafting products. Note that, although the Dragon's Eyes only require 370 Jewelcrafting, &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; is required to access &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and purchase the designs, all of which are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; (as are the cut gems).\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; introduced &lt;a href=\"Chimera%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Chimera's Eye&lt;/a&gt; gems, which have the same limits as &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Dragon's Eye&lt;/a&gt; gems: purchased with (different) tokens, gems cut from them being &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;, the jewelcrafter limited to any combination of 3 Dragon's Eye cuts and/or Chimera's Eye cuts.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; added &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Serpent's Eye&lt;/a&gt; gems, the jewelcrafter is limited to any combination of 2 Serpent's Eye cuts.\nInterface.\nGems can be socketed by shift+right-clicking an item that has sockets. This will bring up a window with sockets appearing at the bottom for you to drop the gem(s) into. After placing your gems into the sockets you want, click the \"Socket Gems\" button to socket the gems.\nA socketed gem can be replaced with a different gem, but the original gem will be completely destroyed by this.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn \"Mists of Pandaria\", rare gems (excluding meta gems) will not be learned from designs or trainers but from random discovery - using 3 of one rare uncut gem, for example &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Ruby\"&gt;Primordial Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, will yield in learning a random red gem design as well as a container that contains two rare gems of the same color. All gem colors share the same daily cooldown. 3 &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Harmony\"&gt;Spirit of Harmony&lt;/a&gt; can be used instead of uncut gems and does not have a cooldown.\nUncommon gems are learned from Jewelcrafting trainers.\n\"Mists of Pandaria\" will not feature epic-quality gems, even though some of the gem names were datamined during the expansion's beta (including Zyanite, Adventurine and Sardonyx)."}

{"id": "496861", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=496861", "title": "Jeweled Estate", "text": "The Jeweled Estate is a large mansion located in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern section of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. The estate is the domain of Suramar's nobility, and primarily used for specific functions in the form of banquets, balls, and special meetings. It was overseen by &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Melandrus&lt;/a&gt;, a high-ranking advisor to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe building itself is ornately designed and furnished, and sits in the very heart of the most affluent and aristocratic portion of the city. It sits just off the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Court\"&gt;Midnight Court&lt;/a&gt; and has access to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt; through the nearby &lt;a href=\"Moonlit%20Landing\"&gt;Moonlit Landing&lt;/a&gt;. The estate is one of the largest and most important buildings in Suramar City, with few outside the ruling classes or the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; permitted access at any time. \nSince the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; among nightborne society, the Jeweled Estate has become one of the targets of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen resistance&lt;/a&gt; as a result of its use by the Grand Magistrix and her allies. Along with the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself, the Jeweled Estate and its surrounding district acted as one of the primary bastions for Suramar's ruling powers.\nHistory.\nRebellion.\n&lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; society (like that of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; before it) has historically been extremely class-based, with an aristocratic nobility rigidly ruling over the majority of commoners. Generally, these two factions are divided demographically within the city along the east and the west; the western districts are mostly middle or lower classes, while in the eastern ones reside the very upper echelons of nightborne civilisation. At the very heart of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; in the far east of the city sits the Jeweled Estate, which exists as the main base for Suramar's ruling classes outside the Nighthold. \nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, an insurrection led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; sought to overthrow the regime of Suramar's ruler, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, for allying their people with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; subsequently broke out, in which the rebels eventually received wide support from the repressed majority of commoners, while Elisande received the significant backing of the city's ruling elite. \nThough initially small in size, the insurrection began to quickly gain support and achieve successes as the nobility resorted to ever more extreme measures to quell dissent. Though the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; and the Jeweled Estate remained secure for the most part, rebel activity still occurred. The &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Su%27esh\"&gt;Su'esh&lt;/a&gt; was notably released from the city's &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;menagerie&lt;/a&gt; by rebel agents, and went on to cause havoc throughout the district and around the exterior of the Jeweled Estate itself. \nMidnight ball.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; continued to rage and the insurrection gained further successes, the Nightfallen leadership began to carry out further operations to topple the regime of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. A unique opportunity arose for the rebels when it was announced that Elisande herself would be attending a large gala held in the Jeweled Estate of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to reassure her supporters. \n&lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and the Nightfallen leadership resolved to make an attempt on Elisande's life during the proceedings, in the hope of shortening the conflict. Thalyssra also presented her agents with the objective of killing &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt;, who had notably betrayed her during their coup to oust Elisande in the events leading up to the rebellion. With the help and connections of their double-agent &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; (who had recently won election to Elisande's inner council) a small group of Nightfallen agents were smuggled into the Court of Stars on the night of the ball, disguised as members of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; nobility. \nThe party was successful in eventually fighting their way to the Jeweled Estate itself, which was full of aristocrats and officials enjoying the event, including some extremely high-ranking individuals such as &lt;a href=\"Spellblade%20Aluriel\"&gt;Spellblade Aluriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Star%20Augur%20Etraeus\"&gt;Star Augur Etraeus&lt;/a&gt;. Still in disguise, Thalyssra's agents mingled among the party-goers and managed to root out a disguised &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; agent placed there to be on the lookout for deceit. \nFollowing this, the infiltrators confronted Elisande herself, in conversation with &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt; who she chastised for the rebellion's recent successes. Before anything further could occur, however, the Grand Magistrix teleported herself back to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, ordering Melandrus to deal with the threat. In the fight that ensued, Melandrus was slain. The Nightfallen agents managed to subsequently escape the scene, though their most optimistic goal had not been achieved. Despite this, Thalyssra was deeply pleased and comforted by proof of Melandrus's demise, believing Elisande was at the very least weaker without him."}

{"id": "22525", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22525", "title": "Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras", "text": "The Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras, or simply the Scepter of Sargeras, is a powerful artifact that used to belong to the Dark Titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Created through incredible effort by hundreds of Sargeras' servants, this scepter can rip open dimensional gateways between worlds.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAfter his defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; immediately planned his next method of infiltrating Azeroth. He knew he couldn't rely on a static portal; to serve a titan, such a gateway required an astronomical amount of power, and the most promising source had been destroyed in his last attempt. Moreover, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s laborious preparation and spellwork had given away his intentions, which had allowed the night elf resistance to thwart him. If he wanted to overcome Azeroth's defenders, Sargeras needed to enter the world with minimal warning. \nThus he commanded the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; to forge a tool that would wrench open rifts between worlds for only a short time, just long enough to let a portion of his soul through. Although that meant he couldn't enter Azeroth in his most devastating form, such an instrument would clear a path for his avatar to lead the Legion's invasion or carry out subtler schemes. Such an instrument would also weaken the integrity of the physical universe and threaten to collapse it, but Sargeras considered those to be only side benefits.\nFirst, scores of magi conducted dark rituals to channel countless portals into a single staff. They then projected the empowered artifact into every corner of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, weaving it into the fabric of reality, creating a thread that could be pulled to unravel the seams of the physical universe at will. To fuel this monstrous undertaking, a hundred warlocks sacrificed a hundred demons, selecting them from among the Legion troops that had been part of the failed invasion of Azeroth. Thus was forged the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras.\nSoon after the War of the Ancients, Sargeras had a vision: the Well of Eternity imploded once again, but this time, it dragged him down to the very core of Azeroth. He was there for only an instant, but in that moment, he saw Azeroth's slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;--and in that moment, the world-soul opened one eye and gazed at the Dark Titan. He was enraptured. Since then, the eye of Azeroth's world-soul has not been far from his thoughts. He commanded the eredar who forged the scepter to crown it with that lone, wondrous orb. Next to it, the eredar placed two &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; wings, a testament to Sargeras's conception of the world-soul: corrupted, demonic, and most importantly, his.\nAegwynn and the Dragon Hunt.\nThe Scepter of Sargeras was a marvel of arcane and fel sorcery, an instrument fit for a titan. It could lacerate the connective tissue of the physical universe, opening portals to any realm Sargeras desired, yet the rifts it created would allow only a portion of his soul to enter. It was a minor setback. Sargeras would simply have to be more inventive with his plans. And so, he waited. Millennia later, Sargeras saw his opportunity. The Guardian &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; had become one of the most powerful mages on Azeroth, and not even the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; could control her. Her pride made her a fine candidate for corruption. Sargeras could not infiltrate Azeroth in his most lethal form, but perhaps he could use the rebellious Guardian as a vessel for his machinations.\nIn the icy wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras drew the Guardian Aegwynn into battle, advancing on his opponent as the portal he'd torn into Azeroth closed behind him. His avatar was but a pale shadow of his true form, but that hardly mattered. After all, even if he couldn't defeat Aegwynn, he could still use her for his own ends. He had only to weaken her defenses, to create an opening for a shard of his spirit to break through. Just as he'd infiltrated Azeroth with the scepter, so too would he invade Aegwynn's soul, corrupting it into another instrument of the Legion. Afterward, Aegwynn would remember the battle as the most brutal she'd ever fought, but she finally destroyed the avatar of Sargeras in an avalanche of arcane might. As she stood triumphant over her fallen foe, she could scarcely believe that she had won. Little did she know that she had lost.\nAfter Aegwynn defeated Sargeras's avatar, she interred his corpse in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, along with the artifacts that he bore. Deep beneath the sea, shielded by enchanted Highborne seals, the Scepter of Sargeras remained for centuries, its power undiminished. Sargeras attempted to regain control of the staff through Aegwynn, but the task proved more difficult than he had estimated. He could sway the Guardian in many ways, but he could not compel her to exhume his scepter from its watery grave. Something held her back, a primal instinct louder than Sargeras's whispering. She knew the artifact was dangerous, that its use risked the destruction of all things. Even possessed by the Dark Titan, she would not yield. \nSargeras realized that greater subtlety was needed. Eventually, he extended his pernicious influence to Aegwynn's son, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, as he developed in her womb. Through this new vessel, Sargeras planned to recover his beloved scepter. \nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nA &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; located on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; held the Scepter until it was killed by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s henchmen, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; directed by &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; needed the artifact because it matched with a &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;their world&lt;/a&gt; known as \"the Staff\". Ner'zhul needed it along with the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to await a special celestial event, which would give off enough energy to &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;create a multitude of ultimately unstable portals&lt;/a&gt; across the planet simultaneously, which tore &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; apart, turning it into what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The scepter was in Ner'zhul's possession when he entered the rift. &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; retrieved it from Ner'zhul when he captured Ner'zhul on the other side of the rift that he had opened with the scepter.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nKil'jaeden would set about using it to invade Azeroth. But he was not as powerful as Sargeras; he could not open a portal mighty enough even for his avatar. Thus he conspired with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; to create a gateway through the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves' ruined fount of power. Combined with the world-rending force of the scepter, Kael'thas's portal cleared the way for Kil'jaeden's full form.\nLegion.\nReferred to as simply the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, it is the &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapon for &lt;a href=\"Warlock%23Specializations\"&gt;Destruction warlocks&lt;/a&gt;.\n got his hands on the scepter and sent out members of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the other artifacts: &lt;a href=\"Jergosh%20the%20Invoker\"&gt;Jergosh the Invoker&lt;/a&gt; to get the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nagaz\"&gt;Nagaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Allaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Allaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt; to get the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;. After gathering the items at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, a warlock &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; uses the Scepter of Sargeras to disrupt the portal ritual and then flees with it in their possession."}

It determined if the pet would stay with you or run off. Loyalty gain or loss was determined by the pet's &lt;a href=\"Happiness\"&gt;Happiness&lt;/a&gt;. Raising the loyalty level would have been your first concern after taming a new pet.\nThe pet's loyalty was shown in the Pet tab of the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Info\"&gt;Character Info&lt;/a&gt; window.\nLoyalty levels.\nWhen you first &lt;a href=\"tame\"&gt;tame&lt;/a&gt;d a pet, its Loyalty index was at the lowest level. If you immediately fed it, this would raise happiness which, in time, would help to raise the pet's loyalty index. The player had to keep in mind that loyalty was directly tied to happiness. You could not neglect one without the other trait suffering. \nThere were several stages of Loyalty:\nLoyalty gain.\nTo gain loyalty required both xp gained and time spent. The following table was found by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.maniasarcania.com/2007/08/06/unruly-loyalty-the-5-rule/%23more-149\"&gt;Mania's Arcania&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasically, to gain a loyalty level, your pet needed to, no matter what, gain at least 5% of the XP you, the Hunter, needed for your next level. This was required even if your pet was your level (which means they weren't actually gaining the XP). But there was also a time component on every loyalty level past Unruly. For example, to get to level 4 from level 5, you not only needed the experience gain, but an hour had to pass. This, as Mania says, is why sometimes your pet would ding loyalty while you're standing around in town-- you had gained the experience, but the time had to pass as well.\nRemoval.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, hunter pet loyalty has been completely removed. &lt;a href=\"Happiness\"&gt;Happiness&lt;/a&gt; however remained. All pets start out with an amount of skill points, which depends on the level of the pet, not on loyalty and level as before. "}

Arguably, we could just refer to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org\"&gt;Lua web site&lt;/a&gt;, but a few functions differ slightly in Blizzard's implementation. They are all documented here for consistency.\nLua in the World of Warcraft API.\nNote that the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20API\"&gt;World of Warcraft API&lt;/a&gt; does \"not\" provide all standard Lua functions. Notably, operating system and file I/O libraries are not present.\nLua Functions.\nThese functions are part of the Lua programming language (v5.1), described in the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html\"&gt;Lua 5.1 Reference Manual&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to this list, see also &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20API%23Debugging\"&gt;Debugging Functions&lt;/a&gt;.\nMath Functions.\nMost of these functions are shorthand references to the Lua math library (which is available via \"math.\", see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//lua-users.org/wiki/MathLibraryTutorial\"&gt;MathLibraryTutorial&lt;/a&gt; for more info). \nThe trigonometry functions are not just references; they have degree\u2192radian conversion wrappers. Blizzard's versions work with degrees. Lua's standard math library works with radians.\nThese are custom math functions available in WoW but not normal Lua.\nString Functions.\nThese string functions are shorthand references to the Lua string library (which is available via \"string.\", see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//lua-users.org/wiki/StringLibraryTutorial\"&gt;StringLibraryTutorial&lt;/a&gt; for more info),\nThese are custom string functions available in WoW but not normal Lua.\nTable Functions.\nThese table functions are shorthand references to the Lua table library (which is available via \"table.\", see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//lua-users.org/wiki/TableLibraryTutorial\"&gt;TableLibraryTutorial&lt;/a&gt; for more info).\nBe also aware that many table functions are designed to work with tables indexed only with numerical indexes, starting with 1 and without holes (like {[1] = \"foo\", [3] = \"bar\"} --- recognize that [2] will be nil in this table). When working with any other tables behavior is not defined and might lead to unexpected results. Not being aware of this fact is one major causes for bugs in code written in Lua.\nThese are custom table functions available in WoW but not normal Lua.\nThe following functions are deprecated and should not be used.\nBit Functions.\nWorld of Warcraft includes the Lua bitlib library (available via the \"bit\" table) which provides access to bit manipulation operators. It has been available since &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.9\"&gt;Patch 1.9&lt;/a&gt;. This library seems to work internally with standard 32-bit 'int' values, since bit.lshift(0x80000000, 1) == 0\nUsing these functions to pack data structures is fairly slow work. Unless you have a very large database and \"need\" to conserve memory, save your information in several, individual variables or table fields.\nCoroutine Functions.\nCoroutine functions should be used sparingly because of the amount of memory they use. \nDetails.\nString Functions.\n -- This...\n local s = string.format(input, arg1, arg2, ...)\n -- ...can be written as this\n local s = input:format(arg1, arg2, ...) -- input gets passed as the first argument, replicating the above code, as per the colon syntax\nTo make this work for string constants, you have to use parentheses. \"%d\":format(arg1) is not valid Lua code, you have to do\n (\"%d\"):format(arg1)\nTable Functions.\n -- this works, of course.\n tinsert(tab, 1, value) -- change the value at index 1 to value.\n -- as does this\n tab.insert = tinsert\n tab:insert(1, value) -- change the value at index 1 to value (note the \":\")."}

This page aims to document how much size each structure uses, to aid addon programmers with memory optimization.\nThis data is from WoW 2.0, Lua 5.1\nStrings.\nStrings are allocated and garbage collected by the lua engine. Equal strings will not take up extra space (all strings are stored by reference). When a new string is allocated in memory, it will consume AT LEAST (17 + string length) bytes. However, strings are also tracked in a global hash table, which will grow as necessary, making the average memory consumption somewhere around 24+length bytes when the number of globally tracked strings grows.\nTables.\nTables behave in different ways depending on how much data is put in them, and the style of indexing used.\nA new, empty table will consume 40 bytes.\nAs indexes are added, the table will allocate space for new indexes at an exponential rate. For example:\n local t = {} -- 40 bytes\n t[1] = true -- alloc 1 index\n t[2] = true -- alloc 1 index\n t[3] = true -- alloc 2 indexes\n t[4] = true\n t[5] = true -- alloc 4 indexes\nIf a table is indexed by sequential integers, each index will take 16 bytes (not including any memory allocated for the value). If the becomes a hash, the index size will jump to 40 bytes each. Lua is \"smart\" and will allocate at the 16 byte rate as much as it can. If the int sequence is broken, the new values will allocate at the 40 byte rate. For example:\n local t = {} -- 40 bytes\n t[1] = true -- 16 bytes\n t[2] = true -- 16 bytes\n t[3] = true -- 32 bytes\n t[4] = true\n t[8] = true -- 40 bytes\n t[9] = true -- 40 bytes\n t[10] = true -- 80 bytes\n t[\"x\"] = true\n t[\"y\"] = true -- 160 bytes\nNote that sequential-int and hash allocation can be intermixed. Lua will continue to allocate at the 16-byte rate as long as it possibly can.\n local t = {} -- 40 bytes\n t[1] = true -- 16 bytes\n t[\"1\"] = true -- 40 bytes\n t[2] = true -- 16 bytes\n t[\"2\"] = true -- 40 bytes\n t[3] = true -- 32 bytes\n t[\"3\"] = true -- 80 bytes\nErasing values from a table will not deallocate space used for indexes. Thus, tables don't \"shrink back\" when erased. However, if a value is written into the table on a new index, the table will deallocate back to fit it's new data. This is not delayed until a GC step, but rather an immediate effect. To erase and shrink a table, one can use:\n for i,v in pairs(t) do t[i] = nil end\n t.reset = 1\n t.reset = nil\nFunction closures.\n\"Note that the actual code also uses RAM, of course. But that only happens once. Closures however are created each time the word \"function\" is executed.\"\nEach function closure takes 20 bytes of RAM. The below code will use 20000 bytes:\n for t=1,1000\n x = function() end\n end\nUpvalues that do not change only uses 4 bytes per closure. The below code will use 20000 + 4000 = 24000 bytes:\n local semistatic = \"hi!\"\n for t=1,1000\n x = function() print(semistatic) end\n end\nHowever, upvalues that actually \"change\" use an additional 32 bytes. The below code will use 20000 + 4000 + 32000 = 56000 bytes:\n for t=1,1000\n x = function() print(t) end\n end\nAnd finally, a mix: The below code will use 20*2*500 + 4*2*500 + 32*500 = 40000 bytes\n for t=1,500\n for i=1,2\n x = function() print(t) end\n end\n end"}
{"id": "92524", "revid": "1965082", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=92524", "title": "Lua variable scoping", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Addons\"&gt;Addons&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\" share a single execution environment. As a result, all Addons have access to the same global variables. If one Addon creates a global variable named \"foo\", then all other addons can use (or overwrite) that same variable. This allows for some really useful things to happen; the most frequently used tactic that takes advantage of this feature is &lt;a href=\"Hooking%20functions\"&gt;hooking&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this can also cause some problems in addons. They will conflict if more than one Addon tries to use the same name for a variable. As a result, Addon authors must ensure that their Addons don't conflict by doing one (or more) of the following:\nWhat is scope?\nNo, it's not just a mouthwash. A variable's \"scope\" defines how visible it is to the rest of the program. The feature exists in most high-level languages and &lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt; is no exception.\nVariables can exist in two forms: \"global\" or \"local.\" A global variable is accessible to everything and is not limited. This is the default functionality in Lua. This is unlike many other languages, such as PHP and C, where a variable is always local unless declared global. This difference is important to note. A global variable is not limited to its file, function, or code block:\n foo = 1;\n function bar()\n foo = 2;\n end\n bar();\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(foo); -- Will output \"2\"\n foo = 1;\n if (true) then\n foo = 2;\n end\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(foo); -- Will output \"2\"\n -- File #1\n foo = 2;\n -- File #2 (run after File #1)\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(foo); -- Will output \"2\"\nThis is precisely the opposite functionality of a local variable, which is limited in scope. Take the following examples, where variable scope comes into play. The reasoning behind this functionality will be explained a bit later, but for now these are shown as a general overview of what scope is:\n local foo = 1;\n function bar()\n local foo = 2;\n end\n bar();\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(foo); -- Will output \"1\"\n local foo = 1;\n if (true) then\n local foo = 2;\n end\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(foo); -- Will output \"1\"\n -- File #1\n local foo = 1;\n -- File #2\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(foo); -- Fails; foo does not exist (is nil)\nWhenever writing addons, it is important to understand the concept of a variable's scope, because it tells the author where a variable is defined (and in some cases, which variable will be used). In general, it is best, in most programming languages, to keep a limited-scope approach, that is, to minimize variable visibility. If a variable does not need to be accessed by other addons and files, it should be kept local. Excessive, unnecessary use of global variables is called \"polluting the global namespace\" and is often looked upon as a messy or sloppy programming practice.\nOut of scope and garbage collection.\nA variable is said to have gone \"out of scope\" when it is no longer accessible by the currently executing code block. If a variable is out of scope, it is eligible for garbage collection. If no accessible references exist to the variable anymore, the variable will be garbage collected at some point in the future. Take note that this implies that global variables will never be garbage collected unless they are overwritten because they never go out of scope.\nLocal variables.\nLocal variables exist in many forms. What's important to remember is that local variables exist in a minimal-scope context. That is, they only exist for the block in which they are defined. Although they are all declared in the same fashion, local variables can effectively be split into four types. These types are listed below, ordered from most visible to least visible:\nFile-local variables.\nFile-local variables, as their name suggests, are local to the file in which they are declared. To be accessible throughout the entire file, they must be declared outside of any function or code blocks, otherwise they will become function-local or block-local, respectively. These variables are not accessible in any other file. Addons can make extensive use of these types of local variables because it ensures that variable names will not conflict with other addons. These types of local variables are especially effective for variables which may need to be accessed throughout the file in which they are declared (often times, this is the entire addon), but never needed outside of that file. This can allow an author to use very simple, easy-to-remember variable names, without worrying about conflicting with other addons. Take the following examples:\n --MyAddon.lua\n local name = \"MyAddon\"; -- File local variable; not accessible outside MyAddon.lua\n function MyAddon()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(name); -- Always Outputs \"MyAddon\"\n end\n --MyAddon2.lua\n local name = \"MyAddon2\"; -- Does not conflict with MyAddon.lua's name. This is a different variable.\n function MyAddon2()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(name); -- Always outputs \"MyAddon2\"\n end\nThese two addons use the same variable name, but in different scopes, so they do not conflict. As a result, everything runs smoothly. Depending on which function you call, it will output the correct value. If the variables \"weren't\" declared as local, then we would run into problems:\n --MyAddon.lua (loaded first)\n name = \"MyAddon\";\n function MyAddon()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(name);\n end\n --MyAddon2.lua (loaded second)\n name = \"MyAddon2\";\n function MyAddon2()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(name);\n end\nNow, note that in this example, no matter which function we call, we will always see \"MyAddon2\" output. This is because MyAddon2.lua was loaded second, and overwrote MyAddon.lua's name. They both use the same global scope, and as such, they are the same variable. Thus, using file-local variables for those variables which only the addon is concerned about is always considered a best-practice, as it limits visibility and overall prevents conflicts. This practice allows you to use much simpler names without needing to worry about whether or not the same name will be used by another addon.\nFunction-local variables.\nFunction-local variables are not declared, but are still local variables nonetheless. They are created when a function is called, and are the parameters of a function. Take the following example function:\n function foo(bar, baz)\n -- Code block\n end\nTwo local variables, bar and baz, are created. They are not accessible outside of the function, however they can be used within the function as if they were any other variable. The following code segment demonstrates this system:\n function foo(bar, baz)\n local n = bar + baz;\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(tostring(bar)..\" + \"..tostring(baz)..\" = \"..tostring(n));\n end\n foo(1,2) -- Prints 1 + 2 = 3\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(tostring(bar)..\" + \"..tostring(baz)..\" = \"..tostring(n)); -- Prints nil + nil = nil (out of scope)\nFunction-local parameter variables are not directly declared by the author (though they are essentially created by the author, as the author created the function), but they operate in the same manner. They are still local variables and should be treated as such. Besides the parameters the author can still explicitly declare local variables inside the function that are function-local variables.\nBlock-local variables.\nBlock-local variables, like their name suggests, are variables which are accessible only within the code block in which they are defined. These are often used for simplistic names which only need to be quickly accessed within that function and nowhere else. These are often counters or temporary variables which are no longer necessary once the function returns. Take the following function, for example, which adds two numbers together:\n function add(a, b)\n local n = a + b;\n return n;\n end\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(tostring(add(1,2))); -- Prints 3\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(tostring(n)); -- Prints nil (n is out of scope)\nSimilar to the way this code segment works, the following segment also demonstrates how a code block can limit scope (without a function). Keep in mind that if..then..end, do..while..end, for..do..end, and other such blocks all create a limited variable scope:\n local a = 1; -- File local\n local b = 2; -- File local\n if (a+b &gt; 2) then\n local n = a + b; -- Block local\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(a..\"+\"..b..\"=\"..tostring(n)); -- Prints 1+2=3\n end\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(a..\"+\"..b..\"=\"..tostring(n)); -- Prints 1+2=nil\nBlock-local variables are especially useful as counters and other variables which will only be useful for a particularly small section of code. One extra advantage to doing this is an author can use extremely simple variable names such as \"a,\" \"n,\" or \"key,\" which can then be reused several times within the same function, each time not conflicting with the other version of it. This greatly simplifies code without the need to make esoteric variable names.\nAddon-local variables.\nAddon-local variables, like their name suggests, are variables which are accessible from any code in any files run from a single .toc file and only within these files. These are useful for addons that are spread across multiple file and want to have access to all or some of the variables that another file creates but without creating a global variable that can be accessed by other addons. They are called in a simalar way to a function-local variable if you asume that each lua file is a function that has been passed two variables.\nAn example of how to use these addon-local variables:\n -- MyAddon.toc\n ## Interface: \n ## Title: My Super Addon\n ## Author: Author1\n ## Version: 1.1.1\n MyAddon1.lua\n MyAddon2.lua\n -- MyAddon1.lua\n local addonName, addonTable = ... -- Pulls back the Addon-Local Variables and store them locally.\n -- addonName = \"MyAddon\"\n addonTable.AddonAuthor = \"Author1\"\n addonTable.Description = {\n DesTitle = \"Addon Description:\",\n Description = \"This is some addon that does something\",\n \n local function MyAddon()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"Addon's Name is \"..addonName)\n end\n -- MyAddon2.lua\n local addonName, addonTable = ... -- Pulls back the Addon-Local Variables and store them locally.\n -- addonName = \"MyAddon\"\n local function MyAddon2()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(addonTable.Description.DesTitle..\": \"..addonTable.Description.Description)\n end\nThe first file (MyAddon1.lua) adds some strings and table variables to the Addon-Local Variable locally named \"addonTable\" in both functions (although it could be put into any variable name or even another table) and the second file \"MyAddon2.lua\" has a function \"MyAddon2()\" that can access these new strings although they couldn't be accessed by any other addon.\nStatic Variables.\nThe \"static\" keyword does not exist in Lua; therefore, it's not possible to create a static variable. Static variables are useful in that they are local to the function, but retain their value with subsequent calls to said function. You can simulate this functionality by encapsulating your function definition in a do...end block with the local variable declaration inside the do...end block and before the function definition. Like so:\nThis could be useful in OnUpdate scripts that must use a frame/table each time it's executed, which is horribly inefficient.\nComplex scope.\nYes, nothing's ever that simple, of course. Above, we have only looked at limiting scope one level at a time. Unfortunately, addons often are complex enough that an author will mix several levels of scope. But how does Lua know which local variable to use? Well, as stated before, Lua uses a rule system called \"least visibility.\" That means, the variable which is \"most local\" to the current scope will be the one used. Global variables are only used in the event that a local variable does not exist at the current scope. The following block shows a very complex example which isolates the various cases that may occur. \nNote we create the function \"p\" as a synonym for DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage because it is a long name to write. More importantly, note that we make this function file-local. Remember, in Lua, functions are variables too. As a result, it is equally possible to make a function local as well. In this case, the function is file-local, meaning that it will be used only within this file, and not be accessible outside of this file. This is often a good idea, especially with very simplistic names such as \"p\" which other authors may also choose.\n local function p(msg)\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(tostring(msg));\n end\n n = 0; -- Global variable\n function foo(n) -- In comments, assuming parameter n = 1\n p(n); -- Prints 1\n local n = n + 1; -- Creates a new n in block scope, equal to n + 1\n p(n); -- Prints 2\n if (true) then -- Entering a new code block\n p(n); -- Prints 2\n local n = 15; -- Creates a more local n, now\n p(n); -- Prints 15\n for x = 1, 10 do -- Note x is implicitly declared as a local variable now, it is not accessible outside the for block\n -- Note each iteration is a separate block!\n p(n); -- Prints 15 EVERY TIME (even on 2nd+ loop)\n local n = x;\n p(n); -- Prints 1,2...,10 (depending on iteration)\n end\n p(n); -- Prints 15 (n in for block is out of scope)\n p(x); -- Prints nil (x is local to the for block)\n end\n p(n); -- Prints 2\n end\n foo(1);\n p(n); -- Prints 0 (using global n, as there is no local n)\nNow, is it a best-practice to use the same variable name for every variable you get your hands on? Most certainly not, but it does provide some extra functionality that can be useful. In general, you should avoid using names that are the same, especially as much as the above function foo(), where it can become very difficult to determine which version of \"n\" you are using, but it is useful on occasion to be able to localize variables. Always remember, however, that the most local variable will always be used, where possible. Global variables are a last resort.\nScope de-resolution.\nSometimes it is necessary to use a global version of a variable instead of a local copy which may exist. Luckily, Lua provides a mechanism to do this. In general, it won't be necessary if you follow programming best-practices, but occasionally it can be useful to use. \nLua also creates and maintains a table defined by the language which contains all global variables. This table is named _G. You access it similarly to getglobal() \u2014 its keys are the string representations of variable names. As such, the same block exemplified in the previous section could be rewritten thusly, with the exact same result:\n local global_n = n; -- These two lines\n local global_n = _G[\"n\"]; -- are functionally equivalent\nThis can allow authors to write much more compact code which performs the same operation, though it may be less readable. As always, use the appropriate tool for the situation to help maintain readability.\nConclusion.\nUnderstanding Lua's use of variable scope is vital to understanding the process in which Lua decides which variable to use. Correct use of limited scope will allow your addon to be less likely to conflict with others, and minimize global namespace pollution."}

He has a special power to shift in and out of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. His hair is described as sandy hair.\nHe was briefly a soldier but didn't fight in any war. He is over 30 years old.\nBiography.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; began spreading and claimed its first victims in Stormwind, Lucan found himself drawn towards something which he didn't quite understand. During his seemingly endless trip, he found himself losing his connection to reality now and then. He was walking day and night, afraid that if he ever lay down to sleep he wouldn't wake up again. After weeks of his strange trip into the unknown, he found himself in the city of &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; where after finding more victims of the Nightmare, he met &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;. Lucan rescued them by teleporting them out of there. He told the night elves who he was and when the trio spotted a black dragon, Lucan again teleported. Now they materialized near a cave, where the dragon was hiding. Lucan claimed that the dragon was green not black. He ventured into the cave, where that dragon really was. It was revealed that he is Ysera's consort Eranikus. The dragon told the truth about Lucan, that he was born within the Emerald Dream after an unknown fey creature stole his mother there to use her unborn child for some nefarious purpose. His birth mother passed away in childbirth. His birth tied him to &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s consort &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; who gave the newborn the energy to live out of mercy, thus giving Lucan the ability to travel between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; at will. He ended up with &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, who had a good relationship with humans and thus would be in a position to ensure that Lucan would end up with a good foster family. Lucan however, does not have the ability to chose where his shifting takes him within either of these dimensions. Traveling into the Emerald Dream usually results in appearing near &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; since his ability is tied to the consort.\nAfter this revelation, he separated from the group only to be encountered by an orc female, &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;, who was following the trio. Lucan eventually used his power to teleport, but he also inadvertently teleported Thura in the process and did not come back. the human and the orc were trapped in the Emerald Dream, and what's worse, in danger of the spreading Emerald Nightmare. Thura ordered him to take her to &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, she sensed her target was near so she let Lucan go. Eventually, he found Tyrande, Broll, and Eranikus, to whom he explained everything about Thura and her plan to kill Malfurion. Tyrande and Broll went to rescue Malfurion and Lucan, later on, left Eranikus and joined the night elves just in time to see Thura cut the tree that was imprisoning the archdruid. The entire event, however, was a ploy by the Nightmare to lure &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; out in the open and trap her within the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ysera\"&gt;Eye of Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. Lucan remained with the night elves and the orc as they escaped the Emerald Dream. As they were flying to safety, Emeriss attacked them, causing the group to be tossed into a portal to Azeroth. There they were attacked by corrupted &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt; and all of them except Lucan were overwhelmed by their nightmares. Eventually, Lucan used his power and teleported them into the Emerald Dream once more. They materialized next to Eranikus, who was too saddened by Ysera's imprisonment to be of any use so he once more used his power and materialized to Stormwind. He then accompanied the group to King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and then to a night elf ambassador. He, alongside Thura, helped Tyrande to calm the dreaming ambassador and teleported once more; this time to the Emerald Nightmare. There, they were taken as prisoners by &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to steal Thura's axe. In that moment, Tyrande created a diversion while Lucan teleported Thura and himself to Eranikus. Unfortunately, the axe and Tyrande remained behind within the Emerald Nightmare.\nMeanwhile, a mortal army led by Varian and Malfurion attacked the Emerald Dream, and Eranikus transported Lucan and Thura to the axe's location. Lucan however, teleported near Ysera and helped her to communicate with Malfurion. After Thura was delivered to the axe's location, Eranikus heard Ysera's voice. Eranikus went to release Ysera from her imprisonment, though he succeeded only after he sacrificed himself. After Ysera was freed, the Dragon Aspect and Lucan teleported to Darnassus.\nAfter the events regarding the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; he is taken up as a student of &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; to further utilize his unique abilities and was present at the wedding of Tyrande and Malfurion. King Varian Wrynn also promoted him from an assistant to the chief cartographer."}

Lucifron is no exception. He has clashed with &lt;a href=\"Gehennas\"&gt;Gehennas&lt;/a&gt; on several occasions, particularly during their incarceration within the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. This rivalry has now extended to the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; where Lucifron quietly waits for his opportunity to capitalize on any weakness shown by the other flamewakers. Lucifron, and his two &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20Protector\"&gt;Flamewaker Protector&lt;/a&gt; guards, can be found watching over the enormous core hound &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt;, favored pet of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. \nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Lucifron is accompanied by four Flamewaker Protectors rather than two.\nStrategies.\nIn most cases, raids will first dispatch the first &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20Pack\"&gt;Core Hound Pack&lt;/a&gt; to give some room for the pullers and the main tank. It is important when Lucifron is pulled that he not come near the main raid group or there could be an instantaneous wipe. His guards have the ability to mind control, so it is sometimes easier to have one or two dummies move ahead of the main tank to suck up the mind control. Additionally, no one can move near the tunnel to the west, or the imps and surgers inside could chain aggro and wipe the raid.\nGenerally, two hunters will use one of their insta-cast shots to pull the Flamewalker Protectors, while the Main Tank must run up, tag, and pull Lucifron in the opposite direction of his guards. Generally the back cove is where the guards are pulled, while Lucifron is taken to another alcove on the east, far from the main raid. Each of the guards must then be picked up by two offtanks and dispatched accordingly before Lucifron is targeted.\nMages will not be contributing any large part of the DPS in this fight as they will be tied up with removing the curse that Lucifron casts on the raid every 15 seconds. Priests and Paladins will also be tied up dispelling the Impending Doom debuff from healers, and especially the main tanks, and whoever becomes mind controlled. The core DPS for this fight therefore falls upon the rogues, hunters, and warlocks.\nOnce the two guards are defeated, all DPS will shift over to Lucifron. Usually around 20-25%, it is safe for some of the mages to begin casting their nukes, depending on their mana and how quickly they decurse the raid.\nLucifron's debuffs have a range of 40 yards. It is possible for every healer (except the MT-decurser), and properly spec'ed hunters to stay out of Lucifron's curse-range, so with a good group you can minimize every curse-wave to about 10 raid members (melees). This makes the fight much easier and allows the mages to do damage too. You can also choose to keep only necessary players within the radius (healers, decursers, dispellers, tanks), and hold back the DPS players out of the range until Luci's mana is depleted. It takes a few minutes, but it saves the trouble of nearly wiping when the entire raid is bing hit by the curses and magic effects. Its good to note that any ranged DPS that can attack at 41 yards through talents can exceed Luci's range and still DPS him down. They just have to be at their maximum range.\nIf Lucifron is not defeated before the group wipes, the guards will respawn.\nReward.\nLucifron drops two epic items, which may include one of the &lt;a href=\"Tier%201\"&gt;Tier 1&lt;/a&gt; epic boots or gloves for some classes.\nLucifron's death rewards 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; up to 20,999/21,000 Revered.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

She plays a significant role in combating the &lt;a href=\"drust%20incursion\"&gt;drust incursion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLucille lived at &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt; along with her parents in the town of &lt;a href=\"Corlain\"&gt;Corlain&lt;/a&gt;. She had a relatively normal childhood, getting bitten by several &lt;a href=\"Bloodfly\"&gt;bloodflies&lt;/a&gt; along the way. At least one of her grandmothers was still alive while she was growing up, who told her stories of onions warding off evil. Her father would pass down stories to her of how the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; compiled their knowledge into a treatise on anti-Drust magic, secured in &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Var\"&gt;Gol Var&lt;/a&gt;, and the cave entrance hidden by an &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Lodge\"&gt;unassuming cottage&lt;/a&gt; with a secret doorway.\nAs an adult, she became engaged to &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Treadward\"&gt;Alexander Treadward&lt;/a&gt;, a common merchant. Her mother &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Meredith&lt;/a&gt; did not approve because of Alexander's status, while her father &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arthur&lt;/a&gt; knew that Lucille was following her heart and apparently approved of his future son-in-law. On the day of their wedding Alexander was killed by &lt;a href=\"Roland%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Roland the Knife&lt;/a&gt; who was hired by Meredith, though Lucille would not know this.\nSometime later an unknown menace had been spreading throughout the land of Drustvar. Unfortunately for her, she got caught up at &lt;a href=\"Fletcher%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Fletcher's Hollow&lt;/a&gt; when the town fell to the &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker men&lt;/a&gt;. Accusing her of being the witch that set the curse upon the town, they planned to hang her at &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20Point\"&gt;Hangman's Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, she would be saved by an adventurer and the Marshal of the Waycrest Guard, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Everit%20Reade\"&gt;Everit Reade&lt;/a&gt;. To prove that she was not a witch she decided to undergo three tests. To prove that she could vomit, she ate the venom from saurolisk, forcing her digestive system to expel. To prove she could cry, she held an onion close to her face. To prove that the blood flies wouldn't avoid her, she allowed several of them to bite her. \nThese tests would prove fruitless as &lt;a href=\"Constable%20Henry%20Framer\"&gt;Constable Henry Framer&lt;/a&gt;, who was in charge of the trial, still wanted to know how &lt;a href=\"Fletcher%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Fletcher's Hollow&lt;/a&gt; became cursed. With only one option left, Lucille asked the adventurer to go to the village and help solve the mystery. The adventurer returned later, and gave a letter from the mayor of Fletcher's Hollow, &lt;a href=\"Evelyn%20Pare\"&gt;Evelyn Pare&lt;/a&gt;, to the Constable, clearing Lucille's name of all wrongdoings. As she was freed, an ambush from &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Widdowson\"&gt;Sister Widdowson&lt;/a&gt; attacked Hangman's Point to capture Lucille, but was repelled.\nAt that point, Lucille came up with an idea to defeat the Coven. Thinking that there was a connections between them and the &lt;a href=\"drust\"&gt;drust&lt;/a&gt;, Lucille rode off with the adventurer to an &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Lodge\"&gt;unassuming cottage&lt;/a&gt; owned by her family &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Rise\"&gt;up in the mountains&lt;/a&gt;. After getting pass the yetis in the area, the two found the &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Var\"&gt;secret ruins&lt;/a&gt; which the Waycrest family had hidden for years. After dismantling the defenses, the two found the ancient base of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; along with a tome containing information on the drust.\nWith the tome in their possession, they rode off to &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. While there, Lucille decoded the tome and uncovered certain weaknesses that affect the drust and their magic. Taking a needle out of her sewing kit, Lucile asked the adventurer to go poke the refugees outside in hope of finding a witch. Meanwhile, Everit sent the adventurer out to recruit members for revitalizing the Order of Embers. \nAs the recruits were gathered, Lucille initiated the sacred ceremony and the Order of Embers was reborn.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt; secured, the three and the Order of Embers started an offensive. While &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Inquisitor Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer went to &lt;a href=\"Falconhurst\"&gt;Falconhurst&lt;/a&gt; to gather the Alchemical Fire from &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Ashton\"&gt;Warren Ashton&lt;/a&gt;, the others traveled to &lt;a href=\"Watchman%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Watchman's Rise&lt;/a&gt;. As the adventurer caught up with them, the Order invaded the tower, taking out the corrupted lieutenant and killing the witch controlling the building, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Adela\"&gt;Sister Adela&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhile they waited for their next move, Lucille sent the adventurer out to gather some silver, as it is a weakness of the drust. She also asked the adventurer to go test out the &lt;a href=\"Witchrend\"&gt;Witchrend&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith all the preparations made, the Order of Embers took down the barrier of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Corlain\"&gt;Upper Corlain&lt;/a&gt; and invaded with the adventurer. The group advanced as one, with the rest of the Order protecting their rear. They charged to Waycrest Menor to save Lucille's parents but she was confronted with a horrible truth: the leader of the Coven was her mother.\nUsing her drust magic, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mother\"&gt;The Mother&lt;/a&gt; corrupted Everit. During the battle, Lucille encourages him to fight it, but it was all for naught as she was forced to watch him die before her. After the battle, she laid next to him in tears. Lucille vowed to travel into the manor to deal with her mother and end the coven. Afterward, she accepted that she was now head of the family, and held a ceremony at Arom's Stand where she named &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt; the new Marshal of the Waycrest Guard.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; sought to save her daughter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt; and the grip of Gorak Tul, Lucille directed the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt;: the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; and last of the drust &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. She later attended the ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; where Katherine named Jaina the new &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, pledging House Waycrest once again to the Proudmoores and Alliance.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWhat is it, &lt;class&gt;?\nI am sorry you seem to have been put in the middle of this. These really are good people, but times have been trying of late.\nThese yetis are threatening the traders that travel along Highroad Pass. They need to be dealt with.\nThe knowledge of the Order of Embers is the key to defeating the coven, I know it!\nWe just need to find a way to use it!\nThe &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; will prevail against the coven. Drustvar depends on it.\nThough these days have been marked by loss, we continue onward.\nThere is a hidden path nearby we can use to return to the manor's foyer."}

Conceptually, it is thrown into the Cluster Launcher, but there is no targeting involved, just right click on the Lucky Rocket Cluster in your inventory. See Notes for details.\nBuff.\nEveryone within a certain range of the launcher when a lucky rocket cluster is launched will gain a +250 HP buff that lasts for 30 minutes (&lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Fortune\"&gt;Lunar Fortune&lt;/a&gt;).\nObject of.\n&lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Fireworks\"&gt;Lunar Fireworks&lt;/a&gt; requires that you launch eight Lunar Fireworks (color and size not specified) and two Cluster Fireworks (color and size not specified). Lucky Rocket Clusters are a Cluster Firework, so firing off one of these satisfies one \"Lunar Fireworks Cluster Fired\" objective, but note that the cluster fireworks vended near the Lunar Festival Harbinger that give you this quest are cheap, and the Lucky Rocket Cluster buff has value. You may not want to waste any Lucky Rocket Clusters on doing this quest, and especially not two in close succession, where one buff is completely overwritten.\nNotes.\nUnlike many fireworks in WoW, Lunar Festival Rocket Clusters (any size, any color) require the presence of a Cluster Launcher &lt;a href=\"object\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt; on the ground in order to use the firework. These are widely available during the Lunar Festival only; near Lunar Festival revelers in cities and in Moonglade, and at other odd locations (there's some at the fishing dock in Orgrimmar). You can also spawn your own Cluster Launcher for 30 minutes by using a , made by an &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; from schematics purchased from in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;.

She is the sister of &lt;a href=\"Wilfred%20Fizzlebang\"&gt;Wilfred Fizzlebang&lt;/a&gt;, a famous gnome warlock who was killed by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jaraxxus\"&gt;Lord Jaraxxus&lt;/a&gt; after he inadvertently summoned him during the Trial of the Crusader.\nLegion.\nAs a member of the great Fizzlebang family of summoners, Lulubelle was needed by the Council to bring stronger demons to their cause, and mostly to summon the powerful &lt;a href=\"Eredar%20Twins\"&gt;Eredar Twins&lt;/a&gt; in order to enslave them using the &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Kira's Bloodstone&lt;/a&gt;. The Council could not afford to lose another member due to inexperience and, with the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; swarming with new blood, all hoping to make a name for themselves in this time of chaos, they hoped to find one worthy enough. Their scouting efforts eventually paid off: &lt;a href=\"Ritssyn%20Flamescowl\"&gt;Ritssyn Flamescowl&lt;/a&gt; had reason to believe that Wilfred Fizzlebang's sister had made her way to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. If she had half her brother's power he said, but at least twice his intelligence, then they just might succeed in summoning the Twins.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; of the Black Harvest found her, she recognized them as the Council's new leader because of their weapon, and asked them to not mention to anyone that they had seen her. She believed that a confession alone would not be enough to clear her name and that her location had to be kept secret, at least until she had proof of her innocence: thanks to the legacy of her family name, any time some miserable warlock summons demons they can't control, she would get the blame. The scene of her latest \"crime\" was a nearby cave, where unruly imps and other nasty demons were roaming free because of a lousy warlock. The First thus went to the cave, banished the summoned demons back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and got the warlock to write them a written confession. Armed with this confession, Lulubelle would be able to prove her innocence and focus on more pressing matters, thus joining the Council on &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nLulubelle warned that what the Council planned to do was pretty risky: summoning one sister would be difficult enough, but both of them at once was just asking for trouble. Luckily, she was up for the challenge. She thus helped the rest of the Council summon the Eredar Twins, in the hopes of restoring pride to the Fizzlebang name.\nThe First then named a new Sixth, choosing between Lulubulle and &lt;a href=\"Kira%20Iresoul\"&gt;Kira Iresoul&lt;/a&gt;.\nLulu doesn't need to hide away in shame anymore, and she thanks the First for that. She says it's a debt she doubts she'll ever be able to repay, but she'd like to try.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nIt's not easy being a Fizzlebang. My brother's mistakes follow me everywhere I go.\nI'll do whatever it takes to restore pride to the Fizzlebang name."}

Once a &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; has been felled and returned to the community, it is processed and made ready for use as Lumber.

The ability to craft wood to the specific shapes and sizes needed to make certain buildings made them an essential part of any community. The mill could also provide &lt;a href=\"Archer%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Archers&lt;/a&gt; with better shafts for their arrows that would make them fly truer, and increase the amount of damage that they inflicted.\nOrc lumber mill.\nThis is where the roughly cut wood supplied by the &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt; laborers was made usable by skilled workers for buildings, &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Catapult%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;catapults&lt;/a&gt;. If other orcs required specific woods for their sites, only the lumber mill had the necessary workers to complete the task. When funds were directed to the craftsmen of the mill, they could increase the quality of spears, making them bite even deeper into the hide of the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; scum.\nSecond War.\nElven lumber mill.\nSeeking insight into the mysteries of the great &lt;a href=\"Ironwood\"&gt;Ironwood&lt;/a&gt; trees of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; constructed lumber mills where they became exceptional craftsmen. The elves offered their superior skills in service to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, providing more efficient means for processing &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt;. The production of ships and war machines became possible with the addition of these structures.\nLumber mills were also responsible for producing the perfectly crafted arrows that made the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Archer%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;elven archers&lt;/a&gt; feared throughout the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. When given the necessary resources, Elven craftsmen would upgrade the quality of these arrows, thus increasing the possible damage that could be inflicted. &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Elven rangers&lt;/a&gt;, after being trained at the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28WC2%20Human%29\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, had been known to gather at the mills, honing their skills in &lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;Longbow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marksmanship\"&gt;Marksmanship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nTroll lumber mill.\nCarved from the husk of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Ironwood\"&gt;Ironwood&lt;/a&gt; tree, the Troll Lumber Mill was a vital part of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; processing operation. The &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Trolls&lt;/a&gt;, having lived in the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;forests&lt;/a&gt; of the far north for centuries, had devised a unique method of harvesting. By treating a group of trees with a volatile alchemical solvent, the Trolls could deaden and weaken large sections of wood. Though it was extremely hazardous to &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Peon&lt;/a&gt; and earth alike, this site made the process of cutting lumber more efficient. Trolls had become quite adept at fashioning a special sort of throwing axe. The crafting and use of this weapon were always being honed to perfection. &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Berserker%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Troll Berserkers&lt;/a&gt; frequented the Ironwood trees to digest potions given to them by the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Alchemist%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Goblin Alchemists&lt;/a&gt; stationed there. These potions enabled them to throw their axes greater distances or sharpen their sight. It was also said that the speed at which healing occurs was increased if the correct potion was ingested. This process of &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28racial%29\"&gt;regeneration&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most distinct and unbelievable powers of the Troll Berserkers.\nThird War.\nHuman lumber mill.\nThe master masons of the human lumber mills strive constantly to improve structural integrity. The site is also a processing mill for lumber harvested from the surrounding landscape. The wood harvested is used in everything from raw building materials to weapon handles.\nHigh elven and blood elven lumber mill.\nThe Lumber Mill helped the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; to fend off &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to attack their capital city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in ' by serving as a returning point for lumber. However, the Lumber Mill couldn't be built by the &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28high%20elf%29\"&gt;High elf worker&lt;/a&gt; unit likely due to the limited ability of the map editor prior to the ' expansion. With the addition of \"The Frozen Throne\" expansion's map editor, it is possible to make additional groups with building orders.\nThe lumber mill also helped the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; campaign in \"The Frozen Throne\".\nOrc war mill.\nAn invention of the crafty trolls, this structure maximizes potential by serving as a mill for lumber as well as a forge for weapons smithing. Here weapons and armor are tirelessly reworked for maximum efficiency. Trolls here can also create one of their most useful fortifications: spiked barricades.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLumber mills can be found all throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and , and even in battlegrounds such as &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;. While a few lumber mills have been abandoned or destroyed, some still remain intact. Many sites in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" are lumber or logging camps even though they lack a true \"lumber mill\" building as they were in the former strategy games. An example for such a place would the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Woodsman\"&gt;Woodsmen&lt;/a&gt; that previously lived at &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; might have been some of the sylvan craftsmen mentioned to operate elven lumber mills."}

The &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; tells his minions to go to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Keep&lt;/a&gt; and bring him the boy, but one of the cultists objects that Theramore repelled both &lt;a href=\"Stasia%20Fallshadow\"&gt;Stasia&lt;/a&gt;'s raiders and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. In response, Cho'gall kills the cultist, yelling that the Lich King is insignificant when compared to his master's power.\nIn Theramore, Maraad is teaching Med'an about the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; when the boy is suddenly attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s voice again. Valeera tells Maraad to help his grand nephew, but the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; wishes to see what Med'an can do for himself first. He tells the boy to not let his fear control him and instructs him to reach out to the Light and let it shield him from the whispers, which Med'an succeeds at. Maraad remarks that Med'an has the affinity for holy magic and that this first attempt was better than any novice the &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; has seen.\n&lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; watches the exchange from the &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt;. While she wants to tell Med'an that she is her grandmother, she decides that she can't let her selfish wishes ruin his life, the way her arrogance ruined her own son &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s life and brought disaster on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and Meryl enter the room. The three of them agree on the importance of learning the exact wording of the prophecy concerning Med'an, and of recreating the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. However, Jaina and Aegwynn point out that &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 where the order was originally formed \u2014 is occupied with its own battles against the Lich King, and that &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos the Spell-Weaver&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;mysterious efforts&lt;/a&gt; have caused all &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth to diminish in power. However, wielders of nature magic and divine magic have not been affected. As such, the reformed council will need to include practitioners of other magical disciplines and not just the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina decides to ask &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Maraad to join the new council, as well as ask the latter to go to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and invite &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. She notes that &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; would be a perfect candidate as well but is likely kept busy by the troubles in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Meryl decides to travel to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to ask &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn proposes inviting the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; inventor &lt;a href=\"Thunker%20Axeljink\"&gt;Thunker Axeljink&lt;/a&gt;, but Meryl informs her that he died fighting &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Thunker's eccentric and ill-tempered son &lt;a href=\"Krank%20Axeljink\"&gt;Krank&lt;/a&gt; lives in Ironforge, Meryl could contact him while visiting Rohan. With matters settled, Jaina teleports to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Thrall.\nBack in Ahn'Qiraj, a group of Twilight cultists depart for Theramore on &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; mounts. To aid in the attack, Cho'gall calls on his master's power to awaken a giant &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt; from the seafloor near Theramore.\nIn Razor Hill, Jaina meets with Thrall and informs him of Cho'gall's return and the plan to create a new council. Thrall is receptive to the idea and wishes he could join the effort, but can't as he is preparing for the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;invasion of Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. He suggests that Jaina take &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt; in his stead, and also proposes that she send Rehgar and Valeera to speak with &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Theramore, Aegwynn, Maraad, Med'an, Meryl, and Valeera stand gathered near the docks to prepare for Maraad and Meryl's departures to Outland and Ironforge, respectively. Med'an wants to go with Maraad, but his great uncle tells him to stay behind and continue his training. Suddenly, the faceless one surges out of the ocean to attack the group. Meryl's firebolts seem to be completely ineffective against the beast. While Med'an suffers another assault from the Old God's whispers and the others try to keep the faceless at bay, bat-riding cultists arrive to seize the boy. Meryl tells the others to destroy Cho'gall's minions while he deals with the faceless. Aegwynn notes that Meryl's current weakness doesn't seem to be due to the difficulty afflicting all magi, but rather something else.\nPrivately, Meryl converses with &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, who points out that they are both wasting their power to fight for control of Meryl's body. The &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; proposes that they instead work together to fight the faceless using &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic fueled by sacrificing some fish or strands of seaweed from the nearby sea. Meryl reluctantly agrees, and together he and his possessing &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; unleash powerful blasts of magic against the creature. Med'an recovers from the Old God's mental attack, having realized through the blessing of the Light who sent the faceless one and how to destroy it. At the same moment, Jaina and Rehgar teleport onto the ramparts of Theramore Keep and are startled by the sight of the faceless. Down below, Med'an calls on the help of the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and weaves together arcane and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic magic, conjuring a single massive blast that strikes into the faceless one from the skies and blows its head open, killing it.\nJaina and Rehgar discuss Med'an's abilities while the others kill the remaining Twilight's Hammer. After the last attackers have been slain, Aegwynn confronts Meryl, having realized that he is possessed by Kathra'natir. Meryl defends his actions, but Aegwynn questions if he is using Kathra'natir or if Kathra'natir is using him. Med'an tends to Valeera, who was injured in the battle, and calls upon the Light and the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Spirit of Earth&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously to heal her wounds. The display does not go unnoticed by Aegwynn and Meryl, who remark that Med'an himself doesn't seem to realize that he is combining magic in a way that no one ever has before. Med'an turns to the others and states that the Light showed him something of the being haunting him, which Meryl concludes must be an Old God.\nIn Ahn'Qiraj, Cho'gall is tortured by his master for his failure to capture the boy. He vows that since Med'an will not offer himself willingly, the ogre will instead sacrifice him to the master; done properly, his death will discharge his energy and release the master from its bonds as surely as if the boy had released the power himself. \nBack in Theramore, Aegwynn, Meryl, and Maraad decide that they need to move Med'an somewhere beyond the Old God's reach, and Maraad decides to take the boy with him to Outland. While the vindicator talks to his grand nephew, Aegwynn tells Meryl that she has decided that no one must ever know that Med'an is the son of Medivh, especially not Med'an himself; he would be shunned by any who knew, and his potential would be wasted. Meryl insists that the boy is old enough to deserve to know, but Aegwynn forbids him from telling, saying that she will keep Meryl's possession a secret only as long as he does the same with the matter of Med'an's father.\nThat night, as Med'an lies in his bed and begins to drift off to sleep, he suddenly jolts awake when a vision of Medivh appears in his room, informs him that he is his father, and invites him to come to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, where all will be explained."}

The discovery was swiftly announced by fan-sites, prompting a large number of players to immediately seek out the cavern where the egg is located. On many servers, the sudden influx of dozens or even hundreds of players made it impossible for newcomers to find and loot the Egg, resulting in ever-growing crowds - some still seeking the elusive item, and others celebrating this impromptu gathering with a riot of toys and &lt;a href=\"S.E.L.F.I.E.%20Camera\"&gt;S.E.L.F.I.E.s&lt;/a&gt;.

It was considered to be one of the oldest and proudest of the orcish clans. Much like the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, the Whiteclaws had learned to hunt alongside Frostfire Ridge's native &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, even befriending and training them as companions, and the Whiteclaws felt an affinity toward the Frostwolves due to their many shared customs and traditions.\nHistory.\nRoughly 11 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the Whiteclaws joined forces with the Frostwolf clan against the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the First War, the Whiteclaws protested the changes to the orcish way of life by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, their chieftain &lt;a href=\"Zagrel\"&gt;Zagrel&lt;/a&gt; being one of the Horde's most outspoken critics. At the great clan meeting at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, Zagrel had stubbornly opposed &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s proposal of uniting the clans into a single force to make war on the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. The Whiteclaw chieftain believed that slaughtering the draenei would not make life better and might instead anger the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; even more. A few years later, Zagrel had called on the clans to end their pointless war with the draenei and focus their attention on &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic rituals, believing that only through dedicated worship and adherence to old traditions could the orcs regain their relationship with the elements. Gul'dan feared that Zagrel could eventually win the support of orcs who questioned the Horde, such as &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and his Frostwolves, and sent his assassin &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; to strike the Whiteclaw chieftain down. Garona silently slipped into the Whiteclaws' encampment and stabbed Zagrel through the heart. None of his clan would ever know she'd been there. After their leader's untimely death, inner turmoil gripped the clan as Zagrel's brothers and sons fought for the title of chieftain. The Whiteclaws would endure, but would never be as strong as they had once been.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Warchief Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; tasked the Frostwolf, Whiteclaw, and &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt; clans with wiping out Draenor's &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the ogres that had refused to join the Horde. The Frostwolves and Whiteclaws saw no honor in hunting the giants down and held most of their warriors back, but the Thunderlords did not shy away from the task and reveled in the slaughter of their ancient enemies.\nAfter the Horde conquered much of Draenor, the threat of starvation caused many orcs to turn on each other, clashing in short-lived battles that left hundreds dead. The Whiteclaws were one of the clans who suffered greatly in these conflicts.\nAs a result of their sympathies to the Frostwolf clan, the Whiteclaws were easy targets for the bolder and more violent clans, and were consequently attacked. The Whiteclaws were destroyed, and any surviving members were scattered. The clan was believed to be no more, becoming little more than clanless savages."}

It is a popular place for the inhabitants of the region wishing to get married there, as the price for the reservation being very high for hosting weddings, and the time on the waiting list can be long up to more than two years.\nHistory.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, it was here that &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; organized her wedding with her fianc\u00e9, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Treadward\"&gt;Alexander Treadward&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, what was a day of celebration turned into a disaster. During the ceremony, &lt;a href=\"Roland%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Roland the Knife&lt;/a&gt; and his assassins of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Hand\"&gt;Red Hand&lt;/a&gt; attacked the chapel, creating panic among the guests. On the orders of the matriarch of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Meredith Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, who had a dislike for her daughter's fianc\u00e9, their leader took the life of Alexander. In the commotion, however, he too would die and be left to rot in the basement. The assassins were eventually repelled by the guards of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Arthur%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lord Arthur Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlexander's body was subsequently buried in the graveyard of the chapel, doomed to stay here for eternity as a &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; without any memory, until an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Inquisitor of the Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; came to help him, allowing the ghost to remember the causes of his death and finally be able to rest in peace.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Drust%20incursion\"&gt;Drust incursion&lt;/a&gt;, Whitegrove Chapel was still in use by the inhabitants of Drustvar. However, some &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker construct&lt;/a&gt;s were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; to attack the chapel, assassinating the &lt;a href=\"The%20Caterer\"&gt;caterer&lt;/a&gt; and interrupting the wedding that was taking place. Consequently, Lucille Waycrest once again sent the Alliance emissary there to save the guests and repel the invaders, witnessing the fury of the bride who unleashed all her anger on one of the creatures under the helpless gaze of her fianc\u00e9, who tried in vain to convince her to run away. Lucille later mentioned that they should cease having weddings here after so much tragedy.\nThe chapel now deserted, &lt;a href=\"Scavenging%20Darkmaw\"&gt;Scavenging Darkmaw&lt;/a&gt;s roam the surroundings and attack anyone on sight, while spectral guardians with the guise of guards of the House Waycrest are present near the entrance to the courtyard, haunting and surveying the surroundings."}

Along with the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, it constitutes the primary current ruling body of &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; society throughout the kingdom. It has been in existence since at least the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernmental role.\nThe presence of a senate is common to dwarven societies, as evidenced by Ironforge's Senate existing since the days of &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; forming their own &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Senate\"&gt;Shadowforge Senate&lt;/a&gt; based in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Seat\"&gt;Imperial Seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; after they were exiled from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe council has been shown to have been slightly out of touch with regional affairs, many being in denial that Dark Iron dwarves had a presence in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, for some time.\nThe Senate has had no tangible role in the events surrounding &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s \"death\" and the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;; at these times, &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been directly under the king. Thus, the Senate has traditionally not interfered with major political events transpiring within the capital. \nThe Senate's exact role in government is unclear, but their field of issues includes investigating and eliminating possible threats to Ironforge, keeping the production of the &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; mines optimal, and setting funds aside for defense issues. Senators frequently either visit threatened locations themselves or send special envoys, such as the brothers &lt;a href=\"Senir%20Whitebeard\"&gt;Senir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grelin%20Whitebeard\"&gt;Grelin Whitebeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\nSeats.\nAfter taking control of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, and due to his clan's close ties with the &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar%20family\"&gt;Anvilmar family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; offered the deposed Anvilmar prince and his descendants a permanent seat on Ironforge's senate as a token of reconciliation, and so these &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; may be senators:"}

He was so old that he does not seem have much time left. He was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Azurewing\"&gt;Azurewing&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;n brood of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, watching over them at the &lt;a href=\"Azurewing%20Repose\"&gt;Azurewing Repose&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently at peace with his age, Senegos was a calm, wise, and jovial individual. He had little patience for those he considers untrustworthy, but seemed to enjoy the company of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe and his brood clash with the &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;Withered&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Azsuna%20storyline\"&gt;Azsuna storyline&lt;/a&gt;, and he aids champions in unlocking &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; appearances later on.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span%20storyline\"&gt;Azure Span storyline&lt;/a&gt;, he, &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emmigosa\"&gt;Emmigosa&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of his brood follow &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;' call to the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;. He later died after helping the blue dragonflight to reunite again.\nHistory.\nLegion.\nAdventurers first meet Senegos in &lt;a href=\"Journey%20to%20the%20Repose\"&gt;Journey to the Repose&lt;/a&gt;, where they find his granddaughter &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, laying in a large mana pool that is sustaining him. After temporarily stabilizing his condition, Khadgar asks the blue dragon if he can help find the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;. Senegos strikes a deal that he will help if they help drive back the &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;Withered&lt;/a&gt;, mana-starved exiles from &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, who are attacking his brood. He conjures an &lt;a href=\"Projection%20of%20Senegos\"&gt;arcane projection&lt;/a&gt; to direct the counterattack personally. Senegos begrudgingly agrees to work with the exile &lt;a href=\"Runas%20the%20Shamed\"&gt;Runas the Shamed&lt;/a&gt; to take down a &lt;a href=\"shal%27dorei\"&gt;shal'dorei&lt;/a&gt; prince leading the withered, &lt;a href=\"Ael%27Yith\"&gt;Ael'Yith&lt;/a&gt;. They destroy the prince's mana feeders, allowing more mana from the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s to be directed toward Senegos' mana pool, causing the dragon to feel stronger. However, Ael'Yith escapes and leads the withered on one last charge against the Azurewing Repose, riding atop a massive &lt;a href=\"arcane%20golem\"&gt;arcane golem&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Orbyth\"&gt;Orbyth&lt;/a&gt;. With help from Khadgar and the adventurer, Ael'Yith and his forces are killed and Senegos, now empowered by the leyline's mana, claims that he has never felt better. He then directs them to the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt; to continue searching for the tidestone. He would also dedicate an entry in his &lt;a href=\"Senegos%27%20Magical%20Tome\"&gt;magical tome&lt;/a&gt; to Runas, who had attempted to warn him of the attack, but came too late and quietly withered in the nearby cave.\nHigher knowledge.\nKalecgos and the class champion arrive at the Repose to increase the potency of their artifact. Kalec is grateful to see the elder blue dragon alive and well. Senegos replied he may well not have been if not for the efforts of the adventurer. He believed how to help them by telling the class champion to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Heart of Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; alongside of picking up the &lt;a href=\"Vainglorious%20Draught\"&gt;Vainglorious Draught&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Veridis%20Fallon\"&gt;Veridis Fallon&lt;/a&gt;. Senegos also mentioned to take caution; for Azshara's minions will not relinquish the Heart easily. When the hero returned to the Repose, it was time to delve deep into the Nightmare but &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Essence\"&gt;starting light&lt;/a&gt;. Upon returning, Kalec started channeling the essence obtained from &lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately one is not simply enough he said. Senegos laughs and says that they are just beginning for now the adventurer must delve deeper into the Nightmare itself. He asks them to bring him essences from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, and states that few have returned after journeying so deep into the dark.\nUpon returning once again, the three channeled the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Essence\"&gt;Corrupted Essence&lt;/a&gt;s using the Heart and were successful. Senegos could only do so much for the adventurer. If they sought more power, &lt;a href=\"Repaid%20Debt\"&gt;they had to look elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\n&lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; calls the blue dragonflight to the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to restore their &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;disband flight&lt;/a&gt;. Senegos leads a group, including &lt;a href=\"Emmigosa\"&gt;Emmigosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, that arrive just in time to save Kalec from &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;. Senegos and the others later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt; to witness Kalec reactivating the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;, as he declares their flight renewed.\nAfter Kalecgos and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; had decided the time to come to put the essences of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; to rest at the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Ossuary\"&gt;Veiled Ossuary&lt;/a&gt;, Senegos and Stellagosa traveled there to clean the place as it had dissolved into a mess. As they traveled through the ossuary, Senegos reflected on how in his youth he had been rebellious and given the duty as gravekeeper as a means to teach him responsibility. He further reflected that it wasn't until the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, that he took it seriously. After the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gravestone\"&gt;grave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Faded%20Gravestone\"&gt;stones&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Gravestone\"&gt;of the&lt;/a&gt; slain blue dragonflights members upon the ossuary were updated, Senegos reflected on how both Malygos and Sindragosa had suffered violent ends. After Kalec and Alexstrasza arrived to put and put the pair to rest, only to cause their memories reanimate. Upon seeing them, Senegos revealed that he hadn't this phenomenon, when which &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragons&lt;/a&gt; who meet violent ends occasionally had their lingering &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy manifested as memories. The two aspects subsequently departed from the area, leaving the task of dealing with the memories to Senegos and Stellagosa. After the memories were dispelled, the pair returned to Kalec at the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt;, where more of the flight had arrived in their absence.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; created a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Locator\"&gt;Dragon Locator&lt;/a&gt; to help Kalecgos find the missing members of the flight, Senegos personally joined adventures in traveling to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Zeros\"&gt;Zeros&lt;/a&gt;, while revealing that Zeros had found himself in debt to &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their arrival, the pair discovered Zeros being confronted by the Baron, who warned that if his debt wasn't paid in full, they would balance the scales with Zeros'. Upon noticing the pair, Zeros expressed his shock at their presence, causing Senegos to reveal that they had come to bring him to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. However worried over his debt to the Baron prevented Zeros from joining them, causing Senegos to question why he didn't just eat the Baron to settle the matter. However, Zeros revealed that he didn't like violence, and that he dealt in gold, not blood. Believing that Zeros knew what to do, Senegos left them in the care of adventurers as he left to take a short nap. After Zeros and the adventurer were able to acquire the gold to pay off his debt, the Baron revealed that he owed more due to interest. However before the situation could turn violent, Senegos arrived to scare the Baron and his guards off, a fact that amused him. Thus with the matter dealt with, Senegos and his allies returned to the archives.\nAfter the rest of the blue dragonflight arrived at the archives, Senegos remained behind as &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; led a team to the ossuary to deal with the memories that had awakened once more. In time, the blue dragonflight working one used the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy within the Azure Archives to break the loop of death that Malygos and Sindragosa had found themselves trapped in. After Malygos and Sindragosa were properly soothed and released from their torment, Senegos and the rest of the blue dragonflight witnessed them departing to the afterlife. In the aftermath, Senegos remarked that his heart was brightened to see everyone reunited, that Malygos and Sindragosa were at peace, and then revealed that the time had come for him to pass on as well, as he held on for long in order to see his kin united and not in disarray. When adventurers objected arguing that they could find a way to save him, he acknowledged that they could find an artifact and noted that he had used several over the years to last as long as he did. in fact how he had. He then pointed out that there was nothing that he needed to be saved from, that it was simply his time. When Stellagosa protested his passing, Senegos declared that a life as his should be celebrated and not mourned. He further declared that &lt;a href=\"Azurewing\"&gt;Azurewing&lt;/a&gt; were hers to lead now, and that as he longed as she carried his lessons close to heart, she would never be far from him. Following this, he ascended to the power nexus at the center of the archives as his body dissipated, leaving only sparks behind.\nSometime later, Stellagosa sent adventures the &lt;a href=\"Inherited%20Wisdom%20of%20Senegos\"&gt;Inherited Wisdom of Senegos&lt;/a&gt; that he had created for them before his passing.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\n&lt;The great dragon pulls in ragged breaths.

The stone states the duty was given to them to learn responsibility. He also commented about the arcane sphere and if the wildlife there has a magnetic attraction to the sphere. We also learn from Senegos he used to be the grave keeper of the Ossuary and was given the role of grave keeper to learn responsibility.\nHe also used to make arcane spheres to clean the wildlife attaching them to the sphere he made. Therefore it might be the one who wrote the notes is Senagos.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They have sufficient numbers to cause some concern, however, they seem more than content to stay in their cave.

{"id": "211115", "revid": "819614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=211115", "title": "Sentinel's Card", "text": "A Sentinel's Card is a pledge gift given out by (&lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; seasonal &lt;a href=\"event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;. These are combined into packages which are in turn hierarchically combined with other pledge packages for &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s and rewards. \nAll of the Love is in the Air pledge gifts are non-functional as regards their name and picture. You cannot read a Sentinel's Card.\nSource.\nSentinel's Card is one of two pledge items (the other is ) that can be found inside a or a , given by Darnassus Sentinels as part of the Love is in the Air event. There is always one and only one of these two pledge items in each of these containers. (The Pledge of Friendship contains only the pledge item; the Pledge of Adoration contains functional gifts as well.) The odds of getting either pledge item appear to be about even, but in the short run you are likely to get a stack of one while trying for the other. \nYou will need one free inventory slot or a current stack of less than 20 Sentinel's Cards in order to remove a Sentinel's Card from its container. To remove the Sentinel's Card from its container, right click the Pledge of Adoration or Pledge of Friendship to open it. \nIngredient.\nIf you have five or more Sentinel's Cards in your inventory, right clicking on any of them will consume five and create a &lt;a href=\"Stack%20of%20Cards\"&gt;Stack of Cards&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nInventory space.\nThe Pledge of Adoration: Darnassus and Pledge of Friendship: Darnassus container items do not stack. Opening your Pledges of Friendship: Darnassus should save inventory space, since both pledge items stack 20 high. It is generally useful to NOT &lt;a href=\"autoloot\"&gt;autoloot&lt;/a&gt; a Pledge of Adoration container - the Love is in the Air event items quickly consume any available inventory space. If you have autoloot turned on, you can hold down the shift key while right clicking the Pledge of Adoration to not autoloot it. You can then remove only the items that you need at the moment. \nBe careful when combining these into packages, the Sentinel's Card pledge item stacks 20 high, but the Stack of Cards package item does not stack at all.\nDarnassus Sentinels.\nThere are only female s, no males, so gender identity issues not withstanding, your (male or female) character has to use a &lt;a href=\"Cologne%20Bottle\"&gt;Cologne Bottle&lt;/a&gt; to get the \"give a \" dialog, if you want to gather these pledge items. \nAll of the Darnassus Sentinels are &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt;. For the Love is in the Air gift items given by non-guard NPCs, the race of the NPC, not the location, determines which city's gift item you get. Since all of a city's guard NPCs are the same race, the distinction does not come into play for the pledge items. \nTransferability.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item. It cannot be sold at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;ed nor put in a &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt; tab, but it can be given, sold, or traded with other &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window. Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nDuration.\nThis item is &lt;a href=\"Darnassus_Gift_Collection%23Notes\"&gt;primarily&lt;/a&gt; useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year."}

She was also present in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; during the trial.\nRecently being promoted to the rank of captain, Cordressa met with King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who recognized her from Garrosh's trial, and the night elven leadership in Darnassus. Her unit was chosen to protect the Explorers' League in their mission.\nCordressa was part of an Alliance expedition sent to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to study &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and survey the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces. The first night they arrived, she befriended the gnome, &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt;. After she ate dinner, she and two other &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; left the camp to collect information regarding the Horde operations. The same night, in the perspective of Sapphronetta Flivvers, three bodies were seen. She commented that two were of dead Sentinels and the third body was something she \"didn't want to look at for fear that panic that was clawing at the back of her brain would swoop to the forefront and shut down her ability to think\". The third body was not Cordressa's and she was ultimately able to save &lt;a href=\"Gavvin%20Stoutarm\"&gt;Gavvin Stoutarm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Inge%20Ironfist\"&gt;Inge Ironfist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arwis%20Blackstone\"&gt;Arwis Blackstone&lt;/a&gt;, returning them to Darnassus with their valuable information.\nCordressa escorted High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the situation with King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; before returning to Darnassus to be assigned to the night elf expedition to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; on the first available ship. Cordressa and the rest of the night elven fleet were en route to Silithus to deter a potential Horde campaign until the night elven druid &lt;a href=\"Teshara\"&gt;Teshara&lt;/a&gt; sent word of the Horde's invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s orders to recall the fleet back to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf fleet returned just in time to fend off the Horde's incursion in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. With Malfurion creating a &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt; wall defense and the night elf fleet using its artillery to keep the Horde at bay, it seemed as if the night elves could hold the Horde off until &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s reinforcements arrive. However, the Horde dissipated the wisp wall by dividing its attention on multiple fronts and then began besieging the night elf fleet with their arcane enhanced &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s. To make matters worse, Horde infiltrators swam through the sea and commandeered some of the night elf ships.

King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sent supplies, troops, and &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s in hopes of rebuilding the former breadbasket of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and to house the &lt;a href=\"Commoner\"&gt;citizens&lt;/a&gt; of Stormwind whose homes were destroyed. From Sentinel Hill, the Brigade has been able to reclaim much of the lands, such as &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Furlbrow%27s%20Pumpkin%20Farm\"&gt;Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Jansen%20Stead\"&gt;Jansen Stead&lt;/a&gt;. The stronghold isn't finished yet, and cannot let the homeless that surround it in yet.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; attacked the area.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;, the settlement was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; noted that Sentinel Hill was being rebuilt and fortified under the supervision of Stoutmantle.\nPhasing.\nThe area is heavily involved in phasing, having three phases during questing. When the player first arrives, the area appears to be under construction and under constant attack from the Riverpaw gnolls. Low-level players should be mindful of this and not wander off should gnolls spawn on top of you. At the gate, assorted refugees are held in check by guards and will occasionally throw garbage at them and say things like, \"This is poop!\"\nAfter the quest &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Rise of the Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hope%20Saldean\"&gt;Hope Saldean&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and leader of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. She leads a sneak attack against Sentinel Hill. From there on, the town burns and is constantly attacked by the Defias instead of the gnolls, leaving only one building usable, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tower\"&gt;Sentinel Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The various trainers and vendors are crammed inside the tower and the guard NPCs stand alert near the flight master.\nIn the RPG.\nSentinel Hill is a sad garrison that houses the 300 remaining &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s who attempt to keep the peace in the whole of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. That is their intent, but about all they concentrate on is catching &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; members heading to the main road to attack &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; villages.\nThe soldiers inside are despondent and harried, for their job is difficult and the Alliance claims it has no more resources for them. They welcome aid from anyone who offers but regret that they cannot pay mercenaries. Thus, they receive little assistance. They try to protect the &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s in Westfall, but the free &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;s are spaced throughout the land and guarding the safety of them all is difficult."}

Around the &lt;a href=\"West%20Sanctum\"&gt;West Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Scout\"&gt;Darnassian Scout&lt;/a&gt;s were working together with the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Anvilward\"&gt;Prospector Anvilward&lt;/a&gt; who, playing the role of an envoy of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, befriended the blood elves, notably &lt;a href=\"Ley-Keeper%20Caidanis\"&gt;Ley-Keeper Caidanis&lt;/a&gt;. He gathered information such as detailed maps of different strategic buildings in Eversong Woods or a diagram of an arcane sanctum sketched in good detail, accompanied with numerous notes, and delivered the secret &lt;a href=\"Incriminating%20Documents\"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; to the night elves, who sabotaged a sanctum.\nAfter Prospector Anvilward's duplicitous role was discovered by the blood elves, open hostilities began between the two factions. The rogue &lt;a href=\"Keltus%20Darkleaf\"&gt;Keltus Darkleaf&lt;/a&gt; went spying on them and sent his companion, &lt;a href=\"Whisper%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Whisper&lt;/a&gt;, to strike at them but the bat was killed immediately. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf%20Plans\"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; for most of their actions were found by the sin'dorei at Shalandis, while the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Leader\"&gt;Sentinel Leader&lt;/a&gt; was neutralized at An'daroth.

{"id": "18903", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18903", "title": "Sentinels", "text": "The Sentinels (officially the Sentinel Army) are the primary military arm of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; race. Founded in the years following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the old &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Sentinels serve as &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;'s army in its engagements throughout &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and beyond.\nThe organization is composed of devout and well-trained warriors, often with strong ties to the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The Sentinels form the majority night elven component of the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Army\"&gt;Darnassian Army&lt;/a&gt;, which encompasses numerous other beings and unit types.\nIn the wake of its war with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; led the night elf race, and particularly the Sisterhood, in rebuilding their ruined society. Her order was uniquely poised to fill a power vacuum as a result of their numbers and influence, and Tyrande soon took advantage of this. From the ranks of the Sisterhood of Elune, she forged the Sentinels, whose duty it was to protect their newly-emergent society. Quickly cementing itself in this role, the Sentinels became the fledgling night elf nation's primary agents and guardians.\nIn the millennia to come, the Sentinels would take part in many conflicts on behalf of Darnassus, most immediately in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the army's composition would begin to change, incorporating more male night elves into its ranks, and utilizing more military hardware. Today, Tyrande is recognized as their former general, and the Sentinel Army is led in battle by the distinguished &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;General Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, with its largest base of operations (outside of Darnassus) at &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground and history.\nMembership.\nThe Sentinels were established approximately 600 years after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and until recently were entirely composed of night elf women. The immense casualties suffered in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; would eventually force the traditional gender roles of night elven society to be set aside in favor of a more practical approach. As a result, although the Sentinels remain mostly female, an increasing number of night elf men serve in their ranks.\nThe Sentinels are courageous and selfless soldiers whose only goal for the last ten millennia has been to defend the night elf people. New recruits undergo extensive training and, as time permits, the more experienced warriors take part in frequent combat drills. The Third War resulted in many losses for the Sentinels, but the army still boasts a number of battle-hardened veterans. Like High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and General &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, there are still plenty of Sentinels in active service who fought in the War of the Ancients.\nEarly history and organization.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, military service in the night elf &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; had become more a matter of bloodline than ability. Almost all high-ranking officers were nobles, and the night elves had lived in peace for so long that very few of those officers, however privileged and well educated, possessed even a basic knowledge of tactics. Joining the army, once a selfless choice to defend the night elf people, had been reduced to a status symbol. At this time, the &lt;a href=\"Windstrikers\"&gt;Windstrikers&lt;/a&gt; developed the gauntlets the Sentinels would wear.\nThe &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; made the army's deterioration all too clear. After the night elves and their allies had finally achieved victory, High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; decreed sweeping changes throughout night elf society. The &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few major organizations to survive the war largely intact, and membership in its ranks had never been a matter of breeding. Furthermore, members of the order had trained extensively in combat, tactics, and healing. Yet in spite of all their knowledge and experience, the priestesses had become somewhat distant from the rest of night elf society.\nTyrande believed that this distance was partly to blame for the cataclysmic war, and she resolved that her order would take up the duty of directing the Sentinels. Never again would the Sisters of Elune fail to guide the night elves. To this day, the General of the Sentinel Army &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; still reports to Tyrande, who is both the High Priestess of Elune and, until &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; returned, sole ruler of the night elf government.\nThese warrior women practiced both the art of combat, as well as that of healing and life-giving in the name of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The Sentinels quickly came to be considered the elite fighters among the night elves. In particular, they favored the &lt;a href=\"moonglaive\"&gt;moonglaive&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon of choice. They are led by the &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestesses of the moon&lt;/a&gt; under the High Priestess, Tyrande Whisperwind; her lieutenant, and General of the Sentinel Army, is &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;. The Sentinels are comprised of elite night elf archers, a cavalry division known as the &lt;a href=\"huntress\"&gt;huntress&lt;/a&gt;es who ride the feral &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;s, and the mighty &lt;a href=\"hippogryph%20rider\"&gt;hippogryph rider&lt;/a&gt;s, who assault enemies from the air. One of the most important functions of the Sentinels became guarding kaldorei towns and cities. Almost all such settlements possess a contingent of these warriors.\nIn addition to their defensive role, the Sentinels were also used to strike at the night elves' foes. 975 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, they, along with other units, rallied under &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Though they suffered heavy casualties in pushing the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; back, the night elves were successful in temporarily ending this threat to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sentinel Army later fought in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, initially working with &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;. Cenarius and his Sentinel force would ultimately be overrun by the orcish forces (empowered by demon blood), with the &lt;a href=\"demi-god\"&gt;demi-god&lt;/a&gt; himself falling. Later, the Sentinels were called on to directly battle the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as it pushed into Kalimdor during a wider invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Led directly by High Priestess Tyrande, they launched numerous attacks on both the demons and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in their forests. Even the Sentinels could not withstand the Legion's advance, however, and were gradually forced back to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the Sentinels and the rest of the kaldorei fought heroically alongside the Alliance and Horde to halt the demons. The effort cost all sides dearly, but the elves and their allies were able to buy enough time for a plan devised by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Atop the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the demon commander &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; would be decisively defeated when the tree's energies were intentionally ignited. The ensuing explosion decimated the demon forces and spelled victory for the night elves.\nTerror of the Tides.\nSoon after the victory in the Third War, the Sentinels would accompany Maiev, and eventually Tyrande and Malfurion Stormrage, on a mission to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving on the Broken Isles, those under Maiev engaged with the vast &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; forces loyal to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and worked their way through the archipelago to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. As the conflict progressed, they were reinforced just in time by an expeditionary force from Kalimdor under Tyrande and Malfurion. Together, they shattered Illidan's remaining forces in the area, though the Betrayer escaped to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sentinel expedition quickly pursued Illidan to Lordaeron, where they were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; running rampant across the fallen kingdom. Tyrande, Malfurion, and Maiev led the night elves through the onslaught and on to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; where Illidan was performing a dangerous ritual. Along the way, Tyrande was separated from the other kaldorei, fortifying a small position with a handful of Sentinels downriver. After triumphing over Illidan's naga and more undead at Dalaran, the main night elf force rescued Tyrande and her soldiers just in time, even briefly fighting on the same side as the naga to do so. Their mission complete, Malfurion and Tyrande would return to Kalimdor with their Sentinels, while Maiev and the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; continued their hunt for Illidan.\nThe sub-faction called &lt;a href=\"Shadowleaves\"&gt;Shadowleaves&lt;/a&gt; existed during the Third War but its current status is unknown. It is possible that it was wiped out or decimated to a point of dissolution during the conflict between the night elves and orcs.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Sentinels and the night elves would find a new home in the form of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, off Kalimdor's northern coast. The capital of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; located here quickly became the center of kaldorei political, spiritual, and military power in the world. Over time, the calm of Teldrassil's enchanted forests would slowly fall into the shadow of a &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;sinister presence&lt;/a&gt;. Crazed &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and fouler beasts began to appear on Teldrassil, occupying all the attention of the ever-vigilant Sentinels and the wise &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFurther to the south, tensions with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would further demand the presence of the Sentinel Army. Years after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves began a massive push to retake the forests of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. focusing their efforts on ridding the land of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. The &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in particular would answer the call, swearing not to rest until every last &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and cast out of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, the battle over the area remains fierce. The Sentinels also remained wary of more local threats, such as recent furbolg attacks into Ashenvale.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loh%27atu\"&gt;Loh'atu&lt;/a&gt; promised the Sentinels that he would help them with &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowsong%20Shrine\"&gt;Shadowsong Shrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe night elves also began deploying Sentinels to distant lands at this time, often in honoring their duties as part of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Several units were thus present in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; assisting the &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinels was likewise sent to pressure the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, where they established themselves on &lt;a href=\"Shalandis%20Isle\"&gt;Shalandis Isle&lt;/a&gt; with the aim of spying on the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sentinels stood alongside their &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; brethren during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and were among the first Azerothians to push through the reopened &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. They would take part in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland%23Prelude\"&gt;Battle for the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, mostly as archers in support of the front line troops, and continued to hold the line as a foothold was established. Later in the campaign, Sentinel units were active in the region of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountain\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, where they established the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanaar\"&gt;Sylvanaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinels were among the multitude of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces that composed the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, many night elf soldiers were by this time members of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which spearheaded the Alliance's advance against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. A predominantly Sentinel outpost in the form of &lt;a href=\"Stars%27%20Rest\"&gt;Stars' Rest&lt;/a&gt; was established in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, and served as a base for operations against the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in the area.\nStormrage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris commanded the Sentinels and the Sisters of Elune to help the inhabitants of the ruined Darnassus. After the &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; reunited, they attended the wedding of the night elven leaders, ensuring that no one would cause trouble as well as acting as honor guard during the ceremony.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a dozen Sentinels guarding a crop caravan were attacked and killed by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Blame for the act would, however, be manipulated to fall on the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and their new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Two soldiers arrived in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to report the attack to High King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. These events would result in a meeting between &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; challenging Garrosh to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; duel.\nCataclysm.\nAmong the foremost guardians of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the Sentinels were some of the first to respond to emergent threats to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a latent &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; buried deep within the tree itself had begun to emerge, and threatened to overtake the region. The Sentinels continued to draw on all available recruits to aid their efforts, especially around the area of &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen\"&gt;Shadowglen&lt;/a&gt;. These forces dealt with many new enemies across Teldrassil, particularly the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Gnarlpine%20tribe\"&gt;Gnarlpine tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s based from &lt;a href=\"Ban%27ethil%20Hollow\"&gt;Ban'ethil Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Sentinel forces were also dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Glade\"&gt;Oracle Glade&lt;/a&gt;, to push back an encroaching colony of &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the corruption afflicting Teldrassil was decisively purged, and the future of the World Tree secured.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; would send considerable aid to the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt;s as they tried to fend off the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. A contingent of Sentinels with heavy siege weaponry accompanied a major fleet that landed at &lt;a href=\"Keel%20Harbor\"&gt;Keel Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the Sentinels and Gilneans bought the civilian populace time to evacuate by ship, delivering the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s from their ruined homeland.\nThe region of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; suffered heavily from the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the Sentinels were vital in responding to the aftermath. Along the coast near &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinels mounted on &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s worked to rescue many civilians fleeing the ruined town. Though numerous night elves were rescued, many did not survive the ordeal.\nOne of the most serious threats facing the Sentinel Army in Darkshore became the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s to the north. Having allied with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls began attacking night elf scouts and garrisons as they prepared for all-out war. The Sentinels responded by sending a contingent of troops to the north from &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict quickly escalated as both sides fought within the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Mathystra\"&gt;Ruins of Mathystra&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Sentinel forces attacked the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20War%20Camp\"&gt;Shatterspear War Camp&lt;/a&gt; (reinforced by the Horde) in preparation for a full assault on &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The kaldorei were successful in sacking the War Camp, while also slaying much of the Shatterspear leadership.\nWasting no time, a Sentinel army suddenly marched on Shatterspear Vale in full force, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s and siege weapons. The attack overwhelmed the troll defenders, who were pushed back into their encampment. There, the invading Sentinels crushed the remaining defenders, while also killing the Shatterspear leader &lt;a href=\"Jor%27kil%20the%20Soulripper\"&gt;Jor'kil the Soulripper&lt;/a&gt;. The decisive victory in Shatterspear Vale ended the troll threat in Darkshore for the foreseeable future, while securing Lor'danel's northern flank.\nThroughout Darkshore, the Sentinels, serving as the region's local defenders, continued to battle the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult. As part of this, the ruined town of Auberdine was retaken and the Twilight's Hammer plans in the area dashed. The cult's presence in Darkshore, and the damage caused by their actions, was ultimately contained, though the local population had suffered greatly.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the Sentinel Army suffered determined attacks from the &lt;a href=\"Hatecrest\"&gt;Hatecrest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nelara\"&gt;Nelara&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with the evacuation of the civilians from the &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. The naga eventually drove them from the Stronghold. The night elf forces, led by Sentinel General &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, relocated to the mainland where they built a &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;new fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The Sentinels remained undeterred, however, and launched a massive effort to push the naga out of their territory. With help from Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris and her forces were successful in crushing the invaders' ranks and slaying their leader.\nThe new war effort in Feralas at this time would lead to several changes for the Sentinels themselves, such as the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Moonclaw%20Warrior\"&gt;Moonclaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; to their ranks for the first time. General Feathermoon herself would mentor at least three of the worgen to serve as her lieutenants.\nIn other parts of Feralas, the night elves worked against &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; clan, who sought to abuse ancient powers within &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;. To properly wage this campaign, the Sentinels called on their allies from the forests, including local &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s. Their forces rallied, the kaldorei confronted Cho'gall himself in Dire Maul's arena, where they decisively defeated him. This victory would end &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; influence in Dire Maul, and firmly drive the cult from Feralas.\nUnder orders from Shandris Feathermoon, Sentinel and Alliance forces would further make war on the &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s in southern Feralas. The gnolls were eventually dealt with, and the Sentinels further rallied the region's &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s for their war effort. Other threats neutralized at this time included the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; infesting the &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20Deep\"&gt;Writhing Deep&lt;/a&gt;, and the ogre garrison at the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni%20Outpost\"&gt;Gordunni Outpost&lt;/a&gt;.\nSentinels forces would also engage with the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; in and around &lt;a href=\"New%20Thalanaar\"&gt;New Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; in Feralas's far east. The &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; laid siege to the outpost in an attempt to seize the area, and fighting between them and the kaldorei defenders would spill over into neighboring &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. This particular conflict would continue for some time.\nThe war for &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; would see some of the fiercest fighting for the Sentinels in all of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; began a renewed campaign to conquer the region. Across the zone, Sentinel forces worked to halt or turn back the Horde's advance centered on &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, with varying degrees of success.\nSmall-scale skirmishes with the Horde would occur at &lt;a href=\"Bathran%27s%20Haunt\"&gt;Bathran's Haunt&lt;/a&gt;, and in the areas surrounding Astranaar. Astranaar itself was also attacked by &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Hellions\"&gt;Hellscream's Hellions&lt;/a&gt; from the air, and the town was subsequently set on fire. Sentinel and Alliance forces were eventually able to control the blaze, while using &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s to repel the airborne attackers. Throughout the coming campaign, Astranaar would remain intact as the Sentinels' main base in Ashenvale.\nEarly in the conflict, the fortified position at &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first bases to fall to the Horde, who turned the resident &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s against the sentinel defenders. The surviving forces would regroup at &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20Spire\"&gt;Stardust Spire&lt;/a&gt;, as Silverwind became the Horde's launching point for the coming campaign. The Sentinel Army would strike would go on the offensive against the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt; to the east, with the intention of interrupting their logging efforts there. Accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20War\"&gt;Ancients of War&lt;/a&gt;, the sentinels rampaged through the camp itself, slaying &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Gorthak\"&gt;Overseer Gorthak&lt;/a&gt;, and laid siege to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn preparing to try and retake Silverwind Refuge, the night elves based from Stardust Spire chose to deal with the befouled water elementals of &lt;a href=\"Mystral%20Lake\"&gt;Mystral Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, they were able to purge many of the elementals, as well as the corruption's source: &lt;a href=\"Tideress\"&gt;Tideress&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike Astranaar and other outposts, &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt; was also targeted by the Horde. Ground forces accompanied by &lt;a href=\"demolisher\"&gt;demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s battered the small Sentinel garrison commanded by &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Onaeya\"&gt;Sentinel Onaeya&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the odds, the tide was turned by the intervention of Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, who led small Sentinel strike teams to effectively cripple the Horde forces and their artillery. Responsible for controlling the surrounding area of the forest, Maestra's Post continued to act as a strategic asset for the kaldorei.\nThe vanguard of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; made contact with Sentinel troops stationed at &lt;a href=\"Raynewood%20Tower\"&gt;Raynewood Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raynewood%20Retreat\"&gt;Raynewood Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, another of the night elves' forward outposts. The tower's defenders were aided in their struggle by local &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s. Raynewood would eventually be reinforced with the Forest Heart, allowing the defenders to summon the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Shadumbra\"&gt;Shade of Shadumbra&lt;/a&gt; against their foes. The essence of this great cat was highly effective at tearing through the Warsong ranks, defeating at least 50 of the attackers along with much of their artillery. This marked a major Sentinel victory that decisively preserved Raynewood.\nAs the conflict began to spill over into the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinel &lt;a href=\"huntress\"&gt;huntress&lt;/a&gt;es and other Alliance forces struck against Horde elements around the border. Specifically, &lt;a href=\"Krom%27gar%20Incinerator\"&gt;Krom'gar Incinerator&lt;/a&gt;s destroying the local flora were attacked and routed. At Silverwind Refuge, the Sentinels further gathered intelligence on the new Horde weapon known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bomb\"&gt;The Bomb&lt;/a&gt;\", while also dealing with &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bombgineer%20Sploder\"&gt;Chief Bombgineer Sploder&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sentinel Army formed a large part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign against the Horde throughout Stonetalon. Fighting would prove especially fierce around &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Overlook\"&gt;Thal'darah Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, where Sentinels (along with other Alliance forces) held off a determined Horde siege. In the midst of the battle, the nearby &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Grove\"&gt;Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt; would be bombed by the Horde, though this night elven settlement was unaffiliated with the Darnassian Army. Prior to this at &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Hold\"&gt;Windshear Hold&lt;/a&gt;, a squadron of Sentinel huntresses were sent to scout the Horde's intentions; though many were captured, they would ultimately be freed by Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the wake of the destruction of Thal'darah Grove, the Sentinel forces at Thal'darah Overlook attempted to punch a hole through the Horde's lines to make contact with the base at &lt;a href=\"Farwatcher%27s%20Glen\"&gt;Farwatcher's Glen&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s, they were successful in cutting through the sieging force and reaching the glen to the south.\nAway from the conflict with the Horde, at &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinels would find themselves attacked by minions of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; as a wave of corruption swept across the area. Many sentinels were overcome by this malignant force and turned on their sisters as they tried to fight back the tide. Under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Mistress%20Geleneth\"&gt;Sentinel Mistress Geleneth&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves gradually began to make progress, destroying the invading &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and laying their corrupted brethren to rest.\n&lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Point\"&gt;Trueshot Point&lt;/a&gt; would be set up as an extension of &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20Spire\"&gt;Stardust Spire&lt;/a&gt; into Stonetalon Mountains. There, Darnassian cannoneers commanded by &lt;a href=\"Kalen%20Trueshot\"&gt;Kalen Trueshot&lt;/a&gt; began using &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s to strike against Horde air forces in Stonetalon to great effect.\nLater, a group of Sentinels rescued &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and his friends from the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. They served &lt;a href=\"Master%20Thal%27darah\"&gt;Master Thal'darah&lt;/a&gt; and normally patrolled the perimeter of &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Overlook\"&gt;Thal'darah Overlook&lt;/a&gt; or checked paths for stray Horde &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Sentinels and night elves were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; in search of the &lt;a href=\"Rethiel%20the%20Greenwarden\"&gt;Greenwarden&lt;/a&gt;, where they established &lt;a href=\"Greenwarden%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Greenwarden's Grove&lt;/a&gt;. There they would come into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, though the Sentinels were easily able to hold off the orcs' attacks.\nThe night elves continued to hold a military foothold in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt;, which became a target of the Horde based from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. While the Sentinels held the front line against orc grunts, Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; would slip through and help undermine the defense from the rear.\nWolfheart.\nSoon after the evacuation of &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt;s, the Sentinels participated in the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing Maiev's betrayal, Tyrande appointed Shandris to assist &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; in choosing from among the Sentinels some possible candidates for his new security force.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe Sentinels would travel to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; upon its discovery, becoming the first &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces to arrive in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, where they established the &lt;a href=\"Incursion\"&gt;Incursion&lt;/a&gt;. This force had been sent by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; herself to search for a prophesied \"source of Light\", which they believed to be the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Youth\"&gt;Pools of Youth&lt;/a&gt;. In searching for the pools, the night elf expedition clashed with the local &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a similar expeditionary force of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, the kaldorei moved on to the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; under Sentinel Commander &lt;a href=\"Lyalia\"&gt;Lyalia&lt;/a&gt;, where they reached the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sentinels later made up part of the united Alliance war effort in the Landfall campaign. Collectively named , this invasion force waged a major campaign against the Horde in Krasarang Wilds from &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Sentinels were particularly involved in recovering the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, though it was later stolen under their watch from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; itself by agents of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey also participated in the in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, transporting and escorting war resources taken from the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; out of the area.\nThe Sentinel Army took part in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; along with other Alliance armies, landing forces in &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; as they pushed towards the city gates. Tyrande herself led a force of mounted sentinels that punched through Orgrimmar's main gate using siege weapons, preventing a protracted siege from developing. These sentinels would also buy time for other forces to get into the city and continue the battle.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nSeveral Sentinel &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Sentinel\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; accompanied the Alliance into , guarding &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Outpost\"&gt;Starfall Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. They also had a small presence in and in &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf chosen, they can also guard the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinel units gathered in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied the Alliance forces into the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;first battle&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. They were also present in several areas of the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;assaults&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth where they established &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions%23Randomized%20military%20camps\"&gt;military camps&lt;/a&gt; to protect Alliance assets.\nLater, General &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and several members of the Sentinels joined the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and assisted the &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s in their campaigns, such as fighting the Legion in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral Sentinels also accompanied &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sentinels' largest operation on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; came during the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande Whisperwind personally led a large night elven army to the region to support the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; rebels in their war against &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. Along with &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements, the kaldorei laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, before pushing into the metropolis itself. A major Sentinel war camp was subsequently set up on the city limits. They would suffer several setbacks at the gate of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, but the rebellion was ultimately successful.\nBefore the Storm.\nCaptain &lt;a href=\"Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt;'s unit was sent to act as guards for the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; team that was sent to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. They were ultimately killed by the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAs part of the opening stages of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; readied itself for conquest on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Believing the focus of the conflict to be in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance dispatched much of the Sentinel Army by sea as reinforcements to the region. As the fleet was en route, it was revealed that the Horde had instead stolen a march on &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; with the intent on pushing straight to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Thinly-spread Sentinel forces in the area were unable to withstand the united Horde attack, and most of the region's outposts quickly fell.\nWith only the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Darnassian City Guard&lt;/a&gt; to protect many of their holdings, the kaldorei would eventually lose &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, as the invaders pressed on to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Captain &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; directed the defense of the night elven territories, as the Sentinels worked frantically to slow the Horde. The most concentrated fighting initially occurred in southern and central Darkshore. Though the Sentinels inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, their numbers were overwhelming. The Sentinel commanders are especially targeted and killed by Horde rogues.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt;, the Darnassian Army was able to temporarily stop the Horde's advance, with both sides drawn into a military stalemate. Meanwhile, the fleet bound for Silithus returned with the majority of the Sentinel Army, further reinforcing the lines. All remaining Sentinel forces in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; were now called on to join the fight. Despite their stalwart defense, the remainder of Darkshore would eventually fall to the Horde when they flanked &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. The Sentinels continued to resist the Horde in the area, even after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; that marked the end of night elf dominance in the region. Some sentinels in Darnassus were rescued before its destruction along with some civilians. Many of these displaced kaldorei would take refuge in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nSentinel units made up some of the attacking force during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Siege of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched in response to the events at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remaining Sentinels in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; were under the command of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Thenysil\"&gt;Sentinel Tara Thenysil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Jalin\"&gt;Huntress Jalin&lt;/a&gt; led her Sentinels against &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to retake it for the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Big%20Baobob\"&gt;Big Baobob&lt;/a&gt; allied with the Sentinels.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the Fourth War, Zekhan reported that forest roads in Darkshore were once highly patrolled, but now they're mostly left alone, with Tyrande and her remaining Sentinels focusing their wrath elsewhere. They were still active in Ashenvale and attacking &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt; regularly and patroling the Ashenvale border with &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Jalin\"&gt;Huntress Jalin&lt;/a&gt;. According to Horde reports, they managed to destroy every siege weapon the Horde brought down from the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the broken machines and the bodies of engineers at the doorstep of Stardust Spire as a warning to their enemies.\nSentinel divisions.\nUnits.\nMembers of the Sentinel Army can be proficient in a wide variety of skills, from &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; riding to the use of siege weaponry. As such, the army is able to fill many unique roles on the battlefield. Primary examples of these include:\nIn the RPG.\nThe Sentinels, also known as Sentinel Army, are an elite guard belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Given the threat of invasion that constantly looms, few roles are as critical to the defense of the land as the sentinel. Sentinels perform guard duty. Sentinel is an ancient title, its skills are rooted in ancient tradition from even before the time of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nSentinels are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light and medium armor, due to her extensive study of her foes and training in the proper techniques for combating them. In addition, sentinels are proficient in the use of arrows as a melee weapon. As a class, it shares elements from archer, hunter, and scout classes. Their hatred of orcs has also fueled their participation in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, many sentinels, druids and warrior night elves began a great hunt. Some night elves happily hunt orcs as a repayment for Cenarius\u2019 murder. &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20wild\"&gt;Druids of the wild&lt;/a&gt; now strive to heal and restore the land, while sentinels keep their eternal watch for enemies both seen and unseen.\nSentinels share almost the exact customs as high elf rangers, to the point where you can only tell the difference by race. Many Sentinels fulfill their duties as huntresses, riding astride great nightsaber panthers, or as windwarriors astride hippogryphs. Sentinels are also the night elf version of &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt; class.\nGallery.\nFanart"}

{"id": "211819", "revid": "36976871", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=211819", "title": "Handling events", "text": "Events are messages sent by the WoW client to UI code (OnEvent script handlers of Frame derivatives), mostly in reaction to things occurring in the game world. To process events, an addon needs to create an event handler and register it for the events it wishes to receive.\nSetting up an event handler.\nEvents are sent to Frame-derived &lt;a href=\"Widget%20API\"&gt;widgets&lt;/a&gt;; an add-on needs to create a frame if it does not already own one that can be used for the purpose of handling events. Frames may be created in Lua using the &lt;a href=\"API_CreateFrame\"&gt;CreateFrame&lt;/a&gt; function; or constructed in XML (using the &lt;Frame&gt; tag).\nOnce a frame has been created, its OnEvent handler must be set to a function that would handle the event on behalf of the addon. The OnEvent script handler may be set using the Lua frame:&lt;a href=\"API_Frame_SetScript\"&gt;SetScript&lt;/a&gt;() function; or constructed in XML (using &lt;Scripts&gt;&lt;OnEvent&gt;function body&lt;/OnEvent&gt;&lt;/Scripts&gt;). The OnEvent handler function receives at least two arguments: \nThe addon's OnEvent script handler function should either handle the event, or call another addon function to handle the event.\nIn order to receive event notifications, the event handler frame needs to be registered for events the addon needs to handle; use frame:&lt;a href=\"API_Frame_RegisterEvent\"&gt;RegisterEvent&lt;/a&gt;(\"eventName\") to achieve this. The RegisterEvent function can can be called at any time after the frame's creation; the OnLoad script handler is a convenient location to register for the desired events when using XML.\nIf you no longer wish to receive event notifications for a particular event, use the frame:&lt;a href=\"API_Frame_UnregisterEvent\"&gt;UnregisterEvent&lt;/a&gt;() function. If you wish to disable all event notifications currently delivered to a frame, use the frame:&lt;a href=\"API_Frame_UnregisterAllEvents\"&gt;UnregisterAllEvents&lt;/a&gt;().\nExamples.\nHello World.\nThe two implementations below are functionally identical: they print \"Hello World! Hello PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD\" to the default chat frame when the character zones into the world. Note that the event variable is implicit in the XML OnEvent handler: it is supplied by the OnEvent closure signature.\nUsing XML\n&lt;Ui&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"FooAddonFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt; self:RegisterEvent(\"PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD\"); &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;OnEvent&gt; print(\"Hello World! Hello \" .. event); &lt;/OnEvent&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n&lt;/Ui&gt;\nUsing Lua\nlocal frame = CreateFrame(\"FRAME\", \"FooAddonFrame\");\nframe:RegisterEvent(\"PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD\");\nlocal function eventHandler(self, event, ...)\n print(\"Hello World! Hello \" .. event);\nend\nframe:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", eventHandler);\nXML-Specific.\nYou may bind an already declared Lua function to the OnEvent handler in XML directly, rather than creating another function by providing a function body within the &lt;OnEvent&gt;&lt;/OnEvent&gt; tags. Doing so will save you memory:\nFooAddOn.lua\nfunction FooHandler_OnEvent(self, event, ...)\n -- insert event handling code here\nend\nFooAddOn.xml\n&lt;Ui&gt;\n &lt;Script file=\"FooAddon.lua\"/&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"FooHandler\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnEvent function=\"FooHandler_OnEvent\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n&lt;/Ui&gt;\nLua-specific.\nIf your frame registers a large number of events, you could reduce the required number of if clauses, and generally simplify your design by doing:\nlocal frame, events = CreateFrame(\"Frame\"), {};\nfunction events:PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD(...)\n -- handle PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD here\nend\nfunction events:PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD(...)\n -- handle PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD here\nend\nframe:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", function(self, event, ...)\n events[event](self, ...); -- call one of the functions above\nend);\nfor k, v in pairs(events) do\n frame:RegisterEvent(k); -- Register all events for which handlers have been defined\nend\nNote that in the case of the events:XXX functions above, the variable self, implicitly defined by using the function table:functionName notation, will point to the frame handling the event rather than the events table.\nThe vararg expression.\nThe vararg expression (...) may contain additional arguments supplied by the event. Arguments contained in ... can be read by simply assigning them to other variables, possibly using the &lt;a href=\"API_select\"&gt;select&lt;/a&gt; function to skip forward to a specific argument in the list.\nConsider the example of handling &lt;a href=\"API_COMBAT_LOG_EVENT\"&gt;COMBAT_LOG_EVENT&lt;/a&gt;:\nfunction eventHandler(self, event, ...)\n if event == \"COMBAT_LOG_EVENT\" then\n local timestamp, combatEvent, hideCaster, sourceGUID, sourceName, sourceFlags, sourceRaidFlags, destGUID, destName, destFlags, destRaidFlags = ...; -- Those arguments appear for all combat event variants.\n local eventPrefix, eventSuffix = combatEvent:match(\"^(.-)_?([^_]*)$\");\n if eventSuffix == \"DAMAGE\" then\n -- Something dealt damage. The last 9 arguments in ... describe how much damage was dealt.\n -- To extract those, we can use the select function:\n local numArgumentsInVarArg = select(\"#\", ...)\n local amount, overkill, school, resisted, blocked, absorbed, critical, glancing, crushing = select(numArgumentsInVarArg - 8, ...);\n -- Do something with the damage details ... \n if eventPrefix == \"RANGE\" or eventPrefix:match(\"^SPELL\") then\n -- The first three arguments for these prefixes (appearing after the 11 common to all COMBAT_LOG_EVENTs) \n -- describe the spell or ability dealing damage. Extract these using select:\n local spellId, spellName, spellSchool = select(12, ...); -- Everything from 12th argument in ... onward\n -- Do something with the spell details ...\n end\n end\n end\nend"}

(The Gift of Friendship contains only the token gift; the Gift of Adoration contains other functional gifts as well.) \nYou will need one free inventory slot or a current stack of less than 20 Handmade Woodcrafts in order to remove a Handmade Woodcraft from its container.

It is generally useful to NOT &lt;a href=\"autoloot\"&gt;autoloot&lt;/a&gt; a Gift of Adoration container - the Love is in the Air event items quickly consume any available inventory space. If you have autoloot turned on, you can hold down the shift key while right clicking the Gift of Adoration to not autoloot it.

He then joined in a fight under the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Worldbreaker\"&gt;Iron Worldbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and left Tanaan.\nHansel alongside &lt;a href=\"Burrian%20Coalpart\"&gt;Burrian Coalpart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scorchbrow\"&gt;Scorchbrow&lt;/a&gt; and some others later ventured into &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; originally to spy on the , as no one knows how to fight Blackrocks better than Dark Iron dwarves. They got separated but Hansel and his group managed to build a station which they named &lt;a href=\"Moira%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Moira's Reach&lt;/a&gt;. They soon located an artifact in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Botani\"&gt;Botani&lt;/a&gt; and the dwarves decided to take it. They were, however, captured, some of them even killed, but Hansel managed to return to the base which was under the attack of &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt;. They took the &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Genesaur\"&gt;Will of the Genesaur&lt;/a&gt; under the base. Reunited with Thaelin and Burrian, the dwarves blasted the Bastion's cannon to aid in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, he arrived to where he tried to release the draenei captives in &lt;a href=\"Telaar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt; from the hands of the Warsong orcs. He was unsuccessful and was captured but soon released by the commander. He returned to &lt;a href=\"Telaari%20Station\"&gt;Telaari Station&lt;/a&gt; and commanded the adventurers to deal with the ogres in &lt;a href=\"Mar%27gok%27s%20Overwatch\"&gt;Mar'gok's Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; as well as with the Burning Blade orcs in &lt;a href=\"Hallvalor\"&gt;Hallvalor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, he arrived to Thaelin's secret station in Gorgrond, but orcs found it. They tied Hansel up but took Thaelin. With the help of the commander, both dwarves were rescued and returned to &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; for a brief time."}

The heat... We lost the whole town.\n refused to pull back when the flames engulfed us. Our forces are scattered. Maybe some of the others survived? We can mount a counter-attack!\nGo into the &lt;a href=\"Scorched%20Plain\"&gt;Scorched Plain&lt;/a&gt; and rescue any lost wardens that got separated from the group. Then find Captain Irontree - he's probably taken up a fortified postion in the middle of the fighting.\nRewards.\nYou will receive: \nProgress.\nWhat?\nCompletion.\nYou've assembled the survivors? Good, good. And the rest of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;the mountain&lt;/a&gt; - healed?\nHaha strike me down! We're on the front lines again!\nNotes.\nPick up &lt;a href=\"Breakthrough\"&gt;Breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; before heading out. Head east along the road, killing and saving along the way. Keep heading east to find a ruined inn filled to the rafters with Irontree Wardens guarding it. Irontree is at inside on the bottom floor. Above him is , offering a fetch quest, &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Recycling%20Program\"&gt;Hyjal Recycling Program&lt;/a&gt;. Pick it up before killing all of the scorchlords."}
