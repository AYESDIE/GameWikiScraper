Among the ornate spires and enchanted streets of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the great Violet Hold stands as a testament to the glory of the city's rulers. Its cells are magically-shielded. Yet within its mighty walls, a dark truth awaits. Much history is attached to this secure vault, with it being destroyed and rebuilt during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Storing a number of powerful &lt;a href=\"prisoner\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt;s, it has become a target for invaders as prison breaking the inmates has made it a popular invasion point for the envisioned fall of Dalaran.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, as far as he knows, no one actually escaped the magically shielded cells of the Violet Hold.\nHistory.\nFilled with row upon row of deadly inmates, Violet Hold has long been used to restrain threats to Dalaran.\nThe Third War.\nIn \", a &lt;a href=\"Council%20Wizard\"&gt;Council Wizard&lt;/a&gt; was present in the Hold and was summoning &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Prisoners\"&gt;various prisoners&lt;/a&gt;, sending them at the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;razed Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in search for the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas and Kel'Thuzad discovered some creatures which the Kirin Tor had, according to Kel'Thuzad, \"caged for studying\". Although no sources confirm it, this might have been an early version of the Violet Hold.\nDuring the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Lord Garithos&lt;/a&gt; caught the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; - led by Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; - consorting with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, and forging a desperate alliance with her &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Garithos branded him a traitor and threw him in a magical cell in the dungeons underneath the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Kael found himself confined in the prison until &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; broke him out, during their escape they put to rest the souls of four archmagi: &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conjurus%20Rex\"&gt;Conjurus Rex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fordred%20Aran\"&gt;Fordred Aran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Landazar\"&gt;Landazar&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to Arthas and Kel'Thuzad, they also found a &lt;a href=\"Experiment%20Furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Experiment%20Ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;, which were experiments of the wizards of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and let them loose upon Garithos' guards. They also fought against some trapped &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and rescued the rest of the imprisoned blood elves. Finally, Kael'thas and the rescued blood elves killed &lt;a href=\"Jailor%20Kassan\"&gt;Jailor Kassan&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend of Kael'thas, who guarded the exit to escape.\nAfter Kael'thas' escape the prison was diligently watched over by the Kirin Tor and it had enjoyed stability for many years\u2026 until the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;.\nMage.\nSometime after Dalaran was moved to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; but before the Alliance and Horde forces had arrived to reinforce the city. During a blue dragon attack on the city led by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; sent a young mage named &lt;a href=\"Aodhan\"&gt;Aodhan&lt;/a&gt; to the Violet Hold to meet with another mage. However the mage wasn't at the Violet hold, but Aodhan heard a voice telling him to come to the Violet Hold. It turned out the voice was his uncle &lt;a href=\"Crevan\"&gt;Crevan&lt;/a&gt;, who had been stripped of his powers and put into a cell by the Kirin Tor. Later, after recovering the Spellbook of &lt;a href=\"Argaleus\"&gt;Argaleus&lt;/a&gt; which had restored Crevan's power, the spellbook let him free many of the prisoners from the cells.\nCrevan, a &lt;a href=\"mage%20hunter\"&gt;mage hunter&lt;/a&gt; in the service of Malygos, hoped that releasing the prisoners in the Violet Hold would distract the other mages long enough for Crevan to cause the Dalaran to crash. Crevan briefly trapped Aodhan in one of the Violet Hold cells promising to come back later. Aodhan managed to free himself from the cell, and to stop some of the prisoners from escaping. The prisoners counted &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"void%20terror\"&gt;void terror&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"revenant\"&gt;revenant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"fel%20beast\"&gt;fel beast&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn a sudden, violent assault, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; has unleashed his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; upon Dalaran, hungry to reclaim arcane dominance over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Utilizing a massive crack in the Violet Hold's roof, agents of the Dragon Aspect have begun pouring through portals within the prison, testing its integrity and risking the safety of everyone outside its walls.\nOverwhelmed by the audacious attack, the Kirin Tor has called upon heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; for assistance, seeking to put a swift end to the invasion. As brave &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s rush to aid Dalaran, rumors circulate about the escalating ferocity of the battle.\nViolet Hold defenders seeking a brief respite from the ongoing offensive warn that the dungeon's vile inmates have begun escaping from their cells due to Malygos' reckless actions. And that, the guards' caution, is only the beginning.\nSo critical is his quest to destroy Dalaran, Malygos has sent &lt;a href=\"Cyanigosa\"&gt;Cyanigosa&lt;/a&gt;, one of his most powerful lieutenants and zealous follower, to ensure victory and guarantee that the city is destroyed, along with any who dare defend it. She broke into the Violet Hold, disguised as an elf mage, and got close to releasing the prisoners, then fought to the death when she was caught.\nAs the onslaught continues to chip away at the Violet Hold's defenses, only the brave souls protecting the prison stand between the continued existence of Dalaran and the city's utter annihilation.\nWhen the adventurers of the Alliance and Horde contained the danger, the rest of the prisoners that had broken free were imprisoned once more.\nThe magi of the Kirin Tor were unable to contain the massive &lt;a href=\"Annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Argaloth\"&gt;Argaloth&lt;/a&gt; in the cells of Violet Hold, so they were left with no choice but to confine the powerful demon beneath &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, the &lt;a href=\"shivarra\"&gt;shivarra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alizabal\"&gt;Alizabal&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned here, not long after corrupt magi summoned her, but despite arcane wards restricting her powers, her influence alone caused her guards to murder one another in sudden fits of rage. Therefore she was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandfall.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; expelled the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, she imprisoned a number of &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in the hold (mostly those who were willing to surrender, the bewildered civilians on the surface, and the elves who did not escape the city with &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; informed the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; leadership of their people's presence in the Violet Hold following his own return to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nShould the adventurer be captured, they too would be teleported to the Violet Hold but would escape it and fight &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Lan%27dalock\"&gt;Archmage Lan'dalock&lt;/a&gt; guarding the entrance.\nJaina was holding the detained Sunreavers as prisoners of war. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, sovereign ruler of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, has publicly demanded their release.\nLegion's return.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"fel%20lord\"&gt;fel lord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Lord%20Betrug\"&gt;Fel Lord Betrug&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"aranasi\"&gt;aranasi&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Sael%27orn\"&gt;Sael'orn&lt;/a&gt; were instructed to lead a force of demons into the city from the Violet Hold. They hired &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Malgath\"&gt;Lord Malgath&lt;/a&gt; to free the inmates imprisoned during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, some of the Lich King's most powerful servants, and opened fel portals for the demons' arrival. The invasion ultimately came down to nothing, as a group of adventurers defeated and repelled their attack.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; confronted &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; here with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; and spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; to relocate the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to a safer place - the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; entered here in order to recover a &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Lexicon\"&gt;Fel Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;, written by an ancient scholar who spoke both &lt;a href=\"eredun\"&gt;eredun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, from the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Malgath\"&gt;powerful prisoner&lt;/a&gt; inside the prison.\n&lt;a href=\"Lyndras\"&gt;Lyndras&lt;/a&gt; was also put here.\n&lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Sinclari\"&gt;Lieutenant Sinclari&lt;/a&gt; expressed her concern about the prison and wants to shut it down.\nFishing.\nUnique items fished up from the waters of Violet Hold (outside the instance):\nSpeculation.\nAlthough not directly stated, the imprisoned Sunreavers may have been released when the Burning Legion invaded the city."}

It is the third instance to be located within the bounds of a capital city (after the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;). The quest &lt;a href=\"Discretion%20is%20Key%20%28Violet%20Hold%29\"&gt;Discretion is Key (Violet Hold)&lt;/a&gt;, obtained from &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; at level 75, introduces the player to the dungeon.\nRemoved.\nThe quest Discretion is Key grants you &lt;a href=\"The%20Violet%20Hold%20Key\"&gt;The Violet Hold Key&lt;/a&gt; which is required to unlock the door to the instance. You can enter without the key so long as someone opens the door for you. The quest itself does not need to be completed in order to keep the key.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Among the ornate spires and enchanted streets of Dalaran, a dark presence stirs within the mighty walls of the Violet Hold. Long used to restrain threats to the city, the tower holds row upon row of deadly inmates, and it has been diligently watched over by the Kirin Tor. However, a sudden assault has tested the integrity of the hold, putting at risk the safety of everyone outside the prison's walls.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAs you enter, Kirin Tor prison guards are fending off invaders of the blue dragonflight. Under orders from Malygos, the blue dragonflight is using magical portals to enter the hold in an attempt to enter the city by breaking through the hold's defenses.\nWhen you talk to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Sinclari\"&gt;Lieutenant Sinclari&lt;/a&gt;, she will use the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Control%20Crystal\"&gt;Defense Control Crystal&lt;/a&gt; near the doors to kill all the mobs in the hold and leave with the guards, closing the doors behind him. Your group is left on their own to defend the hold.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; instance, there will be 18 portals opening one after another. These portals spawn either a portal guardian which continuously spawns non-elite adds from the portal or a squad of elite dragonkin who do not spawn adds. Killing the guardian or the squad closes the portal. You must keep the spawns off the door, so that they don't break through. On the 6th and 12th portal, an unattackable dragonkin will spawn and open up one of the magically sealed prison cells, each containing a different boss. After you defeat the boss, you will get a small break to catch your breath before the event continues.\nThe most challenging portal trash spawn are the squads of elite dragonkin, which emerge in groups of 3-4. The champions have a knock-back ability, so tanking with your back against a wall is preferable. This is especially true since sorcerers are ranged and will not follow the tank backward, creating a potential aggro problem. For this reason, sorcerers should be downed first, and also because they will target random party members with arcane barrages. \nThe squads of elite dragonkin are especially difficult for the tank when they emerge from a portal in the middle of the balcony. Two mobs will run one way and two will run the other way, taking different staircases down to the dungeon's main floor. The ideal response is to be at the portal when they spawn and establish aggro before they split. If you cannot be there in time, establish quick aggro on one side of the split group. Then, charge to one of the mobs on the other side, followed by taunt or ranged attack on the other mob. Alternatively, you can wait for them to meet again at the stairs near the instance door, but dps and heals should be alerted to wait. \nOn the 18th portal, you will fight &lt;a href=\"Cyanigosa\"&gt;Cyanigosa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; in charge of the assault on the prison.\nOn Heroic, it awards approximately 1300 reputation.\nUpon Death, one must fight through all waves, including the bosses, again. However, in Heroic mode, bosses that have already been defeated are replaced by mobs that are the same but differently named and provide only 250 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; and no loot. In Regular, bosses which have to be fought again will drop loot normally. If only a single player or two dies without a wipe, they may simply enter the instance again as a ghost and speak with Sinclari outside the doors of the prison; she'll teleport the player inside the doors.\nDungeon denizens.\nBosses.\nYou will encounter three bosses in this dungeon, the first two being randomly selected out of this list of bosses:\nFinally, you will always face as the 3rd boss.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "327554", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=327554", "title": "Virmen", "text": "The virmen are a race of primitive &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;-like people that live in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; akin to &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s. Commonly seen as little more than aggressive pests, they are obsessed with vegetables, mostly carrots, though they have little love for turnips.\nBackground.\nThe virmen are an annoyance with the potential to become a serious problem. Rabbit-like pests with rat-like tails and powerful hind legs that send them bounding across terrain, virmen typically live and scavenge out of sight in caves and burrows. But when the civilized races of Pandaria draw near their warrens, the virmen are a famine on legs.\nVirmen are inveterate lurkers, awaiting the opportunity to grab carrion, garbage, or actual food whenever they can. They'll steal and eat nearly anything, then scurry away, leaving behind overturned tables and ransacked trash piles. The menace of the virmen is only slightly increased by their propensity to wield stolen daggers (or, failing that, sharpened pieces of bamboo) in both hands. Though most virmen avoid direct conflict, they are not unwilling to attack others in pursuit of the sustenance that drives their every waking moment.\nVirmen love vegetables, especially carrots. Virmen will often steal any vegetable they can find and sometimes use them in unorthodox ways, such as turning watermelons into toy boats. Virmen have surprisingly sharp teeth for creatures that mostly eat carrots. However, there is one vegetable they have no love for; the turnip. For some odd reason, virmen hate turnips to the point that they will sometimes deliberately go out of the way to beat them up. This odd distaste has caused many &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; children to find ways to trick them into accidentally eating a turnip, such as painting them orange to look like carrots; a prank that the virmen often fall prey to.\nAn odd trait is that they see pandaren as the real problem; they often will yell at attackers that they have 'ruined their land' and will tell them that the virmen land is off-limits (virmen land being any land the dig up and turn into a nest and surrounding areas).\nVirmen (unsurprisingly) breed as fast as the rabbits they resemble. They aren't very selective when it comes to breeding, but most broods will still have several alpha males and a single dominant mother figure. She's usually bigger, meaner, and tougher than anyone else in the brood.\nThe Untamed Valley.\nA group of virmen living in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Mother\"&gt;Warren Mother&lt;/a&gt; tried to trade with and harassed &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyalia\"&gt;Lyalia&lt;/a&gt; but the arrival of local farmers forced them away. Later they encountered the &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zertin\"&gt;Zertin&lt;/a&gt; who killed the mother. &lt;a href=\"Hooktooth\"&gt;Hooktooth&lt;/a&gt; then took the leadership of the group. The dark shaman attacked the farmstead of &lt;a href=\"Haohan%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Haohan Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt; but the farmers tricked the virmen into attacking the orcs by stating that carrots would be killed."}

The ceremony begins with an opening speech from the officiator, after which the attending dragons who have already chosen their forms assume them. The dragon undergoing the ceremony then makes a proclamation to their kin and finally recites the words of a visage spell that defines their mortal form and shifts them into it. The attendants welcome them with cheers, which is then followed by dancing, feasting, and singing \"the songs of old\" well into the evening."}

Illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Lindsey%20Burcar\"&gt;Lindsey Burcar&lt;/a&gt;, the story focuses on the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;'s preparations and indecision for the titular &lt;a href=\"Visage%20Day\"&gt;Visage Day&lt;/a&gt;, a ceremony in which dragons decide what their mortal form will be.\nSummary.\nThe story opens with Chronormu waking up in his roost above the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, less than a fortnight before his Visage Day. His friend &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; seeks him out to ask what form he will be choosing, but Chronormu despairs as he has not been able to make up his mind, saying that he doesn't know how he wants others to see him when he's not even sure how he sees himself. Zidormi advises him to seek &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s counsel.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, Chronormu tries to convince Nozdormu to reveal what visage the future Chronormu will choose. Instead, the Bronze &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; states that just as the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s' mortal forms allow them to see the world as the young races do, it informs how the young races perceive the dragons. Since this choice is deeply personal, he will not say anything that might sway Chronormu's decision, but instead advises him to seek out other dragons\u2014friends or otherwise\u2014to learn how they made their choices.\nFirst, Chronormu travels to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, who surprises the bronze by revealing that his visage is that of a humble &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt;. He explains that while many dragons choose elaborate forms, he wanted to instead be approachable and walk among mortals as a friend and equal. When Chronormu asks about Kalecgos' blue hair, he replies \"It suits me\". Before the bronze leaves, Kalecgos gives him two suggestions: thinking about coming up with a nickname to use in his mortal form, and seeking out the advice of a dragon with a different perspective on interacting with mortals.\nActing on Kalec's second suggestion, Chronormu asks for an audience with &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Onyxia tells the bronze that dragons do not choose a visage to befriend mortals, but to control and manipulate them. She assumes her &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; form and continues that no visage will change a dragon's nature as a hunter and killer, and that their shapeshifting is a means to take what they want from mortals. She then offers to let him stay by her side and teach him all he needs to know to become the greatest member of his flight. The bronze flees from the cave, upset at Onyxia's words, but realizes that he now knows what he wants to be.\nChronormu's Visage Day arrives. Held at the summit of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the ceremony is attended by Zidormi, Nozdormu, Kalecgos, Onyxia, and many others, and is officiated by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; herself. The nervous young bronze starts reciting a prepared speech but decides to forgo it and speak from his heart. He states that he long thought something was wrong with him since the choice of form seemed to come naturally to everyone else. He continues that the counsel from his fellow dragons has made him realize that a visage is not just about how they want the world to see them, but about how they see themselves, and that he wants to experience the world as the smallest and most optimistic of mortals working to create a brighter future. Chronormu recites the visage spell, transforms into a female &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;, and introduces herself as \"Chromie\". The other dragons cheer and welcome her choice. During the subsequent festivities, Kalec tells Chromie that he feels that she is the one who has taught them all a lesson. When he asks why she chose to become female, Chromie smiles and replies \"It suits me\". As she goes to bed later that night, she feels more whole and joyful than ever before."}

{"id": "28377", "revid": "54736494", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28377", "title": "Viscidus", "text": "Viscidus is an optional boss in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, a giant slime that can be accessed after the death of &lt;a href=\"Fankriss%20the%20Unyielding\"&gt;Fankriss the Unyielding&lt;/a&gt;. This boss requires a high Nature Resistance as it uses AoE poison bolts which have direct damage along with DoTs. He resets if taken outside his room, much like the bosses in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. If you are about to wipe, run outside the room and you may be able to save your life.\nAbilities.\nThe Three Frost Stages.\nViscidus must be slowed by Frost attacks in order to defeat him. Frostbolt, Frost Shock, Icy Touch, Frost Strike, and Howling Blast count towards this objective. The strength of the Frost attack doesn't matter, only the number of hits, so use the fastest Frost abilities possible. Frost attacks are required, but other attacks too, freezing is faster if more people are attacking it.\nThe Three Melee Stages.\nOnce Viscidus is frozen he must be shattered. This needs to happen very quickly or he will thaw out and continue attacking the raid. Melee attacks are required. Everyone, including melee and ranged characters, should run up and hit him. Viscidus only explodes when enough hits have been dealt (after 30).\nStrategy.\nIdeally, all raids should drink a NR potion 2 minutes before starting, so the cooldown fades. Then, refresh NR potion on every chance. Aim for enough dps to kill your assigned Glob, and then balance stamina with NR equipment. Low stats due to wearing green NR armor may not be the best to stand NR damage. If your raid uses CT_RaidAssist, the raid leader can check the NR resistance, and the number of NR potions on each member. Once you master the encounter, you may try drinking a pot only when you are low on hp.\nBeware of the single bolt: it announces the landing point of a toxin cloud, which drains health real fast. There is an addon called &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-4174-1-viscidus-raid-warning.html\"&gt;Viscidus Raid Warning&lt;/a&gt; to whisper people suffering Toxin Cloud.\nViscidus is vulnerable to Frost (spells/abilities and Frost damage), therefore mages are at a premium for this fight. Warlocks equipped with a Frost damage wand, i.e. &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Biting%20Cold\"&gt;Wand of Biting Cold&lt;/a&gt; (usually 1.5 sec) will be nearly as effective as a mage (1 sec casting on rank 1 frostbolt with improved frostbolt still faces the 1.5 sec global cooldown).\nThe raid is required to get as many frost attacks into Viscidus as possible so that he will go through his several emotes and freeze. After he is frozen, a number of melee attacks must be done to shatter him into 20 or so small blobs. The raid must then kill these blobs in order to reduce Viscidus' health.\nThe triggering for his normal state into frozen seems to be a hitcounter of ~200 Frost based attacks/spells/abilities.\nThe triggering for him to shatter once frozen seems to be a hitcounter of ~75 (in 1.12) melee hits, regardless of damage.\nAll stages have a 15 second time-limit, so if you fail to reach the next stage after that he reverts to his previous one. Time is of the essence. Once people start dying, the fight goes down hill. Killing Viscidus should take around 4 freezing phases to accomplish. Therefore, longevity is the key along with poison cleansing abilities. Mages and Druids are key to this encounter. Shamans make the fight relatively easier for the Horde because of the Poison Cleansing Totems. There might be changes in 1.11 or future patches allowing weapons with +X-Y frost damage to count as (part of) the number of attacks needed. This would mean that Hurricane and other weapons would be very useful.\nMelee positioning.\nMost guilds keep their melee players away from Viscidus so that they don't take poison damage. They have to stay at least 100 yards away to avoid damage. This can be accomplished either by standing on the staircase outside Viscidus' room or by standing inside Viscidus' room far off to one side. The difficulty with this strat is that meleers will take one or two poison volleys while running in and out, and someone has to be in range to depoison them. However, with proper depoisoning, meleers takes much less damage and may not even need to wear full NR.\nThe alternative is to have high-NR melee players in melee range of Viscidus, DPSing him at all times. This does a minimal amount of damage to Viscidus, but it does hurt him a bit. The advantage is that, with players moving around less, it is far easier to keep in range of shaman totems and of your Druids for depoison. The tradeoff is that you take more direct Poison damage (which is resistible), but hopefully you take less DoT damage (not resistible). You can also make use of &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Oil\"&gt;Frost Oil&lt;/a&gt; to help freeze Viscidus.\nHigh-level/solo strategy.\nAfter the post-5.1 hotfix --\"Viscidus now remains frozen for 30 seconds (was 15), and it takes 30 hits to shatter Viscidus (was 50).\"\u2014it is possible to relatively easily solo Viscidius. Solo players need to be able to land a quick succession of frost abilities and melee swings. Any wand that has frost-based damage, or a weapon with the &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20Weapon%20-%20Elemental%20Force\"&gt;Enchant Weapon - Elemental Force&lt;/a&gt; enchant will fulfill the former category. A &lt;a href=\"Barov%20Peasant%20Caller\"&gt;Barov Peasant Caller&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Barov%20Servant%20Caller\"&gt;Barov Servant Caller&lt;/a&gt; are trinkets that supply several guardians that attack with melee swings quick enough to shatter Visc.\nWork through Visc's ~2 million health first without shattering it in the freeze phase. Once it's below 5% total health, switch to frost abilities and get it to freeze. Once it's frozen, switch to melee swings and use the peasant caller.\nDemigod or even old God?\n&lt;a href=\"Chemist%20Fuely\"&gt;Chemist Fuely&lt;/a&gt; suggests that oozes may be connected to the Old Gods, and that an Old(or Demi) god could be Viscidus. Nonetheless, it's currently the most powerful ooze ever known."}

{"id": "17278", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17278", "title": "Eternal", "text": "Eternals are &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s immortal beings. These &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s and demigods-like beings are immortals with nearly divine powers. Eternals are conduits to divine power for several faiths; these include titans, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and other Ancients such as &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; the Waywatcher, &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Xavius\"&gt;Lord Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, the voodoo &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; spirits, the Elemental Lords and Old Gods, etc. Eternal is the term used for many of the gods, goddesses, demigods, deities, divinities, and other revered beings who have interacted in Azeroth's history and molded the world.\nBackground.\nEternals are the divine-like beings of Azeroth and the other planes, who shape the large arcs of history for good and ill. Many beings transcend the bounds of mortal power and play key roles in the world\u2019s long history, either obvious or subtle. These beings are known as eternals. Wielding godlike powers, they battle to destroy or save the world, to disrupt or cultivate life upon Azeroth (and elsewhere).\nThese are beings known only in legends to the peoples of Azeroth. Yet they are beings who have shaped not only the course of history in the world of Azeroth, but often the world itself: the Elemental Lords, ruling over planes of pure power and awaiting the time when they will once again serve the banished Old Gods; the Titans, whom the dwarves believe created Azeroth and many of its races; the great and powerful dragons who watch over the titans\u2019 creation; the moon goddess Elune, and the demigod-like beings She created to protect and guide the creatures of the land. They are the ancient powers. While mortals fight wars to lay claim to villages and kingdoms, the powers wage a perpetual struggle to determine who will dominate the whole of the universe, with Azeroth the nearest battlefield. Though rarely seen, the influence of the ancient powers is ever-present. It is known that They wrought Azeroth from pure chaos and formed it into the world it is today.\nMost of the divine beings of Azeroth (known as eternals) are distant entities. They exist to assist those caught in the conflicts of a cruel, violent world. Never directly intervening in the affairs of the world, They use divine magic as a proxy. With their many healing and protective spells, practitioners of divine magic are at the vanguard of the Gods\u2019 efforts to ensure Their peoples' survival. Priests whisper prayers to evoke power from beings such as Elune the Moon Goddess. Shadow hunters invoke the names of dark Gods (loa), ancient powers whose legends are stained in cruelty and bloodshed, but who are also capable of benevolence when appeased. For example a shadow hunter might venture onto grounds consecrated to the Old Gods and spill his own blood to entice the forces of primeval cruelty to come and visit their worst afflictions upon him.\nThe ancient powers rule supreme in their particular bastions, unsurpassed in power, knowledge and ability. Each also possesses its own personality and agenda, which has led each to interact with mortals in its own way. In some cases, an ancient power may take an interest in a hero early in her life. The powers have an innate understanding of prophecy and divination surpassing that of mortals, and they are often aware of a hero\u2019s fate long before the hero takes her first steps onto the path of adventure. A power may send monsters to kill a nascent hero years before she has an opportunity to meddle in the power\u2019s schemes, or it may subtly assist her by quietly guiding her toward allies, information or hidden artifacts that will help her achieve her destiny. When unable to act or unwilling to show their hands, the ancient powers use mortal heroes and villains as agents to further their own agendas \u2014 Sargeras used Azshara as his servant in an attempt to open the Well of Eternity, and the human wizard Rhonin was the cat's-paw of the dragons during the Second War. Heroes may be approached by an ancient power and asked to undertake a quest. They must take care when serving an Eternal, however, as completing a task for a power may mean incredible reward in thanks for a service well performed \u2014 or utter destruction as the Eternal hides its tracks.\nA number of the eternals died during the War of the Ancients. This doesn\u2019t, however, mean that those powers can have no influence in later eras. Many of the fallen powers still have followers 10,000 years later, such as the furbolg who follow in the path of the long-dead ursine demigods Ursoc and Ursol. Further, though written history says they perished, can eternals who possess the special quality of immortality truly die? Perhaps a \"fallen\" eternal simply sleeps away centuries while his wounds heal...\nEternals usually only appear before mortals only when they have truly earned the audience through their actions, such as by performing a great service to the eternal or by making a formidable stand against its plans. The tangled web of relationships among the eternals means that a favor performed for one may be a slight to several others.\nAncient powers operate not just on levels of power far above mortals, but also on a vastly different time scale: the youngest have lived a hundred mortal lifetimes, and their goals can lay millennia away. Events of the mortal world may be more than meaningless in the larger scope of history to Eternals. For those who are asked to undertake a mission on behalf of an Eternal, the Eternal may be unable or simply unwilling to explain the reasons behind the task to \"mere mortals\" who cannot possibly comprehend. The immortal lifespan of Eternals allows them to collect on debts from many decades previous, and they hold grudges much longer. For example; the great dragon Neltharion spent a lifetime disguised as a human noble, infiltrating the royal courts of Lordaeron and consolidating power in order to avenge himself upon the other dragon Aspects.\nEternals in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt; include the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s, and other powerful entities worshipped or venerated by the mortal races on Azeroth, often as part of &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Myth\"&gt;Creation Myth&lt;/a&gt;s of various people in the world.\nHistory of the Eternals.\nBelow is a brief history covering eternals from the earliest known accounts to the present.\nThe Dawn of History.\nMost of the ancient powers were encountered during Azeroth's earliest days. It was the golden age of the powers, the dragons and Elune's servants watched over the young world, &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s thought the untamed land as comfortable as their home plane. Legends claim that the world's creators still lurked in the shadows finishing the details of their creation.\nThe Shattered World.\nIn the aftermath of the War of the Ancients and the sundering of the world, the Burning Legion was forced off Azeroth. Azshara vanished, and the dragons went into hiding. Even the elementals retreated, and thousands of years would passed before mortal spellcasters discovered how to summon them back across the planar boundaries. Though the eternals who survived were largely unseen for almost 10,000 years, they were occasionally encountered. The eternals were humbled by Azshara's bold attempt to rise to their level of power, and remained reserved and distrustful of both mortals who sought them out and mortals whom they employed.\nCurrent Age.\nSeers and scholars maintain that the Horde's arrival through the Dark Portal heralded the return of the ancient powers to mortal events. In the years since, the great dragons and the Elemental Lords have involved themselves in the war, and both Cenarius and Sargeras have returned. As the dwarves delve deeper into the lost secrets of the Titans, some have wondered whether the Titans ever truly left. Some have found they have unwittingly been drawn into or run afoul of the schemes of a returned eternal. The Eternals appear to have recovered from any uncertainty they suffered during their millennia of retreat, however, and those who seek them out do so at their own risk. Nearly every eternal has followers in the current age, from the worshippers of Elune among the night elves to the demon cults that revere the Burning Legion.\nList of eternals.\nAll Eternals are demigod-like beings. They are immortal and wield divine power, but not all of them aspire to be Gods.\nThe Scourge.\nThe Scourge is a vast army of the undead created and controlled by the Lich King (formerly &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and now &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;). The Lich King is among the most powerful entities Azeroth has ever known and has been described as a demigod.\nBurning Legion.\nThe Burning Legion is undoubtedly potent and some of its leaders possess demigod-like power. Those who worship demons draw terrible divine magic from their dark faith. Most demons are not eternals. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; are the only confirmed exceptions. \nThe titans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s are immortal entities who travel across the cosmos bringing order to worlds such as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Titans were powerful enough to chain the Old Gods, and some accounts give them titles such as \"Patron of All Life\".\nThey are led by a group called the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; which includes:\nThe Old Gods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; were the evil rulers of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; before being defeated by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. They were the masters of the Elemental Lords. Three remain imprisoned beneath the world, but continue to be worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; Cult and the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe old gods exist beyond Azeroth\nGod.\n&lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; was a deity connected to certain members of the Church of the Holy Light, referenced in early Warcraft Lore and sources, and alluded to in \"Day of the Dragon\". The belief also included &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s, Heaven, and Hell.\nDrakkari God.\nA group of four gods in form of statues, that the drakkari give sacrifices and receive blessings, although they could be considered loas, they were never stated to be such.\nThe Earthmother, Skyfather and the Deepmother.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Earthmother\"&gt;Earthmother&lt;/a&gt; is a benevolent and primitive earth goddess whom the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; worship above all else. She is the harmony of nature itself. She is described as the creator of the land, of the sun and moon, and of the tauren people. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Father\"&gt;Sky Father&lt;/a&gt; is a mysterious deity that the tauren worship as a equal of the Earthmother.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Mother\"&gt;Deep Mother&lt;/a&gt; is much like the earthmother, however it's a Murloc deity never associated with the tauren mythology, but instead is primitive sea goddess.\nAncient Guardians.\nThe Ancient Guardians are demigods of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nElune.\nElune - &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; is the benevolent &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; Goddess of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. She is one of the few full deities on Azeroth, the personification of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Lady\"&gt;White Lady&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the Ancient Guardian. The tauren refer to her as Mu'sha, the Left Eye of the Earthmother. She is the counterpart to An'she.\nAn'she.\n&lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; is a male sun deity in &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;, the right Eye of the Earthmother and the counterpart to the goddess Mu'sha (Elune), the moon. It gives the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren paladins, their power and acts much like the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, wherever he is not the light is unknown.\nLoas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;s are primal troll gods, each representing a different animal or domain.\nElemental Lords, the elemental spirits and other elementals.\nFormer servants of the evil &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s once ruled Azeroth. Yet when the titans defeated the Old Gods, they banished the Elemental Lords and all elementals to a planar prison known now as the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; seems to have its own version of the elemental lords of which only Cyrukh is known:\nThe shamans draw their power from five natural elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and the Wilds. The &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s are primordial &lt;a href=\"elementals\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt; which embody these elements. They do not appear to be connected with the Old Gods, nor do they appear connected to their Elemental lieutenants. The Spirits communicate with the shamans through trances, dreams, images and emotions. Their exact motivations remain unknown, and it is unclear whether they act according to some grander design, or whether they act in reaction to events that threaten the balance. Each world seems it's own version of the 5 elemental spirits.\nThere is one elemental that differs from all other Murmur the Primordial essence of sound\nDragon Aspects.\nBefore leaving Azeroth, the titans empowered five dragons with tremendous power. They were to serve as &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, guardians over the world, together with their dragonflight. After the great Cataclysm they became mortal.\nMortals.\nThese are mortals that have been claimed to be Eternals."}

Here, various forms of &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt;s are forged by the &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s to defend the realm against attack. The facility also hosts a shrine to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Forgelite\"&gt;First Forgelite&lt;/a&gt;, in which sits the legendary hammer known as &lt;a href=\"%3APhaestus%2C%20Genesis%20of%20Aeons\"&gt;:Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nA long time ago, &lt;a href=\"General%20Kaal\"&gt;General Kaal&lt;/a&gt; was sent here on a secret mission by &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; to plant &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; siphons, to limit the amount of anima this workshop could use and destabilize this area.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20rebellion\"&gt;Forsworn rebellion&lt;/a&gt; began in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;dark kyrian&lt;/a&gt; sensed that weakness in the area and seized control of the Eternal Forge and began using its potential to construct vast numbers of &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt;s for their war. Many of the forge's &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s followed the orders of the Forsworn to create their weapons, although some others refused and were held captive. &lt;a href=\"Sika\"&gt;Sika&lt;/a&gt;, in charge of the Great Forge in the absence of the Forgelite Prime, was unable to prevent it being turned into a factory for the dark kyrian. Under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Atticus\"&gt;Overseer Atticus&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsworn used &lt;a href=\"Phaestus%2C%20Genesis%20of%20Aeons\"&gt;Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons&lt;/a&gt; to speed up production after looting it from the forge's shrine.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; was shattered by &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the Forgelite Prime &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with building a new crest for the Ascended. To do this, he traveled to the Great Forge along with a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; allied to the kyrian and worked to wrest control of the area back from the Forsworn, while at the same time gathering the materials and tools needed for his work. After working with Sika to free captured stewards and getting the necessary reagents, Mikanikos was able to regain Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons once Overseer Atticus was slain. With the hammer, the Forgelite Prime put the finishing touches on a new and extremely powerful centurion goliath known as &lt;a href=\"Bron%20%28goliath%29\"&gt;Bron&lt;/a&gt;, which was then unleashed on the Forsworn occupying the forge and their newly-made army.\n&lt;a href=\"Venthyr\"&gt;Venthyr&lt;/a&gt; also arrived here to ask Mikanikos to create the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Harvesters\"&gt;Crown of the Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact that could contain the power of the seven &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; medallions."}

It consists of two distinct effects: Surge of Light and Surge of Darkness. The former is helpful for priests who are healing and/or using &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;, while the latter is useful only to Shadow priests.\nSurge of Light.\nThis effect gives a 15% chance for your &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heal%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Heal (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;Flash Heal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Binding%20Heal\"&gt;Binding Heal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Greater Heal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Penance\"&gt;Penance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; to grant a free, instant Flash Heal. This has the obvious benefit of saving mana, but can also be useful in emergencies, PvP and situations where healing is required while moving. The effect has a 20-second duration and can accumulate up to 2 charges, allowing the priest to choose the right moment to use these procs.\nAlthough primarily useful for healing priests, Shadow priests can still benefit from this effect when casting any of the related spells. \nSurge of Darkness.\nThis effect grants a 20% chance for your &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Touch\"&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/a&gt; ticks to empower your &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Spike\"&gt;Mind Spike&lt;/a&gt;. When empowered in this way, Mind Spike is instant cast, costs no mana, has 50% increased damage and no longer removes your damage over time effects from the target. This makes it possible to include Mind Spike in a &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; rotation, increasing DPS and providing a powerful instant attack that can be used on the run. The effect can accumulate up to 2 charges, but has a limited duration of 10 seconds in which to make use of them.\nMind Spike procs from Surge of Darkness increase Shadow priests' mobility, burst capabilities and overall DPS, especially when compared to the &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; usually used to fill the rotation."}

This achievement was all but impossible without a group, for the Whale Shark one-shotted anything it melees; however, it can be easily done solo by a level 100 character as of \"\".\nEngagement.\nTo succeed in killing the whale shark, one member of the group (preferably a &lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; class) must gain &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt; the whale shark around the area. This \"&lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;\" (so to speak) must avoid being hit by the whale shark while also continuing to do damage and maintain aggro, as even the best-equipped &lt;a href=\"plate\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt;-wearer will be instantly killed if he fails to stay out of &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; range. Healing in this encounter is thus pointless (save for griefing from opposing faction members, as the whale sharks usually patrol well away from other mobs) so all classes need to &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; and do so slowly; ripping aggro off the kiter is instant death for whomever does it.\nUnlike some other outdoor boss encounters from \"vanilla\" \"World of Warcraft\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", there is no penalty for a character dying, resurrecting from a &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, and then rejoining the fight. In fact, it will be useful to locate a nearby graveyard and then kite the whale shark towards it, so as to shorten the distance a character must travel to reclaim his corpse and return to action. If the character dies more than a few times, however, he may be subject to the delayed-resurrection penalty where he has to wait a few seconds to a few minutes before being allowed to resurrect (except being raised by another player, or course).\nShould the kiter die, it is imperative that someone else quickly takes over as the new kiter. Otherwise, the whale shark will rapidly go down his aggro list killing players, and he may reset if no character is in melee range.\nBe prepared for a very long fight. Because of the care the group must take to not take aggro off the kiter, all characters must either let several seconds pass between attacks or use only low-damage attacks. The whale shark must pretty much suffer the \"death by a thousand paper cuts.\""}

The shield would last 30 seconds or until the given amount of damage was absorbed, whichever came first. Frost Ward was self-cast only. Since Patch 4.0.1, Frost Ward has been replaced with &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Ward\"&gt;Mage Ward&lt;/a&gt; which is a similar spell that also blocks Fire and Arcane damage.\nPreviously, Frost Ward (Rank 5) could have been trained at level 60 from &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Frost%20Ward%20V\"&gt;Tome of Frost Ward V&lt;/a&gt;; a random drop from pre-TBC high level dungeons, raid bosses and outdoor world bosses.\nTalent improvements.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Warding\"&gt;Frost Warding&lt;/a&gt; talent gave Frost Ward a 20% chance at max rank to reflect frost spells back at the caster.\nThis spell benefits from the &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; cost reduction effects of the talents &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Precision%20%28mage%20talent%29\"&gt;Elemental Precision (mage talent)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Channeling\"&gt;Frost Channeling&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cold%20Snap\"&gt;Cold Snap&lt;/a&gt; would have reset the cooldown on this spell.\nNotes.\nFrost Ward could have been dispelled as a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dispel%20Type%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; debuff.\nDamage reduction due to spell &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt;-like effects was calculated before damage would be absorbed.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ward\"&gt;Fire Ward&lt;/a&gt; shared the same &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; timer as Frost Ward. Using one ward would have triggered the cooldown of the other, meaning only one of the two wards could have been active at a time."}

{"id": "59332", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=59332", "title": "Frost Warding", "text": "Frost Warding is a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; talent that increases the &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; given by the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Armor\"&gt;Frost Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Armor\"&gt;Ice Armor&lt;/a&gt; spells by up to 50% at max rank 2. In addition, it gives &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Ward\"&gt;Frost Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ward\"&gt;Fire Ward&lt;/a&gt; up to 30% chance to negate damage spells that would normally be absorbed (doing no damage to the Ward) and turn the damage they would have caused into &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; for the Mage. This talent is useful in both PvP and PvE specs. In PvE it is the most useful talent on its tier after &lt;a href=\"Precision%20%28mage%20talent%29\"&gt;Precision (mage talent)&lt;/a&gt; for a non Frost Mage, and is taken by most Arcane mages for the ability to convert raid damage into extra mana. In PvP, it is useful for extra regen and more protection, with half of the classes having some form of frost or fire spell.\nThe negation chance is similar to &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Shields\"&gt;Molten Shields&lt;/a&gt;, which gives &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ward\"&gt;Fire Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Ward\"&gt;Frost Ward&lt;/a&gt; a chance to reflect spells. Along with &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Fortitude\"&gt;Arcane Fortitude&lt;/a&gt;, this is one of two Mage talents that will increase armor, though this talent only does so when Ice Armor or Frost Armor is used. The tow are thought to stack additively, so with 2/2 in both talents you would only have a 40% chance to be hit by the warded spell.\nNotes.\nWhen the negate chance occurs, the damage from the spell is prevented via an &lt;a href=\"absorb\"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt;, and you are granted mana equal to the amount of damage the spell would have done. This absorb is completely separate from your Ward, and can prevent any amount of damage. Negating &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%20%28tactics%29%23Phase%20One\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt; can lead to a gain of over 27k mana, leaving your health bar untouched.\nHowever as the negate effect uses the absorb mechanic, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bolt\"&gt;Chaos Bolt&lt;/a&gt; will still deal full damage even if it is negated. When this happens, you gain mana equal to the damage Chaos Bolt deals you."}

Thus the event can occur anytime from the end of March to the end of April. Players can search for colored eggs hidden around 4 towns close to each race's &lt;a href=\"starting%20area\"&gt;starting area&lt;/a&gt;. Noblegarden starts on Easter Sunday, and lasts for one week.\nNoblegarden is a &lt;a href=\"Event%23Seasonal_events\"&gt;seasonal event&lt;/a&gt;, whose achievements contribute to its &lt;a href=\"meta-achievement\"&gt;meta-achievement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Noble%20Gardener\"&gt;Noble Gardener&lt;/a&gt;, which is a part of &lt;a href=\"What%20a%20Long%2C%20Strange%20Trip%20It%27s%20Been\"&gt;What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been&lt;/a&gt;. Noblegarden is unusual for a seasonal event in that its meta-achievement can be accomplished by low-level characters. It's conceivable that a level 1 character could complete all of the achievements, though some of them will be challenging for characters under level 40.\nEgg Hunting.\nGathering &lt;a href=\"Brightly%20Colored%20Egg\"&gt;Brightly Colored Egg&lt;/a&gt;s is the central activity of Noblegarden. These eggs are hidden in and around the starting area towns, and contain &lt;a href=\"Noblegarden%20Chocolate\"&gt;Noblegarden Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, with a chance of containing one of the items that the Noblegarden vendors sell. There's also a chance when collecting the egg that will give the player a buff that transforms them into a rabbit for 1 hour. Said buff silences casting, so it can be clicked off if it proves annoying.\nTo speed the process, turn on &lt;a href=\"autoloot\"&gt;autoloot&lt;/a&gt; and the interact key (default keybind ). A useful macro to quickly gather eggs and open them on the move is:\n #showtooltip Noblegarden Chocolate\n /cancelaura Noblegarden Bunny\n /use Eagger Basket\n /use Brightly Colored Egg\nEggs are found in the following locations:\nEgg-gathering is made easier with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Borrowed%20Egg%20Basket\"&gt;Borrowed Egg Basket&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a speed buff wherever eggs can be found. It levels the playing field against classes with inherent unmounted speed buffs, such as druids. The basket can be acquired with the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Tisket%2C%20a%20Tasket%2C%20a%20Noblegarden%20Basket\"&gt;A Tisket, a Tasket, a Noblegarden Basket&lt;/a&gt;. The quest rewards a cosmetic &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Basket\"&gt;Egg Basket&lt;/a&gt; and a toy &lt;a href=\"Eagger%20Basket\"&gt;Eagger Basket&lt;/a&gt; that functions the same as the quest item.\n&lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Rabbit%27s%20Foot\"&gt;Cursed Rabbit's Foot&lt;/a&gt; can be acquired from the &lt;a href=\"Brightly%20Colored%20Egg\"&gt;Brightly Colored Egg&lt;/a&gt;s, which will have the player lay a slightly larger egg but doesn't sparkle unlike the eggs that spawn with the &lt;a href=\"Noblegarden%20Bunny%20%28buff%29\"&gt;Noblegarden Bunny (buff)&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe following quests are available for Noblegarden:\nVendors.\n&lt;a href=\"Noblegarden%20Merchant\"&gt;Noblegarden Merchant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Noblegarden%20Vendor\"&gt;Noblegarden Vendor&lt;/a&gt;s sell the following items in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Noblegarden%20Chocolate\"&gt;Noblegarden Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;. Vendors can be found at each of the eight event sites.\nAchievements.\nNoblegarden has a host of achievements required to complete its &lt;a href=\"meta-achievement\"&gt;meta-achievement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Noble%20Gardener\"&gt;Noble Gardener&lt;/a&gt;, itself a part of &lt;a href=\"What%20a%20Long%2C%20Strange%20Trip%20It%27s%20Been\"&gt;What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been&lt;/a&gt;.\nAchievement strategy.\nThis is a strategy specifically for the achievements listed above.\nHead to your favorite city of choice. Your mission now is to collect 355 eggs. If you collect any of the following (from finding inside eggs, or borrowing a tuxedo from a friend) you can subtract the amount listed from 355. Do \"not\" purchase anything until the end, to minimize the number of eggs you gather. If you are a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, be sure to add an additional 100 if you are interested in the . If you are also going for the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Springstrider\"&gt;Swift Springstrider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mystical%20Spring%20Bouquet\"&gt;Mystical Spring Bouquet&lt;/a&gt;, add another 600 but again if you're lucky, you could have one drop instead while gathering for your achievements. Playing with others will allow you to share &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tuxedo%20Pants\"&gt;Black Tuxedo Pants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White%20Tuxedo%20Shirt\"&gt;White Tuxedo Shirt&lt;/a&gt;, saving a few eggs.\nThere are generally two strategies for collecting eggs as fast as possible: One option is to use the macro in the &lt;a href=\"%23Egg%20Hunting\"&gt;Egg Hunting section&lt;/a&gt;, and keep its buff up as much as possible, running around picking up eggs. Some people prefer camping instead - finding a spot with a lot of spawn points to minimize movement. Since they do not stack, eggs need to be opened as they are gathered in order to avoid running out of bag space; the chocolates yielded do stack to 250. It's also easy to work on the &lt;a href=\"Chocoholic\"&gt;Chocoholic&lt;/a&gt; achievement by eating the first 100 chocolates. Once enough chocolate has been acquired, purchase or borrow from friends any remaining items. \nHere are some tips for the remaining achievements:\nShake Your Bunny-Maker macro.\nTo be able to identify race and gender for shapeshifted druids, gender-ambiguous blood elves, or if you simply have poor vision, here's a macro:\nTarget a character, and when activated the macro will print in the chat window whether it is male or female, the level, the race and if it has the Sprung buff already or is clear. From the information given you must decide yourself if you want to shake your bunny maker at it. When copy/pasting the macro text, be sure to remove a possible space before the \"/run\".\nSince patch &lt;a href=\"8.1.0\"&gt;8.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, the players can be male or female to obtain the achievement but still requires them to be at least level 18 or higher.\nBeing helpful to others.\nTo help other players get their achievements, you can do the following things:\nNotes.\nIn 2009, the schedule for Noblegarden was changed since it was delayed.\nWarcraft III.\nIn the official &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard scenario map for \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" called \"&lt;a href=\"Funny%20Bunny\"&gt;Funny Bunny&lt;/a&gt;'s Easter Egg Hunt\", Easter Bunnies and Evil Bunnies come out around the time of Noblegarden to find eggs. They compete with each other to find as many eggs as possible, valuing rare golden Easter eggs. They live in Easter egg houses.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "311227", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=311227", "title": "Nobles of Gilneas", "text": "The nobles of Gilneas are the ruling class of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. Some were slain during the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, while others were turned into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Forsaken invasion&lt;/a&gt;. Others remain &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; in exile from their homeland.\nHoldings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20family\"&gt;Greymane family&lt;/a&gt; rules over all of Gilneas. Their home of &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Manor\"&gt;Greymane Manor&lt;/a&gt; overlooked the southern region of &lt;a href=\"Duskmist%20Shore\"&gt;Duskmist Shore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;, and it is located behind the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Queen's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Gate\"&gt;King's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. This area of Gilneas has since sunk outside of the manor, but once held cottages for the &lt;a href=\"Crowley\"&gt;Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and the Walden families. &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; also appears to be explicitly ruled by the royal family.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Crowley&lt;/a&gt; family ruled over the lands that constituted both &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; (and as a result, &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, making &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; a vassal of theirs as a result. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mayor%20Morrison\"&gt;Lord Mayor Morrison&lt;/a&gt; was also the mayor of Pyrewood, placing him implicitly under Crowley's service. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Harford\"&gt;Lord Harford&lt;/a&gt; was also noted as a servant of Arugal and from beyond the wall, meaning he was likely one of Crowley's vassals as well. The &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Marley\"&gt;Marley&lt;/a&gt; family ruled over an unspecified province near Gilneas' borders, which at the time stretched to about the proximity of the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elem%20Mine\"&gt;Deep Elem Mine&lt;/a&gt;. His lands were deemed ill-suited as they lacked natural boundaries to assist with the wall. Given that his lands would not have drawn issue with the Crowleys, his territories were likely near Deep Elem Mine; perhaps &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; itself and the surrounding land, which would have made him subservient to Crowley himself. Marley notably remained behind the Greymane Wall in spite of this.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Godfreys&lt;/a&gt; ruled over a region just south of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, within proximity to the Northgate lands. Given that Godfrey specifies the wall would cut into 'some' of Crowley's lands, and the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;Northgate rebellion&lt;/a&gt; was named for the region that supported Crowley the most; it is unlikely that Godfrey's lands were the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Woods\"&gt;Northgate Woods&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves &lt;a href=\"Emberstone%20Village\"&gt;Emberstone Village&lt;/a&gt; to potentially be Godfrey's holdings, which would give him ties to the eastern lords that he later convinces to betray Genn in the worgen starting zone, or the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Headlands\"&gt;Northern Headlands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Ashbury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Walden\"&gt;Walden&lt;/a&gt; are referred to as the \"eastern lords\", which would constitute areas such as &lt;a href=\"Emberstone%20Village\"&gt;Emberstone Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tempest%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Tempest's Reach&lt;/a&gt;. It is not specified where either of these two lords actually rule over beside this, though the Walden family is noted to have homes outside of the east and Lord Walden himself is killed in a house in Tempest's Reach; meaning they may have been 'unlanded' nobility. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hewell\"&gt;Lord Hewell&lt;/a&gt; is also present at the meeting and spoke against turning over Genn Greymane to the Forsaken. Given the context, Hewell may also be an eastern lord, as the quest specifies that only two lords joined Godfrey's plot; alternatively he may have also been from the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Stormglen%20Village\"&gt;Stormglen Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lands of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Geoffery%20Tulvan\"&gt;Tulvans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Candren\"&gt;Candrens&lt;/a&gt; are entirely unknown with no allusions to any potential regions, though the Tulvans are stated to be 'earls'. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hiram%20Creed\"&gt;Lord Hiram Creed&lt;/a&gt;'s territory, if any, is also unknown. Given that he was, in truth, a drakonid, it is unknown if there is an actual Creed family that he infiltrated / impersonated into, or if he was the only member. &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Longshore\"&gt;Baron Longshore&lt;/a&gt; states that he was once a legitimate baron of Gilneas; though where his lands would have been, or if someone else was given jurisdiction over them, is unknown.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mastiff\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woofington\"&gt;Woofington&lt;/a&gt; was given the title of lord of &lt;a href=\"Havenswood\"&gt;Havenswood&lt;/a&gt; after the rest of the denizens of the island succumbed to madness."}

They have clashed with the monarch on more than one occasion, but the monarchy has recently learned to not let the nobles push them around anymore.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Noblegarden\"&gt;Noblegarden&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to bring communities together to share the joy of life and friendship, it is customary for the nobles and lords of Stormwind to hide coins, candy, and the occasional treasures within special eggs painted to look like wildflowers. These eggs are then scattered in the capital and towns of the kingdom for the citizenry to find.\nHistory.\nIn the years before the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; invasion, &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; would host many galas for the nobles from around Stormwind, who came to regard &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s parties as exclusive high-society events. The guests were awed by the wonders of the enchanted tower, and their happiness even lifted the Guardian's mood.\nIn time, Medivh was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and continued to hide this corruption behind a lavish lifestyle, still inviting many nobles to party down in Karazhan. When &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; confronted Medivh for his crime, this night the tower was crowded with nobles who were expecting a gala. When the son and mother started fighting, their powers were shaking the tower to its foundations and caused the would-be revelers to flee. As Aegwynn slowly gained the upper hand, Medivh resorted to draining the life of hundreds of people fleeing the tower in order to fuel his strength, leaving Karazhan a haunted tower of madness populated by ghosts and afterimages. Among the victims were some of the most important nobles of Stormwind.\nTo the surprise of Medivh, his battle with Aegwynn had gone unnoticed by the rest of the world. No witnesses had survived, and the deaths of so many nobles had not caused the stir that he expected, as the kingdom of Stormwind laid the mysterious disappearance of the nobles on the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s flooding out of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, most of the nobles of the kingdom were slain by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; spent years toiling to rebuild the glorious city, they were left broke, as their fees and salaries were left unpaid and unspoken for by the city's officials. When the time of the rightful payment came, the nobles of Stormwind couldn't because they ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy. In the shadow, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; manipulated both sides with the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; - her meddling in the rebuilding of Stormwind left the nobility unsatisfied with the craftsmanship of the guild, while the workers were enraged that the nobility despised them and were threatening to withhold payment. Although some of the nobles supported the Stonemasons Guild, such as &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Count%20Erlgadin\"&gt;Count Erlgadin&lt;/a&gt;, who lobbied to improve the working conditions for the stonemasons during the restoration of the kingdom.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, several nobles were part of the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Delegation\"&gt;Honor Delegation&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"throne%20room\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, selected to stand behind the king when he would deliver his memorial speech. However, Varian entered and was enraged to find that the nobles had been grumbling about the costs of his campaigns, to which the king harshly berated them for their petty complaints. Varian then dismissed the nobles, causing the stunned audience to slowly file out. When Varian didn't show up in time to start his speech to the people of Stormwind, some of the nobles wanted the ceremony to move forward, king or no king, while others insisted that they should wait for their leader, no matter how long it took. When the people began to lose patience, all the nobles and other members of the delegation convinced &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; to give a speech, as he was truly loved by the citizens. After King Varian survived an assassination attempt and made his speech, everyone applauded with joy, even the nobles were standing and cheering, swept up by the power and pride of their king's vision.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s abduction by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as regent and protector of the realm with the support of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. The nobles of Stormwind were keen on restoring Stormwind's defenses in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, and Turalyon remained popular with them in the years to come."}

The dungeon entrance is located in &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"After &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; captured the ancient eagle spirit, &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, civil war spread across the Ohn'ahran Plains like wildfire. To the other clans, Ohn'ahra is more than a mere spirit: she is their goddess. &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; summon elemental forces, and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ukhel\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; command the spirits of legendary &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;. Beset by enemies, the other &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; clans rally. The Nokhud tyrant, &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt;, watches from afar, bellowing commands. Relentless enemy offenses will continue until his forces submit. The battlefield awaits.\"\nOverview.\nThe Nokhud Offensive is somewhat unique among dungeons in that rather than being set in a confined area, it consists of a phased version of the entire &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; zone under a thunderstorm. All of the zone's terrain is intact and can be freely explored, but almost all NPCs are absent and only a few subzones retain their names; in most of the dungeon, the player's location will be displayed as simply \"The Nokhud Offensive\".\nPlayers are encouraged to &lt;a href=\"Dragonriding\"&gt;Dragonride&lt;/a&gt; to fly quickly across the dungeon. To assist in travel, large whirlwinds are present throughout the zone and give an upward and forward boost when flown through, similar to &lt;a href=\"Winds%20of%20the%20Isles\"&gt;Winds of the Isles&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, five flight masters are present throughout the dungeon, offering (slow) flight paths between the objectives: &lt;a href=\"Salukan\"&gt;Salukan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Baqir\"&gt;Baqir&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Spears\"&gt;Battle of Spears&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Huraq\"&gt;Huraq&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ohn%27iri%20Springs\"&gt;Ohn'iri Springs&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Carseng\"&gt;Carseng&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Teerakai\"&gt;Teerakai&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Washengtu\"&gt;Washengtu&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Nokhud%20Approach\"&gt;Nokhud Approach&lt;/a&gt;).\nIt is not possible to venture outside the Ohn'ahran Plains while inside the dungeon. If a player tries to do so, they'll receive an 8-second warning:\nIf they do not turn back before the warning expires, a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ohuna\"&gt;Great Ohuna&lt;/a&gt; picks them up and drops them back in Maruukai.\nMaruukai.\nPlayers start in the center of &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; and are greeted by &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Khansguard%20Akato\"&gt;Khansguard Akato&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khansguard%20Jebotai\"&gt;Jebotai&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player stays in Maruukai, they will repeatedly receive the following prompt:\nBattle of Spears.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Spears\"&gt;Battle of Spears&lt;/a&gt; in the east, &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt; are locked in battle with the Nokhud and &lt;a href=\"Granyth\"&gt;Granyth&lt;/a&gt;. Players need to defeat the packs of Nokhud mobs guarding three &lt;a href=\"Dragonkiller%20Lance\"&gt;Dragonkiller Lance&lt;/a&gt;s before Granyth lands and becomes attackable.\nOhn'iri Springs.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27iri%20Springs\"&gt;Ohn'iri Springs&lt;/a&gt; in the southeast, &lt;a href=\"Tigari%20Khan\"&gt;Tigari Khan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Clan Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; are beset by the Primalists, who have summoned a &lt;a href=\"Raging%20Tempest\"&gt;Raging Tempest&lt;/a&gt;. Players need to destroy all four &lt;a href=\"Stormsurge%20Totem\"&gt;Stormsurge Totem&lt;/a&gt;s to make the Tempest vulnerable.\nEternal Kurgans.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Kurgans\"&gt;Eternal Kurgans&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest, &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ukhel\"&gt;Clan Ukhel&lt;/a&gt; necromancers are raising the spirits of dead centaur while &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Monkh\"&gt;Gravelord Monkh&lt;/a&gt; is trying to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maruuk\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; themselves. Players need to first kill the four Ukhel Soulharvesters, after which Monkh summons Teera and Maruuk. They promptly kill him, and players need to defeat them in turn in order to return them to their kurgans.\nNokhudon Hold.\n&lt;a href=\"Nokhudon%20Hold\"&gt;Nokhudon Hold&lt;/a&gt; is initially inacessible: &lt;a href=\"Nokhud%20Stormcaller\"&gt;Nokhud Stormcaller&lt;/a&gt;s channel \"Stormcaller's Fury\", which damages and grounds anyone trying to Dragonride in, while &lt;a href=\"Furious%20Storm\"&gt;Furious Storm&lt;/a&gt;s are creating a \"Storm Blockade\", which repels anyone trying to move in through the main entrance on the ground. If the player tries to approach the Hold anyway, they'll receive a warning:\nOnly after the first three bosses have all been defeated does the Hold become accessible:\nThe Stormcaller's Fury effect remains active, preventing Dragonriding, so players need to head into the Hold on the ground to get to the boss fight with &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt;. Upon Balakar's death, &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; is freed and the storms clear from the dungeon, returning the skybox to the regular Ohn'ahran Plains one (though the boost-providing whirlwinds remain active). Sarest, Sansok, Tigari, Boku, and their forces run into the center of the Hold; Sarest offers teleports back to the exit portal in Maruukai.\nMaps and subregions.\nMaps.\nThe Nokhud Offensive uses the same map as the open-world Ohn'ahran Plains."}

However, she was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; and according to Nozdormu the pair had \"punched a tunnel through &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; and are tumbling endlessly amongst the infinite possibilities.\" Nozdormu subsequently sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to rescue the pair, where the group ultimately found themselves at the height of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and worked with one another to escape back to the present. Upon their return, Nozdormu allowed Eternus to leave in gratitude for her aid in helping Chromie return to them. However, before departing, Eternus declared that they would bring about his ultimate fate, a statement that Nozdormu met with resignation.\nFollowing the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;, Chromie arranged a meeting between Eternus and Nozdormu as the bronze dragons hoped to sway Eternus to their point of view. At this meeting, Nozdormu admitted that while &lt;a href=\"Dragonflight\"&gt;their flights&lt;/a&gt; viewed the timeline differently, he hoped to discuss peace between them. An outraged Eternus declared that he had no idea what drove them to accept the infinites' ethos, causing him to ask her to help him understand as he sought to mend the rift between their people. Thus Eternus revealed that she joined infinite dragonflight due to the death of her sister Moraidormi and her not being allowed to save her.\nSeeking to understand the infinites, Nozdormu allowed Eternus to show them the past and attempt to save her sister. Through this, Nozdormu was able to make Eternus see that Moraidormi had chosen to sacrifice her own life to save a hidden bronze whelping. Eternus subsequently decided to respect her sister's choice and they returned to the present. Upon their return, Eternus questioned if Nozdormu was going to tell her that he was right, only for the Timeless One to admit that he wasn't because Moraidormi's death was a tragedy, that shouldn't have happened. He then revealed that as a steward of the timeline he must always take the greater good and free will of others into account, but that Eternus had reminded him that compassion must be considered and the one thing he agreed with the infinites with was that some events were worth changing because their hearts wished it so. In response, Eternus acknowledged that he never wished to become &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, that she herself must remember compassion, how it told her to follow him as he was, and promised to speak with the other infinites.\nAs a gesture of goodwill, Eternus pledged her assistance in finding the disc that contained &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s memories, and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; with Chromie and Nozdormu. While Chromie and Eternus worked together to locate the disc, they tasked the adventurer with aiding &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt; in restoring the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;. With the Tyr Guard restored, Chromie and Eternus revealed where they needed to travel in order to use the infinite beacons to pinpoint the disc's location. Thus the group discovered that the disc was in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, with Chromie noting that the disc was in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful master of magic who would know the disc's power.\nQuotes.\nNozdormu just does not see what drives the infinite. That is his blind spot."}

They are known to be collectors and traders of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; items and artifacts. Now drawn to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, many ethereals are seeking to track down its treasures and steal them back into the Twisting Nether. They are liars and scoundrels who will stop at nothing to pursue their mysterious aims. The ethereals have no care at all for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. They would even play both sides of the conflict against each other if doing so would serve to further their own goals.\nEthereals can be found in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; south of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Sunspring\"&gt;Lake Sunspring&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tombs\"&gt;Mana Tombs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and throughout the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. A small number also dwell in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;. The ethereals are driven by trade and economics, and accordingly, their political structures are centered around trade princes and political \"companies\". The ethereal faction called &lt;a href=\"The%20Consortium\"&gt;The Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, which players can gain reputation with, is one of these. The ethereals that currently control the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tombs\"&gt;Mana Tombs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Shaffar\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Shaffar&lt;/a&gt; are another of these \"political companies.\" The &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; is a radical militant organization that attempts to avenge the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"K%27aresh\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; homeworld by &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; creatures. The &lt;a href=\"Protectorate\"&gt;Protectorate&lt;/a&gt; attempts to thwart the void and protect neutral races from the Ethereum's attacks.\nThe ethereals are similar to &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, in the way their political systems work, and like the goblins, the ethereals will support anyone who would further their profits, and oppose anyone who dares interfere with their plans. The ethereals also share in the goblins' propensity for technology, though their technology appears to be far more powerful and otherworldly. Ethereals possess everything from the familiar, such as transporters, to the radical, such as their &lt;a href=\"eco-dome\"&gt;eco-dome&lt;/a&gt;s. They utilize a unique school of magic known as &lt;a href=\"technomancy\"&gt;technomancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile most ethereals seem completely neutral, the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; later allies with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;.\nUniquely aggressive and pugnacious &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt; bulls are culled from the herd and sold to ethereal traders. The traders then train the bulls for combat and sell them to owners unconcerned about safety.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"K%27aresh\"&gt;K'aresh&lt;/a&gt; was an arid planet, home to a thriving ecosystem and several sentient species. The race that would become the ethereals was led by &lt;a href=\"Nexus-King%20Salhadaar\"&gt;Nexus-King Salhadaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow &lt;a href=\"Dimensius%20the%20All-Devouring\"&gt;Dimensius the All-Devouring&lt;/a&gt; found K'aresh is still hotly debated among the surviving ethereals, but the effects of his coming were unmistakable. At least over a thousand years ago, Dimensius assaulted the planet and opened countless gateways into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; around K'aresh, bathing it in &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and dark energies. Using every scrap of its advanced technology, one of the mortal races hastily attempted to construct magical barriers around its cities, but it was only partially successful; although the dark energies were blocked, the unimpeded flood of arcane energy tore away the mortals' corporeal shells and infused their souls with enough energy so that they could subsist without a body\u2026 barely. Members of this race, now called ethereals, took to binding themselves with enchanted strips of cloth to provide their souls with enough structure to survive. This altered state proved to be a blessing in disguise, as their enhanced minds and magical abilities allowed the ethereals to fight Dimensius and his limited forces to a standstill. Over the years, however, Dimensius eventually grew powerful enough to summon armies of fellow &lt;a href=\"Voidwalkers\"&gt;void creatures&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the ethereals to flee into the Twisting Nether.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;, which held the ruling council of Nexus-Princes, started becoming dark and twisted in their obsession for vengeance. This caused many of the Nexus-Princes to leave the council and form their own organizations with their own goals. Undeterred, the Ethereum continued in the search for vengeance against Dimensius, destroying anyone in their way. The &lt;a href=\"Protectorate\"&gt;Protectorate&lt;/a&gt; was formed by a Nexus-Prince, who left the council, to stop the Ethereum in their destructive path. The &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; is another offshoot group, one of the smugglers, traders, and thieves, that aids the Protectorate in their endeavors. The Consortium also do business in the &lt;a href=\"Hara%27samid%20Sector\"&gt;Hara'samid Sector&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Heraazi\"&gt;Heraazi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sodaraami\"&gt;Sodaraami&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Xarodi%20Sector\"&gt;Xarodi Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nA group of ethereals made their way into &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nexus War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; and their ambassador, &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Trader%20Mu%27fah\"&gt;Wind Trader Mu'fah&lt;/a&gt;, appear to have negotiated an accord with &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. Years later they used this connection in a second attempt to \"become &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"%23Legion\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Cataclysm.\nGroups of entrepreneurial ethereals have emerged from the &lt;a href=\"nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt; to offer a host of new technologies and services that will allow the adventurers of Azeroth to customize and store their equipment. Ethereal warpweavers, vaultkeepers, and thaumaturges set up shop in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to give players access to &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Storage\"&gt;Void Storage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reforging\"&gt;Reforging&lt;/a&gt;, for nominal fees. &lt;a href=\"K%27areshi%20Trader\"&gt;K'areshi Trader&lt;/a&gt;s are found coming out of portals at &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nPandaria.\nEthereal traders have journeyed to Pandaria and set up shop in both the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nIt is revealed that in exchange for their aid in the Nexus War, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; had promised the Ethereum access to the blue dragonflight's treasures within the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;. The Ethereum seeks to become an unstoppable force\u2014to become &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, and they are using the &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s in Coldarra to bore into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and call up void energies. After their leader, &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Bilaal\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Bilaal&lt;/a&gt;, is defeated by an adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, Azuregos remains in the Nexus so it will not fall into the wrong hands again.\nMore ethereals called the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard\"&gt;Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Viceroy%20Nezhar\"&gt;Viceroy Nezhar&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. They are of a certain subset of the race that have tragically succumbed to the call of the Void. They are calling the Void to Eredath to cause all of Argus to fall to darkness.\nSome ethereals, including &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadreen\"&gt;Shadreen&lt;/a&gt;, have joined the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that in general both races have developed a mutually beneficial &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Connection\"&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Consortium%20Arcanist\"&gt;ethereal arcanists&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; have been hired by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to maintain portals to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, respectively in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysiology.\nOriginally, ethereals had physical form. When &lt;a href=\"Dimensius%20the%20All-Devouring\"&gt;Dimensius the All-Devouring&lt;/a&gt; assaulted their homeworld of K'aresh, however, the arcane energies he unleashed on them ripped apart their bodies. Only their advanced technology allowed them to survive - barely - as beings of pure energy. Ultimately, it was this very change that allowed them to battle Dimensius on an even-footing and travel through the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to find refuge. Their bodies can take many forms, able to be compacted into small sizes, or expanded to their true form: a mass of glowing energy with vaguely distinguishable head, eyes, and arms. When not covered in their magical wrappings, they are described as beings of pure energy; a mass of irregular power.\nThey most often appear in their specially enchanted wrappings that keep their energy forms bound within their humanoid shapes. Ethereals appear to need to eat and drink, with their vendors selling specialty bread and drinks not found on vendors of other races. The &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Soul-Trader\"&gt;Ethereal Soul-Trader&lt;/a&gt; sells an &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Liqueur\"&gt;Ethereal Liqueur&lt;/a&gt; that can have an odd effect on 'fleshy imbibers' suggesting that ethereals drink it themselves with no ill effects. Based on the foods &lt;a href=\"Eyonix%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Eyonix&lt;/a&gt; sells and their interest in gems, it could be thought they consume them and precious metals. Alternatively, ethereals may not eat at all and sell food only for the sake of the more corporeal beings with whom they trade and interact. &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Trader%20Lathrai\"&gt;Wind Trader Lathrai&lt;/a&gt; says that &lt;a href=\"World%27s%20End%20Tavern\"&gt;World's End Tavern&lt;/a&gt; has nothing to offer for his kind.\nEthereals apparently do not require sleep.\nVoid ethereal.\n&lt;a href=\"Void%20ethereal\"&gt;Void ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s are ethereals infused with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Their energies are dark purple or red. They also hear maddening whispers that sway them to do the will of the Void.\nNexus-stalkers.\nNexus-stalkers are a partially &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void-based&lt;/a&gt; form of ethereal created by the rogue Ethereum faction, and are considered by the Protectorate to be aberrations. Though the Ethereum was initially dedicated to hunting down and taking revenge on Dimensius, their goal later changed to \"becoming void.\" To that end, they constructed a proto-accelerator which was used to manipulate the abundance of Void energy at &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Ultris\"&gt;Manaforge Ultris&lt;/a&gt;, bonding it with their own energy to transform into nexus-stalkers.\nThe physiology of a nexus-stalker is similar to that of a typical ethereal, albeit with hybrid bodies composed in part of Void energy. As such, they appear translucent and perpetually emanate a shadowy, purple miasma. Those that have been encountered have had the ability to drain their enemies' power.\nThe Protectorate eventually put an end to the operation and killed &lt;a href=\"Nexus-King%20Salhadaar\"&gt;Nexus-King Salhadaar&lt;/a&gt;. A number of nexus-stalkers still existed at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Ethereum's efforts in &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganizations.\nEach group is led by a &lt;a href=\"nexus-prince\"&gt;nexus-prince&lt;/a&gt;, all of which came from or are still part of the Ethereum.\nIn Hearthstone.\n have appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", most notably &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Champion%20Saraad\"&gt;Nexus-Champion Saraad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arch-Thief%20Rafaam\"&gt;Arch-Thief Rafaam&lt;/a&gt;. Saraad, a champion jouster participating in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Tournament\"&gt;Grand Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, rides atop an &lt;a href=\"energy-camel\"&gt;energy-camel&lt;/a&gt;, a creature that has yet to be seen in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" proper. Rafaam, the so-called \"supreme archaeologist,\" leads a band of villainous ethereals in opposition of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild%23In%20Hearthstone\"&gt;League of Explorers&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nIn the ' adventure, there is a rare &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; card known as the , which speaks with a distinctly feminine voice, indicating that it is the first known female ethereal to appear in the \"Warcraft\" universe. \"Hearthstone\" has since seen the introduction of other female ethereals in the form of from ' and from \"\".\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard\"&gt;Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt; may be nexus-stalkers, given the deep purple of their energy as opposed to the lighter shades of previously seen ethereals. Both Locus-Walker and the Shadowguard wield Void magics."}

These guys are aggro sensitive and immune to taunt effects.\nThe trick to keeping these off the healers and clothies is to have two tanks racing for aggro. As long as the tanks are 1st and 2nd on threat, the raid can DPS as usual. This also saves the raid when they disarm the highest aggro, as you already have a 2nd tank waiting.\nOld strategy:\nPlayers used to be able to become immune to disarming effects. With Patch 2.3, it is no longer possible to become immune. Effects that reduce Disarm durations are helpful in allowing the tank to regain threat quicker, but will not stop the deaggro effect from happening\nAlternate strategy:\nFeral Druids can be extremely useful as a tank against this enemy since disarm does not impair their tanking ability.\nMelee stand directly behind the thief to avoid cleave and disarm.\nQuotes.\nAggro\nKilling a player\nDeath\nReward.\nReputation: Provides 15 reputation with &lt;a href=\"The%20Violet%20Eye\"&gt;The Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt;."}

They swore vengeance upon &lt;a href=\"Dimensius%20the%20All-Devouring\"&gt;Dimensius the All-Devouring&lt;/a&gt; after he consumed their world. Since then, they have grown dark and twisted, with vengeance becoming their only recourse they have become ruthless. Several of the Nexus-Princes of the Ethereum council abandoned the Ethereum to form other groups and factions with different goals, such as the Consortium, and the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate\"&gt;Protectorate&lt;/a&gt; who believes that the Ethereum have become as great a threat as Dimensius.\nSeeking to use the &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; to \"become void\", the Ethereum's efforts were thwarted by the Protectorate. They later allied with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, they assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.\nEthereum members glow with red or shadowy energies rather than blue.\nHistory.\nThe Ethereum were once the ruling class of &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; on their homeworld, &lt;a href=\"K%27aresh\"&gt;K'aresh&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly before &lt;a href=\"Dimensius%20the%20All-Devouring\"&gt;Dimensius the All-Devouring&lt;/a&gt; unleashed his &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; armies upon the world, the ethereals were forced to evacuate K'aresh, after which the Ethereum vowed vengeance against Dimensius. They have been tracking the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt; ever since.\nHowever, the Ethereum have since grown \"dark... twisted\". Vengeance has become their only recourse and any that would stand in their way or not join their cause are considered enemies. Many ethereals saw that the Ethereum were plummeting into madness and left. Several of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus-prince\"&gt;Nexus-Princes&lt;/a&gt; of the Ethereum council abandoned the Ethereum to form other groups and factions with different goals, such as the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate\"&gt;Protectorate&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which was formed to serve as opponents to the Ethereum.\nOutland.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, it is discovered that the Ethereum seek not only to hunt Dimensius, but to become &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. They are manipulating void energy at &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Ultris\"&gt;Manaforge Ultris&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; to bond their own energy into \"&lt;a href=\"Ethereal%23Nexus-stalkers\"&gt;nexus-stalkers&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOther than Netherstorm, Ethereum members can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bash%27ir\"&gt;Bash'ir&lt;/a&gt; are an Ethereum group in Blade's Edge using &lt;a href=\"Ethereum%20Prison\"&gt;Ethereum Prison&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ethereum%20Stasis%20Chamber\"&gt;Ethereum Stasis Chamber&lt;/a&gt;s to capture different creatures.\nUltimately, the Ethereum came under assault by both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt;. Not only were their operations in Blade's Edge and Netherstorm stopped, but their leader, &lt;a href=\"Nexus-King%20Salhadaar\"&gt;Nexus-King Salhadaar&lt;/a&gt; was killed as well. Following their leader's death, a group of Ethereum aided &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Magister%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Magister's Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, likely led by &lt;a href=\"Yazzai\"&gt;Yazzai&lt;/a&gt;. When heroes entered the Terrace to put an end to the Sun King, these Ethereum shared the same fate as their fallen Nexus-King while defending Kael'thas.\nNorthrend.\nFollowing the defeat of the forces in Outland and on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the Ethereum sent a small force to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Though their motives were unclear, it is known that &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Trader%20Mu%27fah\"&gt;Wind Trader Mu'fah&lt;/a&gt; of the Ethereum and &lt;a href=\"Goramosh\"&gt;Goramosh&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; were able to work out an accord. Though apparently joining the blue dragonflight in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, the Ethereum haven't actively participated in it, except for the Wind Trader's involvement.\nLegion.\nIt is revealed that in exchange for their aid in the Nexus War, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; had promised the Ethereum access to the blue dragonflight's treasures within the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, as it was negotiated in the accord between Goramosh and Mu'fah several years earlier. The Ethereum seeks to become an unstoppable force--to become &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, and they are using the &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s in Coldarra to bore into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and call up void energies. After &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Bilaal\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Bilaal&lt;/a&gt; is defeated by an adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, Azuregos remains in the Nexus so that it will not fall into the wrong hands again.\nThe title of &lt;a href=\"Saprish\"&gt;Saprish&lt;/a&gt; is \"Ethereum-Lord of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard\"&gt;Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt;\" hinting at a connection between the Ethereum and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard\"&gt;Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "16905", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16905", "title": "Etiquette", "text": "The etiquette is an important part of any &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt; gaming process, and refers to social rules associated to the player's behavior other than those imposed by the game, &lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;GMs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"EULA\"&gt;EULA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"TUA\"&gt;TUA&lt;/a&gt;. In some games, etiquette might only be optional, but in WoW, players generally tend to encourage others to use etiquette to improve the joyfulness of general gaming process. This is especially true on &lt;a href=\"RP\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; servers, where breaking etiquette is akin to &lt;a href=\"hack\"&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt;ing or &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt;, and is punishable by a &lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;. In retrospect, some of the role-playing rules might be eased if proper etiquette is respected by the breaker.\nBecause punishing bad etiquette relies on the boor being ostracized and unable to find anyone to group with, his reputation must reach a high a percentage of the players in his &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; as possible. With high server populations, a poor reputation may not spread as far and as fast. This means the tendency is, the lower the server &lt;a href=\"population\"&gt;population&lt;/a&gt;, the better the overall etiquette as more people know each other."}

Many ettins have also been enslaved or recruited by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult.\nThe ettins of Highmountain seem to operate under some sort of hierarchy above their already existing tribal network, as &lt;a href=\"Hill%20Prince%20Urgo\"&gt;Hill Prince Urgo&lt;/a&gt;, like his father before him, was destined to be the lord of all the hill ettin tribes in Highmountain. They build armor from stolen Gilneas houses and &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; ruins, and some forge their own armor. The ettin of Highmountain eat &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; that have been cooked over bonfires.\nThe skin of an ettin is thicker than that of a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and half as pliable.\nIn the RPG.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt; also appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three&lt;/a&gt; with the following description:\n\"Ettins are two-headed giants who tower over normal &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. These creatures were the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s' first attempt at creating the feared &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, but they proved too stupid and dangerous to be used even as shock troops for the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s soldiers. Some of them escaped annihilation and have created a few &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s. Their mud-and-dung hovels clump together against ravines and in other barren places, and ettins spend their time trying to figure out the nature of fire. Because it seems so difficult, they often prefer to eat their &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; raw.\"\n\"Ettins live in the mountains and valleys of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, preferring to keep far from civilization. In order to do so, they often inhabit the most desolate and barren territories -- literally, the land no one else wants. Still, ettins make their living not only from hunting but also from primitive agrarian efforts.\""}

She was married to Alexei Barov's butler &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Sarkhoff\"&gt;Lucien Sarkhoff&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Barov family accepted &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s offer of immortality, Eva and Lucien hid in the corridors of the Caer Darrow keep. They stole food from their former masters and survived that way for six months. In those months they watched horrors of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; arriving to gain further training in the arts of necromancy everyday. But then it happened.\nThey were discovered by the undead and they were used for experiments of &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Theolen%20Krastinov\"&gt;Doctor Theolen Krastinov&lt;/a&gt;. They were tortured for days and weeks, denied death by magical means. When finally the Doctor was finished with them and they felt death's embrace, it was but a short pleasure. Lucien and Eva were revived and thrown to the ghouls, who devoured them.\nNow their spirits are trapped in Azeroth, and they ask adventurers to travel to Scholomance and burn their remains so that they can leave Azeroth for eternity.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nThank you for all you have done, &lt;name&gt;. I may not know what the future has in store for Caer Darrow, but I feel a sense of peace that had long since become foreign to me.\nHello young &lt;Master / Mistress&gt;. I am Eva Sarkhoff and this is my husband, Lucien. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.\nCertainly, &lt;sir/miss&gt;. We were once servants of the house Barov: What is now known as the Scholomance.\nI was the head maid and Lucien was Master Barov's butler.\nWe had worked for the Barovs for decades, until...\n&lt;Eva weeps.&gt;\nOh it's just so horrible, &lt;sir / miss&gt;. The house Barov was once full of life... full of splendor. The manor was the Barov's primary residence amidst their far reaching empire.\nLucien and I noticed that as the days progressed, the Barovs became depressed. Despondent. Paranoia and rage often overcame the master and missus. At night, we could hear the Barovs arguing in their chambers. From what we understood, their greed had 'broken the dam,' so to speak.\nWe suspect that in order to preserve their fortune and hold of the land - well past their lifespan - the Barovs made a deal with a powerful human mage named &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;Eva shudders.&gt;\nFrom this deal sprang the school of necromancy: A place which bore the Cult of the Damned and would become their capital.\nAs each week passed, the house Barov became more and more decrepit...\nDark beings began to take residence in the various wings of the house. Upkeep became impossible... and disgusting.\nAnd go where? It was all that we knew; all that we had known and all that we would ever know.\nEventually, we lost contact with the Barovs and ultimately, were separated from the household. We knew not what happened to the other servants, only that there were screams. Tortured screams.\nKnowing that we had nowhere to go, Lucien and I were forced to hide in our quarters. During the day, when the school was relatively quiet, Lucien would sneak out to scrounge up food and drink.\nWe did this for about six months and watched as the house went through horrifying changes. Foul monsters roamed through the manor at will. Dark cultists populated every inch with various paraphernalia relating to rituals and sacrifices. We knew that we could not hide much longer.\nAs expected, we were found and captured. They stripped us of all our clothes and laid us out inside a circle of blood. We sat there for days, naked and terrified.\nRestraints? There are things in this world far more restraining than bars and shackles, young &lt;master / mistress&gt;. The undead surrounded us, constantly tormenting us with horrifying acts of depravity.\nFinally, he came. He introduced himself as Doctor Theolen Krastinov. We came to know him as 'The Butcher.'\nWe finally understood what the screams were from. The Butcher exposed us to pain that we did not know existed. He used us in countless experiments, attempting to devise a plague.\nThe days turned to weeks. We would have died on the first day had it not been for that cruel monster keeping us alive through magical means.\nThe Butcher would speak of 'the blood of innocents,' and his dark master, 'Kirtonos.' Of how he must appease his master. \nFinally, the beast was done with his experiments. We had been drained of all life. Our spirits shattered. The sweet embrace of death was upon us and we welcomed it with open arms. But in his infinite cruelty, the Butcher revived us from death's door. \nWe were to be kept alive and thrown to his ravenous ghouls. He laughed as he watched the fiends devour our flesh. \nWe feel nothing. Our souls remain here, in limbo. We are unable to leave until our remains are found and spirits laid to rest.\nRelatives.\nShe might also be related to &lt;a href=\"Tobias%20Sarkhoff\"&gt;Tobias Sarkhoff&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is triggered when an attacking mob is unable to reach its target (due to terrain limitations for example), or when the mob is &lt;a href=\"leash\"&gt;leash&lt;/a&gt;ing (running back to its original location after having chased a player on a too long distance, for example). Its purpose is to discourage exploitation of terrain versus an enemy.\nWhen a mob is in evade mode, it becomes immune to any and all attacks and spells from every player, and will regenerate health as though it was out of combat.\nIn the case of evade due to terrain limitations, the target should go closer to the mob so he becomes attackable again. The mob will then drop evade mode. This is often experienced in boss encounters, such as &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anub%27Rekhan\"&gt;Anub'Rekhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvade is also triggered by targets who have been trapped in the game field. These such creatures would walk into an area that cannot be exited, such as between two rocks. In this situation the target can still &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;, but it cannot be attacked at range. The player must be in melee range of the creature to attack it with anything. \nSometimes mobs spawn in tricky locations where it is hard or impossible to actually attack them without triggering evade. Such mobs are called \"evadebugged\"."}

{"id": "15508", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15508", "title": "Detect Magic", "text": "Prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, Detect Magic was a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; spell that allowed the mage (and others) to see the magical &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s on an &lt;a href=\"enemy\"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt; target. Normally, you could only see &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s put there by you or others. With the default Blizzard UI, the target's buffs appeared directly below the row of debuffs on the target's unit frame. The Detect Magic debuff placed on the target was dispellable as a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dispel%20type%29\"&gt;magic debuff&lt;/a&gt;. The spell caused no threat, and could be cast on enemies without &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;ing them, similar to &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Mark\"&gt;Hunter's Mark&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips and tactics.\nDetect Magic was useful in several PvE encounters where a boss may use a special self buff throughout the fight. Some bosses had a damage shield or a reflective shield that could be dangerous if not detected quickly. While these buffs also usually had a casting animation with them, it was difficult to spot it amongst the visual clutter when many other players were attacking the same target. Detect magic would show the buff clearly on the target's unit frame.\nDetect Magic was also good for finding buffs that mages could &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere was no &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; on this ability (aside from the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Cooldown\"&gt;Universal Cooldown&lt;/a&gt;).\nThis spell had an unusually long range, so it could be used in PvP to cause panic when enemy players saw you casting \"something\" from very far away.\nMages often used this spell to mark targets for &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;. For example: \"The one that just had the swirling, glowing ball around it is the one I will polymorph.\"\nSince it was a &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;, this spell could be dispelled; but you could also use it to \"insulate\" other debuffs. Debuffs are dispelled in the order they are cast, putting this on an enemy before your &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; friend casts his curses will make your enemy have to dispel your Detect Magic before he can get to the more harmful effects. Most dispels are instant cast and very cheap, so it's main benefit is the time it takes.\nWhen facing a hostile &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Felhunter\"&gt;Felhunter&lt;/a&gt; in a one-on-one fight, cast this spell on him before &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;, so the Felhunter will have to dispel it (with &lt;a href=\"Devour%20Magic\"&gt;Devour Magic&lt;/a&gt;) first then wait the &lt;a href=\"Cooldown\"&gt;Cooldown&lt;/a&gt; of 8 seconds to dispel your Polymorph. Eight seconds are often priceless in this kind of encounter.\nIn the RPG.\nDetect Magic is a &lt;a href=\"magic%20schools%20%28RPG%29\"&gt;divination spell&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s. It allows a caster to detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long someone studies a particular area or subject. It can show the presence or absence of magical auras. With further study, it can show the number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura. Finally, with enough time, it can give the strength and location of each aura."}

This event fires whenever a spellcast is completed server end, regardless of whether it is instant or cast. Therefore whenever an instant cast has been used successfully, this event will fire. However, there are times when _SUCCEEDED will fire but the spell is not instant. The events UNIT_SPELLCAST_START, UNIT_SPELLCAST_FAILED, and UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTED (hereafter _START, _FAILED, and _INTERRUPTED) allow us to track precisely which spellcasts are instant and which are not.\nThe key to this code is the relation between these events. Here are the relevant details:\nThus, to detect instant spells, note when someone starts] casting a spell, then watch for a corresponding finishing event. Any finishing event that occurs without an unfinished start event preceding it describes an instant cast spell.\nExample code.\n -- you should replace this with a better one\n local print = function (msg)\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(msg)\n end\n is_casting = false\n SampleTracker = CreateFrame(\"Frame\", nil, UIParent)\n SampleTracker:RegisterEvent(\"UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED\")\n SampleTracker:RegisterEvent(\"UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTED\")\n SampleTracker:RegisterEvent(\"UNIT_SPELLCAST_FAILED\")\n SampleTracker:RegisterEvent(\"UNIT_SPELLCAST_START\")\n SampleTracker:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", function (_,e) SampleTrackerFunctions[e]() end)\n ----\n function SampleTrackerFunctions.UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED()\n if not is_casting then\n print(\"An instant spell, oh my!\")\n end\n is_casting = false\n end\n function SampleTrackerFunctions.UNIT_SPELLCAST_START()\n is_casting = true\n end\n function SampleTrackerFunctions.UNIT_SPELLCAST_FAILED()\n is_casting = false\n end\nChanneled Spells.\nNote that channeled spells are actually considered two casts by the event engine: first, the preceding component spellcast, then channeling component itself. For clarity, consider Mind Control. The preceding component is the 3-second cast before the spell takes effect, and the channeling component is the actual mind control portion of the spell. Note that every channeled spell has a preceding component, though many of them are instant.\nIn other words, don't be surprised when the sample code (or any code using this strategy) picks up abilities like Mind Vision or Drain Life as instant. Technically, there is an instant cast spell associated with such abilities."}

The key is a white item which is always dropped, and can be picked up by any player with loot rights.

Note that the key is placed automatically in your keyring rather than in your bags. \nIf the players' goal is to free Marshal Windsor for his escort quest &lt;a href=\"Jail%20Break%21\"&gt;Jail Break!&lt;/a&gt;, they should first clear the entire detention block of enemies.

In particular, clear out the locked store room on the west side of the detention block loop where Windsor's belongings are kept before starting the escort quest, as the event will spawn additional mobs in that area, making it a very difficult pull. Once Windsor steps out of his cell, he walks clockwise through the Detention Block halls, then across the large entry room, then clockwise through the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20the%20Law\"&gt;Halls of the Law&lt;/a&gt; outside the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Law\"&gt;Ring of the Law&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccess to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Highway\"&gt;Dark Iron Highway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"East%20Garrison\"&gt;East Garrison&lt;/a&gt; are found past locked doors openable with the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Key\"&gt;Shadowforge Key&lt;/a&gt;.

It takes a dedicated hunter a great deal of patience or a group of helpful friends to weaken him enough for his will to falter so that he can be &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;tamed&lt;/a&gt;. There's a big problem: Getting hit by Deth Strike will result in an imminent defeat. He's quite slow, so it's possible to shoot him from good distance of 40 meters {120 feet} while on the move. He also has an aura that, much to a healer's dismay, reduces any heals received by almost 100%. \nTwo hunter strategy.\nIt is possible for two (or three) hunters and their pets to take the beast to low health without further assistance. The basic premise is that one hunter lets their pet aggro, take a Deth Strike, die and thus reduce Deth'tilac's health. The other hunter, standing on the far other side, sends their pet in, so that the first hunter can &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;feign&lt;/a&gt; and revive the dead pet. This repeats alternatingly until Deth'tilac is low enough to be tamed, at which point the hunter intending to tame the spider dismisses their current pet if necessary and uses &lt;a href=\"Distracting%20Shot\"&gt;Distracting Shot&lt;/a&gt; to be able to start the tame, given enough distance and ongoing slows.\nAuto-shots should continue whenever possible until the tame begins to prevent Deth Metal stacking, as well as &lt;a href=\"Concussive%20Shot\"&gt;Concussive Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Trap\"&gt;Ice Trap&lt;/a&gt; to guarantee a large enough time window for Feign Death and the tame itself.\nKiting strategy.\nAn additional strategy is to kite him to the daily quest hub, where the NPCs will attack him. Simply kite him using autoshot and concussive shot until he reaches the camp. He will eventually Deth Strike the NPCs enough to reach the requires percent to tame him. A drawback to this strategy is that there are many more players in this area, allowing more room for tame stealing, other players pulling aggro, making it impossible to tame, or one too many players taunting and getting Deth Striked, resulting in Deth'tilac's defeat. To avoid accidents like this, its recommended to kite him behind the spire, but be careful not to fall off the cliff.\nWarning.\nIt is possible for another hunter to steal the tame while you are busy keeping Deth'tilac slowed. Be careful that it does not happen to you.\nTrivia.\nBecause of his blueish purple hide, Deth'tilac is the most sought after spider."}

While Detheroc was the leader of the three &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt;, he was not necessarily the most powerful.\nBiography.\nThe breaking of Ner'zhul.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s command a group of dreadlords consisting of Detheroc, &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; tortured the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; after he had escaped from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Ner'zhul, his sanity cracking, would agree to serve Kil'jaeden. Kil'jaeden passed the orc's spirit through death and revived as a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;spectral entity&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadlords bound his disembodied spirit to a specifically crafted set of armor and a mighty &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. These items were locked in a diamond-hard block of ice to imprison Ner'zhul. The Lich King and the dreadlords who had tortured him were then sent to Azeroth in order to weaken any resistance that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; would face during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. While the Lich King gathered his strength, Detheroc and his fellow dreadlords would serve as jailors and executors meant to hasten the Lich King's task by any means necessary. To this end, they would construct the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Though seemingly broken by the dreadlords, Ner'zhul sought vengeance and was able to play on the dreadlord's fears of Kil'jaeden in order trick them into allowing him to hurl Frostmourne out of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Detheroc began to notice that much time had passed without hearing a word from &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. One day, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; stormed into the palace and informed them that their Legion was defeated and that their deaths would seal that fate. They were able to flee before he could strike. Hiding in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, they coerced &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; into assisting them, and planned a coup to take back Lordaeron and rule what were now known as the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Detheroc and his brothers assumed control of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; and ambushed Arthas, but the resilient &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; battled his way through their forces and fled across the sea to his master in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Arthas gone, Detheroc and the other dreadlords concentrated their power in Lordaeron. When &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; asked Sylvanas to join their new order she refused, butchered his forces, and turned him to her own side. Detheroc was not so easily defeated. He used his powers of domination to control the human general, &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, and when Sylvanas launched her next attack upon him in a city in the Plaguelands, he turned Garithos and his forces loose on her. With Varimathras at her side, Sylvanas managed to keep Garithos at bay as she stormed into Detheroc's base and tore him apart.\nLegion.\nWhile leading an attack on &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; remarked that any dreadlord slain on the mortal plane is merely banished to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and opined that Detheroc and his brothers may return some day. His theory proved true several years later when, just before the &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, discovered a trap set by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Before they could warn the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Detheroc ambushed the SI:7 agents and captured their leader, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, and impersonated him. &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; managed to get away and tried to warn &lt;a href=\"the%20Uncrowned\"&gt;the Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; but Detheroc, posing as Shaw, ordered SI:7 agents to kill her.\nAs Shaw, Detheroc spoke lies to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and manipulated the new king into preparing Stormwind's armies to attack them, intent on instigating another conflict between the Alliance and Horde when the world could least afford it. To cover his tracks, Detheroc placed wanted posters of the members of the Uncrowned all over Stormwind, claiming they had conspired with the Burning Legion and offering rewards for their deaths. After &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;a member&lt;/a&gt; of the Uncrowned freed the real Mathias Shaw, &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Admiral%20Tethys\"&gt;Fleet Admiral Tethys&lt;/a&gt; snuck them and &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; into Stormwind during the night. The three &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s made their way to , where they exposed and killed Detheroc.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing his rebirth, Detheroc joined his fellow nathrezim in invading &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; in order to rescue &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;. He was personally warned that if he failed again, he would be flayed, and was responsible for recovering an asset. It was left unclear if the asset in question was Denathrius, who the nathrezim successfully liberated from his prison, or someone else.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They are tiny because they have been altered by the &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20creature\"&gt;deviate magic&lt;/a&gt; of the Wailing Caverns. They are a full-grown, but remarkably little, version of a common freshwater species of trout. The deviate fish are about 2\u00a0inches long, whereas a normal adult trout grows upward of 1 foot long. Furthermore, deviate fish radiate faint auras of transformation magic. Consuming one of these fish, either alive or cooked, produces various effects, usually \"reduce person\" which lasts for two minutes. They are very common throughout the Shrine of the Scarabs section of the caverns (WoW RPG, not in the online game). They do not survive more than a day or so outside the Wailing Caverns, and once dead their power fades after several hours.\nSource.\nDeviate Fish are caught with the &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; skill.

Catches from the schools of Deviate Fish are approximately 90% Deviate Fish. There appear to be four schools of Deviate Fish spawned concurrently among the three oases, in any of four spots in each oasis, for a total of twelve possible locations. When one is fished out, another immediately spawns at another location - any empty spot, other than the one just fished, in any of the three oasis. Since four spots, including the one you just fished out are considered to be occupied, each empty spot has a one in eight chance to spawn the next school. If no one is fishing the other oases, you will shortly empty the schools in your oasis and have to travel to another to find a new school. \nThe waters within the instance may be preferred because mobs can be cleared, and hostile players from the other &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; cannot enter your instance.\nThis item can also be commonly found inside the &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Fishing%20Treasures%20%28Dalaran%29\"&gt;Bag of Fishing Treasures (Dalaran)&lt;/a&gt; rewarded from completing &lt;a href=\"Marcia%20Chase\"&gt;Marcia Chase&lt;/a&gt;'s daily fishing quests in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.

While evil in nature, it is my opinion that some good can come from their existence here in Kalimdor.

According to &lt;a href=\"Nalpak\"&gt;Nalpak&lt;/a&gt; they are evil in nature and their existence causes great pain to the earth.\nCataclysm.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; has formed the &lt;a href=\"Overgrowth\"&gt;Overgrowth&lt;/a&gt; and within it the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.

Studies of this area attempt to identify the source of the deviate magic, but all attempts thus far have ended in failure. Creatures that live most of their lives in the Wailing Caverns gain the use of a spell-like ability for as long as they continue to dwell in or near that area. A deviate creature radiates an aura identical to its spell-like ability\u2019s effect. A &lt;a href=\"Black%20ooze\"&gt;deviate black ooze&lt;/a&gt; with a mirror image ability bears a faint illusion aura, even if the mirror image is not active. The identify spell can determine a deviate creature\u2019s spell-like ability, although most will not sit still long enough for this spell to be cast. Dispel magic has no effect on a deviate creature\u2019s spell-like ability until it is used, in which case resolve the dispel effect normally."}

While most died out long ago, some thrive in isolated pockets to this day. There is much speculation about the purpose of the devilsaur's degenerate front arms. One theory is that they help devilsaurs rise to a standing position; another theory suggests that the arms titillate females. More observation is necessary.\nThey are one of the most recognizable and unique creatures in \"World of Warcraft\". All the devilsaurs in Un'Goro are &lt;a href=\"Elite%20creature\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; and range from level 54-60, the largest being &lt;a href=\"King%20Mosh\"&gt;King Mosh&lt;/a&gt;. All members of the devilsaur family are a deadly threat to the unlucky person they come across. They can be skinned for &lt;a href=\"Devilsaur%20Leather\"&gt;Devilsaur Leather&lt;/a&gt;, used in the popular &lt;a href=\"Devilsaur_Leather%23Leatherworking\"&gt;Devilsaur Set Tribal Leather Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Xibala%20%28devilsaur%29\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt; was the first of the devilsaurs, and mother to the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, mother to all that came after. Her bones remain far to the south of Zandalar.\nAs a hunter pet.\nOnly hunters with the 51 point &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; talent will be able to tame these exotic beasts. They are extremely popular pets, mostly due to their Tyrannosaurus Rex likeness and looks.\nIn the RPG.\nThis giant lizard walks on two powerfully muscled hind legs. Two stunted, taloned forelimbs stretch out before it, and rows of bloodstained teeth fill its maw. The devilsaur takes its name from its vicious, relentless attacks, during which it utterly savages its victims to death. The devilsaur uses its bite to assault its prey, and its powerful hind legs and sheer size allow it to chase down almost any chosen prey. Despite the ferocity of this ill-tempered beast, hunters prize its extraordinarily tough but supple hide and often seek it out. Devilsaurs can grow to heights exceeding thirty feet and can weigh almost sixteen tons. Females tend to be smaller and lighter than males, but are even more aggressive. In a reversal of most creatures\u2019 natural gender roles, a female devilsaur abandons her eggs as soon as she lays them; male devilsaurs can identify a clutch of eggs they've fathered by scent, and will protect that clutch until the eggs hatch. The devilsaur uses its intimidating speed to charge prey as soon as they are within range. It typically targets the smallest creatures in a pack first, closing its powerful jaws over them and lifting them off the ground. The devilsaur mauls its prey, biting and shaking until it or the enemy stops moving, swallows, and then moves on to the next target. Badly wounded devilsaurs have been known to flee, sometimes carrying opponents with them."}

Embodying the virtue of loyalty, she was a staunch believer in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;'s sacred mission of ferrying souls to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. This resolve was forever shaken, however, when she encountered the soul of &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, inexplicably wounded by the power of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. As her warnings fell on deaf ears, Devos took this as proof that the kyrian path was fundamentally flawed, and that a new future was needed for the Ascended.\nDeclaring civil war on the Archon and her forces, the new Paragon of Doubt led the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; against their former brethren, eventually attacking the Archon herself atop the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Spires of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. Devos was ultimately slain in battle against the Archon and her allies as the Forsworn assault was driven back. She was succeeded as Paragon of Doubt by her second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nUther and Arthas.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; was killed by his student &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, part of his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was ferried to Bastion from &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. Devos personally welcomed him on his arrival and informed him that he had earned the opportunity to become one of the Ascended, a fact Uther struggled to accept. In an unusual act for a Paragon (though fully within her rights), Devos would decide to take on Uther's training personally. Her fellow Paragon &lt;a href=\"Thenios\"&gt;Thenios&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that this was beneath her station, but Devos replied that she was concerned that Uther's soul seemed broken and that this is why he was failing to let go of his memories and ascend. She even began wondering if the Lightbringer had been sent to Bastion by mistake, though Thenios quietly cautioned her against such thoughts and to trust the path.\nDevos later discovered that Uther's soul had literally been wounded. When she touched the wound, she saw a vision of the paladin's death and recognized Arthas' blade, &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, as an instrument of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; from its runes. Devos immediately brought this news to &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt;, telling her that an agent wielding the power of the Maw was running rampant on a &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;mortal world&lt;/a&gt; and posing a threat to Bastion. Furthermore, if Uther's memories had been purged as the path demanded, the kyrian would've never learned of this danger\u2014in other words, the path was flawed. The Archon interrupted Devos, telling her that the Shadowlands depended on the kyrian carrying out their charge and that she had to abandon her rebellious course. In response, Devos verbally agreed, but then returned to Uther and asked if he still wanted to punish Arthas. When Uther responded that he did, Devos prematurely transformed him into an Ascended and told him that on the moment of Arthas' death, the two would claim his soul.\nWhen Arthas was defeated atop &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Devos and Uther claimed his soul. Devos urged Uther to cast Arthas into the Maw and return him to the darkness he served. Uther hesitated, sadly remembering that Arthas had once been his student, but Devos reminded him why they had brought Arthas here\u2014to take vengeance for what he had done. His will steeled but once again stating that it was never about vengeance for his own death but the crimes Arthas had committed, Uther released Arthas to the Maw's depths.\nRise of the Forsworn.\nDevos's new purpose did not end when Arthas Menethil was cast into the Maw. Now turned fully against the ancient path of the kyrian, she began recruiting others who, like Uther, shared her doubts. One of these kyrian was &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt;, a Hand of Loyalty, who Devos convinced to turn against the path and the Archon. Many others were recruited into what became the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, in particular doubt-filled aspirants unwittingly sent from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Temple of Purity&lt;/a&gt; to have their resolve restored; instead, Devos and her followers encouraged these doubts while offering a new path.\nTo gain the power needed for her quest, Devos aligned herself with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and the power of the Maw, although not all recruits and members of the Forsworn were aware of this alliance. The actions of the former Paragon of Loyalty were hidden from the Archon and the Ascended for some time, as Devos pretended to remain loyal, despite having long since become the Paragon of Doubt. It was only when Lysonia and the Forsworn attacked the Temple of Purity on Devos's orders that the other kyrian became aware of the Forsworn threat. At the same time, the Forsworn also gained control of other important locations in Bastion, including the &lt;a href=\"Mnemonic%20Locus\"&gt;Mnemonic Locus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Eternal%20Forge\"&gt;Eternal Forge&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was during a ritual of ascension at &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; to create new Ascended kyrian that Devos revealed herself to be leading the rebellion, confronting the Archon herself and shattering the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; in a surprise attack. Forsworn forces then launched a full assault on both the Hold and the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Spires of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of seizing total control of Bastion's power. It was only with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt; allied to the kyrian that the rebels were driven back, with Devos herself engaged atop the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Archon\"&gt;Seat of the Archon&lt;/a&gt; as she wielded the Archon's own spear. After a fight, the Paragon of Doubt was overcome and slain, ending the immediate threat.\nDespite Devos's death, the Forsworn continued their campaign against the Ascended under the direction of Lysonia."}

They crawl forth from the cracks between the realms, usually through glowing blue rifts, and have a voracious appetite for &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nNo one knows where the devourers came from, but it is &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;theorized&lt;/a&gt; that they have their origins in the &lt;a href=\"In-Between\"&gt;In-Between&lt;/a&gt; and that they flourish on several lost land masses there. According to &lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;Saezurah&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Automa%23Oracle\"&gt;oracle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, the devourers once \"had purpose\" and were \"made for balance\", but they have since become \"altered\" and now instead pose a threat to the design of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. It's unclear if she's referring to all devourers or only the mutated ones in Zereth Mortis.\nIn recent times, the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought has fueled the devourers' relentless hunger, driving them to seek new sources, and all denizens of the Shadowlands see their recent boldness as a sign of the end times.\nDevourers are attracted to the scent of anima like moths to a flame. Anima they consume gains some strange properties, such as the ability to open rifts to the In-Between and \"infest\" objects, causing them to glow with energy. Devourer bodies contain a liquid that resembles blood but is heavily infused with anima.\nDevourers exist in various types and levels of power throughout the In-Between. So far, six variants have been seen: &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;-like worldeaters or goliaths, who can drain &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from an entire region within a matter of moments; a slightly smaller, hunched version referred to as gorgers; small, flying insect-like creatures called mites or animites; two-legged, bestial scavengers or maulers; levitating, humanoid controllers, who are often seen maintaining rifts for other devourers; and giant, burrowing sandworms.\nDevourers can be found infesting most of the main afterlives of the Shadowlands, most prominently &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. Some even broke into &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt;, drawn to &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;'s abundant store of anima. When the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; opened a portal to Zereth Mortis, devourers found their way into that realm as well and began consuming the magic of the First Ones, causing them to begin mutating and falling apart."}

To prevent their escape, and use every scrap of the damned, the Lich King created the Devourer of Souls. The Devourer of Souls hunts and consumes the stray spirits, and slowly breaks them down within its terrible form. The consumed souls are driven mad with anguish and suffering, but the Devourer's hunger is never sated.\"\nStrategy.\nThe Devourer fairly continuously casts Phantom Blast on the main tank if he is not doing anything else. If possible, this should be interrupted as a sequence of successful casts can quickly kill the tank. If your tank is a warrior, have him use &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt; as well, as it can be reflected back to The Devourer. Other things he could be doing include...\nSomewhat frequently, the Devourer will leap to another player in the party and create a Well of Souls at that player's position. The well lasts upwards of 15 seconds and does some fairly intense damage to anyone still standing in it.\nWhile Mirrored Soul is active, any damage dealt to the Devourer will be mirrored proportionally with whoever has the debuff. Thus, it is imperative to stop DPS while the debuff is up.\nThe Devourer will on occasion stop whatever else he is doing and summon a very large number of wraiths. They do not hit very hard but there are a lot of them and they cannot be targeted. Run away if the damage taken winds up being too great.\nFinally, the Devourer will unleash a wail of souls. He does a 90 degree sweep of the room (either clockwise or counterclockwise) starting from the position of a random, but debuffed player. He starts wailing around three seconds after casting the debuff, and will wail for 15 seconds. Anyone caught in front of him takes a very high amount of damage ticking every 0.4 seconds.\nOne further thing to note is that the encounter will reset if the party runs back down the stairs, leaving enough time to resurrect 2 players (possibly more) before The Devourer respawns. \nQuotes.\nThe Devourer has 3 faces through which will switch during the fight. They all have the same quotes."}
