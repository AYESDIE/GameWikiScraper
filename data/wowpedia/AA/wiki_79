{"id": "110371", "revid": "41545990", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=110371", "title": "Great Sea expansion pack ideas/PvP", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea%20expansion%20pack%20ideas\"&gt;Return to the main article&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Great Sea is a giant ocean, between Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. It contains numerous islands, as well mysterious secrets to explore. \nNow, the Great Sea is filled with pirates, as well as enemies from the Horde or Alliance to fight. \nThis causes conflict constantly on the high seas. The point of having the cannons and other battle-like equipment on your ship is to be ready for battle. \nYou would have to be flagged to get into conflict, like normal PvP on PvE or RPservers, which would flag your ship. Guild ships cannot be attacked for obvious reasons. \nThe ship would act somewhat like a mount, but with combat abilities. If the ship is destroyed, you would all go into the ocean, and if you are not near land, you would die of fatigue eventually. The ships would not be destroyed for good, and you could summon it like a mount. \nYou must be level 40 or higher to get anything besides a rowboat. You can buy the rowboat at level 1 if you have enough money (40 gold). You cannot reach the bottom of the sea by submarine because animals of myth are down there to sink any curious adventurer, watch out for sharks, giant squid, the kraken or even maybe the best of them all, Nessy! \nShip Upgrades - Instead of buying different kinds of boats you get one basic boat, and you can add different things to it weapons, armor, sails, a mast, engines, oars, beds (allows rested EXP to be gained on board), trade stations (allows you to turn the ship into a portable shop linked to the ocean wide auction house that is also linked to the Steamwheede auction houses, and repair your weapons/armor [not your ship]), emergency boats, repair stations. \nAllows your ship to detect humanoids, beasts, and other ships. This also allows the placement of a Flag (like a tabard but for a ship instead). Some flag types can give very minor bonuses I.E. mageweave flag +5 spirit bonus (this affects the ship and its crew) and can be enchanted. It also adds a crow\u2019s nest, which a player can get in action by clicking the main mast. \nGives the Boat a short 20-second burst of speed allowing the boat to go twice as fast as the boat\u2019s normal sailing rate. \nA weak AoE blast increase from the forward cannons of the ship. \nA macro that would play a text and voice message saying something along the lines of: \u201cAll hands on deck!\u201d \u201cMan the cannons!\u201d or \u201cEnemy ship Ahoy!\u201d This message would usher people to the siege cannons located on the floor beneath the deck. \nA snare ability that when fired deals moderate damage (nothing spectacular) but if the boat is bigger than yours, it pulls your boat right to them and stuns their ship for a few seconds, if its size is more then it will slow down by x% and you will move x% faster until you catch up with them. This ability must be learned from a boat designer. And nothing happens except they cannot turn invisible or dive if the size is the same. \nTo summon your boat you must approach or be in a body of water your boat is capable of being in and use the summon boat item (similar to a mount). All boats can be summoned near shallow water except for the battle ships. \nAll boats (excluding the row boat) follow a similar control system. \nTo get on your boat you would have to move your mouse over the boat and right click when the action symbol appears. For passengers to board, the owner/captain of the boat must agree through a pop-up window. The captain will be able to kick anyone he pleases out of the boat at any time. For a passenger to exit the boat you can simply just jump off the edge or right click your portrait and select exit boat (by doing this you will be dropped into the water near the boat as if you jumped or sent to where there hearthstone is set). Passengers will be free to move around the deck of the boat as they please. \nWhen a passenger enters a boat you enter a crew very similar to the party and raid systems. You can be in a crew and in a party at the same time. \nWhen passengers enter the boat a miniature portrait of the player (about 1/5 size of normal) would appear on the top of your screen for everyone else on the boat. The portrait would enlarge and show the players name and info when you move the cursor over the portrait. By right clicking the characters portrait you will be given some options. The options would be: \nMates would be allowed to steer the boat when the captain is not. \nKicks the passenger off the boat and into the water, or makes them hearth. \nSteering the boat would be fairly simple. If the captain or mate goes up to the steering wheel and action clicks it. The action casters view would change from his/her character to the boat. Seeing how boats are large, your view will be noticeably zoomed out (you can zoom in if you like). \nDurability.\nYour ship has a set amount of durability, if it reaches 0 it sinks and you can\u2019t summon it until it is repaired. If you have a repair kit and you own the ship it self, it will repair itself in time, until it gets to 100% durability. \nEquipping your ship.\nWhen your ship is summoned select it then right click its portrait. One of the options would be: Equipment. Select equipment. This will bring up a screen similar to the character equip screen with a picture of your ship, armor, strength, etc. It would also have slots along the sides where the characters helmet, legs, chest, feet, slots, etc. would be. In these slots there would be a slot for cannons (sub slot for ammo), armor, sail, etc. \nCrew.\nCrews are like a second guild. They have a name, do instances, and have many players, ECT. Usually the ranks would start out: Captain, then 1st Mate, then 2nd mate, then Mate, then Swashbuckler. You can also rename these ranks, exactly like a guild. The only difference between this and a guild is that in battle ships, you must be in the same crew as the owner of the ship to man the cannons, or use the steering wheel. If you are not in the crew however, it does not take up a spot in the max holding capacity. In transport ships it still does though because if you go to player vs. player, you will have your boat sunken nearly instantly. When your ship is summoned select it then right click its portrait. One of the options would be: Crew. Select crew. This will bring up a screen similar to the guild data screen with the same data showing. Also there is another tab on that that shows the people on your ship that is in your crew, exactly like a raid group screen but it is double the width because some ships can hold 80 people from that crew, not 40. \nRepair stations - Allows you to use various buyable resources to patch up your ship, yourself (possible secondary profession) and if supplies permit your crew may repair it too. \nPvP on the great sea is very similar to PvP on land. On a PvP server you and your ship and all of the crew will be automatically flagged by entering the great sea. On a PvE server you will have a choice to flag your ship. When you and your ship engage in PvP combat with an enemy factions ship, it wouldn\u2019t be wise at all to try and take on the ship with your equipped combat weapons (unless it is a transport boat or a submarine). Ships would have the armor of raid bosses, (such as Ragnaros) making your weapons almost worthless against them. Instead it would be advised to use cannons. \nNew merchants would appear in most major cities that would vendor boats supplies necessary for ocean exploration. Nautical needs in Booty bay for example, (its an empty shop right now) and they would be seen in other towns and cities on islands around in the seas. \nThere could also be boat designer NPCs that you could pay to upgrade your ship/boat (similar to class trainers). Example: Cannon Blast rank 2, (upgrades forward cannon area of effect radius and damage) Dark iron cannons, (cannon durability) etc. \nAs I have explained before to use a cannon action-click it. As soon as you have done this you would view a first person view from your cannon, making a limited firing area and adding more challenge. From here you would click where you want the cannon ball to strike. The cannon balls do a fair amount of AoE damage, but it does take a 2 seconds for it to shoot the cannon, then another few seconds depending on how far away the target is, giving the target time to evade the attack. \nBy destroying an enemy\u2019s ship you and your crew would be rewarded with a ton of honor, making your efforts worth it in the end. When a ship is destroyed everyone on board is stuck on the ship while it sinks, you may try to swim out of harm, but most likely you would die of fatigue unless you have the escape ships upgrade. \nBy leaving your crew while in PvP you would receive an honor penalty, and you would die of fatigue eventually. \nBloodsail Buccaneers.\nThe Bloodsail Buccaneers often patrol the seas, they are highly aggressive and will often try to board a ship. They are found in the sea from Kalimdor to the Eastern Kingdoms. \nThe vessels of the Theramore Marines and Steamwheedle Cartel Battle Ships will attack Bloodsail Pirate vessels. \nTheramore Marines.\nThe Theramore Marines patrol the waters as well. They will automatically attack any Pirate vessel, however to players they are neutral and will only attack IF attacked first. They are located only near Kalimdor in First and second level seas.\nNorthwatch Hold.\nThe Marines here attack pirate and Horde vessels. They are loacted in the barrens often attacking Racthet.\nSteamwheedle Cartel.\nThe Steamwheedle, not wanting to be left out is in this as well. Boats from Ratchet, Gadzten, Booty Bay etc. All are in the Seas, their aggressiveness level depends on the captain, if, for example the captain is at War with Ratchet, the Steamwheedle Boats will attack him, if the Captain is neutral, they will not do anything to you, if you are friendly they will assist you. Steamwheel boats are found in all levels of water near both the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor. The Steamwheedle Port boat goes to Undermine.\nAlliance.\nthe Night Elves, Humans, Dwarves and Gnomes all are in the waters of World of Warcraft. The Night Elves patrol in Northern Kalimdor, the Dwarf and Gnome ships all patrol near Khaz Modan and the Humans can be seen between the seas near Elwwyn to Duskwood. The Draenei have boats in Western Kalimdor, and the Pandaren in the Great Sea. Alliance boats assist Alliance Player-controlled boats and assault Horde player-controlled boats. \nHorde.\nthe Orcs, Trolls, Undead and Tauren are in the seas as well. The Tauren, Orcs and Trolls patrol the waters of Central and some of Southern Kalimdor. The Blood Elves have boats patrolling around Quel\u2019Thalas, the Naga in the Great Sea. The Forsaken boats patrol Lordaron with some other Orc boats and like the Alliance they will assist boats controlled by their own Faction, and assault boats of the Alliance."}

It seemed like the perfect place, as all beings, whether they were beasts, sentient beings, or elementals, lived there in natural harmony. The pandaren, lovers of nature and peace, only hunted and fought when needed. They prospered, with the help their kobold allies, who lived in the mountain region of Pandaria.\nThe reason for no race ever finding Pandaria was a magical shrine that gave off an aura of safety and passiveness. Any being sentient to come near the island would dismiss it as too primitive or small to deal with, and would sail off. So even though they were close to Theramore, the pandarens did not fear being attacked by vicious races and beings. Although the pandarens know not of who or what created the shrine, they respected it greatly, naming it Safekeeper of Pandaria.\nStill, several pandaren decided to venture out and explore the world, after taken solemn vows to never reveal where Pandaria was. Upon visiting the Alliance and Horde territories, the pandaren were as fascinated with these new races as the two factions were fascinated with them. The pandarens liked most of the races, but were extremely fond of the Night elves. The Kaldorei and the bear beings loved to share stories and had similar mindset, living in balance with nature. They also found friend in Ironforge dwarves, and love to have mug of ale with them. Still, the pandarens were careful as to not say where Pandaria was, nor get drawn into joining the political Alliance.\nSuddenly, tragedy struck the pandaren. Blood elves, sensing the power of the Safekeeper of Pandaria, managed to locate the island by their incurable lust for magic and the arcane. Sneaking onto Pandaria, they approached the shrine and siphoned the magic from it until the shrine turned black as coal.\nSeveral of the pandaren witnessed this, unable to do anything before their beloved shrine was depleted of magic. What they experienced next was the sky turning red, and infernals raining down from the sky. The Burning Legion was attacking Pandaria.\nMany pandarens died that day, a day the pandarens now call \u2018The Shattering of Peace.\u2019 The Burning Legion swarmed across Pandaria like a plague, corrupting the wildlife, the animals, kobolds of the mountains, and even pandaren. Still the pandarens fought back with the strength and agility they were known for, and prevented the loss of Pandaria in total. A good deal of pandarens survived, several parts of the land remained uncorrupted, and a tribe of the mountain kobolds (who had helped the pandarens) were safe.\nThe Shattering of Peace is named not only because of the Burning Legion, but because of how they joined the war between the Alliance and the Horde. When the demonic armies fell from the skies, several of the traveling brewmasters implored the races of the outer world to help them. The Ironforge Dwarves came, and many fought in the name of friendship. The humans, night elves, and gnomes also came, because the friend of their friend was a friend, and the Burning Legion was their mortal enemy.\nBut when asking the Horde, they seemed unsympathetic. Thrall and Cairne, the main leaders of the Horde, did sent orc, troll and tauren troops to help Pandaria. But the Forsaken and the blood elf leaders of Silvermoon, refused to send any help, and even implored the other Horde leaders to not waste troops on such \"meaningless\" creatures.\nShocked and hurt by this, the pandaren informed Silvermoon that blood elves had destroyed the Safekeeper. The blood elves denied it, saying that they could not be found guilty for the actions of few. Although the pandarens did not make any demands for the magic-starved elves to help them, they were upset by the cold, uncaring answer they received.\nWhen Pandaria was stable again, the pandaren realized that the Burning Legion would probably come back, even though they did not know why they came in the first place. Did the blood elves summon them, unintentionally or purposefully? Were those blood elves from Silvermoon or from the Dark Portal? And why did the Burning Legion come with such a force after the Safekeeper was ruined?\nThe pandarens realized they couldn\u2019t do this alone, and now the other races knew where Pandaria was. So they knew a treaty with either faction was in order. They knew right then that the Horde was out of the question, so they went to the Alliance for help. Tyrande, leader of the Night elves, welcomed the pandaren and the other leaders agreed to allow Pandaria\u2019s beings into the Alliance.\nBut the treaty was a shaky one at best. Pandarens were used to non-political, peaceful manners of life, while the Alliance was full of the opposite. Cultures clashed, and the pandarens found themselves surrounded by beings who seemed to love to squabble amongst one another, to create weapons of death, and to fight against the Horde with fiery passion. Although the pandarens agreed to help the Alliance in the war, they did not enjoy such battles; they would keep an eye out on these beings, even their friends of Ironforge.\nIt wasn\u2019t like the Alliance was too friendly towards the pandarens either. The humans believed the pandarens to be drunken bears, and remembered how one of their brewmasters, a hero of Pandaria, helped defeat Admiral Proudmoore. The gnomes sympathized for the pandaren in almost losing their home, but the halfling race could not understand why the ursine race disliked using engineered weapons. The majority of night elves and dwarves were passive towards the pandarens, even though several pandarens joined the Silver Hand and the Cenarion Circle. The races basically wanted the pandarens to prove themselves as capable warriors and allies, not drunken bears.\nAs one of the survivors of the Burning Legion and a proud representative of Pandaria, the world of Azeroth and mysteries within Outland are yours to explore. Discover the cause for the attack on Pandaria, and bring justice and peace to the beings of the world.\nClasses.\nThe pandaren live their lives training to perfect a certain art, these arts are the most important part of their lives. They have slightly different ways of going about the practices of them.\nWarrior \u2013 Though the pandaren prefer a life of peace, the dangers of the world around them and their new involvement with the Alliance the brave pikemen and Wardancers of the pandaren are called out to defend their new allies. The warriors of the pandaren are the only ones to regret any chance to use their art. Preferring to react to violence instead of acting upon others, the pandaren warriors use their strength and agility to fight all enemies of Pandaria and their new allies. Warrior pandarens start with a one-handed sword and shield, and have training in one-handed maces, daggers, and staves.\nPaladin - When they met the paladins of the Silver Hand, the pandarens were excited to meet those that preferred to be defensive and help others as well. Also, they felt that they had found a kindred spirit in the paladins. Adapting the code of the paladin to their own culture they now practice a medium of balance, though they are slowly adapting to the full code of the paladin. So, learning of the Light and having faith in its justice, now there are now some pandaren paladins. Paladin pandarens start with a two-handed mace, and have training in one-handed maces, shields, and one-handed swords.\nHunter \u2013 Having always had a strong affinity with nature being a hunter has always come natural for the pandaren. They quickly befriend the natural life of Pandaria. Even when Pandaria were peaceful, there were many who patrolled the island to bring home food, and those that explored Kalimdor. Now they use their talents to track down and fire upon their enemies. Hunter Pandarens start with a one-handed sword and a bow, and have training in daggers.\nDruid - With an incredible love for nature and saving life, pandarens easily adapted to the druidic magics. The Cenarion Circle was happy to accept the pandarens, especially since the pandarens did not care for waging war upon the Horde as much. Druid pandarens start with a staff.\nMage \u2013 Although the pandaren have been depicted as leaving the Night Elves due to their use of magic it was their abuse of it that caused this. Contrary to common belief the pandaren continue to practice magic, and even have a strong resistance to the addiction it causes using it only for safe and practical manners. After all, life needs the heat of fire, the coolness of frost, and the force of the arcane. So pandarens can be strong magi. Mage pandarens start with a staff, and have training in daggers and wands.\nPriest - Most pandarens priests do not believe in gods or a strong presence (although some have adapted to the Light, Elune or the spirits), but all believe that saving others and helping oneself are two needed skills in life. Pandaren priests call upon their inner power for their healing magic though they stubbornly refuse to use it for offensive purposes. Priest pandarens start off with a one-handed mace, and have training in daggers, wands and staves. Pandarens priests get two new priest abilities as well. At level 10, pandaren priests get Swig of Faith, which is like Renew but regains mana and gives the target a Spirit lowering debuff for a little bit of time. At level 20, pandaren priests get Violence Retribution, a magic debuff placed on enemy targets that deals small holy damage to the enemy if it attacks physically or casts a spell.\nMale Pandaren Personalities.\nCharacter Creation Tips - Fur Color (different combos of white and black), Face (different facial looks), Hip Flasks (different kinds of small kegs, canteens and/or doodads on the pandaren\u2019s hips), Facial Features (hair-styled fur and/or battle scars on cheeks or ear), and Claws (length and color of claws, some are chipped).\n\"Ale is my bear necessity.\"\n\"It\u2019s against the law to kill me!\"\n\"Am I black with white fur or white with black fur?

When the Well of Eternity imploded at the conclusion of the War of the Ancients, sundering the world, the Highborne inhabitants of Zin-Azshari were trapped in the blast. At the last second, Azshara struck a deal with the Old Gods for her survival. Azshara and her followers were dragged down beneath the raging sea... but they did not die. Twisted by the Old Gods, invigorated by the Well's energies, they took on new shapes, new powers and became the hateful, serpentine Naga. \nNaga only marginally resemble the noble race they once were. Their proud Kaldorei visages are warped and twisted. The naga are part night elf, part serpent, and some have evolved bizarre oceanic mutations. In this way, the race has developed an array of genetic variations and defenses, such as ink jets, tentacles, razor fins, venomous fangs, hardened barnacle carapaces and spined fists. The Sea Witches even sport venomous serpents instead of hair. \nNaga served their dark empress Azshara without question. Naga society is matriarchal, and the sexes have diverged radically, both mentally and physically, in the millennia of their estrangement. Women are dominant and often train as spellcasters, while men form the brute labor force and serve their women as physical warriors. \nWhen the Naga awakened, they set about building a new life for themselves on the ocean depths, within the abyssal sea trench beneath the swirling waters of the Maelstrom they built their new city, Nazjatar. \nThere in the depths of the ocean for ten thousand years the Naga plotted their revenge against the Night Elves. Most Naga are still content to wait. However, a small group led by the Naga Sea Witch, Lady Vashj, answered a summons from Illidan Stormrage to aid him in his quest to destroy the Frozen Throne. They made new allies in the form of their Highborne kin the Blood Elves as well as enemies of the Night Elves and the Alliance. They aided Illidan in the recovery of the Eye of Sargeras, and fought alongside the Blood Elves to take Outland as well as at the Icecrown Glacier against the Scourge. After suffering defeat at the hands of Arthas this group retreated back to Outland with Illidan. \nRecently, Queen Azshara broke oath with Old Gods that she made to save her people. Neptulon the tidehunter noticed this, and in his anger, he rose Nazjatar from seafloor and this isle became known as Maw of Abyss because it is in \"maw\" of maelstrom. Queen Azhara realized that sh needed allies quick, so she started to track surface dwelling highbornes. Shes search led her to Silvermoon, where she made offering of peace to blood elves. Blood elves ofcourse accepted this when they knew that alliance had new allies.\nAs one of these ancient beings, you must scour the world and seas of Azeroth, bringing power and glory to the Naga.\nNaga Male Personalities.\nCharacter Creation Tips - Scale color (different color combos.

This was caused by the implosion of the destabilized &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, which destroyed eighty percent of Kalimdor's landmass, sending it down to the bottom of the oceans.\nA seething, massive whirlpool known as the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; now remains where the Well of Eternity once stood. Left behind were the major continents known today as &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and the remnant still referred to as &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Other islands such as &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; survived too.\nConsequences.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s last assault against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the druid drew upon the power of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to disrupt the Highborne's carefully crafted spellwork and shatter the connection between the Legion and Azeroth. The unstable vortex within the Well's depths exploded and ignited a catastrophic chain of events that would sunder the world forever. The massive explosion rocked the temple to its foundations and sent massive quakes ripping through the tortured earth. As the horrific battle between the Legion and the night elves' allies raged around and above the ruined capital city, the surging Well of Eternity buckled in upon itself and collapsed.\nAs the aftershocks from the Well's implosion rattled the bones of the world, the seas rushed in to fill the gaping wound left in the earth. Nearly eighty percent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor's landmass&lt;/a&gt; had been blasted apart, leaving only a handful of separate continents surrounding the new, raging sea. At the center of the new sea, where the Well of Eternity once stood, was a tumultuous storm of tidal fury and chaotic energies. This terrible scar, known as the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, would never cease its furious spinning. It would remain a constant reminder of the terrible catastrophe.\nSomehow, against all odds, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; elite managed to survive the ordeal. Tortured and twisted by the powers they had released, Azshara and her followers were dragged down beneath the raging sea by the Well's implosion. Cursed \u2014 transformed \u2014 they took on new shapes and became the hateful serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara herself expanded with hate and rage, becoming a massive monstrosity, reflecting the wickedness and malice that had always hidden within her core.\nThere, at the bottom of the Maelstrom, the naga built for themselves a new city, &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, from which they would rebuild their power. It would take over ten thousand years before the naga would reveal their existence to the surface world.\nIn the RPG.\nA non-canonical name for the event is the Cataclysm.\nInspiration.\nThe concept of a sundering, or a world being reshaped, is a common theme found in fantasy. Tolkien described a reshaping of Arda, and lands lost to the seas in his writings, and the Dragonlance Dungeons and Dragons gameworld underwent the Cataclysm, where seas receded to the point that a coastal port town became landlocked. In Warhammer, the Gates of Old Ones once shattered and Chaos swept the world, damaging the land, primary on north and south poles. In David Eddings' Belgariad, the dark God Kal Torak attempted to use a magic orb that had been used to shape the world in anger and split the world in two and mutilated himself, an event similar to the Sundering."}

Five of these became the Great Trees which channeled the power of the Emerald Dream into the world, strengthening the nearby wildlife, and scouring the saronite deposits. The greatest of the branches was then planted over the largest growth of saronite in the Grizzly Hills over a which grew with astonishing speed a new World Tree &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Crown of the Snow\". &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; became furious upon learning that these branches had been planted without their approval. They did, however, agree that the plan seemed to have worked. For several decades, Andrassil towered over &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and all seemed well. Yet in time, circumstances changed. Bloody battles erupted between the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"forest%20nymph\"&gt;forest nymph&lt;/a&gt;s of Northrend, two races not known for their warring ways. The fighting was sudden and shockingly vicious, filled with barbarism and unspeakably vile acts. Word slowly reached the druids, and the Cenarion Circle launched an expedition to investigate the source of the violence.\nWhat the druids found chilled them to their marrow. Andrassil's roots had reached so deep into the earth that they had touched &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s subterranean prison. The Old God had infused the tree with its foul energies, and thus all living creatures in the area were slowly being driven to madness. The Cenarion Circle knew that, without the blessing of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, Andrassil was vulnerable to corruption. They were also aware that there was no way to spare the World Tree or ease its suffering. The Cenarion Circle decided that the only recourse was to destroy Andrassil. It was renamed Vordrassil, or \"Broken Crown.\"\nAlthough killing Andrassil had been a heartbreaking task, the Cenarion Circle was pleased it had stopped the growth of saronite. Yet unbeknownst to the druids, something dark had taken root in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Yogg-Saron had used the trees planted by Fandral as a doorway into the Dream - a doorway through which the other &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; could grasp the ethereal domain and well. Small seeds of corruption were spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s realm. In time, these seeds polluted the dreamways. This marked the beginning of what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; took up the responsibility of guarding all of the Great Trees around Azeroth. However, in recent years, Ysera's most trusted lieutenants\u2014&lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taerar\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were corrupted by the Emerald Nightmare and passed through the Great Trees into the waking world to spread madness and terror.\nPossible other great trees.\nWorgen sites can have a tree-structure that has night elf stonework embedded in it.\nThe large tree &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt; may be a type of Great Tree. It corresponds to &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; in the Emerald Dream, which serves as a prison for the Druids of the Scythe.

This has changed, for great halls are now rare and the modern Horde seems to favor large towers or &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; as hub for their &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s. The great halls were known to be upgradable into &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt;es.\nFirst War.\nThis is where the denizens of an encampment came to meet and make their arguments heard. The constant bickering and backstabbing that occurred here was necessary, however, for it kept them from killing each other in the street. The town hall was also where the encampment's Overseer could keep a close eye on the resources and funds that were available, and use them as he saw fit. All shipments of &lt;a href=\"Lumber\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; were brought here for his inspection. This is also where &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;peons&lt;/a&gt; were given the training to do the simple tasks demanded of them by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;orcish empire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; had ordered that only one town hall be allowed to stand in each encampment, so that separate factions of orcs would not arise. If the town hall was destroyed in battle, another could be built to replace it.\nWhile they are not named similarly, the orcish town halls of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; already looked similar in shape to the great halls of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. For more information, refer to the &lt;a href=\"Town%20hall%23Orc%20town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; article.\nSecond War.\nThis structure served many purposes, such as being the gathering place and command center, for most &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish settlements. Unfit for battle, the lowly &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;peons&lt;/a&gt; were trained here to perform the menial tasks of construction, repair and harvesting. This was also where vital raw materials were gathered to be processed and then distributed. The great hall was always a source of fevered activity as the laboring peons worked to please their overseers. When settlements achieved greater prosperity and required stronger defenses, the great hall could be reinforced to become a &lt;a href=\"Stronghold%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nThe great hall is the core stronghold of any &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;orc clan&lt;/a&gt;. Using this structure, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s process &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; from mining operations are processed. Raw materials pilfered from enemy camps are added to the war chest. In time, the great hall can also be more heavily fortified.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiny%20Great%20Hall\"&gt;Tiny Great Hall&lt;/a&gt;s were also usable during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAs said above, great halls are now rare and the modern Horde seems to favor large towers or &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; as hub for their &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s. Still, some great halls still exist, such as in &lt;a href=\"Boulder%20Lode%20Mine\"&gt;Boulder Lode Mine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27sorrow%20Fortress\"&gt;Kil'sorrow Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Garrosh's Landing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorshak%20War%20Camp\"&gt;Gorshak War Camp&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "273175", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=273175", "title": "Greater Healing Wave", "text": "Greater Healing Wave, usually abbreviated GHW, is a &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; healing spell, which has a long casting time but restores a very large number of hit points. It is less &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; efficient than &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wave%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Healing Wave (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, but heals for much more with each cast, making it useful in situations where you need a lot of healing fast. Prior to &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the spell was simply called \"Healing Wave\".\nNotes.\nTogether with Healing Wave, Greater Healing Wave is one of the two main single target healing spells in a shaman's arsenal. It is used in situations where Healing Wave alone is not enough to keep a target alive. Greater Healing Wave is too expensive to be chain-cast for longer durations, and should ideally only be used during periods of higher damage or to bring a target's health up quickly. When used together with &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20Waves\"&gt;Tidal Waves&lt;/a&gt;, the spell can be used to quickly heal an injured target, but the long base casting time means it can be too slow to save someone when Tidal Waves is not active. In these cases, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Surge\"&gt;Healing Surge&lt;/a&gt; may be preferable.\nAt higher gear levels, the mana restoring potential of &lt;a href=\"Telluric%20Currents\"&gt;Telluric Currents&lt;/a&gt; means that Greater Healing Wave can be used as a shaman's main healing spell, although it still cannot be chain-cast for extended periods. Instead, Greater Healing Wave is used to keep a target stable, with &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;s used in between heals to keep mana high. Not using Healing Wave ensures a high Tidal Waves uptime, meaning that most or all Greater Healing Waves cast will benefit from it, freeing up more time for Lightning Bolts to regenerate mana. Because Telluric Currents is based on your &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt;, this healing strategy is mainly used in endgame &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; healing, especially on &lt;a href=\"heroic\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; difficulty."}

Although originally without an associated achievement, having obtained it will now provide the &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt; .\nSource.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; 2009 and 2010, the Green Brewfest Stein was and is a quest reward from: \nSince the stein is &lt;a href=\"unique\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt;, if you saved the 2009 stein, you will not be offered the quest in the 2010 Brewfest. This is true even if the stein is in your bank. Prior years gave , and these do not affect availability of the 2010 stein.\nUse.\n&lt;a href=\"Equip\"&gt;Equip&lt;/a&gt;ping an empty Green Brewfest Stein, then using a &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Festive%20Keg\"&gt;Brewfest Festive Keg&lt;/a&gt; will convert the stein into a Filled Green Brewfest Stein, containing a one charge sample of the beer from the barrel. The filled stein can then be used, drinking from it, which converts the stein back to an empty Green Brewfest Stein. The imbiber get the effects of the particular beer that was sampled. The full or empty stein must be equipped to be used. \nVarieties.\nEach of the three Brewfest Festive Kegs contains a different sample brew, so, depending on what barrel the owner fills their stein at, their &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Stein\"&gt;Brewfest Stein&lt;/a&gt; will have a different sample of brew. Each full stein with a different brew is a different item, as is the empty mug. There are two icons, one for the empty stein and one for the full steins. \nEach Brewfest Festive Keg is near to one of the brew vendor tents. Each brewer vends three different strengths of brew, but the breweries specialize in a low, medium, or high strength range of brews. Stronger brews are higher level, restore more &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, have stronger &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, and have a higher character level requirement to use. Each of three brews available from the Festive Kegs are the same as one of the three brews being vended by the brewer nearest that keg. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; brews are different brews but have equivalent effects. The Barleybrew dwarves' and Drohn's orcs' brews are the weak, low level range. The sample nearest them is the level one sample, the weakest at the Brewfest, and can be sampled by all attendees. Thunderbrew dwarves and T'chali's trolls have mid-range brews. The Gordok Ogres are shared by both factions, and have the strongest, highest level brews.\nNote: The Festive Kegs are neutral and inanimate. You should be able to use the opposing faction's Festive Kegs, if you can get to them. \nYou can fill your mug with any of the three brews. The only way to empty your mug is to drink it (use it). Drinking from your stein and refilling at a different Brewfest Festive Keg switches between brews. \nAnyone can fill their stein from any of the kegs. Since each beer has a minimum level associated with it, but the stein does not, you can drink a brew from your mug that has a higher level requirement than you are, but you will not get the buff. Instead you get a brief \"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Hold%20Your%20Brew\"&gt;Can't Hold Your Brew&lt;/a&gt;\" debuff with a 'getting sick' graphic and a message warning you not to drink the big kids' drink. \nNote that the Alliance/Horde brews may be available in neutral cities as well.\nQuotes.\nThis is the flavor text for each brew. Note that the quotes for the 2009 Stein are the same as the quotes for the 2008 Stein. \nNotes.\nDark Iron Dwarf invasion.\nYou fill at the same Brewfest Festive Kegs that the Dark Iron Dwarves attack when they invade. If the Dark Iron Dwarves succeed in destroying a Brewfest Festive Keg, you will be unable to fill your mug from that keg until it respawns.

Despite the trolls\u2019 misogynistic society, they revere the green witch as a powerful voodoo priestess. Legend tells of the green witch\u2019s astonishing control over plants and trees, and her reclusive nature that led her to live as a hermit in a swamp. Witch doctors who desired powerful herbs or rare potion brewing techniques sought out the green witch to beg for her aid. The green witch, whimsical and mercurial, aided those she found worthy and destroyed those who annoyed her.\nNo one knows the fate of the green witch. Trolls speculate that her desire for solitude grew so great that the green witch sank into the swamp to live with the plants she understood so well. On rare occasion a troll might come across a living hut in the wilderness,a sacred location termed a green witch hut. By showing appropriate respect, a troll may summon the green witch and ask for her aid."}

{"id": "22624", "revid": "40350614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22624", "title": "Green dragon", "text": "Green dragons are a race of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s whose scales are green in color. During the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; charged &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and her flight with the protection of the natural world and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, a pristine realm of nature and magic. Thus, green dragons have an affinity for animals and nature. Like &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, green dragons are generally more approachable than those of other flights, primarily coming into conflict only with those who attempt to corrupt or destroy nature. They occasionally sought the help of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to aid in this task; having worked many times with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nTragically, the green dragons are susceptible to corruption of nature due to their close ties to it; making them a primary target of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; used his dark magic to spread the corruption of the Emerald Nightmare throughout the Dream, causing many green dragons, including Ysera's &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;lieutenants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;consort&lt;/a&gt;, to become rampaging agents of destruction known as &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20dragon\"&gt;Nightmare dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. The corruption was stemmed after the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;war Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;; though they did eventually return during the events of . Here, Xavius returned once more, empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, and began corrupting the Emerald Dream once again. Many emerald dragons succumbed to &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s influence. Eventually, even Ysera herself was corrupted and needed to be slain, leaving the green dragons leaderless for a time. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;:Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; needed the coalesced essences of the &lt;a href=\"dragonflights\"&gt;dragonflights&lt;/a&gt; to save the planet from N'Zoth, &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra of the Dream&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward to lead the flight, and to defend Azeroth in her mother's place.\nTheir breath weapons can consist of a variety of nature-based attacks, including corrosive acid, noxious gas, and emerald-colored fire.\nLife cycle and appearance.\nGreen dragons, as with all other dragons, go through various life stages before they are fully grown. These stages are divided into &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Whelps are the children of their kind, while drakes are adolescents and young adults. The oldest of their kind become dragons, though they appear to still grow in some capacity as far older dragons are usually larger than their younger kindred. Traditional dragons look largely the same, akin to an immense lizard with four legs and wings sprouting along their spine. In their youthful stages, whelps seem to exclusively travel by way of flight, with older dragons flying or walking depending on their whims.\nSome green dragons, as evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Tangled%20Dreamweaver\"&gt;Tangled Dreamweaver&lt;/a&gt;, grow foliage and overgrowth upon their bodies; a sign of their ties to the natural world.\nSeveral of these dragons also take unorthodox forms to those traditionally found; such as the &lt;a href=\"wylderdrake\"&gt;wylderdrake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"velocidrake\"&gt;velocidrake&lt;/a&gt;. As these are specified as drakes, it is unknown what their 'dragon' forms or whelp forms would look like; though they are presumably just smaller and larger variations of these appearances. With the advent of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s being discovered; &lt;a href=\"slitherdrake\"&gt;slitherdrake&lt;/a&gt;s have also been found baring green scales.\nHistory.\nCharge of the Dragonflights.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; departed Azeroth, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over it. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, yet five flights, one of which was the green, held dominion over their brethren and were chosen to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. After blessing the red leader, &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; also blessed &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s younger sister, the lithe green dragon Ysera, with a portion of nature's influence. Ysera fell into an eternal trance, bound to the waking Dream of Creation. Known as the Dreamer, she would watch over the growing wilds of the world from her verdant realm, the Emerald Dream.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently called the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to the world, the Aspect of the Earth, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the demons. Ysera, showing only the briefest moments of doubt, gave much of her own essence toward the creation of this object, called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The greens joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion retreated, leaving the blue dragonflight broken in his wake.\nWounded and shocked, Ysera and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion, but at great cost. Azeroth was sundered.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing\u2019s betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, and the greens were no exception. They would never again be seen in the same numbers as before. The age of dragons had passed.\nTo ensure Deathwing would never hold power over dragonkind again, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu placed an enchantment upon the Demon Soul, so that no dragon could wield it, and hid the foul disc deep beneath the earth. The trio later visited the Night Elven survivors to present the devastated race a gift. Alexstrasza had planted a colossal tree within the new &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; that would come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Both Ysera and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; placed their blessings upon it. Ysera bound the tree to her realm, the Emerald Dream, along with the night elven males, now the druids of their race. As part of the pact, the druids agreed to sleep for centuries at a time so that their spirits could roam the infinite paths of the Emerald Dream alongside the green flight. Though the druids were grieved at the prospect of losing so many years of their lives to hibernation, they selflessly agreed to uphold their bargain with Ysera.\nThe greens, with the druids' help, maintained their posts through the long millennia that followed. Green dragonflight broods were stationed at several of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s, defending the portals to the Emerald Dream, where they remain to this day.\nLoreth'Aran.\nOne particular brood of Ysera's was closely allied with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, who were ruled by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Toreth\"&gt;Prince Toreth&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera kindly allowed the night elves to ride her children into battle and they were known the Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran. Ysera's benevolence raised the ire of Deathwing and he launched an attack against &lt;a href=\"Wyrmscar%20Island\"&gt;Wyrmscar Island&lt;/a&gt; where the dragonriders slept. The blacks, including &lt;a href=\"Razormaw\"&gt;Razormaw&lt;/a&gt;, a lieutenant of Deathwing, mercilessly slaughtered the Kaldorei. The greens rose up to protect their allies but were unsuccessful. Not one was spared, though many blacks, including Razormaw, also perished in the battle. The skeletons and spirits of the murdered greens still litter the small island.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nA thousand years before modern times, the green dragons lent their aid to the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra of the Dream&lt;/a&gt;, child of Ysera, the greens fought the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters furiously and ultimately helped push them back to their city where they were sealed away from the world. The dragons suffered few casualties but the progeny of Ysera, Merithra, was believed lost, having charged deep into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; during the final push. After the war, a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted to the green wyrm &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; the bronze.\nUnbeknownst to her flight, Merithra, along with Caelestrasz and Arygos, was not dead, simply captured. The dark master of Ahn'Qiraj used the tortured dragons to power his new creations: &lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;Obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTemple of Atal'Hakkar.\nThe exiled priests of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, servants of the blood god &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, had fled into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and erected the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, where they could prepare for his arrival into the physical world. The great dragon Aspect, Ysera, learned of the Atal'ai's plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. For a thousand years, the temple has been known as the Sunken Temple. The great emerald wyrm &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, consort to Ysera, was dispatched to deal with the surviving &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; priests, along with his brother &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Itharius&lt;/a&gt;, and a brood of green dragonkin to prevent the trolls from any more evil doings. To this day, the temple's drowned ruins are occupied by the green dragons, who prevent anyone from getting in or out.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nIn the events leading up to the Second War, Deathwing led a powerful orc warlock named &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragon Soul \u2014 now renamed the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros used the Demon Soul to force the red Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, into submission and forced the rest of the red dragonflight to serve him or risk the death of their queen. Korialstrasz, who escaped by faking his death sought the assistance of the other Aspects to free his queen. While deeply concerned, Ysera did not immediately act to save her sister. Korialstrasz had pleaded for assistance but had been turned down countless times by Ysera's consorts. Eventually, Korialstrasz found a way to speak with the Lady of the Dream directly and Ysera agreed to do what she could in assisting to free the Red Aspect. Ysera spoke with &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and convinced them to act as well.\nWith the Aspects convinced, Korialstrasz waited until Nekros brought Alexstrasza and her eggs out of the fortress, just as Deathwing had desired. When Deathwing made his appearance, Ysera and the others arrived and proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;the Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Battle of Grim Batol and the restoration of their power, Ysera and her agents continued to uphold the pact made with the titans to safeguard Azeroth, taking a somewhat more active role in the world, though their duties in the Emerald Dream continued to take precedence.\nEmerald Nightmare.\nAt some unknown point, a new threat appeared within the Emerald Dream. This threat, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, is a region of corruption that travels and grows through the dreamscape, twisting and distorting the native flora and driving living creatures mad, including the green dragonkin. These victims became the mad slaves of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Ysera and her flight attempted to fight against this mysterious threat, alongside &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; while trying to avoid becoming its prey. Fortunately, the Nightmare did not, at least initially, approach the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ysera\"&gt;Eye of Ysera&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nightmare's influence continued to grow and even began seeping into Azeroth. Many members of the flight became inflicted, including a brood dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Temple\"&gt;Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt; led by the mighty green consort &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;four of Ysera's most powerful lieutenants&lt;/a&gt; also fell to the Nightmare's sway and periodically invaded Azeroth through the portals found at the Great Trees. Two of these crazed dragons, &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;, were put down by mortal heroes but their twisted spirits persisted in the Emerald Dream.\nWhen the scepter shard held by Eranikus was needed the denizens of Azeroth discovered they would have to bring the green wyrm to Azeroth and cleanse him of his corruption. Remulos lured Eranikus to Moonglade and after a short battle against the dragon and an army of nightmare shades &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived, and used the light of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse Ysera's consort and free him of the Old Gods' control.\nThe Nightmare.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat the situation with the Nightmare suddenly intensified. Beings of all races, dragon, and mortals alike, became the &lt;a href=\"Unwaking\"&gt;Unwaking&lt;/a&gt;, trapped in their own horrifying dreams. The green dragonflight inside the Emerald Dream was losing ground against the monstrosity and soon nearly the entirety of the dreamscape was consumed by nightmare. Not long after those who remained awake were forced to defend against their own slumbering comrades before being brought to the dream itself to fight in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nEranikus, who had been hiding away from his love and his people ever since his redemption, was stumbled upon in Ashenvale by none other than the high priestess Tyrande and her companions. Although reluctant to assist them, he did so, showing them the way into the Emerald Dream to free &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, held by the Nightmare Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being hindered by the twisted spirits of Lethon and Emeriss they manage to free the Archdruid, but only at the cost of Ysera becoming the Nightmare's newest prisoner. At the climax of the conflict, Eranikus sacrifices himself to save his queen while Malfurion and his allies defeat Xavius and manage to seal the Nightmare safely within the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the conflict's conclusion Ysera, along with her sister &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, presided over Malfurion and Tyrande's marriage ceremony. Immediately after the two Aspects blessed the new world tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; as they had done to Nordrassil ten thousand years before.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the green dragonflight and the others joined together in order to liberate the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; from the forces of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult.\nLegion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; began to succumb to the Emerald Nightmare, Malfurion, &lt;a href=\"Elothir\"&gt;Elothir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Koda%20Steelclaw\"&gt;Koda Steelclaw&lt;/a&gt; summoned Ysera to ask for her aid. Ysera believed that the only way to save the Forest Lord was with the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and sent an adventurer to a nearby temple of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve them.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; attacked the temple and stole the Tears of Elune before Malfurion could use them to save Cenarius from an affliction caused by the Nightmare. Without the Tears, Cenarius succumbed to corruption, and Malfurion pursued Xavius in his rage at the loss of his shan'do. Unfortunately, Xavius was not done taking from Malfurion: when Ysera and an adventurer located Xavius, he was able to corrupt the former Aspect herself, turning her into a dragon of Nightmare. Xavius and Ysera retreated with Malfurion held captive, followed by the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nA reunion with Tyrande was something Xavius had longed for many years. With Malfurion held captive, Xavius gave the High Priestess an ultimatum: she could pursue him and spend her husband's last moments at his side, or she could return to the Temple of Elune and protect it from Xavius's forces which would be led by Ysera. Mournful and distraught, Tyrande chose her goddess over her love, though the decision hurt her. At the temple, Ysera was put to rest, and with her last breath she stated that the nightmare had felt so real. As she fell, Tyrande gently told Ysera to sleep forever and dream no more.\nMore dragons fell to Xavius as well, and the four &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; returned as a boss encounter within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMembers of the Green dragonflight banded together to reforge a &lt;a href=\"Dreamglow%20Dragonscale\"&gt;Dreamglow Dragonscale&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Dream itself&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were re-revealed to Azeroth, the green dragonflight was in an unstable state. While Merithra was the flight's de facto leader after Ysera's death, she was not a proper aspect, and not all of the flight agreed that Merithra should lead them.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nA green dragon is the adult phase of a green &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s lifecycle, between &lt;a href=\"Green%20drake\"&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt; and becoming a &lt;a href=\"Green%20wyrm\"&gt;wyrm&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreen dragons are rare creatures, not often seen on the &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Plane\"&gt;Physical Plane&lt;/a&gt;. They are creatures of dream and make their home on the plane of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. This plane is not just a place of dream crafting, but an immense verdant realm of unspoiled paradise. Other flights often call greens \"brothers and sisters of Dream\" in respect to the realm from which they hail. The dragon has translucent, jewel-like scales that shine with a faint green light. Its eyes are glowing orbs of green-gold light, with no pupils or irises. Its sinuous and shining form flies through the air as if swimming through water.\nGreen dragons have no enemies in the Emerald Dream, but they know that the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is not as lucky or as peaceful. They are capable of fighting, but choose not to if there is any option other than their own death. If conflict is unavoidable, they try to neutralize foes with their breath weapon and leave the area. Some consider green dragons to be pacifists or weaklings. Those who have roused a green to combat fast learn the error of this opinion. After all, dreams and nightmares are not so very different.\nAge Cycle.\nGreen &lt;a href=\"whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt;s are precious to the green dragonflight, especially with the increasing danger of a mysterious, dark force that seems to have arisen in the Emerald Dream. Green whelps spent much of their time in the Emerald Dream in the past, but those children who have not yet experienced travel to the Dream have (fortunately) been kept from entering, and thus safe from contamination. Most green whelps in the world are found under the careful watch of an older dragon. The verdant hatchling is small, but nevertheless it exudes a spiritual aura, one that implies great wisdom even in such a young creature. Its wings look barely large enough to keep it aloft, yet it manages to be imposing in spite of its seeming frailty.\nGreen whelps usually retreat if engaged in combat. If doing so is impossible, they use their breath weapon or try to use magic to increase their chances of escaping.\nGreen whelps speak Common, Darnassian, and Draconic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; was, until recently, one of the few that still flourished. It was only recently that disaster struck: &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragons&lt;/a&gt;, clearly insane due to some sort of corruption, appeared on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;dark and corruptive force&lt;/a&gt; seems to have arisen in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. While the strongest of the green dragons seek the answer to this mystery, typical green drakes \u2014 the average adults of the flight \u2014 try their best simply to maintain order and keep themselves and their young alive and well. A look of sadness and pain is clear on the features of this majestic beast. It appears to be struggling with something inside itself, something threatening its very essence. The creature\u2019s once-brilliant scales have dimmed to a forest green.\nGreen dragons avoid combat, preferring to use incapacitating magic or their breath weapons to stop their foes. If pushed, however, they fight to the best of their abilities, using quick thinking and their magical prowess to outwit and outmaneuver their foes. Unlike most dragons, greens call upon the power of nature for their magic, and this gives them one major advantage: healing magic. If necessary, a green drake wears down her opponent, then flies away briefly to heal before reengaging. In battles with allies, such as other dragons, a few green drakes often stay back to heal their group and use beneficial spell-like abilities.\nGreen drakes speak &lt;a href=\"Common\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;. Some speak other languages as well.\nCulture.\nAs a result of Ysera's charge, the greens can simultaneously see the landscape of Azeroth, and the corresponding dreamscape. This enchanted vision, known as dreamsight, allows green dragons to perceive their surroundings with perfect clarity despite their closed eyes. When they venture to the physical world, they act as though it is the illusion and the realm from which they hail is the only source of reality, often only appearing as an illusion in half ethereal forms, or not physically at all.\nOther flights often call greens \"brothers and sisters of Dream\" in respect to the realm from which they hail. Many night elves form such a close bond with the green flight they become &lt;a href=\"dragonsworn\"&gt;dragonsworn&lt;/a&gt;, though dragonsworn of &lt;a href=\"Charys%20Yserian\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt; are suspected.\nHistory.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; the green dragons were numerous and co-existed peacefully with the other dragonflights, working together to safeguard their world. But this age would not last forever.\nThe Great Tree in &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; at some point had twelve green dragons guarding the portal there, nesting in the tree's branches and swooping down to intercept visitors.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, green dragons were stationed at &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where they, along with the reds, blues, and bronzes, guarded the World Tree from another attack by the remnants of the Burning Legion in &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. In addition green and red dragons were sent to &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Grove\"&gt;Sunwell Grove&lt;/a&gt; to investigate and safeguard the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the new threat of the Emerald Nightmare, the tranquility of the Emerald Dream, and thus Azeroth, is at stake as everything the nightmare touches become wild and corrupt, including the green dragons and dragonkin themselves."}

During the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; charged &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and her flight with the protection of the natural world and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, a pristine realm of nature and magic. Thus, green dragons have an affinity for animals and nature. Like the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, green dragons are generally more approachable than those of other flights, primarily coming into conflict only with those who attempt to corrupt or destroy nature. They occasionally sought the help of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to aid in this task, becoming very involved with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; organization.\nThe green dragonflight would often seek out negative influences on the natural world, such as the trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; and, most notably, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. This latter enemy, unfortunately, pervaded nearly every aspect of the flight's charge, corrupting vast amounts of their allies and membership; including their aspect, Ysera's, &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;lieutenants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;consort&lt;/a&gt; and finally Ysera herself during the conflict with the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. The corruption was stemmed after the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, but the flight was left leaderless.\nThe flight eventually rallied behind &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Ysera, though the process was arduous. The green dragonflight rallied to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;; where they returned to one of their ancestral homes in the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;. After confronting the &lt;a href=\"Primalist\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; threat, their former aspect, Ysera, was returned to them from &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;; albeit temporarily. Ysera specified that she was only there to aid the dragons, and that soon, the title of Aspect would be properly passed to Merithra.\nTheir breath weapons can consist of a variety of nature-based attacks, including corrosive acid, noxious gas, and emerald-colored fire.\nCulture.\n\"The enchanted, ethereal green dragons live only to serve the forces of nature and uphold the balance between mortal creatures and the ever-evolving world. The green dragonflight, ruled by the dreaming goddess, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, holds a special love for the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt;. Though most green dragons live within the mystical dimension known as the Emerald Dream, a few of the graceful creatures still roam the shadowy paths of Ashenvale forest.\"\nGreen dragons are creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, the ethereal dreamworld that all life is tied to. From there the green flight watches over nature, often assisted by the night elven druids. The dragons and druids work closely together within the dream where they can control the ebb and flow of nature and influence the evolutionary path it takes. Greens are, like the other flights, highly intelligent and always striving to learn more about the world they were entrusted to protect, fretting out the mysteries of creation and life - but keeping all such secrets hidden within the Emerald Dream. As a result, the greens are often the least interested about happenings in the mortal realm and must often have any major events brought to their attention by the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s of other flights. Ysera and her dragonflight consider the real world to be just an illusion.\nDragons of the green flight are highly reclusive, and the most difficult to find on the mortal realm. The green dragonflight is a peaceful, meditative society and most greens spend their time in quiet contemplation and the study of dreams, interacting with creatures of myth and illusion. A surprisingly swift flight, they often move quickly, teleporting through the dream to wherever their thoughts lead. Time is meaningless inside the Dream and as a result, the green dragonflight is extremely long-lived. Ysera's consorts in particular almost never emerge and are effectively immortal.\nGreen dragonkin are sometimes referred to as Emerald, Jade or Veridian. When taking humanoid form, most green dragons prefer to transform into &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, given their relationship with Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, though &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; guises are also common.\nGreen dragons cry a lot right before they die, and their teardrops crystallize into green gemstones.\nNomenclature.\nMembers of the green dragonflight occasionally have names ending in \"us\" for males, or \"ra\" for females. Sometimes terms relating to sleep and dreams find their way into their names as well.\nMembership.\nThe green dragonflight includes the green dragons themselves as well as all other green dragonkin such as dragonspawn and drakonid. Mortals have also been seen working as part of the green dragonflight, typically druids of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. In antiquity, the Green dragonflight was part of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Riders%20of%20Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf-draconic organization that was ultimately destroyed fighting the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCharge of the Dragonflights.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; departed Azeroth, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over it. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, yet five flights, one of which was the green, held dominion over their brethren and were chosen to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. After blessing the red leader, &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; also blessed &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s younger sister, the lithe green dragon Ysera, with a portion of nature's influence. Ysera fell into an eternal trance, bound to the waking Dream of Creation. Known as the Dreamer, she would watch over the growing wilds of the world from her verdant realm, the Emerald Dream.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently called the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to the world, the Aspect of the Earth, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the demons. Ysera, showing only the briefest moments of doubt, gave much of her own essence toward the creation of this object, called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The greens joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion retreated, leaving the blue dragonflight broken in his wake.\nWounded and shocked, Ysera and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion, but at great cost. Azeroth was sundered.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing\u2019s betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, and the greens were no exception. They would never again be seen in the same numbers as before. The age of dragons had passed.\nTo ensure Deathwing would never hold power over dragonkind again, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu placed an enchantment upon the Demon Soul, so that no dragon could wield it, and hid the foul disc deep beneath the earth. The trio later visited the Night Elven survivors to present the devastated race a gift. Alexstrasza had planted a colossal tree within the new &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; that would come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Both Ysera and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; placed their blessings upon it. Ysera bound the tree to her realm, the Emerald Dream, along with the night elven males, now the druids of their race. As part of the pact, the druids agreed to sleep for centuries at a time so that their spirits could roam the infinite paths of the Emerald Dream alongside the green flight. Though the druids were grieved at the prospect of losing so many years of their lives to hibernation, they selflessly agreed to uphold their bargain with Ysera.\nThe greens, with the druids' help, maintained their posts through the long millennia that followed. Green dragonflight broods were stationed at several of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s, defending the portals to the Emerald Dream, where they remain to this day.\nLoreth'Aran.\nOne particular brood of Ysera was closely allied with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, who were ruled by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Toreth\"&gt;Prince Toreth&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera kindly allowed the night elves to ride her children into battle and they were known as the Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran. Ysera's benevolence raised the ire of Deathwing and he launched an attack against &lt;a href=\"Wyrmscar%20Island\"&gt;Wyrmscar Island&lt;/a&gt; where the dragonriders slept. The black dragons, including &lt;a href=\"Razormaw\"&gt;Razormaw&lt;/a&gt;, a lieutenant of Deathwing, mercilessly slaughtered the Kaldorei. The green dragons rose up to protect their allies, but were unsuccessful. Not one was spared, though many black dragons, including Razormaw, also perished in the battle. The skeletons and spirits of the murdered green dragons still litter the small island.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nA thousand years before modern times, the green dragons lent their aid to the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra of the Dream&lt;/a&gt;, child of Ysera, the greens fought the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters furiously and ultimately helped push them back to their city where they were sealed away from the world. The dragons suffered few casualties but the progeny of Ysera, Merithra, was believed lost, having charged deep into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; during the final push. After the war, a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted to the green wyrm &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; the bronze.\nUnbeknownst to her flight, Merithra, along with Caelestrasz and Arygos, was not dead, simply captured. The dark master of Ahn'Qiraj used the tortured dragons to power his new creations: &lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;Obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTemple of Atal'Hakkar.\nThe exiled priests of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, servants of the blood god &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, had fled into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and erected the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, where they could prepare for his arrival into the physical world. The great dragon Aspect, Ysera, learned of the Atal'ai's plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. For a thousand years, the temple has been known as the Sunken Temple. The great emerald wyrm &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, consort to Ysera, was dispatched to deal with the surviving &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; priests, along with his brother &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Itharius&lt;/a&gt;, and a brood of green dragonkin to prevent the trolls from any more evil doings. To this day, the temple's drowned ruins are occupied by the green dragons, who prevent anyone from getting in or out.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nIn the events leading up to the Second War, Deathwing led a powerful orc warlock named &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragon Soul \u2014 now renamed the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros used the Demon Soul to force the red Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, into submission and forced the rest of the red dragonflight to serve him or risk the death of their queen. Korialstrasz, who escaped by faking his death sought the assistance of the other Aspects to free his queen. While deeply concerned, Ysera did not immediately act to save her sister. Korialstrasz had pleaded for assistance but had been turned down countless times by Ysera's consorts. Eventually, Korialstrasz found a way to speak with the Lady of the Dream directly and Ysera agreed to do what she could in assisting to free the Red Aspect. Ysera spoke with &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and convinced them to act as well.\nWith the Aspects convinced, Korialstrasz waited until Nekros brought Alexstrasza and her eggs out of the fortress, just as Deathwing had desired. When Deathwing made his appearance, Ysera and the others arrived and proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;the Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Battle of Grim Batol and the restoration of their power, Ysera and her agents continued to uphold the pact made with the titans to safeguard Azeroth, taking a somewhat more active role in the world, though their duties in the Emerald Dream continued to take precedence.\nEmerald Nightmare.\nAt some unknown point, a new threat appeared within the Emerald Dream. This threat, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, is a region of corruption that travels and grows through the dreamscape, twisting and distorting the native flora and driving living creatures mad, including the green dragonkin. These victims became the mad slaves of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Ysera and her flight attempted to fight against this mysterious threat, alongside &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; while trying to avoid becoming its prey. Fortunately, the Nightmare did not, at least initially, approach the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ysera\"&gt;Eye of Ysera&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nightmare's influence continued to grow and even began seeping into Azeroth. Many members of the flight became inflicted, including a brood dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Temple\"&gt;Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt; led by the mighty green consort &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;four of Ysera's most powerful lieutenants&lt;/a&gt; also fell to the Nightmare's sway and periodically invaded Azeroth through the portals found at the Great Trees. Two of these crazed dragons, &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;, were put down by mortal heroes but their twisted spirits persisted in the Emerald Dream.\nWhen the scepter shard held by Eranikus was needed the denizens of Azeroth discovered they would have to bring the green wyrm to Azeroth and cleanse him of his corruption. Remulos lured Eranikus to Moonglade and after a short battle against the dragon and an army of nightmare shades &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived, and used the light of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse Ysera's consort and free him of the Old Gods' control.\nThe Nightmare.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat the situation with the Nightmare suddenly intensified. Beings of all races, dragon, and mortals alike, became the &lt;a href=\"Unwaking\"&gt;Unwaking&lt;/a&gt;, trapped in their own horrifying dreams. The green dragonflight inside the Emerald Dream was losing ground against the monstrosity and soon nearly the entirety of the dreamscape was consumed by nightmare. Not long after those who remained awake were forced to defend against their own slumbering comrades before being brought to the dream itself to fight in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nEranikus, who had been hiding away from his love and his people ever since his redemption, was stumbled upon in Ashenvale by none other than the high priestess Tyrande and her companions. Although reluctant to assist them, he did so, showing them the way into the Emerald Dream to free &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, held by the Nightmare Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being hindered by the twisted spirits of Lethon and Emeriss they manage to free the Archdruid, but only at the cost of Ysera becoming the Nightmare's newest prisoner. At the climax of the conflict, Eranikus sacrifices himself to save his queen while Malfurion and his allies defeat Xavius and manage to seal the Nightmare safely within the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the conflict's conclusion Ysera, along with her sister &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, presided over Malfurion and Tyrande's marriage ceremony. Immediately after the two Aspects blessed the new world tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; as they had done to Nordrassil ten thousand years before.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the green dragonflight and the others joined together in order to liberate the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; from the forces of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult.\nLegion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; began to succumb to the Emerald Nightmare, Malfurion, &lt;a href=\"Elothir\"&gt;Elothir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Koda%20Steelclaw\"&gt;Koda Steelclaw&lt;/a&gt; summoned Ysera to ask for her aid. Ysera believed that the only way to save the Forest Lord was with the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and sent an adventurer to a nearby temple of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve them.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; attacked the temple and stole the Tears of Elune before Malfurion could use them to save Cenarius from an affliction caused by the Nightmare. Without the Tears, Cenarius succumbed to corruption, and Malfurion pursued Xavius in his rage at the loss of his shan'do. Unfortunately, Xavius was not done taking from Malfurion: when Ysera and an adventurer located Xavius, he was able to corrupt the former Aspect herself, turning her into a dragon of Nightmare. Xavius and Ysera retreated with Malfurion held captive, followed by the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nA reunion with Tyrande was something Xavius had longed for many years. With Malfurion held captive, Xavius gave the High Priestess an ultimatum: she could pursue him and spend her husband's last moments at his side, or she could return to the Temple of Elune and protect it from Xavius's forces which would be led by Ysera. Mournful and distraught, Tyrande chose her goddess over her love, though the decision hurt her. At the temple, Ysera was put to rest, and with her last breath she stated that the nightmare had felt so real.

While Merithra was the flight's de facto leader after Ysera's death, she was not a proper aspect, and not all of the flight agreed that Merithra should lead them."}

Most could be found in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; as members of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;, loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.

They made a greater appearance in the form of the corrupted forces of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Fel orcs made the bulk of the army of the former ruler of Outland, &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; overthrew him, he took control of his Fel Horde and imprisoned the pit lord, using his blood to produce more fel orcs. They are easily distinguishable from regular orcs by their red skin, glowing red eyes, longer tusks and the spiky growths all over their body. The &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; fel orcs are the result of orcs drinking the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and have similar features to the Outland ones, albeit with black and grey skin and glowing green eyes instead of red.\nHistory.\nWarcraft III.\nFel orcs made their first appearance in the form of orcish warriors that followed &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s initial excursions into &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;. After being nearly destroyed by the forces of the demigod, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; shaman alerted Grom of a nearby font of dark magic that could be useful to them in defeating Cenarius and his &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; forces. This font ended up being the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Well\"&gt;Chaos Well&lt;/a&gt;; a fountain of power that was tainted with the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their second consumption of Mannoroth's blood, the orcs were transformed into fel orcs, turning red skinned and larger. \nThis allowed for Grom and his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; to make quick work of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowleaves\"&gt;Shadowleaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonhunters\"&gt;Moonhunters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightblades\"&gt;Nightblades&lt;/a&gt; and Cenarius himself. With Cenarius' demise, Mannoroth revealed himself to the orcs and declared they were once again under his thrall. Despite initial resistance, Grommash and his warriors fell inline under the Legion's forces. This led to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; banding together with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of the guardian, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, to stop Grommash. Capturing Grommash and locking him within a ritual circle, the united forces of humanity and the orcs were able to purge the fel corruption from Grommash, returning him to his normal orcish self. This gave way for Grom and Thrall to confront Mannoroth, ultimately leading to the former's heroic sacrifice that freed the orcs from the blood curse.\nWhen the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; took control of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, he created fel orcs by corrupting them with his blood. Fel orcs made up the backbone of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Forces\"&gt;Magtheridon's armies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAfter Magtheridon was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned, the fel orcs stayed in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, keeping guard over the captured pit lord as servants of Illidan. Illidan has continued using the blood of Magtheridon to create more fel orcs to follow him under &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;. A letter recovered from one of the orcs has revealed that Illidan is not pleased with the orcs' progress with the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt;. They are capturing many orcs, and &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, then experimenting on them to create fel orcs.\n&lt;a href=\"Caza%27rez\"&gt;Caza'rez&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; is working on a cure for the fel orcs converted by the Illidari.\nCataclysm.\nRed skinned orcs appear as one of the random &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Portal-Sentry\"&gt;Horde Portal-Sentries&lt;/a&gt; that are guarding the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde along with the Alliance. The general goods vendor, &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Dekrok\"&gt;Quartermaster Dekrok&lt;/a&gt;, also has a red-skinned orc model. They may be horde aligned fel orcs, another color of &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, or this may be a simple skin error.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Lord%20Fel%27dan\"&gt;Shadow Lord Fel'dan&lt;/a&gt; appears as a fel orc and is said to be more demon than orc now.\nA group of &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; fel orcs, led by the former &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt;, traveled from Outland to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to enslave the Dragonmaws who had remained on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. However, Mor'ghor and his fel orcs were defeated by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; of the Dragonmaw.\nAlternate Draenor.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and his followers were described as fel orcs, but had green skin rather than red skin and mutations. &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Copeland\"&gt;Sean Copeland&lt;/a&gt; clarified that these orcs are fel-corrupted but not true \"fel orcs.\"\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; suffered devastating losses, Gul'dan took control of the faction by capturing &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Warchief Grommash&lt;/a&gt; and convincing , Warlord of the , to drink the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; (who had much earlier been slain by Grommash) and transform into a fel orc. Thousands of Iron Horde orcs then accepted the blood of Mannoroth, transforming them into fel orcs as well, but none grew as powerful as three champions: &lt;a href=\"Dia%20Darkwhisper\"&gt;Dia Darkwhisper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gurtogg%20Bloodboil%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Gurtogg Bloodboil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Jubei%27thos\"&gt;Blademaster Jubei'thos&lt;/a&gt;. Tainted with fel sickness, the three began serving Gul'dan as both Highguard and Council of War, becoming known as the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20High%20Council\"&gt;Hellfire High Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nFel orc forces can be found serving the Legion throughout &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 mainly at the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Front\"&gt;Iron Front&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Forge\"&gt;Fel Forge&lt;/a&gt; and atop the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and in the halls of . The &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Hand of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; forces stationed in the jungle argued that if their leader, &lt;a href=\"Velen%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, were there to guide them, he would not simply give up on the entire race, and while the draenei's &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; brothers are seemingly lost forever, the orcs of Azeroth did manage to break free from the Burning Legion. Thus, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes were sent out to gather vials of fel orc blood for draenei scholars to study in the hopes of finding a way to reverse the corruption process. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s believed there to be a way back for the fel orcs and also asked for blood samples from freshly turned orcs. However, not every member of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces in Tanaan had as bright of an outlook on the fel orcs' chance at redemption.\nLegion.\nWhile much fewer in number, some fel orc members of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; resembling the ones from alternate Draenor can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Malgath\"&gt;Lord Malgath&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Assault on Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther fel orcs from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; can also be seen imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance and characteristics.\nThe consumption of &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; blood results in a blood haze, uncontrollable bloodlust, and physical changes as well. Even those who were transformed unwillingly end up exhibiting these traits, and end up forced to obey the supplier of the blood. The &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; fel orcs are produced using an elixir. The procedure is extremely painful, and tends to drive subjects mad.\nThe standard &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; fel orc has red skin, and a ridge of long sharp spines coming out of its back. Bony horns grow from its arms and hands. Its eyes are bloodshot and glow red, and six long and thin fangs grow out of its mouth. Its ears are stubbier than orc ears, coming to a blunt point. These features signify a fel orc as much as its maddened lust for destruction. Fel orc blood is described as bubbling, as if full of rage. Most fel orcs have lived for years in Outland with the corruption, and this has led to greater mutations. These fel orcs are formidable foes, with even the weakest among their number being just as powerful as any normal green-skinned orc. They are also larger, meaner, and more cunning than the average orc.\nThe fel orcs of &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; instead feature gray skin with black, horn-like growths, glowing green eyes, and glowing green \"cracks\" on the skin and aforementioned growths. The reason for this difference in appearance is unknown, as himself, who had previously drunk the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, only gained green skin and red eyes, without the gray skin and mutations. According to &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Krethos\"&gt;Vindicator Krethos&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan's poison turned the already ferocious orcs into \"hateful, vicious creatures with no soul\" while &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Denjai\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Denjai&lt;/a&gt; describes the fel orcs as \"monsters\", \"fel beasts\" and \"soulless savages\". The blood of Draenic fel orcs remains warm to the touch long after the orc is killed.\nFel &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the alternate Draenor instead have red skin like their main universe counterparts.\nKnown clans in Outland.\nHere follows a list of known clans that, at least parts of which, have allied with the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;:\nUnits in Warcraft III.\nChaos/Fel orc units were featured in the campaigns\nIn the RPG.\nFel orcs, also known as chaos orcs, are the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, who \"blessed\" the orc race by infusing within them &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies and binding their will to the Burning Legion. While Grom's sacrifice freed most of his race, many orcs remain loyal to Mannoroth and worship the demons, gaining tremendous strength in exchange for their service. While not all demon-worshiping orcs are fel orcs, more than enough still partake of demon blood for the strength it grants them.\nSpeculation.\nA possible explanation for the difference between the alternate Draenor's and the fel orcs, who both drank &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood but gained vastly different appearances, may be the \"freshness\" of the blood; Mannoroth had been dead for some time before the fel orcs of alternate Draenor drank his blood, unlike Gul'dan."}

They are immensely powerful foes and are constantly emitting &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; green smoke.\nBackground.\nFel reavers cover ground with incredible speed, due to their long legs and an internal power core that is \"powered by a scalding core of fel fire\" that \"burns much hotter than normal fire\", and cannot be fueled by nether gas. They also seem to have a &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Fel%20Reaver\"&gt;Heart&lt;/a&gt; of some kind that 'beats'.\nIt is said that the cunning &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; pushed their &lt;a href=\"gan%27arg\"&gt;gan'arg&lt;/a&gt; workers for weeks in the construction of the first fel reaver, a massive construct that could easily raze fortified towers or tear the wings off an airborne &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"forge%20camp\"&gt;forge camp&lt;/a&gt;s then began to mass-produce these fel reavers to smash the mortal forces of Outland.\nCurrently not much else is known about the reavers' construction or origin beyond that. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; uses them as &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Reaver%20Sentry\"&gt;sentinels&lt;/a&gt; all around Hellfire Peninsula, including around their forges to the north ( and ) to oversee the work on their cannons. Much of what is known about fel reavers comes from observing the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Reaver%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Fel Reavers&lt;/a&gt; in Hellfire Peninsula, which patrol around the region, killing unprepared travelers that wander within range.\nTwo locations in Hellfire Peninsula are based around ruined fel reavers. &lt;a href=\"Reaver%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Reaver's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, in eastern &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, is the location of remains of a destroyed fel reaver, with a handful of trolls, orcs, and tauren cheering and dancing around the fel debris. At this area, players can execute bombing runs against the legion front. Another area, &lt;a href=\"Expedition%20Point\"&gt;Expedition Point&lt;/a&gt;, is near the gateways of the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;. It is also built around fel reaver parts that are being forever hacked away at to bring to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; in order to be melted down and remade as weapons to use against the Legion.\nThere are &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20Reaver\"&gt;inactive fel reavers&lt;/a&gt; parked at and in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Inactive%20Fel%20Reaver\"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; are also parked in and in Netherstorm. Also in Netherstorm, a &lt;a href=\"Scrapped%20Fel%20Reaver\"&gt;Scrapped Fel Reaver&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Heap\"&gt;Heap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Vomisa%2C%20Ph.T.\"&gt;Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T.&lt;/a&gt; built a &lt;a href=\"Scrap%20Reaver%20X6000\"&gt;Scrap Reaver X6000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Hold%20Fel%20Reaver\"&gt;Legion Hold Fel Reaver&lt;/a&gt;s can be found inactive and undergoing some sort of charging/construction process in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and players can control a &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Reaver%20Sentinel\"&gt;Fel Reaver Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; at nearby . Parts of fel reavers can be found in many &lt;a href=\"Forge%20Site\"&gt;Forge Site&lt;/a&gt;s around Outland, but few have actually been produced.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowsword%20Guardian\"&gt;Shadowsword Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, a type of fel reaver, can be fought in &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Reaver\"&gt;Iron Reaver&lt;/a&gt;, the plans for which was found in the workshop of &lt;a href=\"Siegecrafter%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Siegecrafter Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, was inspired by the fel reavers. The project was completed after his death to serve the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but was later retrofitted to use fel energy.\nIn the last moments of his life, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; destroyed a gigantic fel reaver, in order to release the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" from its grasp, knowing full well he would be trapped with the demons in front of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany fel reavers were the product of &lt;a href=\"Kin%27garoth\"&gt;Kin'garoth&lt;/a&gt;, the engineer of the apocalypse."}

When the felblood covers one's body, the individual may hear the whispers of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. It may also cause a short transformation into a demon.\nIn an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; when drank demon blood the blood transformed his visage into something hideous, bent and twisted by demonic energies.\nThe felblood used by on appears to create &lt;a href=\"Man%27ari%20Eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fel%20orcs\"&gt;fel orcs&lt;/a&gt; with different appearances, with cracked skin exposing fel energy for the Eredar and grey skin, massive apparently metallic deformities across the body and more extreme asymmetric claws and spines for the orcs. This could indicate another source for the felblood than in the Prime Timeline.\nFurther felblood corruption from Mannoroth created the &lt;a href=\"chaos%20orc\"&gt;chaos orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s with wilder appearances.\nWarlords of Draenor.\n used felblood to mutate &lt;a href=\"Razuun\"&gt;Razuun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giselda%20the%20Beautiful\"&gt;Giselda&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"shivarra\"&gt;shivarra&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Even after Mannoroth's death his demonic blood was used to transform orcs into fel orcs, &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Man%27ari%20Eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;cursed arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; into winged arakkoa. Some &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s in appear to be affected by felblood or some other corruption. Gul'dan appears to be able to acquire more felblood after Mannoroth was slain.\nIn the RPG.\nThe ultimate manifestation of the demonic &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is fel energy. Fel energy, which most commonly manifests itself as ghastly, green-yellow flame, is arcane magic at its most corrupt, for it employs the blood of demons. Unlike arcane magic the use of fel magic &lt;a href=\"Fel%23Effects%20on%20beings\"&gt;corrupts&lt;/a&gt; the user\u2019s body and soul. By contrast, the chief danger of arcane magic is that using it inevitably leads to the desire to wield greater power: power that only fel magic can provide. When the demons brought death and damnation to Azeroth, they also carried their own brand of magic to the world. Fel magic is pure, evil and arcane; it resides in the blood of demons. This blood has magical properties; it is addictive to arcane magic users and can be used to create evil weapons. When a weapon is forged in demon blood, it becomes a fel weapon. It glows with a foul, yellow-green fire and deals extra damage to good-aligned opponents. Some arcanists can cast fel spells, perhaps after drinking demon blood. Since the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to Azeroth, the world's heroes have encountered fel weapons and fel magic at an increasing frequency. As demon cults continue to fester and grow in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and other remote corners, gruesome sacrifices are held to entice demons into giving their blood in trade. The cultists use their blood to enchant the weapons that they hope will bring about their masters' ultimate victory.\nDemons sometimes tempt spellcasters by offering small amounts of their blood in exchange for services. If the recipient drinks the demon's blood within 24 hours of the offering, the next arcane spell he casts will be empowered by the fel. Fel blood is highly addictive as well as corruptive. Anyone who drinks it risks becoming dependent on fel blood, and unless the person continues to drink it daily, he will suffer withdrawal symptoms. He has a chance of breaking the addiction seven days after first drinking the fel blood.\nSpeculation.\nFelblood might have necromantic properties: "}

Whereas the om'riggor taught participants only of the hunt, the om'gora teaches all of what it means to be an orc and can be undertaken by all orcs who have come of age.\nHistory.\nThe om'gora was proposed by &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt; in connection to &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;'s proposed re-introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. Aggralan felt that the om'riggor was inadequate, and many orcs\u2014including her life-mate &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were never given a chance to attempt it. Eitrigg in turn suggested that an orc &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, whom he felt embodied everything that orcs should aspire to be, should be the first to complete the new rite. &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; issued a challenge to the adventurer, having them best first his wolves &lt;a href=\"Duros\"&gt;Duros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drakan\"&gt;Drakan&lt;/a&gt; and then a &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Projection\"&gt;projection of his own powers&lt;/a&gt; in order to prove that they were worthy of the honor. He then gave Aggralan the title of &lt;a href=\"farseer\"&gt;farseer&lt;/a&gt; and appointed her to preside over the Kosh'harg and judge the hero's rite.\nThe adventurer's om'gora was at the center of the subsequent Kosh'harg in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. After the adventurer completed all three steps and completed the rite, the gathered orcs held a feast in their honor. After the Kosh'harg concluded, other orcs began lining up to complete the om'gora themselves. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was determined to go first in line and be the second orc to complete it. His son &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt; looked forward to completing it once he came of age as well.\nThe rite.\nThe om'gora is presided over by a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, who acts both as the participant's judge and as their guide. To complete the rite, the participant must earn three different blessings: of the clan, of the land, and of the ancestors. The intent is that once they have earned all three, they will understand what it means to be an orc."}
{"id": "72245", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=72245", "title": "Om'riggor", "text": "The om'riggor was a rite of passage in &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish society marking the transition to adulthood, taking place at the age of 12. In the modern day, it has been replaced by the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nOm'riggor required the initiate to track and slay a target by themselves, in what was referred to as a \"solo kill\". Originally, the target was a &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt;, but it was later adapted by &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian orcs to native creatures. Initiates were permitted to bring only a single weapon with no armor or provisions. If the initiate was successful in the solo kill, they would paint the blood of the prey upon their face as proof. Upon the initiate's return, a &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; would taste the blood and, if deemed genuine, the initiate would be inducted into adulthood through a formal ceremony, conducted by the clan's shaman and presided over by the clan leader who would declare the initiate(s) full members of the clan. During the ceremony, the initiate's face was anointed with blood from their father, kept carefully in a small stoppered leather bag.\nFollowing the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, om'riggor and various other orcish traditions stopped being practiced, skipping an entire generation of orcs. With the founding of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and the return of peace, shaman reclaimed the ancient ways, and om'riggor began being practiced once again. In connection to the re-introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt; suggested the introduction of a new rite of passage, the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, to replace the om'riggor. She had always felt that the latter was inadequate, as it only teaches participants of the hunt and not the rest of what it means to be an orc, and many orcs\u2014including her life-mate &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were never given a chance to attempt it. One of the three portions of the om'gora, the Blessing of the Clan, is inspired by the om'riggor."}

Blessed by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, he was once a noble &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;, but was corrupted and driven insane by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; Omen was a being of great strength and knowledge. Blessed by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, Omen wandered primordial &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, guiding hunters and gatherers and offering luck and advice to all he met. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; launched their attack during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Omen allied with &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s defenders.\nDuring one heated battle, &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; tried to protect Omen from the forces of the Legion, but the great beast was gravely wounded and poisoned with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy. Before he succumbed to demonic corruption, Omen gave his last breath of purity to Huln's spear, &lt;a href=\"Talonclaw\"&gt;Talonclaw&lt;/a&gt;, adding to the powers that other &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s had left therein. Huln placed the Ancient's name on his spear so that his courage would always be remembered.\nOmen's wounds eventually plunged him into a deep, dreaming sleep, where fel-inspired nightmares slowly consumed him. When he finally awoke centuries later, he had fallen to madness and began to rampage. No longer a creature of wisdom \u2014 but still possessing the strength of Elune's blessing \u2014 he tore through the land, killing and devouring, until a group of ancient heroes gathered in the village of &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt; and confronted the beast. Calling down the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;moon's wrath&lt;/a&gt;, they blinded and stunned Omen and forced him to retreat into the deep waters of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally defeated in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, Omen now sleeps among the silt of Lake Elune'ara. Although driven insane by the Burning Legion, the demi-god still possesses Elune's blessing and is, hence, immortal. During the Lunar Festival, he stirs, and heroes of the land are called to defeat him once again in order to ease the tormented Ancient's suffering, in the hopes that perhaps next year he will return with a clearer mind.\nStrategy.\nSummoning Omen.\nTo summon Omen, you must use &lt;a href=\"Firework%23Rocket%20Clusters\"&gt;Rocket Clusters&lt;/a&gt; on the launchers on the southeastern shore of the lake. This will cause several &lt;a href=\"Minion%20of%20Omen\"&gt;Minions of Omen&lt;/a&gt; to appear. Continue killing them and firing off rockets, and eventually Omen will appear out of the lake. It seems that there is no need to kill them, it's enough to merely have two players continually use Rocket Clusters on the launchers and he will eventually emerge out of the lake. Using &lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Candle\"&gt;Elune's Candle&lt;/a&gt; on the Minions may make Omen appear faster.\nOverview.\nOmen is a fairly straightforward fight. He has a moderately powerful melee attack, a frontal &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt;, and frequently uses a powerful AoE &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; (ticks for about 1800 damage every two seconds over a large area.) A level 70 tank should have no difficulty holding aggro on him as long as he or she is given time to build initial threat and DPS watches themselves. Using two or three healers will make it easy to keep the tank up without drawing healing aggro. A group of 10-15 well-geared level 70 characters should be able to beat him easily. The fight can be done by lower-level characters, but you will want a group of 15-20+ at level 60 or 25-30+ at lower levels (a 40-man group around L40 could probably handle it, especially with a high-level tank and/or healer.)\nHis most dangerous ability by far is &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 this will kill most characters even at L70 if they do not move out of the affected area quickly. Lower-level characters will be killed within seconds. Since healers will normally be busy keeping the tank alive, players who are hurt by this should bandage afterwards if possible. The best way to mitigate this is to constantly drag Omen around (so if he drops &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; on the tank or a melee DPSer, you will quickly move out of the way.) Ranged DPS and healers should just keep a close eye out for it (turning on scrolling combat text helps, as it pops up a big thing saying \"&lt;Starfall&gt;\" when the AoE is on you) and move out of the area as quickly as possible. It is necessary to keep the whole raid moving to survive Starfall, since it seems to be hardly if not impossible to resist(immunity shields like &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; work too if you're too low on health). If Starfall killing the tank is an issue, you may want to use only ranged DPS (meleers can just sit back and use ranged weapons); this reduces the chance that Starfall will be cast on top of the tank.\nThe boss can be graveyard-zerged; he can be dragged over close to the nearby graveyard to make this easier. Omen does not regenerate his health if he drops aggro, though he will eventually despawn.\nThe guards in Nighthaven (and some of the elites, like the flight masters) will aggro on Omen if he is kited there. The non-elites do not do much damage, but the elite NPCs can hurt him substantially. Also, if it is a busy time, there will normally be many other players in Nighthaven who will help kill him.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Candle\"&gt;Elune's Candle&lt;/a&gt; on Omen appears to prevent him from casting &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; for a few seconds (and deals some damage to him as well.) Having a number of characters rotating uses of them may almost completely prevent him from using &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is a fairly good deal to have Horde and Alliance players cooperate on killing him if you can't get enough people for Omen. It doesn't matter who tags Omen \u2014 anyone with the quest can obtain quest credit by stepping into Omen's pillar of light after he is dead. This does not always work properly \u2014 if you have the quest, step into the light, and get the buff without getting quest credit, try stepping out, dismissing the buff, and stepping into the light a second time.\nKiting.\nA group that cannot adequately tank Omen may be able to beat him by constantly kiting him around; as long as you are moving you will not take much damage from &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt;, and Omen has no other attack outside of melee range. Hunters are good for this, since they can use &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Aspect of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; to keep away from him while still dealing substantial ranged damage. Other DPS classes must be careful not to get above the threat level of the kiter, or Omen will run to them and quickly slay them. Ranged DPS at maximum range can avoid a lot of the damage from &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; (try to spread everyone out); melee DPS may want to just hang back and use their ranged weapons, and/or bandage any healers who get hurt.\nA group wipe will probably occur if the hunter runs out of mana; having a Druid (or three) to use &lt;a href=\"Innervate\"&gt;Innervate&lt;/a&gt; on them, and/or a lot of mana potions, will help. You can also use multiple hunters; when one runs out of mana, he/she should &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; to leave combat and drink (or simply die and run back), then start DPSing again. Because Omen does not reset health, even if you wipe you can set up again and repeat until he is downed.\nOmen will leash if taken too far from his spawn point, so keep this in mind when attempting to kite him. It is well advised that you bring a healer to mitigate starfall damage (which oddly does not daze cheetah/pack affected players) \u2014 a priest or druid being best, given their instant cast HOTs. A paladin could conceivably work, though the cooldown on Holy Shock is prohibitive, and you may as well keep looking before using a shaman healer.\nSoloing.\nIt is possible for warlocks, balance druids, and possibly other classes, to solo Omen. Plan on spending 30 minutes kiting him without help. There is a very large tree, south along the road, near the cluster launchers where he spawns. Cast all DoTs on Omen and run him tightly around the tree. You will have to reapply one spell every ~9 seconds so that he does not reset. Healthstones, healing potions, and a run speed enchant will help significantly. You will be taking damage from &lt;a href=\"Lifetap\"&gt;Lifetap&lt;/a&gt; and occasional Starfall spells, so if you have neither &lt;a href=\"Siphon%20Life%20%28Wrath%20Classic%29\"&gt;Siphon Life (Wrath Classic)&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Stamina\"&gt;Fel Stamina&lt;/a&gt; it is unlikely you will succeed in killing him without help. It is also possible to kite him around Nighthaven as a hunter using a combination of &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Viper\"&gt;Aspect of the Viper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Aspect of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, and damage over time through traps, stings and pausing to shoot at Omen. One must run in a circular pattern around Nighthaven through the inn and over the bridge, and around again, all the while doing this. It takes a massive amount of time, but is possible. Nearby players are likely to help, as do all guards that Omen passes, though these die fairly quickly.\nOmen has now been buffed to 5.6 Million health and does about 3-4 Thousand damage with Starfall. Omen is also now leashed to his summoning grounds. He can no longer be kited to Nighthaven. Max distance toward Nighthaven is the second bridge from the summoning grounds. -OMEN IS NOW CLASSED AS A RAID BOSS- It is still possible to solo Omen, although it takes a prohibitive amount of time.\nBalance druids can solo Omen with relative ease so long as their mana regeneration is sufficient to maintain a very long, pitched fight. As with the strategy above, pull Omen to the large tree to the south of his spawn point (just north of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Cat%20Spirit\"&gt;Great Cat Spirit&lt;/a&gt;). It seems to be easiest to circle the tree in a clockwise fashion. Use &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Swarm\"&gt;Insect Swarm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moonfire\"&gt;Moonfire&lt;/a&gt; as your primary sources of damage, reapplying them as soon as they wear off. You can also use &lt;a href=\"Force%20of%20Nature\"&gt;Force of Nature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; on every cooldown to supplement your damage, but try to drop Force of Nature immediately after Omen uses HIS Starfall, else your treants will likely die without doing any damage. &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Moonfire\"&gt;Glyph of Moonfire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Insect%20Swarm\"&gt;Glyph of Insect Swarm&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful here, as can &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Innervate\"&gt;Glyph of Innervate&lt;/a&gt; to help prolong your mana. You won't have time to get any other spells off on Omen and you must not allow him to land a physical attack on you lest you be dazed, so stick to your two damage-over-time spells. You'll usually catch at least one damage tick each time he uses his Starfall ability, so use &lt;a href=\"Lifebloom\"&gt;Lifebloom&lt;/a&gt; and possibly &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; to keep your health up. When you begin to get low on mana, use &lt;a href=\"Innervate\"&gt;Innervate&lt;/a&gt; if it's not on cooldown. If it's still on its cooldown, stop using Moonfire and just use Insect Swarm to keep Omen from resetting, casting it only once every ten seconds or so, until you can use Innervate again. Trinkets such as the &lt;a href=\"Majestic%20Dragon%20Figurine\"&gt;Majestic Dragon Figurine&lt;/a&gt; and talents such as &lt;a href=\"Intensity%20%28druid%20talent%29\"&gt;Intensity (druid talent)&lt;/a&gt; will help preserve your mana between Innervates. If Omen begins to get too close for comfort, shift into &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;Travel Form&lt;/a&gt; to give you some breathing room, but don't outrun Omen too far or you'll be out of casting range and he may reset. \nExpect to devote at least two hours to soloing Omen at level 80, although depending on gear level it can go faster. It's interesting to note that Omen does not immediately regain health when resetting, so if you lose aggro you can take that opportunity to eat/drink/bandage. A player attempting to solo Omen has at least a few minutes to rest when he resets before their progress is lost, however waiting too long will allow him to despawn. A level 85 hunter can solo him without interference, as long as they keep their signature pets alive."}

When &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and the majority of the draenei race left for &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, these draenei remained on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to reestablish a presence at their holy places.\nHistory.\nIllidan.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; in their pursuit of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; visited the Temple of Telhamat and asked the draenei about &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;. They told her that he was a leader in a faction known as the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20tribe\"&gt;Ashtongue tribe&lt;/a&gt;, had access to troops, and knew this land.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; reopened, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s met &lt;a href=\"Warp-Scryer%20Kryv\"&gt;Warp-Scryer Kryv&lt;/a&gt; who told them about the Omenai and sent them to meet &lt;a href=\"Amaan%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Amaan the Wise&lt;/a&gt;, who welcomed them warmly. As one of the Omenai's missions is to restore their sacred places, Amaan sent the adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Aggonar\"&gt;Pools of Aggonar&lt;/a&gt; in order to cleanse it of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that infected these waters once sacred to the draenei. As it was the blood of the demon &lt;a href=\"Aggonar\"&gt;Aggonar&lt;/a&gt; that fouled the very essence of these holy waters, he also sent them to cleanse them with a &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Vial\"&gt;cleansing vial&lt;/a&gt; and to kill &lt;a href=\"Aggonis\"&gt;Aggonis&lt;/a&gt;, the manifestation of his remaining essence in Outland. After their success, Amaan announced that they could finally begin their work to restore the pools to their former purity.\nWorrying about the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' use of &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;demonic magics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elsaana\"&gt;Elsaana&lt;/a&gt; sent the adventurers to neutralize the &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s that they drained in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Sedai\"&gt;Vindicator Sedai&lt;/a&gt; left the temple to try to negotiate peace with the orcs of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20Post\"&gt;Mag'har Post&lt;/a&gt;. His brother &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Obadei\"&gt;Anchorite Obadei&lt;/a&gt; began to worry when he didn't return, and sent an adventurer who discovered his corpse. Enraged by his friend's death, and the Omenai's decision not to counterattack, the broken &lt;a href=\"Makuru\"&gt;Makuru&lt;/a&gt; asked the adventurer to enact vengeance by killing several Mag'har grunts. Anchorite Obadei later chastised Makuru, as this went against Sedai's ideals, and sent the adventurer to Amaan in order to shed some light on the situation. The leader of the Omenai lent them an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"%3ASeer%27s%20Relic\"&gt;:Seer's Relic&lt;/a&gt;, and though the relic didn't have the power to reveal the past, it could grant a vision showing a likely series of events. In this vision, Sedai was escorted from the village by two &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; orc guards who swore they'd kill him if he ever came back. However, &lt;a href=\"Krun%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Krun Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; and a pair of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Ambusher\"&gt;Laughing Skull Ambusher&lt;/a&gt;s ambushed the group and managed to kill them all. It is unknown if the events shown in the vision are what really happened, but Amaan hoped that it might lead the adventurer to consider other possibilities, rather than making an assumption and believing it the truth.\nLike the other &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ikan\"&gt;Ikan&lt;/a&gt; was lost after his mind suffered terrible pain from the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt;' demonic &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.

The island was almost entirely bare of vegetation and held a series of small ruined structures that appeared to have been either a fort or a walled estate. Upon approaching the island, Rhonin felt a sense of dread and experienced mournful cries, comparing it to when he flew over &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, and heard the cries of that island's restless &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt;. Korialstrasz felt that something tragic had happened there, but could not say what.\nDuring Korialstrasz and Rhonin's rest on a promontory overlooking the ruins, some type of &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s attacked them and manipulated their dreams. They managed to wake up, somehow finding themselves in one of the ruined buildings. The creatures were described as having glowing red eyes, much-too-long limbs, three-fingered hands, and needle-sharp teeth, and one that attacked Rhonin wore the remains of regal clothing. After a small fight, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s emerged victorious and then quickly escaped from the island.\nRhonin asked Krasus what they could have been. While the dragon believed the creatures to have once been the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants of the island, he only knew that their current state was the result of something even older and more unholy than anything the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; ever created. He further believed that there were catacombs below the island where the ghouls rested when not hunting. Krasus stated that after his and Rhonin's mission was over, he would return to end the abominations.\nFollowing their flight path to Kalimdor, and Korialstrasz's statement that they would need rest before passing near the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, this island would be somewhere to the north and east of the Maelstrom."}

You can choose whether you wish to fight him before or after &lt;a href=\"Vazruden\"&gt;Vazruden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazan\"&gt;Nazan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Omor the Unscarred was a disciple of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and took charge of the legendary warrior's remaining felhounds after his master's defeat during the War of the Ancients. Since that time, Omor has never been defeated in single combat. The venerable demon is &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s envoy to the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s of Hellfire Citadel.\"\nMelee tank strategy (Normal).\nOmor is mostly a tank-and-spank fight, with a few variations. Before you begin, clear the two guards in front of him separately (they are not linked to Omor and can be pulled without chaining the boss), then when the party is ready have your &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; go in and build some &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpace out to avoid damage from his curse Treacherous Aura which should be removed if possible. Failing that, pay attention to the cursed person and keep them away from other players and let the curse wear off. The room where you fight Omor is circular. If you have ranged DPS, characters can stay at range from Omor and away from one another by making corners (2 in front and 2 in back) with the tank on him. This will avoid the affects of being cursed but may require an off healer for the two in the back.\nMake sure the felhounds are dealt with quickly, as their draining abilities are quite potent. They can become problematic if they run free, in a fight where players are split up to various degrees. Easy to nuke down and warlocks are particularly valuable here as they can single handedly deal with both adds. The felhounds are nonelite and any melee dps can make quick work of them. \nOmor doesn't always use his Shadow Whip ability on his highest aggro target, so the only one to suffer from it should generally be melee dps. Maneuver yourself over Omor, so that you can rejoin the fight immediately on landing.\nMelee tank strategy (Heroic).\nThe strategy for Heroic difficulty is very similar to the one for Normal difficulty. \nHigh shadow resist (over 200) negates most all of the damage of this boss. If your people are geared up with high shadow resistances, this boss is relatively easy for a heroic mode boss.\nOmor's AoE debuff is now much stronger, and can no longer be dispelled.\nThe problem with the Bane of Treachery debuff is if it is placed on a melee fighting the boss, it will harm all other melee nearby\u2014a rogue with the aura can do the 5,000 damage to the tank every 2 seconds, if on the tank, the melee will take this, etc. With respect to the adds, if the healer gets the aura and a melee goes to get the adds attacking the healer, that melee will take the damage.\nIt's simple enough to avoid problems with Bane, as you can time it and control it. As the fight begins and players are spreading out there will be a ten-second grace before the 1st Bane. Melee DPS should wait to see who gets the first Bane before running into the boss. If one person on melee DPS gets Bane, he should wait its duration out on the sides. If the tank gets Bane, all melee DPS should wait on the sides. As Bane reaches the end of its duration (15 seconds), all melee DPS should return to their original spread out positions until Bane has been placed on a new target. If melee are next to each other when Omor gives the debuff, they will almost certainly NOT be able to get away from each other in time.\nThe Fel Hounds will now pose an additional threat to mana users; so it's even more important to control/eliminate them quickly. They may not despawn immediately when the boss dies. On heroic, they are still vulnerable to crowd control like Ice Trap, Banish, Enslave and Fear.\nThis fight is a cinch if you appropriately spread out to deal with the Bane of Treachery debuff and have a warlock or a quick main tank to deal with the Felhounds.\nStrategy (Heroic - Range Tanking).\nThis strategy works best with the following composition:\n2x Range Dps(warlock/mage/hunter/shaman/druid/priest)\n1x Main healer(priest/shaman/paladin/druid) \n1x Offhealer/Dps(druid/shaman/paladin/priest) \n1x NonManaBased Dps (warrior/rogue/bear/kitty) *possible with hunter or enhancement shaman in absence of all else\nPositioning:\nhave your main healer stand at the entrance of the platform about 10 yards in with 1 ranged dps to the right and 1 to the left approximately 15-20 yards away from the healer on either side. None of these 3 need move at all the whole fight so the range from each other is simply to make sure they are within healing/dps range and out of debuff dmg range of each other. Have the offhealer and the NMB-DPS wait with the healer for the pull.\nThe fight:\nRanged Dps will \"pull\" and immediately go all out dps having no concern for threat/aggro whatsoever.\nOmor will stay in the center. He does not move. He will not use his shadow whip ability. He will simply fire shadowbolts at the Ranged DPS who has the highest aggro. The fight is very short so the main healer just has to spam heal whichever caster holds aggro, If you have made it this far your Main healer (regardless of class) should have no problem out healing the shadowbolt damage.\nAs soon as the range dps have made the \"pull\" the NMB-DPS runs to the feet of Omor and waits there for felhounds to spawn as they spawn he needs to aggro them and pull them behind Omor slightly in order to keep them out of mana burn range of the casters, the offhealer just needs to stay at max range healing the NMB-DPS until Omor is dead then the rest of the group can assist in killing off the felhounds. Be careful not to aggro Omor out of boredom waiting for a felhound as he will shadow whip and kill the person who is supposed to keep felhounds away from the casters.\nAs long as the felhounds are aggroed as they spawn and pulled slightly behind Omor so that casters don't get mana burned, all out dps from 2xRanged dps even if they are undergeared makes this a very short fight.\nNote: This strategy works in normal mode as well"}

This means that a Frost Tombed player will have to be healed for around 40,000 damage over 18 seconds, while the healer is still keeping the tank standing. Because of this, having two players able to heal is almost an absolute necessity. If you do not bring two healers, then luck will play the most part of this fight. If a person dies to Frost Tomb, you will not get the achievement.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He was born on the same day and under the same constellation as Taruka, but whereas she struggled to be seen at all, he was set on making a name for himself and always tried to belittle her. One afternoon when Taruka returned to the clan's camp with a catch of &lt;a href=\"Spotted%20Yellowtail\"&gt;spotted yellowtail&lt;/a&gt;, Onaaka mocked her and boastfully displayed a huge &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Salmon\"&gt;emperor salmon&lt;/a&gt; he'd caught, saying that the catch master &lt;a href=\"Kattik%20Sharktasted\"&gt;Kattik&lt;/a&gt; would have to call on his assistant to weigh it.\nWhen Taruka set off for &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt; an early morning, she noticed Onaaka and some of the other tuskarr preparing their boats. He shouted something after her, but his words were blown away by the wind.\nOnaaka accompanied the rest of his clan to Kamagua. When Taruka later arrived to the harbor, she did so riding a strange vessel made from the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Beast%20of%20Lyquokk%20Strait\"&gt;huge sea monster&lt;/a&gt; she'd slain on her voyage through &lt;a href=\"Lyquokk%20Strait\"&gt;Lyquokk Strait&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone with a boat wanted to help tow her into the harbor, including Onaaka, who quietly watched from his boat with a facial expression Taruka had never seen before. Then, just loud enough for her to hear, he told her that it was a very good catch."}

When the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s' slaves refused to fight, she was sent do deal with them. This happened when &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; refused to kill the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;. The two combatants took advantage of her being one-eyed and coordinated their attacks. When Aram hoped on her, he noticed a thorn collar which he removed, but she didn't fly away, yet she stopped attacking the younglings. When the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; attacked Dire Maul and killed a guard named &lt;a href=\"Arkus\"&gt;Arkus&lt;/a&gt;, his head was sent flying, landed next to her and she raised it with her tail and showed it to &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt; figured there must be something under the dome and learned from other slaves about her cubs. During the ensuing chaos, Thalyss promised her in &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt; to help her, and the druid destroyed the thorn dome and freed the cubs. With the cubs freed, she aided Aram, defending him from &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; whom she knocked out for a brief time. Aram, Thalyss, &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt;, Hackle and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; hoped on her and left Dire Maul for east to her nest atop &lt;a href=\"Skypeak\"&gt;Skypeak&lt;/a&gt;. As they took off, Thalyss was hit by two crossbow bolts and died atop the mountain. She then carried them down, dug a hole for the night elf and eventually left.\nOne-Eye and her three cubs accepted Makasa's plea for help to rescue Aram from the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They came to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; valley in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, reuniting with their friends. Upon entering the peninsula, One-Eye, her cubs, &lt;a href=\"Telagos\"&gt;Telagos&lt;/a&gt;, and a few of the fastest &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20clan\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s went ahead to scout the way. Eventually, they fought at the citadel, successfully defeating the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Their history was recorded in the \"&lt;a href=\"Annals%20of%20the%20One%20Hundred\"&gt;Annals of the One Hundred&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHistory.\nThe Troll Wars.\nPrior to the founding of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; tribes practiced animistic beliefs, mainly crude forms of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism. The &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic of the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; was legendary among humans, but they had never learned its secrets.\nIn 2,800 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; began when the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; attacked the high elf kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The outnumbered elves quickly lost ground. The desperate high elf king &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; decided to turn to the humans for help. Although the humans had no spellcasters, Arathor had a large population and Anasterian hoped that there were humans with magical talent who could become useful in combat if they were given training. He knew that teaching the arcane to humans could lead to disaster, but with his people facing extinction, he had little choice and sent ambassadors to Arathor's capital of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; to speak to &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;. Thoradin deeply distrusted sorcery but, after debating with his advisors, concluded that Arathor did not have the forces for an open fight with the trolls and that they would need magic to make an impact in the war. After some further negotiation, Thoradin and Anasterian agreed that the elves would teach the humans the arcane arts in exchange for Strom's military aid.\nElven &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; quickly traveled to Strom and began tutoring a group of one hundred humans, chosen for their strong wills and noble spirits. The number one hundred was chosen because it was the bare minimum needed to defeat the Amani, and the students were taught no more than the very basics necessary for combat. Over the course of many months, the elves noticed that although the humans were innately clumsy in their spellcasting, they possessed a strong natural affinity for magic.\nOnce the One Hundred's training were complete, Arathor's forces gathered at &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Fortress\"&gt;Alterac Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and marched toward Quel'Thalas, while the human magi stayed behind in the fortress. The Arathi host attacked the Amani's southern flank and then retreated back to Alterac with the trolls in pursuit. A days-long battle ensued in the Alterac foothills, with the humans and high elves attacking the Amani on different fronts while the One Hundred stayed hidden inside the fortress. When the humans and elves were confident that they had worn down the Amani, they unleashed their secret weapon. The One Hundred emerged from the fortress and, alongside the high elven sorcerers, did something unprecedented. Instead of attacking individually, they pooled their power and unleashed a single devastating spell, creating a massive column of fire which tore down from the sky and engulfed the Amani army. The magical flames prevented the trolls from &lt;a href=\"Troll%23Troll%20regeneration\"&gt;regenerating&lt;/a&gt; their wounds and burned both the trolls (including their ruler &lt;a href=\"Jintha\"&gt;Jintha&lt;/a&gt;) and their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; allies from the inside out. The surviving trolls fled and were easily defeated, marking the end of both the battle and the Troll Wars.\nAfter the war.\nYears after the Troll Wars, King Thoradin abdicated his throne and set out on a quest to find the origins of humanity. Two of the One Hundred, &lt;a href=\"Antonius\"&gt;Antonius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decindra\"&gt;Decindra&lt;/a&gt;, along with their apprentices, chose to accompany him. The party ultimately discovered the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and broke the tomb's magical seals, which inadvertently resurrected the monster &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt; who was buried within. Zakajz easily killed the magi and everyone else in the party, but with his last act Thoradin subdued it with &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the years after Thoradin's reign, the original One Hundred expanded their powers and began teaching pupils in the ways of the arcane, dramatically increasing the number of spellcasters in Arathor over the course of a few decades. The original magi had always practiced their magic with responsibility and care, but now passed their knowledge onto a newer generation that had no concept of the rigors of war or the need for self-restraint. These younger magicians began practicing magic for their own gain rather than any responsibility toward their fellow humans. The protection of these magi made it possible for enterprising humans to expand into the wilderness of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and create new settlements. However, as their powers grew, the magicians became increasingly conceited and isolated from the rest of society. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; eventually became a haven for Arathor's magi, whom the empire's citizens increasingly viewed with suspicion and prejudice.\n&lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council&lt;/a&gt;, and the reformed &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was presumably one of the original One Hundred, since he participated in (and became undead during) the Troll Wars. This would make him the only one known member to still exist in the present day, more than 2,800 years later.\nSpeculation.\nBased on its name and location, the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;Tower of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; in Strom (now &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;) may have been where the One Hundred trained and kept their headquarters."}

(Definitions).\nNo, really. What the heck are UIs, Mods, and AddOns?\nA \"UI\", \"AddOn\" or \"Mod\" (the terms tend to be used interchangeably) is anything that provides \"Modifications\" or \"Adds On to\" the original base User Interface as supplied by Blizzard. The changes may be purely cosmetic (change the colour of the bars from the standard grey to florescent pink), may make it so you can change where or how things are displayed on the screen, may provide additional information or functionality, etc.\nInformation on Macros and Scripts can be found further along in this FAQ.\nWhat's the best UI?\nWhat is the best UI?\nWhat is the best UI for PvP?\nWhat is the best UI for instancing?\nWhat is the best UI for &lt;insert your class here&gt;?\nRemember that when you are asking about \"the best UI\", while people can point you to the mod they prefer, it is just that, a personal preference.\nPerson A prefers Mod/Compilation X. Person B doesn't like Mod/Compilation X, they prefer Mod/Compilation Y. Person C uses stand-alones only, and mixes and matches to get their desired result, etc and so on ...\nExamples of AddOns:\nPlease note, this is definitely not anywhere near a \"complete\" list, there are many many many others. A large number of the ones I've got listed there are suites/compilations, an example listing of stand-alones would be absolutely freaking huge. The ones I listed aren't in any particular order. This is just a very small sample listing to give you an idea of the fact that there are tons out there.\nYou have to figure out which one gives you the options you want, or mix and match to get what you want. \nCheck out different AddOns, find what works for you.\nWhere? (Where do I get AddOns?).\nWhere can I download some AddOns?\nThere are a number of Mod Hosting sites:\nPlus all of the AddOns that are self-hosted, most of which can be found by browsing through the Blizzard UI forum.\nYou can also see an overview of updates to addons covering multiple sites:\nX AddOns hosting site is down, where can I get Y AddOn?\nTry one of the other mod sites listed above, or do a web search for the name of the AddOn you are looking for.\nWhere's that cool Addon?\nThere's this AddOn, that does this really cool thing, but I can't remember it's name... Can you tell me what it is!\nWithout additional information it would be near impossible to figure out which AddOn you're hoping to find. If you browse some of the mod hosting sites listed below, you'll likely find what you're looking for, (and much more besides!) If you can give a very detailed description of exactly what the AddOn does we just might be able to help you find what you are looking for. A screen shot would be very helpful.\nExtremely popular AddOns (main sites for AddOns that are asked about all the time).\nMany of these are available at the major hosting sites listed above, but not all, and those that are also have their own support forums, etc, listed here. (Listed alphabetically): \nHow?\nHow do I install AddOns?\nI downloaded an AddOn but I'm not sure how to get it working in-game, help!\nI downloaded an AddOn but it's not showing up under the [AddOns] button in the character select screen, help!\nThe FAQ at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com\"&gt;wowinterface.com&lt;/a&gt; has a nice step-by-step walk through on how to install AddOns. There are also a couple images of the right and wrong ways to install, along with a check list of the most common errors, in case you have any difficulties. View it here: http://www.wowinterface.com/forums/faq.php?faq=install#faq_howto_install\nUm. This zip file I downloaded doesn't have any folders... just a bunch of files. What should I do? \nOne of the files in the zip should have the .toc extension (i.e., there should be a file with a name similar to NameOfTheMod.toc). Simply create a new folder under your Interface/AddOns/ directory with the same name (NameOfTheMod), and place all the zipped files into that new folder.\nFor WinZIP, make sure you use Classic mode and that \"View-&gt;Files by Folder (Explorer Style)\" is ticked and don't use Wizard mode, it will unzip the files into \"Interface\\AddOns\\&lt;ZIP file name&gt;\\&lt;addon name&gt;\" instead of just \"Interface\\AddOns\\&lt;addon name&gt;\".\nPatch Day.\nWhat to do and not do.\nHey, a new patch is out! What should I do to ensure my AddOns keep working error-free?\nCondensed version.\nMany AddOns will still work after a patch, even though they are technically \"out of date\". You only *have* to update AddOns that are actually broken because of functionality changes made by Blizzard in a patch. If you aren't getting error messages and everything is still working okay, you can just run using the \"Load Outdated AddOns\" check box. It is a good idea, however, to update your AddOns as you get the opportunity to do so, because not only do the authors fix anything broken, but most authors are also constantly tweaking their mod to make them better.\nExpanded version.\nWell, there's no guarantee that your AddOns will work error-free after a patch, since it is Blizzard's prerogative to change any and all of the API used by various AddOns. When that happens, AddOns which call upon those API functions tend to either not work, work strangely, or throw up lots of nasty-looking error messages.\nThe absolute best advice I can give for patch-day AddOn maintenance is to follow these guidelines \nThere is no harm in leaving version checking turned off permanently.\nThese steps will ensure a clean and aggravation free mod using experience. They will ensure that you don't spend hours trying to figure out exactly what killed your system. When 1300 patch initially came out, the Standalone version of QuestMinion totally locked up everyone's machine, requiring a coldboot. It was a pain to figure out which mod did it.\nWhat's the new toc number?\nUnless you are a mod author, \"it does not matter\". \nThere is simply no need. Use the \"Load Outdated AddOns\" check box, located under the AddOns button on your Character Select screen instead. Check in at the location where you got your mod(s) from originally over a few days after a patch, to get the properly updated version from the actual mod author.\nBy going in and changing all the toc numbers yourself, you are completely defeating the entire purpose of them in the first place.\nIf you use \"Load Outdated AddOns\", without making any changes to the toc numbers (i.e., the proper way to deal with patch days), then when something stops working, you've got some hope of figuring out which mod(s) aren't working right, since you can go back to the AddOn button on the Character Select screen and see which AddOns aren't updated yet.\nIf, however, you go in and manually change all the toc numbers, so far as WoW is concerned, they are all \"current\". Now what do you do when they stop working? When all of a sudden you've got error messages popping up all over the place? How do you know which ones are actually current and which ones are outdated and probably the problem? You've no way to tell any more. \"Leave your toc numbers alone.\"\nLegal?\nIs &lt;insert name of addon here&gt; a cheat or hack?\nTrimble's post and Slouken's reply to it sums it up pretty well (this has unfortunately disappeared from the forums long ago, if nothing else, it would have gone in one of the forum upgrades):\nTrimble: \nUI AddOns fall into two categories:\nMacros - these aren't really AddOns at all, but they can use LUA code to do neat things in game. These are found ENTIRELY inside the game, and the code is run by Blizzard's interpreter, so they make the rules on what macros can and cannot do. Therefore, Blizzard won't ban someone from using any macros.\nAddOns - These are extra files, put into the WoW Interface directory on your hard drive which supplement the existing LUA and XML code that Blizzard created that makes up the user interface that everyone uses.\nAddOns are made up of LUA files, and XML files, both of which are also run by Blizzard's interpreter. Therefore, Blizzard won't ban someone from using any AddOns.\n3rd party programs are actual programs that get loaded into memory and executed using their own code. They run separate from the game similar to how ICQ or MSN Messenger runs in the background. The difference is that 3rd party hacks try to read, or change data coming into or out of the WOW game client(to the network card), or they try to read or write to memory space used by the Wow Game client.\nSpeed hacks, for example, often interfere with data flowing from the game client to the network card by intercepting the \"i am here\" signal that he game client sends to the server and making it seem that the player is moving faster than they should be. The server accepts this as truth because Blizzard left it up to the game client to limit how fast you can go. (Oops Blizzard?) This strange design is caused by a need to let the game client do some of the work because the server is too busy to be expected to do everything.'\nAnyway, the distinction in 3rd party hacks is usually the fact that hacks run as their own programs and interfere with the game client.\nAddOns aren't anything more than REALLY extravagant macros.\nSlouken:\nThis is a very good explanation of things as I understand them. However, I am not involved in policy and I'm not a lawyer.\nWhile we've done our best not to penalize people who use the scripting interface, even in ways that aren't intended, it's conceivable that at some point someone will find a way to use them that is against the terms of use (e.g. is hurting other people's play experience), and is something we can't disable. In that case it's possible that we might warn people that using the AddOn is against the terms of use, and if they continue to do so, some action would be taken.\nIf you haven't been explicitly warned by a GM, or seen an official Blizzard response about an AddOn or UI modification, then don't worry about it.\nAlso this post, translated by Shouryuu from: http://forums-fr.wow-europe.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-interface-fr&amp;t=21783&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post21783 (posted by Daghorn, a Blizzard Rep for the EU community)\n\"(Not the best of translations, but I do believe I have not changed the meaning of the post. Please inform me if you believe so. )\"\nDaghorn:\nUpon review of your comments, I deem it important to come back on the notion of interface modification (Addon, personalized interface) and the notion of third party applications.\nInterface modifications:\nSince the early days of Beta, our developers have chosen to offer fans of interface modifications some freedom to create. However, this \"creative space\" is supervised by what is called the API (Application Programming Interface): some doors are left open, while others are shut closed.\nWhat must be known is that these interface modifications are entirely integrated within the games repertory and are a part of the World of Warcraft application, as you may note while looking at your task manager, AddOns do not require other applications to function and do not modify the client's files.\nAll in all, developers supervise the situation and can, if need be, lock certain functionalities that may alter the game play.\nAs long as your AddOns meet the above conditions, there is no need for concern. The only thing you need to know is that if the developers deem that some proposed functionalities alter game play, they will render their use impossible.\nUnauthorized third party application:\nA third party application includes any file or application that is not part of the World Of Warcraft application, used to gain an in-game advantage, such as increasing your movement speed or the ability to teleport yourself from one place to another in a manner not permitted by the game's conception. This includes any program that allows players to obtain information on the game which is normally not obtainable, or to transmit or modify certain game files. Normally, this does not include interface modifications, except interfaces whose functioning depends on an outside program.\n-&gt; To the difference of a personalized interface, these are autonomous programs, which are not concerned by the API defined by the developers since they do not use the current system but rather other procedures and modify game files. In this case, we no longer speak of game play alteration but of cheating, and sanctions will follow.\nBrief Observations:\nAlso see Blizzard's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.blizzard.com/support/wow/%3Fid%3Daww01657p\"&gt;What are \"Hacks\" and \"Third Party Programs\"?&lt;/a&gt; page.\nPanic!\nWhat to do and not do when posting a \"please help\" thread.\nNothing works, help me!\nBefore you post:\nAs well, make use of the search button, as it is entirely possible that your problem has already been encountered and solved.\nIf after all of that, you are still having problems, please remember these things when posting your help request:\nAlso, when having problems with your UI, it tends to help if you also post the contents of your log file. This is located at &lt;WoWFolder&gt;\\Logs\\FrameXML.log. \nThings to try.\nVarious graphics for my AddOns are showing up as green squares? What's wrong, how do I fix it?\nIf the graphics files are showing up as green squares, it is because WoW can't \"find\" them where the AddOn told them they would be. Most AddOns have their graphics files in a sub-folder within the AddOn's folder. Make sure when you unzipped the download that you have \"maintain directory structure\" (or something like that, I don't recall what the exact wording is off the top of my head) enabled; otherwise WinZip will dump all the files in the same directory.\nI got my UI set up the way I want, log out and back in, and nothing is saved, I have to do it all over again. Why?\nMake sure that you don't have copies of any of the configuration files (see &lt;a href=\"%23Backups%20and%20copying%20settings\"&gt;Backups and copying settings&lt;/a&gt; below) anywhere else in your WoW folders, since WoW will try to read some of them from several places for backward compatibility reasons, but it will only save it to a single place. Also, make sure that none of the configuration files are set to \"read-only\".\nI have a broken mod, how do I get it fixed? \nFirst make sure you have the latest version, if you do then try to get feedback to the author. This can usually be done in a comment thread on the mod site where it's posted. Some authors have their own forums; if that's the case post it there. When you give this feedback there's a few key pieces of info needed: \nI have a broken mod but can't find the author, or I found where it was published but it seems the slacker's been MIA for 5 months, what do I do now? \nPost it up here! Link to the mod and provide the info that the author would need to fix the error. There's a good chance one of the authors here will pick it up, repair it, and republish it. Keep an eye out for AddOns with the words \"continued\" \"resurrected\" or \"(Rank 2)\" as these are often abandoned-then-readopted AddOns.\nFinding the faulty AddOn.\nI'm having &lt;insert vague problem here&gt; with my UI, help! \nGo to the character select screen. In the bottom left is a button labeled [AddOns]. Click that. You should see a list of all the AddOns that WoW thinks it might be able to load. You can enable and disable their loading from there.\nMake a list of all AddOns that you have loaded.\nDisable them all. Yep. All of them.\nEnter the game and see if the problem still exists. If it does, you probably have an \"old style\" AddOn that put something in the path/to/WoW/Interface/FrameXML/ folder. Rename that folder to something like FrameXML.broken and try it again. If you still have a problem change the name of the path/to/WoW/Interface/AddOns/ folder to something like AddOns.broken and try again. \nIf you still have a problem, something about your WoW installation is really broken and you may have to do the dreaded \"WTF, WDB, Interface\" dance. (i.e., follow the steps for completely resetting your UI in the Q/A below.)\nAssuming that it ran fine with at most moving your FrameXML folder aside, you now need to start re-enabling AddOns until you see the problem. If you don't want to do a lot of paperwork, and have a little time, re-enable them one at a time and see what happens. (This is the way I do it. It doesn't take too long even with a moderately-long list of AddOns.)\nIf you have a ton of AddOns, you may want to do a \"binary search\" which works like this:\nOnce you get down to one candidate somehow, disable all AddOns except that one. If you still have the problem, that is your culprit. If you don't see the problem, then it is a likely conflict with some other AddOn(s) and you would need to use a similar search to find which pair (and hopefully not three or four involved) cause the problem.\nArgh! Why?!\nWhy does Blizzard break my AddOns each patch?\nWhy?!?! Why, Damnit, Why?! Argh! Blizzard SUCKS! They ALWAYS break my stuff! \nFirst of all, it's important to clearly state that Blizzard does not officially support any add-ons. By support, I mean Blizzard is in no way responsible for their proper functioning, and does not guarantee their in-game stability. Blizzard guarantees that their default UI (User Interface) functions at all times, and it does, even though a large part of modders do believe it to be somewhat lacking in versatility.\nThere are two ways of viewing this lack of versatility. The first one, the most popular one, believes that Blizzard left a job undone\u2014that like a lot of things in World of Warcraft, the default UI is \"lacking in content\". However, the other view, held by most of the modding communities (those who code the add-ons), sees the reasons for this \"ineffective\" UI as Blizzard's will to let the modding community grow, and offer plethora of AddOns to users which will allow them to have their very own unique UI, entirely fitted to their tastes and to the way they play the game.\nThis belief has been strongly reinforced with the possibility, since in patch 1.8, to disable some parts of the default UI. The modding community views this as an encouragement from Blizzard, to change, replace, reuse, rework, hash, cut, and destroy their UI. We strongly believe that Blizzard's UI, intentionally, lays down the foundations of a UI (a foundation which does offer more than basic functions and does not prevent you from playing the game properly) to offer us infinite possibilities to tinker and customize our UI. There is no way Blizzard can satisfy every player's tastes with only one UI, and we believe they have done so by not imposing one type of UI.\nThis being said, why does every patch break my add-ons?\n\"One very common reason for this is that if you downloaded an addon in version 2.0.1 and later game patch 2.0.2 comes out the addon is still believing that you have 2.0.1 and will not function. You should always first try checking the box on your character selection screen; \"Load out of date addons\" whereas this svolves the problem most of the times. However, the most popular addons usually receives an update itself, but might take some time to be fixed and uploaded on the Internet.\"\nWell technically speaking, not every patch breaks your add-ons, only the patches that apply changes to the API (in other words, the functions used by your add-ons) or the way add-ons work. The UI was very well compared to (by Cairenn or Iriel I believe) a black box, with plenty of little buttons and lights of different colors and in different places. Inside the box, is WoW, the lights tell you something about WoW, and the buttons allow you to do something in WoW.\nFor example, if the red light were to light up, it would mean that you would have been hit for X damage, and WoW let's you know that (via the combat log). If you were to push the cute little pink button, you would do the /hug emote. So there you are, in front of your black box, playing WoW. Everything is great but you only have 10 fingers and there are thousands of buttons to press, and you only have two eyes and there are thousands of lights to watch out for, so what to do?\nWell you'd hire Santa\u2019s little helpers, in other words add-ons. Add-ons just watch the lights, decode what they mean and yell it to you. They even help you press those hard to reach buttons. But what happens when Blizzard moves a button to another place because they've added one nearby, and don't want you mistaking one for the other? Well your great add-on is going to try press the designated button and hit the black box, oh noz! So it's going to hit it, and then it's going to tell you \"ZOMG there's no button, ERROR ERROR!\u201d Same goes for the lights. What if the light an add-on is piously gazing at changes color, or doesn't flash at the same frequency it used to so that players without add-ons (those who use the default UI) can see it more clearly? Well the add-on is going to tell you \"Uh, what\u2019s up with this light? I'm supposed to be seeing a thousand flashes a second, and I only see three flashes a second! ERROR ERROR!\u201d So this is how patches break AddOns. They swap the lights around, move a button so that someone using the default UI can reach it easier, add lights that add-ons stare at saying \"WTF is that?\", even sometimes remove buttons (remember the Auto Travel soap opera...). Most (by most I mean 99.99%) changes in the lights and buttons are either a good thing for the default user, or a good thing for the add-on user.\nAn example of the good changes for add-ons that break them: (it's called Creative Destruction, it's actually an economic theory By Schumpeter and the very base of Capitalism, you Americans should understand that ) Let us imagine there is a series of four lights at the faaaar back of that black box, those lights flash a different frequencies, are of different colors and say different things. The only problem, is that all look realllllly alike, and what they are trying to say isn't always clear (for eample, they flash differently but are trying to say the same things...). Sooo Blizzard sees this, hears a few suggestions left and right and decides to change them. So they rip those four lights out, and put 8 lights all very different and easily differentiable from one another. So add-ons that were looking at those lights are going \"WTF?\" and are broken =(. But after authors change the add-ons code, well all is better! The add-ons clearly understand what the lights are saying, it's easier for the coders, it's easier for the add-on, it uses less memory and most importantly it's easier for the user.\nSo Blizzard does care about AddOns. They seem to want customized UI to be as effective as possible, as versatile as possible, as stable as possible (test realms help a lot in pre-updating of AddOns) and they want AddOns to be out there in numbers. They don't support AddOns, but they all they can to make them possible, they deserve a big thank you from all of us.\nHow do I....\nFix my UI when something breaks?\nI really fudged up my interface! How can I reset everything to the defaults?\nDelete the Cache\\WDB and WTF folders from your World of Warcraft directory, and rename the \"Interface\" folder to something else, e.g. \"Interface Backup\". Log back into the game. Your UI, keybindings, and chat settings should now be reset to the default settings. Log out and move your Interface folder back into your WoW directory. Now you should be able to log back into the game and reconfigure all of your AddOns, etc.\nI lost all my addon data! Is it possible to retrieve it somehow?\nUnless you've made a backup of all of your SavedVariables/\"AddOnName\".lua files, no, sorry, it's not.\nIf you *have* made a backup, you should be able to simply overwrite your current SavedVariables/\"AddOnName\".lua files with the old (backup) version.\nHowever, there's a tool that exists to make this process easier, AND it will allow you to MERGE (rather than overwrite) your new data with your old. That tool is called SVEdit, and it can be found here: http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=4047\nThere's also software (not free), such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.r-tt.com/\"&gt;R-Studio&lt;/a&gt;, that advanced users can use to recover deleted files. This will \"only\" recover deleted files, it will \"not\" undo changes in files and, no matter how much you pay for the software, it is \"not\" guaranteed to work.\nMy UI is all messed up. My bag slots don't line up properly with the bag themselves, how do I fix it?\nI dragged X thing off the screen, how do I get it back?\nI dragged X and dropped it on Y. Now Y is on top of X and I can't move either. What do I do?\nGo to your codice_5 folder and delete your codice_6 file. \nThat will reset all visible UI elements to the default Blizzard locations. A bit of a pain, as you'll have to set your layout back up the way you want, but at least your immediate problem will be fixed.\nI messed up my chat settings, I can't see X messages any more, my channels are all messed up. How do I fix it?\nGo to your codice_5 folder. Delete the codice_8 file. \nThat will reset all chat windows, channels &amp; chat options to the default Blizzard setup. You'll have to re-do any changes you made to layout and channels that you want to keep.\nBackups and copying settings.\nI want to copy my settings over from one account/computer to another. What is saved where?\nMacros for all characters:\nMacros for specific characters:\nVarious standard UI parameters:\nAddOn configuration:\nThe on-screen layout of visible UI elements:\nYour chat settings:\nYour key bindings:\nYour character specific keybindings:\nOther UI-related stuff.\nHow do I make it so I can see both my chat and my combat window at the same time?\nGo to the main in-game menu (hit [Esc] or the little computer icon). Go to Interface Options. Click \"Simple Chat\".\nHow do I make a new chat window?\nGo to the main in-game menu (hit [Esc] or the little computer icon). Go to Interface Options. Make sure \"Lock Chat Settings\" is turned off. Make sure \"Simple Chat\" is turned off. Go back to the main game window. Hover your mouse over your chat window. A tab will appear at the top of your window. Right click on it and select \"Create New Window\".\nFor more Chat Information and Troubleshooting, see &lt;a href=\"Chat\"&gt;Chat&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow do I connect to our guild's website in an addon (to get DKP info/access guild rosters/Thottbot/etc)?\nThe user interface Lua environment is \"sandboxed\" and it is not possible to get data in or out of the game in realtime while the game is playing. The only method of getting data in or out is through the SavedVariables/\"AddOnName\".lua files, which are only updated/read on logout/login or when the interface is reloaded. There is no way to directly access web site information from within the game. The best you can do is have a separate .exe file monitoring your SavedVariables files and watch for changes and act on them.\nHow do I extract information from WoW to an outside source? \nThis can't be done directly. For example, let us say you want to make an AddOn that updates your guild roster, and posts the name/lvl/class of each member on your web site. The only way to do this is to write an AddOn that will save the name/lvl/class of each guild member in a SavedVariables/\"AddOnName\".lua file, close WoW and extract the info to your guild web site either manually, or with a program which would do it for you.\nYou may not extract information about anything in the WoW environment by \"leeching\" the information that passes between you and the server. Or, rather, with a lot of work, it's possible to write a program that monitors network traffic, but that is against Blizzard's Terms of Service. We strongly suggest you do not do it."}

{"id": "42749", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=42749", "title": "UI FAQ/Macros and scripts", "text": "\"The UI FAQ is posted here on Wowpedia as well as on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html%3FforumId%3D11114%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;Blizzard's UI &amp; Macros Forum&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"WoWInterface\"&gt;WoWInterface.com&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Some of the texts will direct you to \"post followups\" and the like; this is referring to those two forums.\"\nWhat? (Definitions).\nNo, really. What the heck are macros and scripts? \nMacros.\nMacros are a list of commands designed to be executed in series.\nA macro can consist of any number of &lt;a href=\"Slash%20commands\"&gt;Slash commands&lt;/a&gt; or pure text to up 255 characters. With some exceptions, these commands behave exactly as if you had typed them into the chat window. Users wishing to use more advanced commands are recommended to see the Interface Customization and World of Warcraft API sections at wowpedia.org.\nScripts.\nUsually, not just in WoW, the term Script refers to a short to medium length program, written in some kind of simple programming language (called a scripting language). The purpose of a script is usually to control another program.\nWorld of Warcraft has a powerful programming language called &lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt; embedded inside it, which is used for scripting. What this means is that WoW is able to understand and execute little programs written in the Lua language. However, in WoW, a script is usually not something that you use by itself, i.e. you don't just type in a script and execute it (although this is also possible). Instead, there are several places in WoW where you have the option to enter scripts as part of something else.\nThe kind of places that you can use a script:\nSo what can a script do? There are many resources on Lua scripts (the main one being http://www.wowpedia.org); However, the most important point is that scripts are able to perform many more game actions than slash commands. This is done via a set of functions (called API or Application Programming Interface) that WoW makes available for use in scripts. There is a quite extensive list of all the API functions available for use in scripts at http://www.wowpedia.org\nNOTE: Scripts are now mainly reserved for UI, the allowable API used within the /script tag is greatly reduced. It is however still usable.\nIf you wish to create a macro to cast spells or use an item, refer to the &lt;a href=\"Most_Used_Macros%232.0_Macro_Guide\"&gt;2.0 Macro guide&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the new limitations on the \"/Script\" tag cover these actions. For miscellaneous actions such as switching weapons, playing music, or sending chat messages; scripts still work fine. --Digital Utopia 05:25 2 February 2007 (CST) \nWhere? (Where can I learn more about macros / scripting?).\nThe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html%3FforumId%3D11114%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;Blizzard UI &amp; Macros Forum&lt;/a&gt;, for one. Another great source of info is this site.\nAlso:\nHow? (How do I use?).\nGeneral.\nNOTE: Macro scripts cannot be used in combat anymore\nHow do I create a macro? \nIn a chat box, start by typing /macro. then click NEW, give it a name and an icon, and then start entering some commands.\nHow can I make a conditional macro? \nTo use conditionals, you'll need to invoke the LUA interpreter. To do that, you start a macro with \"/script\" Anything after /script will be run as lua code (or a 'chunk' as lua calls it). It is VERY important to keep all parts of a Lua chunk on ONE LINE in a macro, and make it fit within 255 characters.\nYou can then use the \"if ... then ... end\" codeblock to complete your macro. it should look similar to this when you're done:\nNOTE: As of 2.0.1 you may not use anymore conditional macros to initiate spellcasting, give orders to your pet or use an item.\n /script if UnitName(\"target\") == \"fred\" then SendChatMessage(\"Hi fred!\",\"WHISPER\",nil,\"fred\"); end\nNote the use of \"end\" at the end. It's important to Lua.\nWhen using Lua script code, do I need to end each line with a semicolon? \nLua doesn't require this, but you may do so if you like. It does make it easier to read, but Lua does have strict enough syntax that it can understand commands without semicolons. Even something as ugly as this is legal: /script a =5 b =6 Message(a..b)c= a +b\nHow do I output text to the chat window?\nUse codice_1, where msg is the text, and \"r,g,b\" are red,green,blue (0-1) and \"a\" is alpha (transparency; 0 for completely transparent, 1 for completely solid). The alpha parameter can be left out to mean \"completely solid\".\nThis is easier if you write a function that calls the above, :AddMessage(), function:\n function cprint(...)\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(...)\n end\nThen you can use cprint(\"foo\",1,0,0) multiple times in the macro without it taking quite so many characters.\nNOTE: As of 3.0, &lt;a href=\"API_print\"&gt;print&lt;/a&gt;() is now available.\nIs it possible to wait in a macro for a certain amount of time, then continue running the rest of the macro? \nNo, it is not possible. See the question regarding multiple abilities in one macro for a more detailed explanation of the sorts of things not being able to wait prevents you from doing.\nADDENDUM:\nIt is possible, if you have the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.cosmosui.org/addons.php%3Finfo%3DChronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; stand-alone library, the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/ace2.aspx\"&gt;AceEvent-2.0&lt;/a&gt; stand-alone library, or any addon that uses either of those installed, to do something like:\n /in 5 /say Hello,\n /say Fred!\nAnd in 5 seconds you will say \"Hello,\". But you will say \"Fred!\" right now. /in is not a macro pause command, it simply lets you queue up a single command to execute at a future time.\nHOWEVER, you cannot use /in to cast a spell, use an ability, or run a macro, due to the hardware event restriction. So, its usefulness is very limited. You can use it to talk, or to use items, but that's about it. Which is one reason I didn't mention it in the first place. Because 99% of the time people want a pause, its so they can cast another spell in the same macro, or switch inventory items and then use an ability, neither of which is possible using /in.\nWhy won't this macro / addon work? I'm almost positive my code is correct! \nFor macros: double- and even triple-check your syntax AND SPELLING. Remember that Lua is case-sensitive! Triple-check the names of any spells, as well. CastSpellByName(\"Curse of Shadows(Rank 2)\") is NOT the same as CastSpellByName(\"Curse of Shadow(Rank 2)\")\nFor AddOns: Follow the advice given in the \"For macros:\" section above. Remember that both Lua *and* XML are case-sensitive! codice_2 is NOT the same as codice_3. If your AddOn is listed in the [AddOns] list at character select, but doesn't seem to be loading in-game, check your XML, you likely have an error there somewhere.\nIf you've tried the above and STILL can't get your script to work: Make a NEW post in this forum asking for help. Please DO NOT clutter up this thread asking for help with your broken macros!\nHow do I register a /slash command? \nIn my UI AddOn, what do I need to do to create a new \"/slashcommand\" that the user can type into the chat box?\nSlash command information is stored in two places. The first is a global table named SlashCmdList. In order to add a new command, create a new function with one argument. That argument will contain whatever text the user typed after the name of your command.\nMyAddon = {};\nfunction MyAddon.SlashCommand(Argument)\nDoSomethingWith(Argument);\nend\nThen create a new entry in the table for your new slash command.\nSlashCmdList[\"My_AddOn_Slash_Command\"] = MyAddon.SlashCommand;\nThe second place slash command information is stored is in a haphazard series of global variables. These variables' names all start with \"SLASH_\", then the name of an entry in SlashCmdList, and end with a digit. The value of each variable is the text the user types to active the command. It's important to note that while the names of the variables are case-sensitive, the command the user types is case-insensitive (so \"/MASC\", \"/Masc\" and \"/masc\" all do the same thing.\nSLASH_My_AddOn_Slash_Command1 = \"/MASC\";\nSLASH_My_AddOn_Slash_Command2 = \"/MASlashCommand\";\nSLASH_My_AddOn_Slash_Command3 = \"/MyAddonSlashCommand\"; \nSpells, Abilities and Buffs.\nWhat is the best way to know the exact spelling of a spell to cast? \nOpen your spellbook along side your macro editor. Position the edit cursor in the macro window, and then hold down the SHIFT key while you LEFT click on a spell icon in your spellbook, and the game will type in the correct /cast spellname command for you. You can then cut/paste or edit it if needed.\nCan I make a conditional macro that does something if I have a certain buff? \nYou can't do that with such a macro since 2.0.1.\nIs it possible to use multiple abilities in one macro, such as cast Corruption, Curse of Agony, and then Shadowbolt? \nNo. The reason is that it is not possible to wait in a macro, but to cast one spell after another, you would have to cast the first one, wait for it to finish, then cast the other. Even instant spells activate a global cooldown timer of 1.5 second (or 1 second for rogues/warriors/druids in bear/cat form), and you cannot cast another spell until this timer is done. Even with the ability to wait in a macro, you wouldn't be able to cast multiple spells: an action from the user is required to start a spell cast (like a keypress or a mouse click, not at any other time - which is why \"do something, wait a bit, then cast XXX\" is impossible).\nIt is, however, possible to do multiple things that don't require waiting. You could, for example, cast a spell and turn on attack. Or use two items (as long as they had independent refresh timers).\nYou just can't do anything that would require waiting between action A and action B.\nNOTE: It is possible, however, since 2.0.1, to define a /castsequence macro which would allow you to cast a different spell on each button click. See 2.0 macro guide for more details.\nHow do I set up a macro or script to automatically cast XXX when... \nYou don't. There is no way to automatically cast any spell or ability. You can ONLY use spells and abilities in response to a hardware event (mouse button or keyboard press), and furthermore, it appears that the hardware event must trigger a normal action button or the spell will fail to cast. Furthermore, since 2.0.1, many cast/use/pet functions have been protected and cannot be used directly by AddOns and scripts.\nHow do you link multiple spells together in a single macro? \nSpells can be linked into one macro if the first one does not activate the global cooldown (such as Nature's Swiftness). To do so, simply put the two spells on two different lines. E.g.\n /cast Presence of Mind\n /cast Pyroblast(Rank 1)\nSee also the Addendum on chaining spells at the end of this FAQ.\n The above has been rewritten to match 2.0.1 new restrictions. \n The rest of the FAQ also needs to be updated. Everything below this message is still pre-2.0.1 documented.\nInteracting with the World.\nCan you help me write a macro that will automatically loot a corpse / automatically skin and loot a corpse / automatically pickpocket and loot?\nNo. There is no way to loot items except via mouse clicks.\nHow do I make a macro that jumps and spins 180 degrees?\nMovement related functions now require a hardware event to work so such a macro is no longer feasible. Even when it was, you could only turn at the same speed that the keyboard can turn you which is too slow to be usable in PvP. It is better to practice this maneuver using the mouse.\nThe default Blizzard UI has a camera function (Main Menu-&gt;Key Bindings-&gt;Camera Functions) called \"Flip Camera\" which rotates the camera (but not the character) 180 degrees.\nHow do I make a macro/addon that tells me the distance to my target?\nThe ability to obtain the exact distance between you and a non-friendly target was removed. At best, you can now only obtain a range (i.e.: Between 36 and 30 units) based on which abilities on your action bar are usable (&lt;a href=\"API%20IsActionInRange\"&gt;IsActionInRange(slot)&lt;/a&gt;). \nYou can get some more range information by using &lt;a href=\"API%20CheckInteractDistance\"&gt;CheckInteractDistance(unit, distanceType)&lt;/a&gt;\nCan I make a Macro that automatically picks up the WSG flag? \nThis is not possible. Any interaction with the 3d world (talking to NPCs, looting...) must be done via mouse click\nAddendum on chaining spells.\nDespite the popular (and usually correct) notion that you can only cast a single spell or use a single item per button press, it is possible to do so. However, what spells you can chain together is extremely limited. If you read nothing else in this post, at least read the Limitations section before posting questions.\nYou can only cast spells during a button press. You cannot have the macro wait for any period of time and then cast the spell. The limiting factor is cooldowns. Casting a spell (usually when you start to cast) usually activates a global cooldown. You can only chain together spells that could otherwise be cast together near-instantly. This means that the first spell must be instant, and it must not activate a cooldown that prevents the second spell from being used immediately.\nAll of you that are looking for a way to cast Frostbolt, followed by Arcane Missiles, followed by Frost Nova, followed by Blink, can just give up now. The first spell (or item) must be instant and incur neither the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; nor the next spell's (or item's) cooldown. You cannot code the macro to wait the global cooldown before proceeding to the next spell.\nThere are a few spells, usually a couple per class, that fit the rules for chaining spells. They're usually spells that affect the next casted spell, or abilities that affect the next used ability. This includes abilities such as Divine Favor, Nature's Swiftness, Presence of Mind, Heroic Strike, Raptor Strike. They have no casting time (instant) and they do not activate the global cooldown.\nThe script for doing it is relatively simple. Make a macro to cast the first spell that fits the above rules. After that, you can cast whatever you want that isn't on cooldown. For example:\n /cast Nature's Swiftness\n /cast Healing Wave\nThat gives you a single button press to cast an instant Healing Wave. Another example:\n /cast Presence of Mind\n /cast Pyroblast\nThat gives you an instant Pyroblast. Here's a nice one for Rogues with First Aid:\n /cast Gouge\n /use Netherweave Bandage\nSpell that are 'On next Attack', like Heroic Strike or Raptor Strike can also be chained in macros. Hunters should like this one:\n /cast Raptor Strike\n /cast Wing Clip\nThat's will do a Wing Clip immediately, and a Raptor Strike on the next attack (which might be immediately following the Wing Clip, if the weapon speed timer is up). Warriors could do the same thing with Heroic Strike and Hamstring, though that's quite a lot of rage to burn through in their case.\nMost items aren't hit by the global cooldown, which means that spells that activate the global cooldown, can still be chained with many items. Druids could make an emergency self heal that chained Rejuvenation with using a healing potion. I like to have my Lightning Shield up at all times, so I chain that before using my mount. Some trinkets can be used and immediately followed by casting spells (such as the fire trinket from the new lvl50 Mage quest).\nThis functionality is best used to enhance your existing play style, not totally change it. For example, a warrior (especially one who has the talents to reduce their bloodrage damage) could chain bloodrage before some/all attacks (Bloodrage+Execute would be useful), to make sure they're using it whenever possible. You could make sure you're making the most of your Elemental Mastery/Presence of Mind by attempting to cast it with every Chain Lightning/Pyroblast you cast. Explore the many possibilities!\nMany of these macros are best used in emergency situations, especially the NS+Heal ones. If you were to already have a spell casting when you hit the emergency heal button, it would begin casting the heal without NS. To get around this, if you have the room in the macro (macros can only be 255 characters long, remember), add a '/script SpellStopCasting()' line at the top of your macro. That will make it abort whatever spell you might already have been casting, and do the NS+Heal. Note that this doesn't just apply to NS+Heal; I use it for my EM+ChainLightning.\nPlease note that the examples here are just examples of how to chain spells together. In order to be very useful, some of them (ie the healing ones) will require some other addon or script to handle their targeting, so that your heal targets yourself if you don't have another friendly unit targeted, or automatically targets a certain party member, or whatever target you want.\nThough even more rarely useful, it is possible to chain more than just 2 spells/items. For example, we could enhance that druid emergency heal even further:\n /cast Nature's Swiftness\n /cast Healing Touch\n /use Major Healing Potion\nOne thing to note about this is that if you chain Nature's Swiftness or Presence of Mind together with a spell with a cast time, it won't work while moving, whereas it would if you casted them separately.\nThe reason for this is because the client doesn't know that Nature's Swiftness or PoM is up so therefore denies the spell from being cast. This is due to the time required to communicate with the server - even latency of 1ms would cause this issue. Your latency would have to be effectively 0 (in actuality somewhere in the nanosecond range, the exact latency would depend on how fast your computer would be able to process the macro) which is not possible. This is a limitation of current technology and I suspect that it will always be the case.\nThis functionality also doesn't work with form or stance switches, where the second spell is only available in the form or stance you are changing to. This is probably because the client has not been told by the server that the change really took place. For example, the following can be used to revert from any druid form, and start tracking herbs.\n /script local j,_,a;for i=1,GetNumShapeshiftForms() do _,_,a=GetShapeshiftFormInfo(i);j=a and i or j;end j=j and CastShapeshiftForm(j);\n /stopcasting\n /cast Find Herbs\nI really wanted a 'switch-back-to-caster-form-and-start-healing' macro, but it doesn't look like that's possible. If anyone has any way to get it to work, I'd love to know.\nVanish+(anything that requires Stealth) - this will never work unless you're in Stealth already when you vanish, since the client will deny use of abilities that require stealth until the server tells it you're in stealth.\nAny Seal+Judgement - this will fail unless you have an active Seal. This doesn't have to be the same seal as the one you are trying to Judge, any seal will do for the purposes of validating the Judgement spell in the client. However, there are no issues with Divine Favor+Holy Light macros.\nNope. Slouken has confirmed that this is an allowed practice. It doesn't get around cooldowns in any way. Have fun!"}

The relevant API is highlighted on this page.\nThe menu architecture.\nFrameXML provides a Frame template -- UIDropDownMenuTemplate -- that all menu or dropdown boxes should inherit from. Once a frame inheriting from UIDropDownMenuTemplate has been created, call UIDropDownMenu_Initialize to bind a menu function to it; the menu function will be responsible for creating the menu entries when the menu is open. The frame is used to store limited menu-related data, as well as a container for the dropdown list box if that menu style is used. Note that most of the usual frame-related methods may not work as expected on the dropdown menus, so additional API is provided to perform functions such as setting the selected entries, text, or adjusting dropdown box appearance.\nThe menus themselves are displayed using FrameXML-owned frames. Because of this, menu representations generally do not exist in memory unless the menu is open, and only one menu may be open at a time. The function provided to UIDropDownMenu_Initialize is used to create the required menu's entries when that menu is opened.\nTo implement a dropdown menu or list, one typically needs to create a frame inheriting from UIDropDownMenuTemplate, implement an initialization function to populate the menu when needed, and bind the initialization function to the frame using UIDropDownMenu_Initialize.\nGeneral API.\nInitialization functions.\nThe initFunction supplied to UIDropDownMenu_Initialize is called when the menu (as well as any nested menu levels) should be constructed, as well as as part of the UIDropDownMenu_Initialize call (this allows you to use the selection API to specify a selection immediately after binding the function to a menu frame should you so desire). The function is given three arguments:\nAdditionally, some &lt;a href=\"%23Global%20variables\"&gt;global variables&lt;/a&gt; may be useful to determine which entry's nested menu the initializer function is asked to supply.\nIt is expected that the initialization function will create any required menu entries using UIDropDownMenu_AddButton when called.\nSelection functions.\nTo use the _SetSelected* functions, your dropdown menu must be the currently open / currently being initialized.

{"id": "195735", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=195735", "title": "UI Scale", "text": "UI Scale is an option in the Main Menu, within \"Video Options\" under \"Resolution\", to adjust the &lt;a href=\"UI%20scaling\"&gt;UI scaling&lt;/a&gt; applied to most &lt;a href=\"widget\"&gt;widget&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"user%20interface\"&gt;user interface&lt;/a&gt;.\nA checkbox enables the feature, and a slider sets the custom value starting from a minimum range of codice_1.\ncodice_2 causes most widgets to scale as if the screen were 768 units tall. Disabling the checkbox allows the game chooses a default scale that between codice_1 and codice_4 for &lt;a href=\"Retail\"&gt;Retail&lt;/a&gt;, or between codice_5 and codice_4 for \"&lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTextures.\nTo demonstrate, assume an onscreen texture is 256x256 pixels. If the actual y-res matches the WoW y-res (e.g., 1024x768 = 768) then the texture appears as 256px (768/768 = 1*256 = 256). Increasing the resolution, so does our multiplier ([actual y/WoW y] = multiplier). Observe the following (all results are with the same 256x256 texture):\nPixel perfect UIs.\nAs a result of how WoW handles UI coordinates, having an improperly set UI scale may result in various glitches with interface addons. For instance, a one pixel wide border on a frame may have a varying width (ie. occasionally appear to be two pixels wide) depending on the frame's position and size.\nTo rectify this behaviour, you should set your UI scale so that your screen height matches with the UI coordinates. You can find out the correct UI scale from \"UIScale = 768 / verticalResolution\", and set it with the command \"/console UIScale [number]\".\nFor instance, if you play with a 1920x1080 resolution, the correct UI scale would be 768/1080 = 0.7111..., and you would set that by typing \"/run SetCVar(\"UIScale\", 0.7111111111)\" in the chat.\nNote that the above only works for screen resolutions up to 1200 vertical pixels (0.64 UI scale), as the setting won't go lower than 0.64. For screen resolutions above 1920x1200, you will have to use\n\"/run UIParent:SetScale(UIScale)\"\nwhere UIScale is the decimal number you got out of the equation above. Since this setting is not saved, you'll have to use an addon that rescales the UI every time the game loads (ie. after every loading screen). While writing such an addon is a trivial task, you can also &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info16878-UIScale.html\"&gt;download one&lt;/a&gt; if you can't be arsed to figure out how to write it yourself."}
{"id": "14327", "revid": "1965082", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14327", "title": "UI beginner's guide", "text": "This page explains some of the basic ideas behind and differences between things like macros, scripts, and addons for those who are new to using or making such things.\nSlash Comands.\n&lt;a href=\"Slash%20command\"&gt;Slash command&lt;/a&gt;s are simple commands you can type into the in-game chat window to perform some action. For example, typing \"/follow\" into the chat window (without the quotation marks) while you are targeting a friendly player will cause your character to follow that player. You can get a list of some of the available slash commands using the \"/help\" command.\nThere are several types of slash commands built into the game. Some make your character do things (like /cast and /follow) while others give you information or open UI panels (like /who or /raidinfo) and others are related to chatting (like /yell or /join). There are also emotes (like /laugh and /dance), and commands to run custom code (/run or /script).\nMacros.\n&lt;a href=\"Macro\"&gt;Macro&lt;/a&gt;s are basically ways to store slash commands and run them again on demand. A macro can contain just one command, or many commands, up to 255 total characters.\nYou can open the macro UI by typing \"/macro\" (without the quotes) into the chat window, or clicking on the speech bubble button next to the chat window and selecting \"Macro\", or by bringing up the main game menu (usually by pressing the Escape) key and clicking the \"Macro\" button. Each macro can have a name and an icon in addition to its contents. After creating a macro, you can drag it into your action bars and activate it by clicking on its icon.\nA simple example of a macro would be:\n /cast Fireball\n /say I am frying it!\nThis macro merely casts a Fireball, and then has your character tell everyone nearby that you're casting it.\nAnother example would be:\n /cast Feral Spirit\n /cast Ascendance\n /cast Berserking\n /use 17\nThis macro would be used by a Troll Enhancement Shaman to cast all of their personal DPS cooldows at once and use a trinket.\nAn example of a macro that can do different things based on which button you use to click on it:\n /cast [button:2] Frostbolt; Fireball\nThis macro will cast Frostbolt if you right-click it, or Fireball if you use any other button.\nMacros can be very useful, but also are subject to many restrictions to prevent automation. For example, you can't use a macro to cast more than one spell with a cast time or global cooldown at once. Adding a second \"/cast Fireball\" line to the first example macro above wouldn't make the macro cast Fireball twice. The second example macro can cast all 3 spells and use a trinket at once because only one of those actions (Feral Spirit) has a global cooldown, and none of them have a cast time.\nSee also &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1011693/\"&gt;The Blizzard World of Warcraft UI &amp; Macros Forum&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/874706/\"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Making%20a%20macro\"&gt;Making a macro&lt;/a&gt;.\nScripts.\nScripts are small computer programs that can manipulate objects that exist outside the script. Scripts are usually written in a \"scripting language\", which is designed so that users can quickly write these small programs in a flexible way. The World of Warcraft client embeds a powerful scripting language called &lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt;, and offers a wide array of functions (called an \"API\", or Application Programming Interface) for scripts to use to perform many actions beyond what are availble with simple slash commands.\nVery small scripts can be run directly from the chat window using the /run (or /script) command, or embedded in a macro. Here's an example:\n /run if UnitIsGroupLeader(\"player\") then SendChatMessage(\"I am the group leader!\", \"SAY\") end\nThis script is very simple. It checks whether you are currently the leader of a group, and if you are, sends a message to the /say channel informing everyone around you.\nHowever, scripts can also be much larger and more complex, performing many actions automatically, or adding new elements to the user interface. There is a quite extensive list of all the API functions available for use in scripts at &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20API\"&gt;World of Warcraft API&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike macros, scripts are subject to many restrictions to prevent automation. For example, a script can't automatically cast a Fireball when you target an enemy, or automatically dispel group members when they are affected by a debuff. These types of actions are classified as \"secure actions\" and can't be done without some action from the user, such as pressing a key or clicking a button. These restrictions are designed to prevent players from \"botting\" or having a script play their character for them.\nAddOns.\nThe World of Warcraft user interface is fully customizable, modifiable, and extendable. This is completely legal, and is encouraged by Blizzard. AddOns are also sometimes referred to as \"user interface modifications\", \"UI mods\", or just \"mods\" but all of those terms mean the same thing.\nAddons come in the form of a folder containing several files. They are installed by placing this folder, and all the files it contains, inside the World of Warcraft\\Interface\\AddOns folder. Addons can include several different types of files:\nAddons may also include text files with extensions like \".txt\" or \".md\" -- these files are not used by WoW at all, but are included to provide information about the addon to users (such as a README file, or a file describing the changes between versions) or to keep track of information by the addon's creator (such as a list of bugs that need to be fixed).\nA warning about executable files.\nAddons do not include executable files with extensions like \".exe\" or \".bat\" -- WoW cannot do anything with these files, and they have the potential to do bad things to your computer, like install viruses or delete all of your data. You should be very careful with any such files. Only run them if you absolutely trust their source. Examples of non-malicious uses for executable files related to addons include:\nAgain, you should be very cautious about running any executable programs. There are many websites that claim to offer addons or automatic updaters, but actually download malicious programs onto your computer that may attempt to steal your login information. Only download executable programs from websites you know and trust.\nWhere to get AddOns.\nThe two most popular addon websites are Curse and WoWInterface. These sites host thousands of addons written by hundreds of programmers. Some addon creators may also run their own websites with additional features like custom forums or image galleries.\nMost addons are single programs with a specific focus. For example, Recount is a popular addon that keeps track of how much damage and healing each member of your group has done, and displays that information as a list of bars on the screen. Bagnon is another popular addon that shows the contents of your bags all in one window. There are also addons that will automatically sell your gray items when you visit a vendor, alert you when your cooldowns finish, show you timer bars for boss encounters, keep track of auction prices over time, and do many, many other things.\nYou will also find many packages containing multiple addons. These are commonly called \"compilations\" or \"premade UIs\" and range from a bundle of helpful addons for raiding, to complete suites that replace the entire user interface. Some compilations are made of individual addons that can be run by themselves, while others are designed to work as a unified whole and can't be split up.\nAs a new addon user, it may be tempting to start with a full compliation, but be careful not to end up with dozens of addons you don't know how to use, or maybe don't need at all. You may be better off starting out with just a few individual addons, and getting comfortable with them before adding more.\nHow to make your own AddOns.\nMost of the addons you'll find on popular addon websites are written by regular users, not professional programmers. Lua is a very easy scripting language to learn, and there are lots of resources to help explain the WoW API.\nGood places here on Wowpedia to look for more information:"}
{"id": "70794", "revid": "40286632", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=70794", "title": "UI best practices", "text": "With the low barrier to entry, writing mods has become very popular. While this has greatly benefited the WoW community, it does have a dark side. There are idiosyncrasies in both the &lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua language&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20API\"&gt;World of Warcraft API&lt;/a&gt; that many authors overlook. This can lead to poorly written programs as measured by performance, memory usage, interference with other addons and the default UI, etc. The techniques gathering on this page will help help addon authors, experienced and otherwise, make the most out of WoW's environment safely and efficiently.\nGeneral Scripting.\nThese tips relate to Lua scripting in general. They are offered to help you write safer and more efficient code, and are applicable to non-WoW scripts as well.\nUse local variables.\nOne stumbling block for Lua programmers coming from other languages is the fact that all variables are global unless specified otherwise. Many times, the use of global variables is necessary: saved variables are created via the global environment; all API functions and UI frames are in the global namespace. However, globals come at a cost of both performance, and naming conflicts.\nGlobals are inefficient to access compared to locals. Whenever a global is accessed, Lua has to call the internal equivalent of getfenv() to figure out where to retrieve the global from. Local variables, on the other hand, are stored on a stack. In code where performance is important (for instance an &lt;a href=\"UIHANDLER%20OnUpdate\"&gt;OnUpdate handler&lt;/a&gt;), it's often beneficial to create a local alias to a global function:\n local Foo = Foo\n for i = 1, 10000 do\n Foo()\n end\nNaming conflicts are sometimes a more pressing concern. The effects are usually much more noticeable. If two addons define print functions that work in slightly different ways, one of the addons isn't going to be too happy when it tries to use its own. Another problem can be taint... If you accidentally use the name of some variable that blizzard code uses (e.g. arg1), you can introduce taint.\nThese problems are easily solved by declaring functions and variables local. There are other approaches as well, but this is by far the simplest.\nHook functions safely.\nSee also: \nYou should do your best to write your addon in such a way that you don't need to hook functions. Even when it is necessary, most of the time &lt;a href=\"API%20hooksecurefunc\"&gt;hooksecurefunc&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient. However, there are occasional cases where \"traditional\" hooking must be used. When you do, remember to pass all parameters and return all results. Example:\n local OrigFunc = Func\n Func = function(foo, bar, ...)\n DoStuff()\n local blah, baz, rofl = OrigFunc(foo, bar, ...)\n DoOtherStuff()\n return blah, baz, rofl\n end\nEven if the function only takes two parameters, you should always use the vararg (...). This will help future-proof your hook. If parameters are added to the function, your addon will safely ignore them while still passing them along.\nThere is actually a slight problem with the above example. If the number of return values from the function increases, your addon will likely cause erros. If you can call the original function as your last step, this is easy to deal with:\n return OrigFunc(foo, bar, ...)\nIf you need to do processing based on the return value, you'll need to create a table to store the results of the call:\n DoStuff()\n return unpack(ret)\nMake efficient use of conditionals.\nIf you have a series of if conditionals, test the most efficient ones first. For example:\n if Efficient() then\n DoStuff()\n elseif LessEfficient() then\n DoOtherStuff()\n elseif HorriblySlow() then\n DoSomething()\n else\n Cry()\n end\nThere are exceptions to this rule, though... If one of the less efficient conditions is more likely to be the case, you should test it first. This way, instead of running both the fast test and the slow test most of the time, it only runs the slow test. E.g.:\n if SlowButCommon() then\n DoStuff()\n elseif FastButRare() then\n DoOtherStuff()\n end\nShort-Circuiting.\nLua uses short-circuiting of conditionals. This means it only evaluates enough of the condition from left to right to know for certain whether it's true or false. In the case of \"or\", the whole condition is known to be true as soon as one operand is true. For \"and\", the whole condition is known to be false as soon as one operand is false. You can take advantage of this to add a bit of efficiency:\n if Fast() or Slow() then\n DoStuff()\n elseif LikelyToBeFalse() and LikelyToBeTrue() then\n DoStuff()\n elseif LikelyToBeTrue() or LikelyToBeFalse() then\n DoStuff()\n end\nOrder of Operations.\nLua, like many other programming languages, executes expressions from left to right starting from the innermost parenthesis to the outermost. This allows for un-nesting of IF blocks.\n -- This:\n if a and b then\n if c or d then\n DoStuff()\n end\n end\n -- Can be written as:\n -- As described in the previous section, if \"a\" or \"b\" are false, then DoStuff() will never execute\n -- If \"a\" and \"b\" are true and \"c\" or \"d\" are true, then DoStuff() will run.\n if a and b and (c or d) then -- same as \"a and ((b and c) or (b and d))\" (yes, the distributive property works here too)\n DoStuff()\n end\nNote: There are several programming languages that do not read left to right (eg. Joy, Factor, J and K, etc.). Others - like Haskell - can be used both ways. There are even languages that are multi-dimensional. While many of these are mainly academic, they are not esoteric languages made to be weird, but rather based on recent theories and ideas in computer science.\nLazy Coding.\nYou can utilize the Short-Circuiting functionality to make sure a variable has a value before comparing it to a literal:\n if foo[bar] == 5 then -- might throw \"attempting to index field ? a nil value\"\n DoStuff()\n end\n if foo and foo[bar] == 5 then -- will not throw an error\n DoStuff()\n end\nYou can also \"cheat\" if all you want to do is make sure a variable has a value other than nil or false:\n -- This:\n if foo then\n print(foo)\n elseif bar then\n print(bar)\n else\n print(\"nothing to print\")\n end\n -- Can be written as:\n print(foo or bar or \"nothing to print\")\nMinimize use of throw-away tables.\nTables in Lua, being powerful instrument, can cause your addon to pollute memory with unnecessary garbage if you're not careful, as tables are one of value types that are not reused automatically. It is better not to use repeatedly generated throw-away tables unless they provide far easier to read solution, faster code or if your task is impossible to handle without them at all. In some cases you can minimize garbage generation when using those as explained in .\nAPI &amp; XML.\nThis section applies specifically to the World of Warcraft UI environment.\nUse local event handler parameters.\nWith the introduction of WoW 2.0, &lt;a href=\"Widget%20Handlers\"&gt;widget event handlers&lt;/a&gt; now provide local parameters. As mentioned in &lt;a href=\"%23Use_local_variables\"&gt;a previous section&lt;/a&gt;, accessing local values is more efficient than accessing globals. Here are a few examples of the old way and how they should be implemented now:\nCode directly in XML.\nOld\n &lt;OnEvent&gt;\n if event == \"SOME_EVENT_NAME\" then\n this:Show()\n elseif event == \"SOME_OTHER_EVENT\" then\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"%s: %s\", arg1, arg2))\n end\n &lt;/OnEvent&gt;\nNew\n &lt;OnEvent&gt;\n if event == \"SOME_EVENT_NAME\" then\n self:Show()\n elseif event == \"SOME_OTHER_EVENT\" then\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"%s: %s\", ...))\n end\n &lt;/OnEvent&gt;\nNote: Lua code must be inserted inside event handlers or it will never run.\nXML calling Lua function.\nOld XML\n &lt;OnEvent&gt;\n MyEventHandler()\n &lt;/OnEvent&gt;\nOld Lua\n function MyEventHandler()\n if event == \"SOME_EVENT_NAME\" then\n this:Show()\n elseif event == \"SOME_OTHER_EVENT\" then\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"%s: %s\", arg1, arg2))\n end\n end\nNew XML\n &lt;OnEvent&gt;\n MyEventHandler(self, event, ...)\n &lt;/OnEvent&gt;\nNew Lua\n function MyEventHandler(frame, event, firstArg, secondArg)\n if event == \"SOME_EVENT_NAME\" then\n frame:Show()\n elseif event == \"SOME_OTHER_EVENT\" then\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"%s: %s\", firstArg, secondArg))\n end\n end\nEven Newer XML\n &lt;OnEvent function=\"MyEventHandler\" /&gt;\nThis has the advantage of resulting in a reference call, without an anonymous code block calling a global function.\nLua only.\nOld\n frame:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", function()\n if event == \"SOME_EVENT_NAME\" then\n this:Show()\n elseif event == \"SOME_OTHER_EVENT\" then\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"%s: %s\", arg1, arg2))\n end\n end)\nNew\n frame:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", function(frame, event, firstArg, secondArg)\n if event == \"SOME_EVENT_NAME\" then\n frame:Show()\n elseif event == \"SOME_OTHER_EVENT\" then\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"%s: %s\", firstArg, secondArg))\n end\n end)"}

{"id": "28876", "revid": "612753", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28876", "title": "UI scaling", "text": "Scaling shrinks or expands the &lt;a href=\"user%20interface\"&gt;user interface&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of pixels, lengths measure in scaled units equal to 1/768 of the screen height multiplied by a ratio.\nFor measuring a point on the screen, this ratio is codice_1. For measuring &lt;a href=\"widget\"&gt;widget&lt;/a&gt;s, this ratio is usually the UI Scale that is user-configurable in the &lt;a href=\"System\"&gt;System&lt;/a&gt; settings.\nScreen units.\nFunctions like () measure from the bottom-left corner (0, 0). The maximum visible Y coordinate is always 768, while the maximum visible X coordinate depends on aspect ratio:\nValues outside these ranges represent an overflow beyond the screen edges.\nRegion units.\n() resizes a Region, and also its children, children's children, and so on. If a child also has scale, the values multiply and the product is an \"effective scale\". Lengths measured about a Region use region units per the following formula:\n region:GetEffectiveScale() * screenHeight / 768\nRegion units apply to the following length measurements:\n&lt;a href=\"FrameXML\"&gt;FrameXML&lt;/a&gt; has functions to compare regions independent of their effective scale:\nUIParent.\nMost user interface elements are parented by codice_2 that covers the whole screen. Addons inserting widgets into the UI should consider making them children of UIParent (or within its heirarchy of children) to inherit a common scale.\nThe &lt;a href=\"System%20window\"&gt;System window&lt;/a&gt;, within \"Graphics\", presents a checkbox and slider corresponding to &lt;a href=\"console%20variables\"&gt;console variables&lt;/a&gt; and . Disabling this option causes UIParent to adopt a default scale per the table below:\nConversely, enabling the option allows the user to set a custom scale. Finer-grained scaling is possible with the command to set each console variable.\nPixel perfect UI.\nDue to rounding and snapping to pixels, visual oddities can appear when a borders or overlaps another. To eliminate these visual glitches, one strategy is to set a custom UIScale ratio so that one unit equals one pixel.\nFor screens up to a height of 1200px, this is possible by setting CVar to equal codice_3 where vRes is the vertical resolution.

It can be assumed that the shrine is located in a separate area from the section of Zul'Aman that appears in-game.\nThe name \"Ula-Tek\" could be a reversal of the name Cthulhu (oo-lah-tek/uh-luh-tc). Note that in the movie the god-creature the cultists summon is called Ullatec, with a similar reverse-pronunciation.\nSome speculate that Hethiss, &lt;a href=\"Dambala\"&gt;Dambala&lt;/a&gt;, and Ula-tek are variations of the same god.\nAnother possibility is that she is indeed an Old God. Her nomenclature is similar in style to C'Thun, Yogg-Saron and the Lovecraft characters they draw their naming style from. Given this, it's possible that Hakkar is her son, but there is very little to support this at all.\nIt's also speculated that the giant snake tail in Gundrak is Ula-tek's tail, however, there is no proof of this at all."}

Once his daughter &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla&lt;/a&gt; joined the meeting, Ulan asked her what she saw at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Legion. Ulan then asked Ebonhorn what he knew and why he had called the meeting. The spiritwalker revealed that he had seen a message left by the spirits deep within &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt;: that the Legion's fall would come at the hands of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; from outside Highmountain, empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; and aided by all the peoples of an undivided Highmountain. This caused outrage among Dargrul and the tauren chieftains, who said that the Hammer belonged to the people of Highmountain alone. Mayla asked Ebonhorn if he was certain, to which he replied that he was, and that the tauren and drogbar were bound by fate to aid the foreign champions. Ulan responded that the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; would obey the spirits, and Jale, Lasan and Torok begrudgingly said that their tribes would do so as well. In response, however, Dargrul claimed that he had also visited Neltharion's Vault but had seen nothing of outsiders \u2014 only that strength would drive back the Legion. Without warning, he leaped forward and grabbed the hammer while his hooded bodyguard called forth great spikes from the earth to imprison the lesser chieftains. Before the Underking could flee, Ulan confronted Dargrul, saying that the subterranean drogbar relied on the tauren for food. In response, Dargrul said that he would conquer all of Highmountain. He then used the hammer's power to instantly kill Ulan before fleeing.\nAs Mayla knelt before her father's body, the other chieftains said that they could not afford to spare any of their people to hunt down the Underking, before leaving Thunder Totem to see to their own lands. Mayla, now High Chieftain, remained behind and picked up her father's totem, telling herself that if the hammer was what was needed to reunite her people, then she would get it back.\nLegion.\nA &lt;a href=\"Note%20for%20Ulan\"&gt;memorial note for Ulan&lt;/a&gt;, written by Mayla, can be found at a shrine in &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, west of what was once the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, it was partially excavated by the dwarves from Ironforge, but has since fallen into the hands of the troggs and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt;, who find the place ideal to dig for earthly riches. It was previously a &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; facility.\nUldaman contains many artifacts for those willing to seek them out, primarily archaeologists and adventurers, who are slowly digging up this ruin of a titan-forged city. There are members of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;, but also of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;, equally eager to get their hands on ancient treasures.\nA level 60-70 wing of Uldaman, the was added in \"\".\nHistory.\nAfter a failed experiment that resulted in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; built a small subterranean vault named Uldaman, which was to act as a stasis chamber for the troggs. However, some of the troggs managed to escape and wandered the world.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; and Ironaya fled to Uldaman and expanded the site, carving new chambers to hold the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; and vowing to protect it. Years later, some of the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; that had followed the keeper and the giantess showed signs of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Archaedas heard their fears and agreed to place them in hibernation until a cure could be found, promising them to wake them in the future. As such, some earthen were sealed within Uldaman's vast vaults, while others decided, along with the &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt; followers, to stay awake, watch over Uldaman and maintain its machineries. Over the years, Archaedas and Ironaya would retreat into the lowest chambers of Uldaman to work on the cure for the curse of flesh, spending years in quiet contemplation. Eventually, the two would enter hibernation as well.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; tore the world, the active earthen felt the pain of the world. As a result, they tunneled deep within Uldaman and locked themselves away within the hibernation chambers with their sleeping brethren. Only the mechagnomes remained to watch over the facility, but they too eventually succumbed to the curse of the flesh, and a majority of them became fleshy beings known as &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s. They left Uldaman to the nearby mountains and caverns, leaving only a handful of mechagnomes in Uldaman. Even they eventually degraded and died out until only one remained. Although this lone mechagnome did her best to maintain Uldaman, much of the stronghold fell into disrepair. This mechagnome was eventually transformed into a gnome as well and grew old. When she neared death, the gnome worked her way to free the earthen hibernating deep within Uldaman, and she did so with her dying breath. The hibernation chambers soon stirred with life, but they were changed and known later as &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Just like gnomes years ago, the dwarves too left Uldaman for the nearby mountains.\nFor thousands of years, troggs slept in the deep reaches of the Uldaman fortress. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; delved into Uldaman to gather artifacts and knowledge. They inadvertently woke the troggs who, in turn, slaughtered most of the explorers. The survivors escaped back to Ironforge. Unbeknown to them, the troggs followed them through the ground, tunneling their way to Dun Morogh. As they neared Ironforge, noises from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; attracted their attention, and they invaded it. The initial &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; excavation team that discovered Uldaman counted &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Master%20Talonaxe\"&gt;Gryphon Master Talonaxe&lt;/a&gt;'s father among their ranks.\nYears later, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20clan\"&gt;Shadowforge clan&lt;/a&gt; made their way to Uldaman, seeking lost artifacts there, under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Infernus\"&gt;Ambassador Infernus&lt;/a&gt;. The League later returned to Uldaman to excavate it, but were once again driven away. Dwarves working on its digsites included individuals like &lt;a href=\"Sigrun%20Ironhew\"&gt;Sigrun Ironhew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammertoe%20Grez\"&gt;Hammertoe Grez&lt;/a&gt;, who was working with &lt;a href=\"Historian%20Karnik\"&gt;Historian Karnik&lt;/a&gt; on finding lost artifacts of the titan site. In their hurry, the dwarves abandoned many wagons and crates of supplies along the way.\nAs of the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", the League and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; took an interest In Uldaman. At some point, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s infiltrated the place and deactivated &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; has learned of a rumor on how to access Ironaya in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Khaz%27mul\"&gt;Chamber of Khaz'mul&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Prehistoria\"&gt;Staff of Prehistoria&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nUldaman is located in the northern part of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nUldaman is a famous dig site hiding ancient &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; relics and remnants. It has produced many important finds, and more undoubtedly wait within its depths. &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s entire population is eager to see what's down there. Unfortunately, the site is currently inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Stonevault\"&gt;Stonevault&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s who were buried for millennia inside the ruins. &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"prospector\"&gt;prospector&lt;/a&gt;s uncovered the ruins and inadvertently set the troggs loose upon &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe layout of Uldaman on the floor, and the use of a staff, created from a medallion and a shaft, to create a beam to show the opening to a hidden chamber, are most likely a reference to ; more specifically, to the map chamber that showed the way to the Well of Souls, where the was held in the film. Like in the film, which was buried under the sand in a sandstorm that lasted a whole year, Uldaman was buried beneath the earth (presumably due to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and is being excavated for its powerful contents. The &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"The%20Reliquary\"&gt;The Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; are likely representative of Indy and his cohorts, and the Dark Iron dwarf excavators are likely representing the Nazis, as they are the less savory group."}

Perfectly preserved in the snows of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, it was once thought to house fabled treasures and relics along with its great engines of creation, in reality, it was conceived first and foremost as a prison for the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. It notably encompasses the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Halls of Stone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Temple of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and the prison of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; were a section of Ulduar until &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; ripped, and stationed them in the misty heavens above &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficial Blizzard description.\n\"For millennia, Ulduar has remained undisturbed by mortals, far away from their concerns and their struggles. Yet since its recent discovery, many have wondered what the structure's original purpose may have been. Some thought it a city, built to herald the glory of its &lt;a href=\"maker\"&gt;maker&lt;/a&gt;s; some thought it a vault containing innumerable treasures, perhaps even relics of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s themselves. Such speculations were wrong. Beyond Ulduar's gates lies no city, no treasure vault, no final answer to the Titan's mysteries. All that awaits those who dare set foot in Ulduar is a horror even the Titans could not, would not destroy, an evil they merely... contained. \"\n\"Beneath ancient Ulduar, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; of death lies, whispering... Tread carefully, or its prison will become your tomb.\"\nSince discovering Ulduar in the Storm Peaks, adventurers had journeyed to the titan city to learn more about its mysterious past. Further exploration revealed that the magnificent complex included a prison, intended to permanently confine the Old God Yogg-Saron. This ancient horror had corrupted its guards, and was breaking through the last of its restraints.\nFaced with the peril of Yogg-Saron's imminent freedom, a band of mortals made preparations for a sweeping assault on the city. Overcoming the legions of iron minions and towering defenses at the city's entrance took tremendous strength, but even that great victory may not be enough to overcome the madness that dwells below.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragons&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s saw them worthy to be the protectors of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and wished to call upon the mighty &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s to bless them for that purpose. However, &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Designate and ruler of the keepers, resented this idea. He did not trust the proto-dragons and so he sought to create his own elite army, one of steadfast and valiant stature. He saw the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, children of the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, to be the most desirable candidate for his army. However, the other keepers did not concur with Odyn's aspirations and attempted to dissuade him from his plan. Odyn was unyielding to their request and continued with his scheme.\nWithin the halls of Ulduar, Odyn secured one of the sections to be the headquarters for his new army. He summoned the titan-forged sorceress and friend &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and with her power, she ripped the division of Ulduar and stationed it in the misty heavens above Azeroth. This would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, home of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, and where the greatest warriors of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; are called to serve Odyn as their eternal reward for being the worthiest.\nWhile Ulduar performed well his prison duty for Yogg-Saron, it did it incompletely, as his black blood runs through the whole continent, crystallizing into &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; and corrupting all it touches. His whispers even escaped with the saronite, tempting many to madness, including the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAfter thousands of years, Yogg-Saron's chains began to weaken, and the prisoner truly took control of the prison. Under his orders, Loken attacked the city, took its control from the resident &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, and created iron dwarves and iron vrykul in the Forge of Wills; these new creations drove the remaining earthen and mechagnomes from Ulduar, then went out into Northrend to spread destruction.\nThis came near the same time as the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; discovered the truth about the death of his wife &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, killed by his treacherous brother &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim brought war to Loken with the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s serving the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;. However, it turned out to have been an elaborate ruse perpetrated by Loken to lure him out of &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, where proximity to his &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;dark master&lt;/a&gt; granted him the power to overcome Thorim's attack. Thorim and his &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt;, were then captured and taken to Ulduar, so he could be driven mad by Yogg-Saron. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, with some help from &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, stopped Loken and defeated Yogg-Saron.\nFollowing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orik%20Trueheart\"&gt;Orik Trueheart&lt;/a&gt; spent his time around Ulduar learning about &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, as he was the only titan &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; who fought &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; during his betrayal. He also found a &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; saga describing a &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;powerful shield&lt;/a&gt; Tyr crafted for his &lt;a href=\"Yrgrim%20the%20Truthseeker\"&gt;vrykul champion&lt;/a&gt; to carry into battle.\nAt some point, the small &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; camps were replaced with a medium-sized camp named &lt;a href=\"Copperpot%20Camp\"&gt;Copperpot Camp&lt;/a&gt;, run by human &lt;a href=\"Chester%20Copperpot\"&gt;Chester Copperpot&lt;/a&gt; and guarded by &lt;a href=\"Copperpot%20Goon\"&gt;Copperpot Goon&lt;/a&gt;s, with a meeting stone located just nearby.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Ulduar was thought to have been cleansed of the corruption that previously infested it, with the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mechagnomes\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt; resuming command of the facility under the eyes of their &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watchers\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have also been integrated into Ulduar's defensive systems. During the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20King\"&gt;The Diamond King&lt;/a&gt;, it is implied that Ulduar was normally meant to have visitors, with Visitor Information Representatives available for inquiries and curators posted to report if an area was not enterable due to repairs or maintenance. Visitors were even asked to fill out a Visitor Satisfaction Survey before they left.\nDuring the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s broke into the facility intending to unearth information that would lead them to the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. To make matters worse, the whispers of the previously defeated Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; were heard once more throughout the halls, and groups of &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;N'raqi&lt;/a&gt; returned to Ulduar for an unknown purpose.\nThe Legion attacked Ulduar a second time to capture &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, and were fought off by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn unknown entity time-traveled to Ulduar in order to tamper with and artificially age the &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Prison%20Fragment\"&gt;titan locks&lt;/a&gt; holding &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; in place, releasing the Old God forty millennia early. &lt;a href=\"Vormu\"&gt;Vormu&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; came too late to stop this modification of the timeline.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Ulduar was still undergoing repairs. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; traveled here to recruit &lt;a href=\"Ignis%20the%20Furnace%20Master\"&gt;Ignis the Furnace Master&lt;/a&gt;, who had been revived by the Keepers, in order to help reforge the armor of &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that Ulduar was still being rebuilt since the attack of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s have returned, with freed &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; welcomed into their ranks. While Yogg-Saron was indeed defeated, both his corpse still imprisoned and his influence seems contained, his whispers, however, were still heard around &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and in the halls of Ulduar.\nIn the RPG.\nUlduar is located in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; and it is the &lt;a href=\"storm%20giant\"&gt;storm giant&lt;/a&gt;s' stronghold, however, they did not build it. It starts with the typical \"&lt;a href=\"Uld\"&gt;Uld&lt;/a&gt;\" in the name, and the architecture matches the design of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;temples&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and other ruins found elsewhere, so it can be assured Ulduar is a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; city. This place might be a treasure trove of information on the Titans and their activities, so &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; planned to send an expedition to inspect it properly. Ulduar is a mysterious subterranean realm of ice and stone.\nDescription.\nIt is a great place but you would never know it from outside as it is completely hidden. The exterior looks like the other peaks: a jumble of rock and ice cut at angles only nature would have produced. The entrance is well-hidden and heavily guarded by those &lt;a href=\"crystalline%20golem\"&gt;crystalline golem&lt;/a&gt;s, but it is possible to sneak inside if you are clever enough.\nInside, Ulduar is a profusion of tunnels, stairs and balconies. For its looks, the entire place was carved out of a massive cave, and many of the levels are natural ledges. It has that feel, as if nature was improved upon rather than replaced or recreated. The surfaces are a strange mix of smooth and unaltered stone and ice, as when a master sculptor works in stone and lets the material's natural texture add depth and beauty. It shows where the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; got their skill in stonework, but judging by Ulduar they are still a long way from matching their creators.\nHistory.\nLong ago the Titans lived in the Storm Peaks. They created Ulduar as their city, and from there they worked their experiments. The storm giants began here, and perhaps the dwarves and &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s as well. Then the Titans disappeared, leaving the races to survive on their own, so the storm giants decided to remain and claimed Ulduar as their own. There they developed crystalline golems to aid them in their research and to defend them. Over time the giants dwindled in number and grew ever more reclusive.\nAfter a great battle between the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragon\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s ended and &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; was transformed, the storm giants decided to investigate the newly crystallized region. There they discovered that the crystals contained strong &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of their own, and began mining the forest for their own purposes so they created crystalline golems to handle the actual work, and left these creatures to defend the forest and carry crystals back to Ulduar.\nThe giants themselves are so few in number you can wander the halls of Ulduar without ever meeting one \u2014 which is probably for the best, since no one is supposed to gain entrance. From what they say, the giants are a dying race desperately avoiding their fate. They seem to think another race will vanquish them some day, and so they hide here rather than girding for battle. When the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invaded Northrend, the storm giants, who might have been strong enough to stop him, hid away in the Storm Peaks and avoided all contact. They are too frightened to battle the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, though they do not like them.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}
