He understood the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s were not peaceful but energetic and not passive but adaptive. He accepted their various moods, knowing there wasn't much he could do about it. He meditated, patiently waiting for the elements to speak to him when they wanted. He was nearly blind, seeing only smudges of light and shadow beyond two arms' length, but his waning senses were not so crippling with the elements as his ally. He was assisted by several apprentices.\nWhen arrived to the Stones of Prophecy to verify &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s claims, Zhanak intended to turn the group away. While he showed warmth and respect towards Grom, he was harsh towards Garrosh due to the elemental spirits loathing his presence. Zhanak saw through Garrosh's lies and advised Grom to kill Garrosh before he could upset the fate of the world. Despite this, Grom wanted to see for himself if there was weakness within their people and correct it. Zhanak acquiesced, but insisted that Garrosh stay away from the Stones.\nGrom took the shard of the &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; to the spirits and they revealed the history of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the main universe. Zhanak was also able to see the vision and was horrified at what the future held for them. However, as he saw further, he wept with joy at how &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Death%20of%20Hellscream%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;sacrificed&lt;/a&gt; himself to redeem the orcs of the corruption, saving them all.\nNot wanting Grom to see this part of the vision, Garrosh suffocated Zhanak, assuring him that the ancestors would welcome him home. Garrosh then claimed that the vision had killed the old shaman to convince the guards to pull Grom out of the vision before he could see his redemption. "}

Why these energies have been focused into the cold will of a &lt;a href=\"celestial\"&gt;celestial&lt;/a&gt; dragon is a mystery that lies at the very heart of the vaults.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nStage One: Entering Defensive Mode.\nElegon activates the Energy Vortex, attacking with Celestial Breath and calling for Celestial Protectors to help defend the Engine of Nalak'sha. Stage One ends at 85% and 50% remaining health.\nStage Two: Primary Power Offline.\nElegon attempts to reactivate The Engine of Nalak'sha by creating Energy Charges to energize the Empyreal Focuses. If players destroy all Energy Charges in a wave, Elegon will continue to create more Energy Charges. The creation process permanently weakens his physical form. Stage Two ends once an Energy Charge leaves the Energy Vortex.\nStage Three: Power Draw Stable.\nElegon has reactivated The Engine of Nalak'sha, disabling the Energy Vortex and activating all Empyreal Focuses. Elegon is shielded from all damage. Stage Three ends once players destroy all the Empyreal Focuses.\nStrategy.\nElegon is a four-phase encounter, with phases 1, 2, and 3 being repeated in sequence twice before moving into the phase 4 soft-enrage burn. The boss chamber is arrayed in two sections, with the exterior ring made of stone and the interior disc, called the \"Energy Vortex\", being translucent and celestial in theme.\nPlayers standing on the interior disc gain the debuff Touch of the Titans, which increases damage done and healing received by 50%. Players also receive a stack of the debuff Overcharged every 5 seconds they remain in the interior disc, increases the damage they take by 5% per stack. Overcharged will continue stacking as long as the person remains in the interior disc, but is removed instantly upon exiting to the exterior ring.\nElegon requires two tanks and is generally 2-healed on 10-man difficulty.\nPhase 1 occurs as second time after the first phase 2 and 3. This phase 1 will last until Elegon reaches 50% HP.\nPhase 1.\nPhase 1 occurs at the start of the fight and lasts until the boss reaches 85% HP. During this phase, the ranged DPS should be stacked up near the edge of the disc, with one of the tanks and the melee DPS at the center. All players should periodically exit the disc to clear their stacks of Overcharged, but should otherwise remain on the disc for the damage done and healing taken buffs. Periodically Celestial Protectors will spawn. These should be picked up by the second tank and tanked near the edge of the disc, by the ranged DPS. Melee DPS are advised to peel off to DPS these Protectors (as it places them near the edge of the disc for stack clearing). It is advisable to keep at least 1-2 DPS on the boss full-time to ensure the phase progresses quickly. When the Protectors reach 20% HP, the tank should drag them off the disc to prevent them from casting Total Annihilation while buffed by Touch of the Titans. All DPS and healers should clear their stacks before Total Annihilation goes off, and the tank on Elegon should pop a cooldown to ensure they survive the explosion. \nAt this point, the tanks should swap, and the prior Elegon tanks should immediately clear their Overcharged stacks before picking up the next Protector that spawns.\nIt is recommended to push the boss over the 85% threshold into phase 2 during or right after a Total Annihilation cast but before the next Protector is spawned.\nPhase 2.\nDuring phase 2, Elegon will cast Draw Power, then summon six adds equally spaced around him. These adds will move directly outward from him toward the six pillars on the inside edge of the exterior ring. Should any of the adds reach a pillar, Elegon will transition into phase 3. Each wave of adds that Elegon spawns increases his damage taken by 10% for the remainder of the fight, but each wave of adds also moves 20% faster. DPS should be assigned to pillars (the raid world markers work quite well for this, mark five, leave one unmarked, assign to color). Their job is to kill the adds that are headed to their pillar, help any nearby if necessary, and otherwise DPS the boss as much as possible. It is possible to damage Elegon by 10-15% during this phase, if your DPS works hard.\nNote that Overcharged continues to stack during this phase, and every add killed AoEs the raid for fairly solid amounts of damage, so all raiders should remember to clear their stacks regularly during this phase (between add spawns is a good time). Tanks can either help DPS with the add spawns, or focus on DPS the boss. Healers can also get in DPS time on the adds or boss if their mana and raid healing permits.\nIdeally, 4-5 waves should be killed each time, resulting in 5-6 stacks of the debuff. The wave after the last one you choose to kill should be ignored, and DPS should focus on getting in as much damage as they can on the boss before they are forced to evacuate the inner disc for phase 3.\nPhase 3.\nPhase 3 begins when any add reaches an exterior pillar. When this occurs, all six pillars will raise and spawn energy walls between the pillar and the exterior wall, splitting the exterior ring into six segments. Moving through the wall will likely kill anyone attempting it. A few seconds after the phase starts, the interior disc will despawn and all players remaining on it will fall to their deaths (unresurrectable by any means short of a corpse-run). Players should evacuate the center platform before this occurs. The raid should be divided into two for this, with a healer, a tank, and three DPS on each side. Each DPS should end up near the pillar they were assigned to, ideally in one of the two segements between the upper or lower and center pillar on either side of the room. DPS are then responsible for killing their pillar, then helping kill other pillars nearby once done. Pillars will not actually \"die\" until both they and the pillar directly across the room from them (connected by a white energy line) have been reduced to 0 HP. The energy wall they spawn will persist until this occurs as well, restricting raid movement. Ideally, all six pillars should be killed as close to the same time as possible to reduce raid damage from the Unstable Energy ability Elegon uses.\nAll players should avoid standing in pools of lightning during this phase, as shortly after the pools spawn a bolt of lightning will hit them, dealing substantial damage to anyone still in the pool, and spawning a Cosmic Spark. These Sparks hit very hard and should be picked up by the tank ASAP. Once all pillars are down, the raid should group up and AoE down the adds, then resume phase 1 or 4 strategy. Tanks need to run in to Elegon \"immediately\" at the start of phase 1 or 4 to prevent Elegon from Grasping Energy Tendrils.\nOnce phase 3 ends the first time, Elegon will transition back into phase 1, lasting until he reaches 50% HP, then will repeat phases 2 and 3 again. After the second phase 3, Elegon will instead transition into phase 4 for the remainder of the fight.\nPhase 4.\nThe exterior ring will fill with energy (Energy Conduit), dealing lethal damage to anyone remaining in it. All players should run into the center of the interior disc, where they will remain for the rest of the fight. This phase works similarly to phase 1, except that Elegon no longer summons Celestial Protector adds, players cannot reset their Overcharged stacks, and Elegon will do regular AoE damage to the raid (increasing over time due to the increasing Overcharged stacks). If prior phases have been completed properly, Elegon should be at no more than 35-40% HP entering into this phase, and should have at least 10-12 stacks of Draw Power, doubling or more his damage taken. The raid should cluster up behind Elegon (he still uses his breath attack) for AoE healing, pop cooldowns and &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Hysteria\"&gt;Ancient Hysteria&lt;/a&gt; and nuke him as hard as possible. This phase is a soft-enrage dependent on killing Elegon before the raid damage exceeds the healing output of the healers.\nLFR.\nOn LFR setting, players do not receive the Overcharged debuff when in the interior disc, all damage effects deal less damage, and pillars need not be killed in linked pairs to actually die. During phase 1, players should still stack up for raid healing. Phase 2, as many waves of adds should be killed as possible, though LFR raids rarely manage to kill more than 1-2. During phase 3, kill the pillars and the adds that spawn. Phase 4 barely counts as a soft-enrage, as the AoE damage from Elegon does not increase over time (due to the lack of Overcharged stacking), and thus is simply a final burn.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

Elekks became sickly and corrupt as a result of Draenor's &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; corruption and subsequent transformation into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatient and strong, the elekk exemplify the draenei attitude towards the hardships of life.\nBackground.\nElekks are one of the oldest living species on Draenor. These majestic creatures graze contentedly across the grassy plains of Draenor, relying on their huge size and the support of the herd to keep predators at bay. &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; explorers have determined that the animals pose no threat, as long as their young aren't endangered or their water supply jeopardized. They have the endurance to cover great distances and the ability to defend themselves by ramming or stomping attackers. The elekk's long trunk allows it to sniff out sources of food, avoid danger, and steal snacks from people's bags when they're not looking. While it's not stated exactly how long they can live, a single elekk's life can apparently span several &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; generations. Elekk tusks continue to grow throughout the animal's lifetime, meaning that the best way of telling the age of an elekk is by the size of its tusks. It is said an elekk never forgets.\nSome legends say the draenei first befriended the elekk after one of the beasts saved an injured scout from a pack of vicious &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s. The draenei perfected elekk husbandry long ago, adorning the creatures with &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-infused crystals to make them more docile. The intelligence and caring nature of elekk calves make them a stalwart lifelong companion. When the draenei fled &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", they carried with them a number of species, including tamed elekk. Upon landing on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the tusked creatures played a large role in helping the draenei establish themselves on their new home. While much of Azeroth's own native wildlife has served other races as trustworthy mounts, the draenei still prefer the hearty and unyielding elekk above all else. The strong draft animals bore building materials needed to build new settlements and set down trade routes.\nOn Outland, wild elekk can be found mostly in the northern and eastern parts of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in the south near &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, where they congregate into large herds of hostile bull elekks led by the giant matriarch &lt;a href=\"Tusker\"&gt;Tusker&lt;/a&gt;, who is said to be the queen of all that dwell in Nagrand. The recent influx of different races to Outland, particularly the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, has resulted in increased hunting of Nagrand's elekk for their tusks, as elekk ivory is a highly sought-after prize. Uniquely aggressive and pugnacious elekk bulls are culled from the herd and sold to ethereal traders. The traders then train the bulls for combat and sell them to owners unconcerned about safety. The rare and elusive &lt;a href=\"Pint-Sized%20Pink%20Pachyderm\"&gt;pink elekks&lt;/a&gt; will only make their presence known to those that have befriended them, or to anyone too intoxicated to harm it. &lt;a href=\"%3AExodar%20Elekk\"&gt;:Exodar Elekk&lt;/a&gt; are elekk which have been anointed by &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; who journeyed from Draenor to Azeroth with &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and his followers. Never seen in Nagrand, the first &lt;a href=\"Great%20Red%20Elekk\"&gt;red elekk&lt;/a&gt; calves were born in Azeroth after the \"Exodar\"'s arrival. Some breeders theorize that the unique coloration is somehow caused by the same radiation which ravaged &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, having spent time on Draenor, introduced elekk to the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the , elekk herds roam the fields of and .

Players can be dismounted either manually (right-clicking the icon), by jumping into water, by entering a building/cave, or by attempting to travel across the bridge to the main part of Bloodmyst Isle. Certain buffs and spells, such as shaman weapon buffs, also dismount the player.\nAs a hunter pet.\nElekks are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt; family."}

Their spirit - made of volatile elemental energies - remain at the core. On &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, elementals were bound to the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; by the titanic &lt;a href=\"Keepers\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt;, which means that, when slain in the physical world, they will return to the Plane.\nKilling them in the Elemental Plane seems to be the way to permanently defeat them, after which their power can be absorbed by another elemental. Although they are imprisoned in the Elemental Plane, they can be summoned to Azeroth by those who seek to use their power. The most powerful ones reign over all others, and are called the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s. An elemental's core retains some semi-sentient properties after death.\nOrigins.\nIn the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;'s formation, shards of fractured &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; were sent through the universe. Upon hitting the planets they'd encounter, they would infuse them with the spark of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. The most common and primordial form of life to appear was the elementals, who now populate nearly every world of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;. The elementals are nourished by the &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; energy of the planet they live on.\nLife cycle.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s elementals are extremely violent and chaotic, because as its &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; developed, it consumed much of the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; energy of the planet, which nourishes the elements. In contrast, a large abundance of Spirit energy leads to slumbering elementals. &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s elementals were harmonious and worked together, indicating a fair level of Spirit. Spirit is also the force used by &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; to commune with the elements, while &lt;a href=\"Decay\"&gt;Decay&lt;/a&gt;, its opposite, is used by &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; to bind the elements to their will.\nIt is a natural part of the elementals' life cycle that impurities are accumulated in the elemental body over time. When enough contamination has taken place, an elemental becomes unstable and in some cases volatile. A necessary part to their rebirth is pure, living essence, which can be found in the body of other elementals.\nIt is possible that the elementals of Azeroth have developed some sort of hierarchy, many having titles such as Baron, Lord, and Duke. Some of the most powerful offspring of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lords\"&gt;Elemental Lords&lt;/a&gt; are also known as Princes and Princesses.\nHistory.\nPrimordial Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; became more and more erratic as the fifth element, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, became less available. The slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; consumed much of it, rendering the elements of Azeroth extremely violent, destructive and chaotic by nature. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20wars\"&gt;elemental wars&lt;/a&gt;, the elementals raged freely on primordial &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, waging war upon one another for endless millennia, and the four Elemental Lords reigned supreme over innumerable lesser spirits. &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; used to send his minions to spy on his enemies and sow distrust to weaken them. &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; embraced brute force, seeking to boil the seas, reduce mountains to slag, and choke the skies with ash. &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; was reclusive, entrenching herself behind towering mountain ranges before attacking her exhausted foes. &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; fought strategically, allowing the forces of the other elements to clash, before crushing his divided rivals.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s plummeted down from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, they slammed into Azeroth's surface and embedded themselves in the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time in history, the four Elemental Lords banded together in an attempt to fight the Old Gods' fledgling empire. Though the elementals were mighty, they could not stand against the constant swarm of &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, and they were enslaved by the Old Gods. Without the native spirits of Azeroth to counter the Old Gods' influence, the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; crept over much of the world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; armies of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; would eventually come to assault the Old Gods, defeat them and sealing them deep beneath the surface of the planet, after having imprisoned the elemental armies in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, divided into four regions: the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Sundering.\nEven while locked within the Elemental Plane, the Elemental Lords continued to war with each other. The &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sundering\"&gt;Elemental Sundering&lt;/a&gt; was a 5,000 year-long battle at the core of Azeroth. The Lieutenants of Ragnaros, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Geddon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt;, perpetrated the betrayal against &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Air, who was caught unaware. The Firelord's advances were wholly unknown to Thunderaan, and before he could react, &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary hammer of Ragnaros, struck an unmerciful blow, and Thunderaan fell, utterly defeated.\nThe Firelord feasted upon the essence of Thunderaan but was unable to consume him entirely. He stored what little remained of Thunderaan's essence within a talisman of elemental binding. Ragnaros then shattered the talisman in two flawless pieces, called the &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Bindings of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;, and assigned them to his lieutenants.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, 230 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Ragnaros the Firelord was summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. It was his intent to use the Firelord for domination of the other dwarf clans. Ironically, however, Ragnaros enslaved them for his own purposes. His violent entry into the world scarred the surrounding area, creating &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecent events.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Ragnaros and his fire elemental armies were locked in a war for control of Blackrock Moutain with the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeptulon, then at war with &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, seemed to use mostly mortal races to weaken the forces of the other three Elemental Lords. His agent, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;, sought to bring others to his side. He sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s into the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the Firelord. Another agent, &lt;a href=\"Tsunaman\"&gt;Tsunaman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, also sought to destroy Ragnaros's elementals in the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. \nCataclysm.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; entered Azeroth from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; was shattered, causing the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; to collapse onto Azeroth, and parts of it to manifest in the real world. While &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; accepted &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s offer of sowing destruction, &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; refused to do so.\nRagnaros's armies launched a full-scale assault on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to destroy the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; pushed his minions back into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, where he was slain.\nNeptulon the Tidehunter was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; that worked with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt;, while Therazane was also at odds with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; that had intruded in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAl'akir called the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Wind\"&gt;Conclave of Wind&lt;/a&gt;, ancient wind elementals nearly as powerful as Al'Akir himself, to aid in the elemental invasion of his former home. \nHe assisted Deathwing's efforts at reclaiming the ancient re-origination device and lent his elemental forces at crushing &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;'s native defenders and his old enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Tol%27vir\"&gt;Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;. One of his first acts after the Cataclysm was destroying the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Orsis\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt; in revenge for having refused Deathwing's offer of curing their &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. The armies and strongest minions of Al'Akir resided within the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, training in formation and torturing tol'vir as they prepared to lash out yet again at Uldum. At some point prior to his death, Al'Akir ensnared and twisted &lt;a href=\"Hagara%20the%20Stormbinder\"&gt;Hagara the Stormbinder&lt;/a&gt; with new powers for trying to bind elementals to her will.\nDwelling in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Throne of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, Al'Akir was slain in his home plane, the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; helped new elementals to replace Ragnaros and Al'Akir: &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; respectively. They then managed to convince the four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s to band together against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Shaman and elementals now work actively to fight the Legion off the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen the Dark Irons and the Alliance emissary worked to repair the Black Anvil in Shadowforge in the aftermath of a Venture Co. attack, they were required to take a &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20o%27%20the%20Molten%20Core\"&gt;Fragment of the Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; into the Firelands to re-energize. There, &lt;a href=\"Anvil-Thane%20Thurgaden\"&gt;Anvil-Thane Thurgaden&lt;/a&gt; and the emissary discovered the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Cult of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, a sect of Dark Iron Dwarves apparently led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Justice%20Grimstone\"&gt;High Justice Grimstone&lt;/a&gt; who were attempting to resurrect Ragnaros. Smolderon was worryingly absent during these events, a fact Thurgaden noted and to which Grimstone evasively answered \"All in due time\".\nIn World of Warcraft.\nIn \"World of Warcraft,\" elementals are often found close to environments representative of their elements: water elementals are often found on coastlines and in lakes, fire elementals are often found close to lava or areas which has suffered from fire, stone elementals are often found in hills and inside caves, and air elementals are often found in windy areas like steppes and deserts. Elementals will also often drop elemental items related to their element. A fire elemental may, for example, drop a &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Heart of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, while a water elemental may drop an &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Water\"&gt;Essence of Water&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecific elemental types.\nSome types of elementals have only been found in a single element.\n\"Elemental\" as a gameplay term.\nMany NPCs in World of Warcraft are classed as elementals for gameplay purposes, but may not actually be true elementals. They cannot be skinned, although the remains of earth elementals may sometimes &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mined&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;s can enchant weapons with &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Elemental%20Slayer\"&gt;Lesser Elemental Slayer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Slayer\"&gt;Elemental Slayer&lt;/a&gt;, which gives them bonus damage. All elementals can be &lt;a href=\"banish\"&gt;banish&lt;/a&gt;ed by &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nWhen the Old Gods were defeated and imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s, the Titans banished all elementals to the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. The Elemental Plane is a violent and dangerous place where elementals of one type battle with all others in a never-ending conflict to expand their territory. It is no wonder, then, that some elementals attempt to escape from the unceasing struggle by traveling to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where they establish solitary lairs in suitable environments. Such transplanted elementals find it difficult to shake off the warlike existence they lived on the Elemental Plane; they guard their new territory viciously and constantly seek to expand their boundaries.\nAll elementals speak &lt;a href=\"Kalimag\"&gt;Kalimag&lt;/a&gt; and, whether summoned to Azeroth or there of their own free will, wear a set of magic bracers. These bracers form automatically when the elemental leaves the Elemental Plane. They tie the elemental to Azeroth and allow it to exist outside of the Elemental Plane. If the magic of the bracer's is disrupted, usually by prolonged physical or magical attack, the elemental loses much of its power and may inadvertently return to the Elemental Plane.\nElemental Conglomerate.\n&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Conglomerate\"&gt;Elemental Conglomerate&lt;/a&gt;s are elementals that share two or more aspects of the basic elemental types."}

Despite that, the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider\"&gt;Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;s maintained a modicum of political power as the royal house. \nMembership.\nThe Convocation was comprised of seven of the greatest &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; lords. \n&lt;a href=\"Verath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Verath Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; served the council as adviser.\nHistory.\nThe Guardians of Tirisfal.\nOver 3,000 years ago the &lt;a href=\"Magocrats\"&gt;Magocrats&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; contacted the Council as demons started to appear in the streets of the magical city-state. After dispatching their mightiest wizards to the human lands to investigate, the Convocation's agents concluded that there were only a few &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s loose in the world; although, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; itself would remain a dire threat so long as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s continued to wield the forces of magic. \nThe elven lords entered into a secret pact with the &lt;a href=\"Magocrats\"&gt;Magocrat lords&lt;/a&gt;, revealing them the history of ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Both groups decided to found &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;an order&lt;/a&gt; that would fight a never-ending secret war against the invaders from the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nThe king and the Convocation convened to discuss the matter of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Azeroth during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Given how far the invaders were from Quel'Thalas, they were hesitant to dedicate themselves to the conflict, believing the orcs sought only to conquer human lands. Regardless, the presence of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; (last of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; bloodline) required homage from King Anasterian for the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; millennia before, and the king and the council authorized a token force to be sent to &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; confronted the council after returning from the south, hoping to convince them to mobilize the elves' full might. She met opposition from the Convocation, who claimed that the presence of &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; in the Horde's ranks meant the orcs may even lead the trolls away from Quel'Thalas, and that even if an invasion was to occur, the invaders would never be able to overcome the &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s. However, Alleria reported that the Amani had already mobilized and started attacking the elves, which provoked an angered reaction from Anasterian. The king ordered the high elf armies to be rallied and the Amani to be wiped out for good.\nThird War.\nMost of the Convocation remained on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt; (the great shield protecting &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;) was dispelled, Convocation member &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;, who was commanding Silvermoon's defense, immediately ordered the council to raise a barrier in its place, though word did not reach them in time: roughly half of the council had been individually murdered near the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; by the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; (who had long envied and despised the Convocation for their high place and, as he saw it, their refusal to share the power of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;), though the traitor noticed Belo'vir's absence. By murdering key members of the council who had the knowledge to stop him, Dar'Khan was able to hide what he had planned for the Sunwell, and bound its energies.\nThe rest of the Convocation, bent on unraveling the mystery of the bound Sunwell, remained at the plateau while Belo'vir led an army of &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; to combat the Scourge. The battle ended in disaster for the elves: King Anasterian, along with Belo'vir and a staggering 90% of their people, all fell to the Scourge's might. The surviving Convocation members were eventually driven away and wiped out by the Scourge, who proceeded to corrupt the Sunwell and raze the isle. \nThe council ceased to rule over the kingdom after its devastation at the hands of the Scourge, as the &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Sunstrider heir&lt;/a&gt; went on to become the sole leader of the Thalassian people; from then on, they would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nAn early &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; article stated that an \"unknown council\" based in Silvermoon was behind the recent revitalization of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;. No information has been given since, but it has been speculated that this may be a sort of reincarnation of the Convocation."}

She prepared breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the residents and guests of Medivh.\nCook was likely an old woman, wearing a set of rose-quartz lenses in order to avoid seeing the creepy manifestations and visions of magic inside the magus' tower. She first got the lenses the very next day after Moroes had broken a crystal dish that Medivh had asked for; she had previously hidden the plates because she had had a vision of Moroes breaking this very one piece of crystal, several months before. She did not want to see any more visions at all.\nCook and Moroes were both killed by their master. &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; was able to find Cook's red lenses smashed when she, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; searched Karazhan.

{"id": "12918", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12918", "title": "Cooking", "text": "Cooking is one of the &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Secondary%20professions\"&gt;secondary professions&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\". \nIt is a crafting profession which, as the name suggests, revolves around making &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;-type &lt;a href=\"consumable\"&gt;consumable&lt;/a&gt; items. Food made with Cooking grants the &lt;a href=\"Well%20Fed\"&gt;Well Fed&lt;/a&gt; buff which, depending on the food eaten, provides temporary &lt;a href=\"stat\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; buffs which typically last for 1 hour. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Clefthoof%20Sausages\"&gt;Clefthoof Sausages&lt;/a&gt; which boosts &lt;a href=\"Versatility\"&gt;Versatility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barracuda%20Mrglgagh\"&gt;Barracuda Mrglgagh&lt;/a&gt; which boosts &lt;a href=\"Mastery\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ravenberry%20Tarts\"&gt;Ravenberry Tarts&lt;/a&gt; which boosts &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly all foods, even the ones not made with Cooking, also grant increased health regeneration while eating. Cooking can also be used to make certain entertaining consumables like the famous &lt;a href=\"Savory%20Deviate%20Delight\"&gt;Savory Deviate Delight&lt;/a&gt; or \"feast\" items such as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Feast\"&gt;Great Feast&lt;/a&gt; which can be placed on the ground in order for several players to eat and benefit from it.\nThe base &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s for food is &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; though many foods also require &lt;a href=\"spice\"&gt;spice&lt;/a&gt;s, Cooking-specific ingredients such as &lt;a href=\"Juicycrunch%20Carrot\"&gt;Juicycrunch Carrot&lt;/a&gt;, or even other food items. In some cases eggs (such as &lt;a href=\"Small%20Egg\"&gt;Small Egg&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"alcohol\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s, or even more exotic ingredients are also used.\nHigh-level Well Fed buffs are powerful enough to make Cooking a popular profession. In particular &lt;a href=\"end-game\"&gt;end-game&lt;/a&gt; content often requires characters to have as good stats as possible to overcome various challenges, making Cooking foods a must.\nOfficial overview.\n\"Cooks experiment with strange and wondrous ingredients gathered from the far corners of Azeroth. A dedicated chef is able to turn mundane ingredients, recently caught fish or leftover animal meat into a delectable and nutritious meal. Ambitious cooks can even create massive feasts to sate the hunger of entire adventuring parties. Food made with cooking speeds health recovery, and some foods provide long-term buffs to heroes with full bellies.\n\"Cooking is a secondary profession - anyone can train to be a cook, no matter how many other professions they've devoted themselves to.\n\"Most cooking must be done over a heat source - either a cooking fire you've started yourself, or an open stove, campfire, etc.\n\"Though many cooking recipes utilize meat from animals you've slain in the wilderness (making cooking a convenient way to utilize your leftovers), the fishing profession also provides you with a great deal of stock to try out new recipes. The health benefits of Azerothian seafood are well-documented.\"\nSuggested classes.\nAll classes benefit from cooking: &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage dealers&lt;/a&gt; (DPS), &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healers&lt;/a&gt; alike. With the addition of the new recipes available in Outland, Northrend, and Cataclysm there is something for everyone!\nRequirements.\nCreating food usually requires three components: A recipe, ingredients, and heat. \nSummary of skill levels.\nAdvancement.\nCooking works just like any other crafting-profession; in order to advance your skill, you must constantly create dishes or higher levels by obtaining the recipes and ingredients. Whenever you create an item at a proper profession level, you may be guaranteed or have the chance of gaining a &lt;a href=\"skillup\"&gt;skill point&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe color of the recipe in your cooking window (menu) indicates whether you will gain a skill point in Cooking when you create the item. The color codes of all professions, including Cooking, are as follows:\nAll items in crafting-professions eventually end up being gray as your skill improves. Most begin as orange when you learn them, but some begin at yellow, green, or even gray (meaning the recipe cannot give you any skillups at all, such as &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Apple%20Cider\"&gt;Hot Apple Cider&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhen you gain enough Cooking skill points, you will need to visit a &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20trainers\"&gt;Cooking trainer&lt;/a&gt; to advance to the next &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Proficiency%20levels\"&gt;skill level&lt;/a&gt;. Notice that as with other crafting-professions, a higher skill level may be trained prior to \"finishing\" the one before it. For example, \"Journeyman\" may be obtained at skill 50 although \"Apprentice\" goes to 75.\nQuests.\nThe majority of cooking quests are &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;dailies&lt;/a&gt;. They, including other non-daily cooking quests, usually have in common that they somehow supply the player with cooking recipes. Other quests ask the player to cook something by using Cooking and some both. At higher skill (+375) it is necessary to complete several dailies in order to access more recipes.\nAchievements.\nLike other secondary professions, Cooking includes a number of &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s. Most of them focus on learning recipes, making food, and performing the daily cooking quests."}

Many of them are learned from &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20trainer\"&gt;Cooking trainer&lt;/a&gt;s, but the majority is learned by using recipe-items. As an item, a recipe may be obtained as a &lt;a href=\"reward\"&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt; for completing a &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20quest\"&gt;Cooking quest&lt;/a&gt;, found as &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"purchase\"&gt;purchase&lt;/a&gt;d from a &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;. It is usually named in the format of [Recipe: \"&lt;consumable&gt;\"], such as . Most cooking recipes use the picture of a scroll.\nNo cooking recipe is restricted to either the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but some are much easier to obtain for one of them than the other. This has several reasons - a recipe may be sold by a single faction-aligned NPC, rewarded from a faction-aligned quest, or perhaps dropped in in a &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; especially populated by a specific faction. Often, these recipes are available from a neutral &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs of &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Pilgrim's Bounty&lt;/a&gt; (2009), the total number of recipes actually in the game was 169. With the recent implements of \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", the number of recipes increased to 202 with the additional three new recipes from Cooking Trainers, two Feasts from guild achievements, and 28 from new Cooking Dailies. For new players, however, the number of obtainable recipes is slightly less; not only were the quests yielding &lt;a href=\"Iron_Chef%23Removed_recipes\"&gt;some recipes&lt;/a&gt; removed in 4.0.3a, some vendors selling recipes were also removed due to change to their location (some of these recipes returned in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.6\"&gt;4.0.6&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, turned out to be bugged and was removed shortly after the expansion launched to be worked on (it later returned in 4.0.6 as well).

Also, keep in mind that some recipes are only available during &lt;a href=\"Seasonal%23Seasonal%20events\"&gt;seasonal events&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2.0\"&gt;patch 4.2.0&lt;/a&gt; - which removed one recipe - it's possible to know 202 cooking recipes at most.

{"id": "14133", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14133", "title": "Cooldown", "text": "The term cooldown is defined as a period of wait time before a &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ability\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"power\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; can be used after a prior spell, ability, or item power. Often referred to by the pseudo-acronym \"CD\".\n'Cooldown' may refer to:\nShared cooldown.\nA shared cooldown is when some spell, item or ability prevents usage of certain others while it is cooling down. It effectively applies the same cooldown to all those that it shares a cooldown with. \nIt is important to know if a spell or item has a shared cooldown, since that is much more limiting than an isolated cooldown. This usually means that you must choose wisely which to use, since you cannot use all within a short time period. For instance, many potions share cooldowns with other potions; the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; abilities &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Strike\"&gt;Heroic Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt; share a cooldown; and so do &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA shared cooldown need not match the ability's individual cooldown; some powerful abilities with lengthy cooldowns also have a short shared cooldown with similar abilities, preventing a player from gaining several powerful effects at once.\n&lt;a href=\"Warrior%20stance\"&gt;Warrior stance&lt;/a&gt; changes also fall under the shared cooldown category. Switching stances as a warrior prevents switching to another stance for 1.5 seconds but does not prevent the user of other abilities.\nSome abilities do not have shared cooldowns, but still prevent players from using certain other abilities during their effect, such as to prevent players from combining excessively powerful buffs. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lay%20on%20Hands\"&gt;Lay on Hands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt; use the &lt;a href=\"forbearance\"&gt;forbearance&lt;/a&gt; debuff to prevent a player from receiving any of these effects within 1 minute of each other. However, they do not share a cooldown, and so can be used in short succession on three different targets.\nGlobal cooldown.\nThe global or universal cooldown, frequently shortened to \"GCD\", is the cooldown which starts every time you start to use a spell or ability, and affects all of your class spells and abilities. There are exceptions to this, however, as noted below.\nThe term 'global' is also often used to refer to a single global cooldown. In this way it serves as a basic unit of measurement for time and ability usage. It may take a certain number of globals to set up a rotation, to deal a certain amount of damage/healing, or to respond to an event. The phrase 'to global' (or 'to be globaled') refers to being killed extremely quickly, such as in the duration of only a single GCD.\nIf a spell has a casting time less than the global cooldown (or instant cast), you generally have to wait the remainder of the global cooldown. If a spell with &lt;a href=\"casting%20time\"&gt;casting time&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ed before it has finished casting, the global cooldown is canceled. This allows you to immediately begin casting a new spell, be it the same spell or another.\nThe base global cooldown is generally 1.5 seconds for all classes except &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, whose abilities mostly have one second global cooldowns. However, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//elitistjerks.com/f47/t15393-global_cooldown/\"&gt;since&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4.0\"&gt;patch 2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the global cooldown to a minimum of 0.75 seconds (1.0 seconds prior to &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;) for the spells that originated from 1.5 second cooldown. &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; doesn't affect GCD of agility energy melee classes like the ones mentioned before. A few specific abilities have global cooldowns as short as 0.5 seconds. The global cooldown affects the wait for the next ability, so using an item or ability with the standard 1.5 second cooldown will require waiting that long before a 1 second global cooldown ability can be used.\nSome abilities are not affected by the global cooldown, and do not trigger the global cooldown when used. This means that they can be used at times when other abilities cannot (such as immediately after using an instant ability), and can be followed immediately by another ability without delay. Such abilities are often referred to as being \"off the global cooldown\" or \"not affected by the GCD\". All such abilities are currently instant cast, allowing several to be used simultaneously, followed immediately by the use of another ability. Many of these abilities have the effect of augmenting the character in some way, and are often placed in &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s with other abilities, for speed and convenience.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a significant number of abilities which previously were not on the global cooldown have been added to it. Notably, the majority of DPS and healing cooldowns and movement abilities have been added to the global cooldown. Some but not all defensive abilities have also been added to the global cooldown.\nCooldown and usage theory.\nThe cooldown determines how often something (spell, ability, or item) may be used. Specifically, it has an inverse relationship to how many times per fight it may be used. \nHere's a rough guide to help with when to burn a cooldown:\nItem cooldowns.\n&lt;a href=\"Item\"&gt;Item&lt;/a&gt;s with cooldowns are simply items that have limit on how often you can use them.\nFor example &lt;a href=\"Major%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Major Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt; has a 2 minute cooldown, so it can be used just once every 2 minutes. The average cooldown is 2 or 5 minutes, but they range from 10 seconds to 3 hours (like &lt;a href=\"Signet%20of%20Expertise\"&gt;Signet of Expertise&lt;/a&gt;) to 3 days at the longest. These items can be equipped in a variety of slots or used from the backpack.\nMost consumable items have a shared cooldown, such as alcoholic beverages.\nThese items have a long cooldown (this isn't an exhaustive list):\nMost equippable items with \"Use\" effects have a 0 second global cooldown.\nInternal cooldowns.\nAn internal cooldown is the cooldown on several abilities usually found on items. It exists as a regulator to prevent specific chance-to-&lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt; abilities from being active at all times. One example is &lt;a href=\"Pendulum%20of%20Telluric%20Currents\"&gt;Pendulum of Telluric Currents&lt;/a&gt; which has a 10% chance to proc and a 45 internal cooldown. When it does proc, there will be 45 seconds before it can do so again. Internal cooldowns vary in duration, but the most common is 45 seconds as with the Pendulum of Telluric Currents.\nInternal cooldowns are often hard to perceive and measure. This is because the description of the item which holds the ability rarely tells if there is any cooldown on the ability, nor how long any possible cooldown is. As a result, internal cooldowns are often mentioned as \"hidden cooldowns\". Because of this, the cooldown of an item's ability is usually discovered via player testing in-game. It is important to know the internal cooldown of an item's ability since it highly affects how powerful the item is. One example is . It has a 35% chance to proc, a 15 second duration and a 45 second internal cooldown. If there were no cooldown, players would be able to refresh the duration via procs over and over, enjoying a nearly permanent effect from this item. Applying the cooldown will reduce the time the effect is active to 33% possible uptime (as 15 is 33% of 45), which in comparison reduces the item's performance by almost 70%.\nTradeskill cooldowns.\nSeveral professions have recipes with long cooldowns.

With Deathwing's departure, however, Corborus has broken loose and now rampages though the Stonecore in blind fury.\"\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nIn phase 1, Corborus will be on the surface. \nPositioning is not overly important, although ranged dps and the healer should not stack due to Crystal Barrage.\nWhen he casts Crystal Barrage, the affected player should move out of the crystals on the floor to avoid additional damage. Even though this can be healed through, with the limited mana of healers it is a good idea to avoid as much damage as possible.\nCorborus will also cast Dampening Wave which will cause damage and apply a stacking debuff to all players within 60 yards absorbing up to 4000 healing and can stack up to 20 times. This will need to be healed through or a single dispell will remove the effect.\nPhase 2.\nCorborus will burrow underground in phase 2, in this phase he will summon small adds which deal minor damage. These should be taken care of throughout the phase and have a rather small health pool.\nAs well as this, while burrowing, Corborus will cause clouds of dust on the ground. Players must stay out of these as he will periodically resurface and cause damage and a knockback to any players in the dust cloud.\nHe will resurface and go back to phase 1.\nHeroic Difficulty.\nIn phase 1 Corborus' Crystal Barrage will summon 8-10 &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Shard\"&gt;Crystal Shard&lt;/a&gt;s about 2 seconds after the effect finishes. These have 7.5k health and will move to the closest player. If they reach their target they will explode causing 20k damage and applying a debuff which increases damage taken by 25%.\nFor this reason, players should stay spread out. It is critical that the Crystal Shards are destroyed as soon as possible. At least one ranged DPS with good AOE should be prepared to focus all attention on the adds.\nPhase 2 stays the same for tactics, add damage is increased but if hit by the emerge from Corborus you will be killed instantly. Everyone needs to be very aware of the dust cloud's position, while also being sure to keep the adds off the healer and hopefully destroy them before Corborus re-emerges.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The next morning, she zoomed into the marketplace on her footcarts and into tinker history. Today, they are one of the first useful devices apprentices learn to make during their instruction.\nThough footcarts have become a simple and popular mode of &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; even among adults, they are rarely seen outside city walls.

They are the classic counterpart to &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s but despite their heavy armor they are weaker than them in \"Warcraft III\" (they do, however, cost much less). This may be explained by the fact that the footmen of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; are mostly volunteers lacking the plate armor and specialized training of their predecessors.\nFirst War.\nFootmen were the backbone of the &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt;'s armies.

However, many of the strong-hearted citizens of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; have volunteered to defend their lands as Footmen. Though these fierce warriors lack the shining plate mail and specialized training of their noble predecessors, they still fight with bravery and honor on the field of battle.\nInformation.\nFootmen are the basic melee units of human players. Generally, a player should train at least 3 or 4 footmen to help out a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Mage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blood Mage&lt;/a&gt; in creeping. &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain Kings&lt;/a&gt; can also appreciate the assistance but will generally work better with &lt;a href=\"Rifleman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Riflemen&lt;/a&gt; due to their skillset.\nThey aren't as powerful as &lt;a href=\"Grunt%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s, but make up for it with a cheaper cost. Don't continue to train Footmen when they are facing them or &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Huntresses&lt;/a&gt;, who can easily overwhelm them.\nFootmen may learn Defend. This protects them from Riflemen, &lt;a href=\"Archer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Fiend%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Crypt Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Headhunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s and creeps that use piercing attacks when it has been researched, who generally kill Footmen with ease if they aren't in defensive stance. Though it doesn't reflect damage inflicted by towers, it allows them to tank them better, although most players are unlikely to play defensively at the start of a match.\nFootmen should be replaced with &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt; as soon as they are accessible. In team matches most players will generally go for &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dragonhawk Riders&lt;/a&gt; once available.\nSpells and abilities.\nefend.\nDefend reduces 65% of all piercing damage. Defend only reduces Pierce damage, and thus it won't have any effect against any other style of attack. Shields can be raised and lowered as desired by the player.\nMany players tend to use ranged units early game, which deal piercing damage. Defend can teach them a lesson by allowing a Footman to tank more damage than they normally would.\nNever walk around the map with their shields raised, as it'll make them exceptionally slow and sitting ducks for other units. Only use Defend when facing piercing damage and a battle is about to start when the enemy has such damage.\nManual description.\nThe vast ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; armies have been replenished since the devastating battles of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second war&lt;/a&gt;.

It is illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Zoltan%20Boros\"&gt;Zoltan Boros&lt;/a&gt;. The story tells of some freshly risen or newly liberated &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; being inducted into &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; society in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nTwo Forsaken veterans, Conor Greystone and Bronwen Polaron, meet with six newly risen undead. Among them is Jeremiah Pall and a man named Abel.\nThey go around the circle asking for their names. To help them get used to their undeath, they ask each to tell how they got there, how they died, to help cope with their new fate and the trauma of their death. For most of the group, including Jeremiah, they had been drafted and forced into service. Abel, however, enlisted in order to be a hero like Captain Whitney.\nAbel recalls the story his father, Roland, told him, of Captain Whitney the Fearless Flyer, who launched himself on a catapult into an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; camp to lead a surprise attack. Jeremiah expresses familiarity with Whitney, and knows that it is a lie. Bronwen reveals that Whitney is also Forsaken, and so Jeremiah and Abel go to see him.\nWhitney, Jeremiah, and Abel sit together at the pub, toasting with empty mugs and mimicking drinking ale. Abel tells the story again, but Whitney interrupts to exaggerate more, to Jeremiah's increasing frustration. More people gather around them, many of whom Jeremiah recognizes as former comrades.\nJeremiah recalls the truth of that battle and his former commander. Whitney was ill-tempered and abusive, starving his soldiers, locking him in a dark box for days for insubordination, and Jeremiah suspected Whitney killed his friend who spoke out against him. Once Whitney leaves, Jeremiah tells Abel the truth: Whitney was drunk that night and got tangled in the ropes of the catapult, accidentally launched into the camp, many died trying to rescue him, and they found him hiding like a coward.\nJeremiah reveals that Abel's father confronted Whitney, threatening to expose him, and Whitney slit his throat. Abel doesn't believe him at first, until Jeremiah mentions his father always spoke of his son that built a toy boat.\nThey plan retaliation. They lure Whitney to a reconstructed catapult, and ask him to tell the story yet again. During the retelling, they tie him up in ropes. Abel convinces Jeremiah to give him a chance to tell the truth, but Whitney doubles down in his lies."}

Have at least five healers. Note that having a dedicated tank healer like a Holy Paladin is not necessary because the &lt;a href=\"faction%20leader\"&gt;faction leader&lt;/a&gt;s they will be tanking do not hit hard. AoE healers are a better choice, because enemy players will be a much greater threat than Horde NPCs. It is also a good idea to have one or two backup tanks in your group, so that in the case that the main tank gets killed by enemy players, another can resume tanking the leader. As said before, no faction leader is exceptionally tough. You can burn them down while in PvP gear, which, if you have any, should be worn as it will help you more against the real challenge here: enemy players.\nWarlocks are a great asset here, because aside from the fact that they are able to summon players who do not have the flight paths to your meeting place, their heavy DoTs ensure that faction leaders will continue taking damage even if your group's attention needs to shift to enemy players. Give priority to Warlocks who want to join your group.\nDeath to the Warchief!\nAll For the Alliance raids tend to begin with Orgrimmar. This is due to Orgrimmar being the most heavily populated Capital City. However, it is a bad idea to tell anyone where you are meeting or which city you are raiding first because if they are in fact an alt for a Horde player, they may alert the Horde to your group.\nWhere to meet?\nWith the reforged lands due to &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, flight points near Orgrimmar are hard to come by. Ratchet is a bad idea for a meeting place, because being sighted by even a single Horde player can alert them to your presence, but you may have no other options. The &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; may be safer, but is still a Horde-heavy area, and can be hard to remain undetected. &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; is unlikely to have any Horde presence, but is a long flight away. (&lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; will no longer be an option for the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;) In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; portal from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt; can offer a convenient path around to the front gate via &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The decision of where to meet should be decided on soon after forming the raid. Where to meet will be up for the raiders to decide. Have a Warlock or use a &lt;a href=\"Have%20Group%2C%20Will%20Travel\"&gt;Have Group, Will Travel&lt;/a&gt; to summon people who do not have a flight path.\nHave a rogue scout Orgrimmar and report whether Horde players are plentiful near the Valley of Strength and/or seem ready to defend Garrosh. In this case, someone in your group is the &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; of a Horde player, or you were seen recruiting by a Horde player's alt. Get ready to fight. Otherwise...\nJust GO!\nWith &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; being redesigned for Cataclysm, the quickest path to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%23Tactics\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; is through the front gates of the city. Unfortunately, this is the portion of the city that is most likely to have enemy players present. Other entrances are present, if you wish to fly in, but beware of flying guards and other players. Like most faction leaders, Garrosh himself is not exceptionally strong; raids should be more worried about Horde players coming to defend him. If your server is Horde heavy, then it is best to wait until a battle for &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; begins before attacking, because many Horde players who enjoy PvP will not be in Orgrimmar then to defend Garrosh. Once Garrosh is engaged, use all your DoTs on him, then spam AoEs.It might be a good idea to use some cooldowns if possible, because it is of the utmost importance to burn Garrosh's health. If the raid fails here it will probably fall apart, so use CDs if you can.\nOnce Garrosh is down, drop a &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Banner\"&gt;Stormwind Banner&lt;/a&gt; on his corpse if you feel like adding insult to injury, then RUN, as his respawn timer is, like Lor'themar Theron's, only 5-10 minutes!\nWhere next?\nIf many Horde players showed up to defend Orgrimmar, they may be on your tail now. Thunder Bluff is obviously the next logical step, but do not go there if you barely managed to down Garrosh because of defending players. Throw them off by going to either &lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Alliance%21%23Downing%20the%20Dark%20Lady\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Alliance%21%23Killed%20in%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; next. Otherwise...\nBleeding Bloodhoof.\nIf you skipped Thunder Bluff earlier to throw off defending Horde players, make your way to either &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt;, and fly to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. Pre-Cataclysm, Thunder Bluff was hard to navigate, and easy for Horde players to defend. But with the advent of &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master%27s%20License\"&gt;Flight Master's License&lt;/a&gt;, Thunder Bluff can be easily invaded from the sky, dropping straight into Baine's room. \nFor full strategy, see &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof%23Tactics\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaine Bloodhoof is in a longhouse at the other side of the High Rise. Tank him in a corner of his house, otherwise, his main ability (dropping aggro and charging at random raid members and knocking them back) will cause him to eventually run out too far and reset. The tank will lose aggro no matter what, so have your finger on your taunt keybind and keep it ready. A Death Knight tank is preferred here because they have two taunts on separate cooldowns, but any tanking class will do. So long as you prevent Baine from resetting, you will likely down him before significant resistance arrives, if any.\nWhere next? (2).\nIf you did not need to skip &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; after Orgrimmar, then your final two destinations are on another continent. Now is the time to &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;hearth&lt;/a&gt; and take a bio break. Once finished and ready to go again, the preferred meeting place is &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. If you do not have a Warlock, then the nearby &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; meeting stone can be used to summon those people.\nDowning the Dark Lady.\nThe Sewer Entrance is preferred because it is closer to Sylvanas than the Main Entrance. The Sewers are to the West of the Undercity and the path to Sylvanas is shown on the Undercity attack plan here. I have noticed that many people who do not know the way tend to get lost in the Undercity the most. Mark one person who knows the way, and tell the raid to follow him/her.\nSylvanas is a &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner%23tactics\"&gt;relatively simple fight&lt;/a&gt; so long as you take care of her most annoying ability: Invisibility, which lasts for a long time, and an aggro drop when she reappears. Casting &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Fire\"&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/a&gt; on her is enough to prevent this from happening for the entire fight. This is a useful macro for druids:\n /tar Lady\n /cast Faerie Fire\nAfter patch 4.0.3a, however, Sylvanas now pulls with the entire room. This means two tanks are a must: One for Sylvanas herself and one for the 2-3 Battlemaster's, Envoys, and Guards that pull with her.\nHave one druid enter at the same time as the Main Tank and use this macro on her to prevent this from happening. Other than this, it is a fairly simple tank and spank fight. The usual rules apply; enemy players are more important to kill than enemy NPCs.\nKilled in Quel'Thalas.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; is the closest flight path to Silvermoon for Alliance players, and Death Knights can shorten the time it takes for them to get there by using &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gate\"&gt;Death Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Use the meeting stone to summon people who do not have the flight path. It is a common mistake for players who have not been to Silvermoon city before to think that the entrance to the city is further west than it is (ie. through the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;). Direct players to &lt;a href=\"The%20Shepherd%27s%20Gate\"&gt;The Shepherd's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and have a leader who knows the way through the path shown here. From Zul'Aman, you have to use ground mounts as the game does NOT allow you to use flying mounts in the Ghostlands or the Eversong Woods.\n&lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron%23tactics\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; ought to be tanked on the far side of the room, to avoid healers and ranged DPS being hit with his &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; spell. Lor'themar also has a &lt;a href=\"Charm\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; spell, which means that PvP trinkets and/or &lt;a href=\"Will%20to%20Survive\"&gt;Will to Survive&lt;/a&gt; will need to be used. &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; provide extra obstacles for the raid, and each one should be tanked separately. Rommath will cast a &lt;a href=\"Flamestrike\"&gt;Flamestrike&lt;/a&gt; that will need to be moved out of, and Halduron will use &lt;a href=\"Multi-shot\"&gt;Multi-shot&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, Lor'themar is the main objective here for the Achievement. It MUST be kept in mind that the Respawn timer's for Lor'themar, Rommath, and Halduron is, unlike most city leaders, only 5-10 minutes.\nAs with the other cities, Horde players are the most dangerous obstacle that can hurt the raid. While Silvermoon has a low population, the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Translocation\"&gt;Orb of Translocation&lt;/a&gt; in the Undercity will lead Horde defenders right into the throne room. Keep an eye out for them, and work fast.\nThe Letter From King Varian Wrynn.\nYou will receive a letter from &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Black%20War%20Bear\"&gt;Reins of the Black War Bear&lt;/a&gt; attached:"}

While in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" most if not all of the leaders could be two or three-manned (in some cases even one-manned), this is no longer a viable option. Indeed, with Mists of Pandaria now here, the racial leaders now last a lot longer than their previous incarnations with an average of 523M health each and hit far harder.\n\"For the Horde!\" involves doing battle with &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;.\nForming the raid.\nFirst, the raid's composition must be understood. A standard comp of 2-3 tanks and 5-6 healers are recommended with the remainder being DPS. For &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, depending on server population, at least a 25 man raid group with 2+ and 6+ healers (possibly more) is required; ideally a 40 man group for higher-population servers. Unlike the NPC's in the other cities, the primary difficulty for Stormwind is Alliance player input, and they are very likely to focus fire your tanks and healers.\nThough still a &lt;a href=\"pug\"&gt;pug&lt;/a&gt;gable achievement, with luck, it is highly recommended that it is attempted by at least a fair few reliable players - chances of success will naturally increase largely if attempted by a &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; group.\nKill order.\nWhile not set in stone, there are two generally employed kill orders.\nThe first is the easiet city to the hardest - &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and finally &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second is the opposite, killing the most well-defended leaders first and then moving on. This kill order is Varian in Stormwind City, the Council of Three Hammers in Ironforge, Tyrande in Darnassus, and Velen in the Exodar.\nEach tactic has its advantages, though it is generally considered a good plan to hit Stormwind first. If Varian can be swiftly killed, then even if the raid disbands later in the attack, the hardest achievement will still be done.\nGetting there.\nThere are several methods to reach the Alliance cities. With the removal of the &lt;a href=\"Have%20Group%2C%20Will%20Travel\"&gt;Have Group, Will Travel&lt;/a&gt; guild ability in Mists of Pandaria, the raid should fly to each city on mounts, and select a designated meeting point near the city to be attacked. &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"summoning%20stone\"&gt;summoning stone&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to summon in the stragglers.\nAfter the raid has assembled, they should fly into the city together. Make sure to mark a leader who knows their way around!\nTactics.\nEach leader has their own abilities and a standard tactic for dealing with them.\nProphet Velen.\nThe encounter with Velen is generally considered the easiest of the faction leaders, and the virtually non-existent player traffic within the Exodar leaves room for pre planning. It is often the first city to be attacked during a \"For the Horde!\" raid, due to its simplicity.\nThe raid should group up at the stairs, and to play it safe, pull Velen's two battlemasters before him. With them down, the raid can freely focus on Velen.\nVelen pulls with his battlemasters, though if disposed of beforehand will only be protected by his Shield of Velen elite guards. One tank is enough to hold him in such a case. However, the Battlemaster's run on a 5-10 minute respawn timer, so quick dps is required to avoid facing them again.\nVelen's abilities are not particularly potent, even after the step up to Cataclysm level difficulty. His shield is easily broken, and his infrequent use of [Holy Nova] can be easily healed through. His Holy Smite ability will be randomly cast on a raid member. For the most part, the encounter is a good example of tank and spank, and the extremely low chance of an Alliance defense raid allows breathing space.\nTyrande Whisperwind.\nDarnassus has several entrances, and can be entered through the usual portal or by ascending Teldrassil via &lt;a href=\"flying%20mount\"&gt;flying mount&lt;/a&gt;. Rush straight for the temple, and deal with the large guard spawns before approaching Tyrande's balcony. With the raid in place, it is a good idea to look out for any &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players who may interrupt the battle.\nAt first glance, the battle with Tyrande can seem intimidating, due the presence of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; by her side. However, Malfurion does not engage &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players, and will therefore not interfere with the fight against Tyrande. There are no elite guards or &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s, so only one tank is needed. However, she does pull with her companion &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt; who will constantly cast a moonfire AOE type of ability on the raid. Hold Tyrande with the tank's back against the wall opposite the balcony.\nTyrande's major ability is her channelled &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt;. It is a powerful technique, and the small amount of space allocated for the fight leaves many members of the raid susceptible to it, most notably melee. However, the ability costs mana, and Tyrande can be drained of it relatively quickly via &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; abilities. Tyrande will use a searing arrow on a random party member, and a &lt;a href=\"moonfire\"&gt;moonfire&lt;/a&gt;, though again, only with mana. If drained completely, she will rely on her far weaker melee abilities, and the fight's difficulty will drop considerably.\nThe Council of Three Hammers.\nNow the main ruling body of the Dwarves, the Council of Three Hammers serve as the faction leaders for Ironforge. The battle with Muradin, Moira and Falstad is somewhat comparable to the battle with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, in terms of the triple boss fight mechanics. Two tanks are recommended, one to hold Muradin and one to hold Moira and Falstad. All three should be tanked within their throne room. It should also be noted that there are NOT any \"Royal Guards\" within the High Seat.\nThe two major threats to the raid are Muradin, who boasts the highest amount of health of the three, and whether or not there is relatively high player traffic in Ironforge. Without player interference, the quickest strategy is to first focus on Moira. She will use priest abilities, though their potency can be easily ignored if she is given the raid's full attention. Once she is down, the raid should focus on Falstad. Falstad will make use of various Wildhammer &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; abilities, and hits far harder than Moira. Without Moira's healing he should go down fairly quickly. \nFinally, Muradin should be dealt with. Like &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; before him, Muradin has both the Avatar and AoE pushback abilities, in addition to a storm bolt. With the other two dead and with low enemy player input, Muradin will follow suit and the raid will have done its job.\nDespite being three leaders, their 523 million HP is split between them.\nVarian Wrynn.\nKing Varian is perhaps the hardest city leader to kill. The relocation of Stormwind Keep and the change of Stormwind's geography make getting to Varian undetected nearly impossible. Additionally, Varian\u2019s elite guard are spread all the way along the path to the king, ranging as far as the steps of the keep itself. A fast kill is vital as Stormwind is highly populated during most hours and Alliance players may come to the aid of their King.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; accompanies Varian, further complicating the battle. Genn won\u2019t attack for the first two to three seconds after aggro as he changes into worgen form. Genn should be tanked separately from Varian and kept away from the rest of the raid due to his Intimidating Roar. For his other abilities refer to Genn\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;main article&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarian retains his previous abilities of Heroic Leap and Whirlwind as well as continuously spawning guards. In total King Varian and Genn Greymane have the largest total health of all the racial leaders (almost 800 million), however the biggest threat in this fight is definitely the Alliance playerbase, success can rely almost entirely on how many respond to your raid's attack.\nEscape.\nAfter each leader bites the dust, a quick mage portal is advisable. \nVictory!\nWith that, regardless of who went down first and last, the Alliance should now have each of their leaders on a two hour respawn timer and with the last victim's corpse fresh on the floor. Perhaps hurl an &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Banner\"&gt;Orgrimmar Banner&lt;/a&gt; into it and relish in the taste of victory. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; will be most pleased with the puny Alliance leaders licking their wounds, and will send you a present along with words of congratulations.\nLok'tar!

But in the aftermath of a terrible battle, the island has lain dormant and abandoned for ages until the return of an ancient enemy causes the dracthyr to stir.\nThe zone is the &lt;a href=\"starting%20zone\"&gt;starting zone&lt;/a&gt; of the new playable race-&lt;a href=\"hero%20class\"&gt;hero class&lt;/a&gt; combo dracthyr &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt; starting at level 58.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"patch%2010.0.7\"&gt;patch 10.0.7&lt;/a&gt; when the zone was re-opened, when a player visited the Forbidden Reach outside of the evoker starting experience by flying from the mainland Dragon Isles, they were struck by lightning until they died.\nDescription.\nThe Forbidden Reach was once fashioned by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion the Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt; himself to be the secret training grounds of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and of its &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr\"&gt;would-be ultimate soldiers&lt;/a&gt;. The Reach has since descended into a broken and deserted landscape, lost to the ravages of time. Those few dragons who remember the island know that it is taboo to visit, as it is a place where something dreadful fell. Those who have braved the shores found little of consequence in this cauldron-like caldera apart from a shattered landscape and nature-claimed ruins half buried by magma.

C'Thun created the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and resides within the city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is an unfathomably evil entity whose pervasive power has suffused Azeroth since time immemorial. In recent years, C'Thun freed itself. Champions of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; chose not to wait for the Old God to build up its strength. They invaded the city-kingdom of Ahn'Qiraj, fighting countless qiraji and silithid before finally confronting and defeating the malevolent god. Even so, it is unknown whether Azeroth has truly seen the last of C'Thun.\nIt appears in \"World of Warcraft\" as the final encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, implemented in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.9\"&gt;patch 1.9&lt;/a&gt;. \nC'Thun served as one of the main antagonists of classic \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nBefore the ordering of Azeroth.\nCountless millennia ago, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, C'Thun among them, arrived on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. There, with the help of their &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;i spawn, they established their mighty &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; and enslaved the chaotic &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, who had previously been the world's only inhabitants.\nOne day, the godlike &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s happened upon Azeroth. Vowing to cleanse the planet of the Old Gods and saving its &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; from the eldritch beings' malign influence, the titans crafted the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; from the planet's crust to destroy the Black Empire. The titan-forged succeeded in imprisoning the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and defeating most of the aqir, but after the titans saw the catastrophic effect that the Old God &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;'s death had on the planet, they ordered their creations to imprison the remaining Old Gods rather than killing them. After containing &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, the titan-forged launched their campaign upon the temple-city of C'Thun, purging swams of n'raqi before successfully imprisoning the Old God itself.\nAfter the defeat of the Old Gods, the titan-forged set to work ordering Azeroth. After installing the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, the titan-forged &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt; servants marched northwest towards C'Thun's prison, laboring to expand the prison into the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of the Shifting Sands.\nFor millennia, C'Thun lay dormant within its prison. Roughly 16,000 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, the race known as the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s accidentally reawakened the insectoid aqir, who had escaped underground during the destruction of the Black Empire. Led by the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;, the aqir launched a great war against the trolls, but the trolls were able to drive the insectoids back to the far corners of the &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;. One group of aqir fled southwest and overran Ahn'Qiraj, enslaving its anubisath guardians with the intention of using the giants against their foes, but nevertheless, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; trolls were sucessful in containing the insectoids within the fortress for the rest of the war. The aqir would remain inside the prison complex's walls for millennia afterwards, and over time, the influence of C'Thun transformed them into a new race: the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;.\nThousands of years later, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; accidentally awakened the dormant qiraji upon entering Ahn'Qiraj. C'Thun stirred within its prison and became aware of the insectoids that had gathered around it. The Old God drove the qiraji and their &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; minions into a murderous frenzy, and shortly thereafter the insectoids swarmed out across &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. So began the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The whole of Silithus was soon engulfed by the silithid and their qiraji hosts. The night elf army, led by the pompous &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, was pushed back through &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, to the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; desert. Fandral sought the aid of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; who resided in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, and who at the time were led by &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;. Anachronos initially hesitated to bring the bronze dragons into the war, but when the qiraji attacked the Caverns of Time itself, Anachronos agreed to ally with the kaldorei forces. Realizing that even the combined forces of the night elves and the bronze flight couldn't stop the onslaught of the qiraji, Anachronos called out to the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; of the blue flight was the first to notice the strange emanations radiating from the monolothic temple in the southern quadrant of Ahn'Qiraj, a strange power completely different from anything radiated by the qiraji. Seeing the endless numbers of the silithid and qiraji constantly growing within the walls of Ahn'Qiraj and sensing the presence of the qiraji's master, the dragons knew that they had to react quickly. The &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; was erected to create an impenetrable magical barrier and contain the insectoid threat. The war ended, and C'Thun's plans had failed.\nReawakening.\nCenturies later, the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; reopened, and the qiraji once again threatened all of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors circulated that C'Thun was present with its great, horrifying lidless eye, surrounded by a sea of tentacles, and would vaporize every ignorant mortal who thought of daring to challenge its supreme power and right to the world of Azeroth. Since the Old God has foreseen the arrival of the dragons, it cast a spell that would place them firmly under his control should they come any closer to him. While it expected dragons at his doorstep, it was not prepared for mortal &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. The mortal champions managed to fight their way through Ahn'Qiraj, and finally reached C'Thun's chamber. There, the adventurers did what was thought to be impossible and defeated the Old God itself. After C'Thun's defeat, &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20C%27Thun\"&gt;its eye&lt;/a&gt; was brought to the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttempted return.\nYears later, while the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; launched massive attacks on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 distracting &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; attempted to free his new master, the Old God C'Thun, from its prison beneath the earth. C'Thun empowered the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;, deforming his body which became monstrous. However, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; used the power of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; to collapse the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj on top of Cho'gall, stopping the ritual.\nEven so, it is unknown whether Azeroth has truly seen the last of C'Thun. Following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; declared that Azeroth was made free of the grasp of the Old Gods, suggesting that a future return of C'Thun is unlikely. \nComposition.\nThe C'Thun &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;encounter&lt;/a&gt; is actually a composition of different NPCs:\nQuotes.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, players can periodically hear the whisperings of C'Thun:\nIn Hearthstone.\nC'Thun appears as in the &lt;a href=\"Whispers%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;Whispers of the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". C'Thun could be considered the expansion's \"main character\"; the card is rather unique in that it is accompanied by a total of that synergize with the Old God in various ways.

{"id": "231004", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=231004", "title": "C'Thun (tactics)", "text": "C'Thun (pronounced \"Kah-Thoon\" or \"Kuh-THOON\") is the final boss in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. Until the release of the original &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and later \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", C'Thun was considered the most difficult raid boss in the game.\nAbilities.\nC'Thun is a two phase encounter focused primarily on proper positioning and unpredictable add control. \nPhase One.\nPhase one initiates upon entering C'Thun's room, and lasts until the Eye of C'Thun is killed.\nPhase Two.\nAfter killing the Eye of C'Thun, the body of C'Thun rises from the ground to begin the second stage.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nThe initial phase of the C'thun encounter, characterized by an alternation between the Eye shooting Eye Beams for 50 seconds followed by 35 seconds of Dark Glare (detailed below) as well as periodic spawning of and .\nWhen first entering C'Thun's chamber, the best strategy is to shield a player with high nature resist and have him enter the room ahead of the rest of the raid. This will cause the first few eye beams (described below) to hit the player with high nature resist, giving the rest of the raid a chance to get into position. A hunter is the ideal candidate for this, with their +60 Nature Resist from their aura and their ability to feign death and then put on normal gear. If the raid enters the room at the same time it is likely that a large portion will die from a chained eye beam.\nEye of C'Thun casts one every 3 seconds for 2625 - 3375 Nature damage. If other players are standing nearby (within roughly 10 yards) the beam will instantly chain to them and their nearby allies, dealing 1.5x the damage it dealt to its previous target per jump, making the effect lethal past three jumps. Eye Beam is capable of striking all 40 players at once, so spreading out is key. A mod that approximates your distance with other raid members is recommended. The initial target is completely random, and the eye will roll around to face its target while casting. Eye Beam can be resisted, up to 100%, though Nature resistance armor is not encouraged. Nature protection potions can be used to help mitigate the damage taken.\nAt the start of the \"red phase\" of phase one, the Eye of C'Thun will turn toward a new target, rapidly darken to a deep red color, and a shadowy cloud will appear in its pupil indicating the beam preparing to fire. Dark Glare appears as three large stacked red beams, and extends radially out from the Eye, inflicting 43,750 - 56,250 Shadow damage to any player struck by the beams. The Eye will slowly rotate while channeling this attack, clockwise or counterclockwise 180 degrees. It is possible to blink through it. Dark Glare pierces through the small pillars in the room and cannot be los'd. Though Dark Glare can be partially resisted, even resisting 75% of its damage will still result in a minimum of 10,938 damage taken.\nEvery 45 seconds, eight small eye tentacles will spawn at the edge of the black expanse radiating from C'Thun, equally spaced in a circle around it, and inflicting a damaging knockback to anyone standing within 10 yards of their spawn points. These tentacles are level 60 with 2,289 health, and randomly target players with a strong &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; spell that snares the target and deals 750 damage a second for 10 seconds. As Mind Flay is a binary spell, its damage cannot be partially resisted and must be interrupted. Eye tentacles are susceptible to many cc abilities such as disorients, interrupts, and stuns. \nClaw tentacles spawn under random players with alarming frequency during phase one, varying in their location due to the necessity to keep raid members spread. These tentacles are level 60 and have 1,526 health. While their melee is fairly weak (approximately 200 damage per hit), they are capable of causing high raid damage via their rupture should players be even loosely stacked near a spawn. Both their &lt;a href=\"hamstring\"&gt;hamstring&lt;/a&gt; attack and ground rupture make them deadly during dark glare, specifically as an unlucky spawn can knock players into the glare they are fleeing. \nPhase 2.\nBegins upon killing the Eye of C'Thun. If no tentacle is alive, players are very briefly taken out of combat and are encouraged to drink during this minor transition. During this phase, C'Thun is empowered with the Carapace of C'Thun, which reduces all damage taken by 99%. In order to bring this shield down, players must weaken C'Thun.\nEye tentacles continue to spawn as in phase one, but with a reduced spawn timer set to 30 seconds (instead of 45). It remains key to cover the area around C'Thun each time eye tentacles spawn. Again, assigning small teams on each Eye Tentacle spawn is helpful, but players must stand out of range of their ground eruption to avoid getting knocked back.\nOnce every minute, with a 30-second offset from Giant Eye Tentacle spawns, C'Thun will summon a Giant Claw Tentacle at a random player's feet, and knocking back all nearby players for high nature damage. These tentacles are level 60 with 91,560 health, and should have a dedicated tank assigned to them due to their high melee damage. Additionally, they also have a Thrash ability (two extra attacks), giving them the potential to one-shot non-tank players. If no one is in melee range, they will burrow and re-emerge on a new target at full health, repeating the Ground Rupture attack. It is imperative that these are defeated before another one spawns in order to reduce the chance that this happens.\nOnce every minute, with a 30-second offset from Giant Claw Tentacle spawns, C'Thun will summon a Giant Eye Tentacle. They do the same Ground Rupture when they appear, and also melee just as hard. They repeatedly cast the same Eye Beam ability the Eye of C'Thun uses in phase one, but they can be stunlocked. They are level 60 with 36,624 health and, again, there appears to be no cap on the number of tentacles that can be spawned simultaneously. As with their small version, they are susceptible to crowd control such as disorients and stuns. As the raid is more closely packed together to bring down both small and giant tentacles, they are far more vulnerable to Eye Beam in this phase. Therefore, stun-locking and killing Giant Eye Tentacles is a priority.\nThe stomach of C'Thun is an entirely separate room that cannot be reached by normal means. Every 10 seconds, an untargetable tentacle will emerge and devour a random person in the raid, pacifying the player being devoured. When devoured, you fall from the top of the new room into a pool of stomach acid, and are struck with an aura called Digestive Acid that deals 150 damage every 5 seconds. This aura reapplies itself every 5 seconds, and stacks indefinitely; after 20 seconds of being inside the stomach, you will have 5 stacks. \nYou can swim out of the stomach acid to one of three small landmasses. One of the landmasses has a dark circle on it which projects you out of C'Thun and back to the surface; you can use this to exit at any time. Note that if you don't position yourself at the center, you will be bounced against a wall and killed. \nThere are two Flesh Tentacles in the stomach which are level 60 with 24,416 HP each and have no abilities other than a melee attack. These Flesh Tentacles must both be killed in order to weaken C'Thun and remove its carapace. When this happens, a raid-wide emote will go out indicating that C'Thun has been weakened, causing it to turn purple and become vulnerable to damage for 45 seconds. At the end of this phase, C'Thun regains its carapace and both Flesh Tentacles respawn in his stomach.\nAdditionally, during the weakened phase, C'Thun will not spawn any tentacles. Your raid should aim to synchronize the death of the Flesh Tentacles in the stomach with the death of all tentacles on the surface, in order to focus all damage on C'Thun. 10 seconds after the weakened phase ends, C'Thun spawns a Giant Claw Tentacle. \nQuotes.\nSound scripts.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Kalimdor%20instance%20sounds%23.C2.A0C.27Thun\"&gt;Sound Files of Kalimdor: C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The &lt;a href=\"Farm%20Chicken%20Egg\"&gt;Farm Chicken Egg&lt;/a&gt;s persist for at least several minutes. You won't derive any particular benefit from extra , but you might do this on behalf of others.\nThe chicken that spawns the &lt;a href=\"Farm%20Chicken%20Egg\"&gt;Farm Chicken Egg&lt;/a&gt; remains under the egg while the egg is spawned, and does not roam. Looting the egg, causing it to disappear, frees the chicken. If the chicken is killed while it is under the egg, the egg will fade out and disappear, but it can take several seconds. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Special%20Chicken%20Feed\"&gt;Special Chicken Feed&lt;/a&gt; is a food item that you can eat, and it counts towards &lt;a href=\"Tastes%20Like%20Chicken\"&gt;Tastes Like Chicken&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players are able to receive the emote, but the quest is not offered as it has been added for Horde players in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMacro.\nA macro is strongly recommended for completing this quest in a short amount of time. Creating the above-described macro with 255 lines of /chicken or /flap is the most effective and often allows only doing the macro once before it procs. However, for some users this creates an error or lag which will disconnect them or they will miss the opportunity to accept the quest.\nThis macro will do the chicken emote 50 times:"}

On &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, their domain on the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; is known as the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt; where they led by &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; the Tidehunter, while another group of water elementals serves one of the Abyssal Maw's creators, &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, in the desolate realm of &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;. Not all water elementals are minions of the elemental lords and princes, some are minions of the elemental spirits of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrdering of Azeroth.\nTo keep &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; safe from these threats, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s imprisoned the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s underground and banished the savage &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to the titan-constructed &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, a secure dominion where the elementals could dwell without harming Azeroth. Four domains were created within this primordial realm to serve as ideal environments for each type of elemental. One of the Elemental Plane's domains, a vast ocean known as the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;, is home to the water elementals. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony.\nFirst War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; classifies this spell under Conjuration, the study of magically creating creatures and objects. This art was born when a few daring wizards attempted to summon water without remembering the glass. Water elementals are a wizard's best friend. A summoned elemental is a formidable ally in combat, a great listener, and they even taste great!\n\"The caster uses the forces of nature to create a &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;. He summons the forces of air and water and combines them into a simulacrum to defend the lands. They are excellent creatures, and will never turn upon their creators. The element of water was chosen because it is persistent as in the state of erosion, and it is the opposite of fire, which seems to be the element that the Orcs favor.\"\n\"These creatures are made of the magical essence of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Once created, they are loyal servants, and will unerringly do the bidding of their masters. Should they escape the control of their master, they become free creatures to do as they will. They are excellent fighters and will defend those whom they serve to the death.\"\n\"These are creations of &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally found in the service of their &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Conjurers&lt;/a&gt;, these simulacrums have the powers of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; to use as they will. When found uncontrolled, they prove to be difficult to disperse, as they gain some semblance of independent thought and motivation. In either case, these &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s will attack until they are destroyed or their foe is dead.\"\nThe Third War.\n\"By use of &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Water%20Elemental\"&gt;this spell&lt;/a&gt; an Archmage can summon and control a powerful elemental composed of water and air vapors. These creatures, capable of hurling torrents of rock-solid water at their enemies, cannot remain in the physical world for long. Thus, after a short length of time, they will vanish and return to their base liquid forms.\"\n\"These mindless, hulking forms of water can take massive punishment from enemy units while delivering tremendous blows in return. Water elementals were a favorite tool of the Conjurors of Azeroth during the First War, and now the enchanted creatures have come to aid the defenders of freedom once again.\"\nThe water elementals served their masters well during the Third War, defending and later avenging Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. The most notable of these Elementals was the one summoned by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who seemed to have an almost developed personality and acted as a more permanent bodyguard. Countless Undead were felled in Lordaeron by this elemental, and it had a fair share of demon-bashing at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, facing the likes of &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the destruction of Dalaran, &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20Elemental\"&gt;enraged&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berserk%20Elemental\"&gt;berserk&lt;/a&gt; elementals were roaming the ruins of the city, indicating they turned loose after the deaths of their masters.\nIn the aftermath of the Third War, the Grand Wizards of Kul Tiras who arrived with Admiral Proudmoore's force in Kalimdor summoned water elementals in Proudmoore's ill-begotten quest to destroy Durotar. After the Admiral's death, the Grand Wizards either returned to Kul Tiras or remained to serve Jaina.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s death, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; made sure that the involvement of the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s with the Dark Irons was known to the world. In response, the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt; recruited scores of powerful adventurers of the Horde and Alliance to enter the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; and defeat his army and the Firelord himself. Ragnaros and his elementals were banished back into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Tribunal of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Tsunaman\"&gt;Tsunaman&lt;/a&gt; to wage war against the fire elementals in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nA force of elemental scouts was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; of that place twisted and infected them.\nSeveral wizards have chosen to follow the refreshing path of conjuration. Captain &lt;a href=\"Balinda%20Stonehearth\"&gt;Balinda Stonehearth&lt;/a&gt; is a fine example of a mage who has chosen to adapt conjuration magic for battle. Perhaps the most famous conjuror is &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt; who is noted for &lt;a href=\"Shade_of_Aran%23Water_Elementals\"&gt;being able to summon several elementals at once&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the stresses on the land from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the deaths of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, the wall between worlds weakened and water elementals flooded the &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Sotra%20Fields\"&gt;Drak'Sotra Fields&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. The Drakkari &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s attempted to send &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Water%20Binder\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; to control the elementals, but their efforts were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s allied with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;. While summoning water elementals to fight the Scourge, the trolls of Zul'Drak also inadvertently created tiny &lt;a href=\"Water%20Waveling\"&gt;water wavelings&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; and his destructive re-emergence into Azeroth, the Elemental Plane collided with the physical realm and resulted in drastic geographical upheaval, causing chaotic elementals to pour out into the world of Azeroth. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;, Neptulon did not ally himself and his Water elementals to Deathwing. Neptulon made his first appearance when he and his minions battle the naga who were attempting to invade his domain through the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Breach\"&gt;Abyssal Breach&lt;/a&gt;. He clashed with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt; and appeared to gain the upper hand over the sea witch until &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt; was called and attacked the Tide Hunter. Neptulon retreated into his realm, pursued by the vast naga forces where the fight continued on the elemental plane.\nTides of War.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; to create and enslave many water elementals. She bound them into a huge wave with the intent of destroying &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The enslaved elementals cried out to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in a vision, asking for help. Thanks to &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina realized the horror of the genocide she was about to commit. She instead used the elementals to rescue the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; navy from a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fleet and their &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; decided to summon the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s in order to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. They summoned &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; who at first refused to ally with the other Elemental Lords, but eventually accepted in memory of a time when &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;they all fought together&lt;/a&gt;. The Tidehunter later sent his servant &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Lord Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, with his &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;, to represent him and to aid the mortals against the invading &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Unleashed\"&gt;Tempest Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;, many water elementals were summoned alongside the &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Ice%20Lord\"&gt;Glacial Ice Lord&lt;/a&gt; to cause chaos across the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;. After the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, hostile water elementals were among the enemies encountered there. A number of them were also called forth by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned them as their reinforcements through elemental gateways linked to the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a mage minion.\n&lt;a href=\"Mage%23Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s are able to summon a water elemental as a minion.\nIn the RPG.\nA water elemental is a muscular humanoid formed from glimmering blue-green water; polished brass bracers encircle its hefty arms and two glowing blue eyes shine from a featureless head. Its torso trails off into a vestigial whirlpool. Some water elementals have become corrupted, appearing green instead of blue. Water elementals, perhaps the most versatile of all the elementals, possess strong arms, quick reflexes, and hearty constitutions. Enemies fear them, for water elementals possess devastating slam attacks, numbing blows, and the capacity to form powerful whirlpools. They are also the most secretive. Many have never seen daylight and dwell near ocean wrecks and forgotten cities. Human &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmagi&lt;/a&gt; preferred summoning water elementals over all other elementals during the Third War. Of all the elementals, adventurers are most likely to succeed in diplomatic overtures with water elementals. Water elementals rely on their vortex as a primary attack and then switch to melee combat as appropriate. They focus their numbing blows on a single target, hoping to neutralize one threat before turning their attention to other combatants. They speak &lt;a href=\"Aquan\"&gt;Aquan&lt;/a&gt;."}

However as revealed by Aram's sketches, it was a figure of a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt; west of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, Greydon's old enemy, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; with his ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Inevitable\"&gt;Inevitable&lt;/a&gt;\", and his dark &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;, chased and boarded Greydon's ship, after the ship's cook, &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Cobb\"&gt;Jonas Cobb&lt;/a&gt;, betrayed the \"Wavestrider\"'s crew.

Their primary role is to defend the people of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe story of the Waycrest Guard began during the war with the Drust. Under the leadership of Colonel &lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, the warriors of Drustvar defeated the Drust king, &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Osigr\"&gt;Gol Osigr&lt;/a&gt;. With this victory, Colonel Waycrest was promoted to the lord and founded &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;. The men who remained in his service following his victory over the Drust became the first of the Waycrest Guard.\nAs the warriors of Drustvar organized into an official organization, they began taming the local falcons to work alongside them as scouts and messengers.\nAt the beginning of the events of the Battle For Azeroth the leader of the Waycrest Guard was &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Everit%20Reade\"&gt;Marshal Everit Reade&lt;/a&gt;. For many years, his watch would prove to be a peaceful one. That would all change when the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; arrived. The coven would undermine the Waycrest Guard from within. The members at &lt;a href=\"Corlain\"&gt;Corlain&lt;/a&gt; and Waycrest Manor were taken under the absolute control of the Coven. The members at &lt;a href=\"Watchman%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Watchman's Rise&lt;/a&gt; would also fall under the Coven's spell. While most were turned against their alliance by being enthralled, others joined willingly. The subgroup of &lt;a href=\"Goodspeed%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Goodspeed's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, gave their alliance to the Coven in exchange for power. All seem to go from bad to force and the Army was forced to remained at &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt; to take care of the refugees. With &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Arthur%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lord Arthur Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; captured and daughter &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; being sentenced to death. Everit chose to save her first. With his men at his side, he rode to &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20Point\"&gt;Hangman's Point&lt;/a&gt; and defended it long enough until Lucille was proven innocent. With Lucille's freedom assured, Everit rode back to Arom's Stand, awaiting her return.\nLucille would return with a plan to stop the Heartsbane Coven, involving the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of Everit, he gave her five recruits for the order.\nWith the Order restored, the Waycrest Guard began their offensive. They started by retaking the &lt;a href=\"Watchman%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Watchman's Rise&lt;/a&gt; and pushing into Corlain. They took down the barrier and changed towards Waycrest Manor. Arriving at the entrance, they are confronted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Mother\"&gt;The Mother&lt;/a&gt; who corrupts Everit. With no other choice, Everit was brought down. \nAfter the death of Meredith, the Waycrest guard continued their duties in peace. &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt; was named the new Marshal."}

He wanted to explore the mountains with his henchman, &lt;a href=\"Chava\"&gt;Chava&lt;/a&gt;, looking for arcanite deposits. He needed a &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; to leapfrog ahead of his claim-jumping competition.\nThe young dwarf wanted to head to the mountains in a few weeks. Not feeling the need to rush things, Jode decided that he didn't need the fastest flying machine possible (he knew he could always upgrade the copter later). He figured that sixty miles an hour was fast enough. Jode came up with a design, in which the flying machine had the primary task to \"fly around in comfort and style.\"\nAccording to his plans, it would be able to travel up to sixty miles an hour, and could carry up to six hundred pounds including its pilot. Jode also wanted a mounted cannon, but that was a secondary task. He wanted it so he could \"shoot vicious predators and claim-jumpers\". After he considered the time involved in turning on magnetos and spinning up the rotor he learned it would take minutes. Because Jode didnt' want his poor henchman &lt;a href=\"Chava\"&gt;Chava&lt;/a&gt; to wait too long, he decided that starting it up in one minute would be quite long enough. Unfortunately that would have cost a lot, and taken a year to complete, when all he wanted to do was get into the air.\nJode decided he could live with a 'copter that was slower at 40 MPH, and took 4 minutes longer to start. With the changes to his blueprints he could build the ship in half the time for a lot less.\nHe finally built his flying machine. A fragile vehicle that required plenty of coaxing to start. but it was all Jode needed to zip himself, his henchman Chava, and his equipment around the mountains."}

Keeshan served 248 consecutive tours of duty across all of the three Great Wars. At some point in the wars, Keeshan's wife &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Keeshan\"&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt; was killed by &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt;. He started wearing her pendant after that.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nCorporal Keeshan first appeared as a level 25 &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located deep in &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Rock\"&gt;Render's Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the human-aligned zone of &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. During the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt;, he was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orc&lt;/a&gt;s and dragged away to &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Rock\"&gt;Render's Rock&lt;/a&gt;. He was found by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurers and escorted out of Render's Rock.\nCataclysm.\nKeeshan was an orc prisoner for five years. After his rescue, Keeshan states that the townspeople of &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; were \"spitting on me, protesting me, calling me a baby orc killer and all kinds of vile crap\". Keeshan became disillusioned with Lakeshire after being treated with contempt for his military service and refused to do anything to help out the town when it was being attacked. Adventurers, under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Troteman\"&gt;Colonel Troteman&lt;/a&gt;, helped to reignite his will to fight by recovering his lost belongings and helping reassemble Bravo Company, who had all been discovered to be alive but captured by Blackrock orcs.\nWith his belongings returned and his friends in Bravo Company reunited with him, Keeshan regained the will to fight. Keeshan led Bravo Company in an assault on &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Valley\"&gt;Render's Valley&lt;/a&gt;, freeing the prisoners of war located there and then decimating it in an explosion that created &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Crater\"&gt;Render's Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nBravo Company then discovered from the POWs that the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Galardell%20Valley\"&gt;Galardell Valley&lt;/a&gt; are being controlled by a powerful magus in the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;Tower of Ilgalar&lt;/a&gt;. After retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; to its entrance from &lt;a href=\"General%20Fangore\"&gt;General Fangore&lt;/a&gt;, Bravo Company confront &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magus%20Doane\"&gt;Grand Magus Doane&lt;/a&gt;, who alludes to &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the mastermind behind the invasion that Doane alludes to before teleporting away.\nBravo Company later assaulted &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the stronghold of the Blackrock orcs, which culminated in a battle with the black dragon, &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, all the members of Bravo Company were killed except for the adventurer and Keeshan, whom Darkblaze attempted to eat. Darkblaze flew over &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt; with Keeshan in his mouth, and after some struggle, both of them fell into the lake's waters. Both Keeshan and Darkblaze were presumed to have died in the fight, and though his body was never found several of Keeshan's belongings were later recovered by Lakeshire's townspeople.\nIt is later revealed that Keeshan survived, and helps adventurers defeat the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance adventurer joins Keeshan in taking out some of the Dark Horde's &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Flamescale%20Broodling\"&gt;Flamescale Broodling&lt;/a&gt;s. Afterwards, the duo start priming &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Troteman\"&gt;Colonel Troteman&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to debilitate the Dark Horde by gathering supplies. Keeshan and the Alliance champion then start thinning the Dark Horde's numbers as they rendezvous with the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and Troteman in &lt;a href=\"Chiselgrip\"&gt;Chiselgrip&lt;/a&gt;. After proving their allegiance to the Thorium Brotherhood, the adventurer is disguised as a member of the Dark Horde's army by &lt;a href=\"Thelaron%20Direneedle\"&gt;Thelaron Direneedle&lt;/a&gt; and is sent to spy on the Dark Horde's army and assassinate some of its most fearsome soldiers. After earning &lt;a href=\"General%20Thorg%27izog\"&gt;General Thorg'izog&lt;/a&gt;'s trust and killing some &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Sergeant\"&gt;Blackrock Sergeant&lt;/a&gt;s, Troteman, Keeshan, and the Alliance adventurer move to &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Morgan's Vigil&lt;/a&gt; to execute the next phase of Troteman's plan. After gathering more supplies, Keeshan resumes his war and joins the Alliance champion in killing &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragonspawn\"&gt;Black Dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Wyrmkin\"&gt;Black Wyrmkin&lt;/a&gt;, and more of the Dark Horde's fearsome champions. Keeshan and the adventurer &lt;a href=\"Rescued%20Whelplings\"&gt;Rescued Whelplings&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Whelping%20Downs\"&gt;Whelping Downs&lt;/a&gt; and escorts them to &lt;a href=\"Acride\"&gt;Acride&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for his promise to provide a dragon's support in the final battle of the campaign. After the Alliance champion makes deliveries to sabotage the big three leaders of &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Rock\"&gt;Dreadmaul Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Troteman commences the final battle. The Dark Horde leadership within the Burning Steppes is nearly eliminated in the end, with the culmination of Troteman's plan seeing &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlock%20Xi%27lun\"&gt;High Warlock Xi'lun&lt;/a&gt; unable to control the &lt;a href=\"pitlord\"&gt;pitlord&lt;/a&gt; he summoned. The uncontrolled pitlord consequently wipes out most of the Blackrock forces while the adventurer uses the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20the%20Callers\"&gt;Horn of the Callers&lt;/a&gt; to summon an Obsidian-Cloaked Dragon and direct its wrath to decimate 200 Blackrock Invaders. With the Dark Horde's army decimated, Keeshan and the adventurer finishes the mission by eliminating the top three leaders: Thorg'izog, &lt;a href=\"Dragon-Lord%20Neeralak\"&gt;Dragon-Lord Neeralak&lt;/a&gt;, and Xi'lun. \nHe is also one of the dozens of past characters encountered by adventurers aiding in the fight against Ragnaros' forces in &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nKeeshan can be found occasionally in &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, where he offers the dungeon daily quests &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Steel\"&gt;Cold Steel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Steel%20Part%20II\"&gt;Cold Steel Part II&lt;/a&gt;, looking for items from the &lt;a href=\"Grimrail%20Depot\"&gt;Grimrail Depot&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nKeeshan was part of the Alliance's expedition into &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, where he helped establish &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Victory\"&gt;Fort Victory&lt;/a&gt;. He had allowed his facial hair to grow out and sports a moustache and a beard with a thick goatee. After the Alliance's efforts to ally with the native &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s failed and the mad &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Conrad\"&gt;Captain Conrad&lt;/a&gt; was slain, Keeshan wanted to aim his sights higher. Whatever was next for the Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, Keeshan wanted to be a part of it.\nKeeshan later partnered with the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down some Horde &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s in Nazmir. He was nervous around &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, thinking he was barely worthy of serving next to her because of her thousands of years of experience. Keeshan referred to Shandris as \"ma'am\" and figured the least he could do was keep quiet and show respect. Shandris calmed his worries by informing Keeshan that she had read an SI:7 document about his deeds in Redridge and the three wars and he was a hero in his own right. He aided in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt;, who insulted Shandris for allying with a human. Shandris believed that Areiel's views on humans were outdated.\nWhen it came time to confront the Horde &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Prince%20Dreven\"&gt;Blood Prince Dreven&lt;/a&gt; and his allies in a tunnel between Nazmir and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, Keeshan acted as bait as Shandris planned to seal the tunnel entrance while the san'layn were inside it, then kill them all. However, Dreven got away and Keeshan was seriously wounded. He returned to Fort Victory to recover.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, the forces led by &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; began an operation to weaken the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; harbor's defenses. Keeshan and &lt;a href=\"Kelsey%20Steelspark\"&gt;Kelsey Steelspark&lt;/a&gt; planted bombs on the \"&lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Pa%27ku\"&gt;Breath of Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;\", and in the process Keeshan and Kelsey bonded over a love of collecting knives. Realizing one of the Zandalari ships had a route that would take it right by the Alliance's base in &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt;, the two of them hurried to warn Wyrmbane.

However, their plan was anything but flawless. When battle erupted, it attracted a tremendous amount of attention, and the three humans soon found themselves in a brutal fight for their lives. Medivh dueled Jok'non himself, facing a breed of magic he had never seen. Jok'non's dark power nearly overwhelmed Medivh, forcing the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to abandon his apprehensions and unleash his full might. The resulting spell destroyed every single troll inside the ziggurat, and their howls of agony were heard throughout Stranglethorn.\nThe three men hurried back to Stormwind, but there was no joy in their victory, for they had witnessed Medivh's dark side and realized that their old friend was different in ways they could never understand. Medivh himself did not fully understand what he had done and had no idea where the knowledge to cast the destructive spell had come from or if it had been entirely powered by &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. It disturbed him greatly.\nThough none of the trolls who had witnessed Warlord Jok'non's death survived, it took little imagination for them to guess who was responsible, and the Gurubashi soon rallied under Jok'non's son, &lt;a href=\"Zan%27non\"&gt;Zan'non&lt;/a&gt;, and marched against Stormwind, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;."}
