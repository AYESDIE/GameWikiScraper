Bwonsamdi's temple is the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. He brings the spirits of any who worship him into his realm, the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;Other Side&lt;/a&gt;. Bwonsamdi grows more powerful the more souls are in his care.\nHis face is covered by a bony, skull-shaped growth and is described as resembling a &lt;a href=\"rush%27kah\"&gt;rush'kah&lt;/a&gt; mask. He is constantly surrounded by an aura of rot and darkness, and nearby plants wilt in his presence. After someone undergoes the rite of binding, a ritual \"as old as the world itself\", the soul of anything they kill goes to Bwonsamdi. To honor the loa of death, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s will don masks in their rituals and pray to him. Bwonsamdi, in turn, will either answer in kind or curse them with pain, depending on his mood. The &lt;a href=\"%3AGrimoire%20of%20the%20Other%20Side\"&gt;:Grimoire of the Other Side&lt;/a&gt;, along with the power of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, is used by &lt;a href=\"Kaza%27jin%20the%20Wavebinder\"&gt;Kaza'jin the Wavebinder&lt;/a&gt; to bless the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of a deal made between Bwonsamdi and &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi is currently the highest loa in the Zandalari pantheon and the patron loa of the royal family, taking the place of the deceased &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWhen discussing with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi stated that the loa came before the trolls, which would make him and other loa older than them. This statement, as it concerned himself, was ultimately false. Long ago, &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; was the loa of the dead for all trolls, and he elevated Bwonsamdi from priest to loa, becoming Bwonsamdi's master. But Mueh'zala's followers turned against him, fearful of the sacrifices and blood he demanded, and over time he was forgotten by all but the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury tribe&lt;/a&gt; while Bwonsamdi became the primary loa of the death.\nZalazane's Fall.\nBefore they were driven away from the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; and his hexed trolls, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; once worshiped the great spirit. During &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;the liberation of the Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; tried to recruit Bwonsamdi to his side for the battle against &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;. After Vol'jin and his fellow &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; warriors proved themselves worthy and promised to revive the worship of the loa, Bwonsamdi agreed to help them against Zalazane. When Zalazane shielded himself with a protective barrier, an amused Bwonsamdi pointed out that the Darkspear dead belonged in his domain and that Zalazane was going to be one of them. Bwonsamdi then raised &lt;a href=\"Restless%20Zombie\"&gt;Restless Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s to shatter the barrier and killed Zalazane. With the battle over, Bwonsamdi took his leave.\nVol'jin: Shadows of the Horde.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s crippled &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the troll found that his &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; powers were being withheld by the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. In his dreams, Bwonsamdi contacted Vol'jin and told him that his injuries, self-doubt, and conflicting loyalty toward the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has made the loa forsake him. Bwonsamdi showed him various visions, including a future of Vol'jin using the Horde to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and turning the Horde into an empire that would rival even the ancient troll civilizations. The Death Loa wished Vol'jin would use his influence to create as much strife and war as possible, for that would mean more souls would be sent to the other side on his behalf. Vol'jin refused to go down the path of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; conquerors, believing it was not the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; 'way'. Vol'jin eventually proved his conviction and reaffirmed his identity, regaining both Bwonsamdi's respect and his powers. \nBwonsamdi received the souls Vol'jin sent from the battles between the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;'s forces with great satisfaction. At the end of the war, Vol'jin's companion &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt; was near death. Vol'jin pleaded with Bwonsamdi to spare Tyrathan. The loa complied, knowing that the timing did not matter and that he would have his soul sooner or later.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; was betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and near death, Bwonsamdi claimed his soul and at first refused to give it back because the loa of kings &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt; had been keeping Rastakhan from him for a long, long time and he would be denied no further. Rezan threatened Bwonsamdi into complying, but Bwonsamdi was sure that he would see him again soon enough. When Rezan was slain by Zul, his power could no longer keep Bwonsamdi at bay and Rastakhan began to age quickly.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari forces led by &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; sought the aid of the local loa to battle the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Bwonsamdi's worshiper &lt;a href=\"Hanzabu\"&gt;Hanzabu&lt;/a&gt; brought a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; to meet with him. After tasking the adventurer with cleansing his temple of the spirits who had abandoned Bwonsamdi for &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi agreed to pledge his powers to the fight against the blood trolls in exchange for one million souls. The ritual to finalize their contract was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ma%27da%20Ateena\"&gt;Grand Ma'da Ateena&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the blood trolls, but she was successfully fought off. For being attacked in his own temple, Bwonsamdi declared that the blood trolls would be mighty sorry.\nWhen it was discovered that the turtle loa &lt;a href=\"Torga\"&gt;Torga&lt;/a&gt; had been slain by the blood trolls, Talanji and the &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s called on Bwonsamdi to communicate with Torga's spirit. Bwonsamdi would only comply with a deal, the soul of another loa in exchange for communing with Torga, but Talanji denied him that much to Bwonsamdi's amusement. Instead, the souls of the blood trolls that had eaten Torga's flesh were used in exchange for communing with Torga.\nBwonsamdi participated in the final charge against the blood trolls led by Talanji. He prevented the adventurer from dying to a swarm of blood trolls because they still had a debt to pay him.\nAfter a blood troll attack on Zuldazar, Rastakhan made a deal with Bwonsamdi: If Bwonsamdi gave him the power to take back his empire, then Rastakhan would elevate Bwonsamdi above all other loa in the Zandalari pantheon. Bwonsamdi accepted the deal on one condition: that the king's bloodline would be devoted to Bwonsamdi, to serve him in life and in death. Later, as &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; came under attack from Zul and &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi empowered Rastakhan to kill Zul. He happily congratulated Rastakhan on taking back \"their\" empire.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20Vol%27jin\"&gt;Urn of Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; is delivered to Atal'Dazar Bwonsamdi appears saying to bring the urn to his necropolis instead, as he hasn't seen Vol'jin in quite some time and they need to have a face to face talk. There Bwonsamdi discovers that Vol'jin spirit isn't in the urn and says \"Da boss ain't gonna like dis\".\nSeeking to learn where Vol'jin's spirit had gone missing, Bwonsamdi tasked the adventurer and Talanji with performing a seance with the aid of some of Vol'jin's friends from life, Gadrin and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;. They succeeded in contacting him deep within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, and he tasked them with slaying G'huun as justice for the sons and daughters of the loa and the heart of Zandalar. However, he did not answer what it was that had stolen his spirit.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; reinforced his Necropolis, bringing troops and supplies. When the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated it, Bwonsamdi was seen in the courtyard performing a ritual while &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Hunter\"&gt;Darkspear Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s were worshipping him.\nTides of Vengeance.\nFollowing the deaths of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20the%20Light%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Champion of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jadefire%20Masters%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Jadefire Masters&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; urged Bwonsamdi to aid his forces. Bwonsamdi created a blood moon and raised the dead to fend off the Alliance. Bwonsamdi also raised &lt;a href=\"Grong\"&gt;Grong&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Grong%2C%20the%20Revenant\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt; and turned him against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after Horde adventurers slew the giant gorilla. When the Alliance reached King Rastakhan, Bwonsamdi fought at his side and empowered the Zandalari king, but Rastakhan was still ultimately killed. As Talanji held her dying father, Rastakhan's pact with Bwonsamdi was transferred to his daughter as he took his final breath. Bwonsamdi himself then appeared before Talanji, who demanded to know what he had done to her, unaware of the pact her father made that bound his bloodline to the loa of graves. In response, Bwonsamdi merely revealed that her father never told her about their bargain. When asked by her allies about what to do about the fleeing Alliance, she turned towards Bwonsamdi, who with his gesture encouraged Talanji to order the Horde to go after the Alliance.\nVol'jin's spirit, Talanji, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; returned to the Necropolis to reveal that Vol'jin had been calling for him, and Bwonsamdi had not heard him for some reason. They confronted Bwonsamdi to ask him if he was the one who had told the shadow hunter to make &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; the Warchief of the Horde on Vol'jin's deathbed, which Bwonsamdi denied. Even as much as Bwonsamdi was all for war and death, Sylvanas took things too far, and besides that Sylvanas kept the souls of what she killed as undead instead of releasing them for Bwonsamdi to claim. Troubled by their words, Bwonsamdi agreed to help them find out who had really told Vol'jin to put Sylvanas in charge.\nBwonsamdi opened a &lt;a href=\"%3ADeath%20Gate\"&gt;:Death Gate&lt;/a&gt; to one of his rivals in the ownership of souls: the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Like Bwonsamdi, the Lich King told Vol'jin that he was not responsible and that Sylvanas was upsetting the balance of life and death. Realizing that Vol'jin's spirit was getting help from some other power, Bwonsamdi also sent them to speak to the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;, warning them not to mention him by name to her. Indeed, because of some past history with Bwonsamdi Eyir did not allow Talanji to enter her hall as she was a priestess of the death loa. Eyir informed the group that Vol'jin had been \"touched by the hand of valor\", and whoever that was was not the same person who had told Vol'jin to make Sylvanas Warchief. Back at the Necropolis, Bwonsamdi mused that while Eyir and the Lich King were not his only rivals they were the ones he thought most likely to be behind it. He urged Vol'jin to search not the living world but the Shadowlands for his answers.\nIn accordance of the ritual of queens and kings, Talanji sought the judgment of the loa. After passing the trials of &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;, all that remained was Bwonsamdi. The loa of graves offered Talanji a chance to be freed of the pact by giving him the head of Sylvanas Windrunner. Surprised and stunned by this offer, Talanji, moved by her personal sense of honor, rejected betraying the Horde in such a manner and decided to remain beholden to her father's bargain with Bwonsamdi. The death loa merely remarked that it was a shame as he had been desiring a Warchief's soul for some time. Nonetheless, he gave her his blessing. Having passed the trials, Talanji was declared the Queen of Zandalari.\nShadows Rising.\nWhen the machinery of the Shadowlands broke and began sending all souls to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi focused his powers on preventing the troll race from suffering the same fate by holding onto as many troll souls as he could and keeping them safe in the Other Side. This brought him into conflict with Sylvanas Windrunner, who wanted to expand the power of the Maw and sent &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; to kill the loa. To that end, Nathanos, Sira, and the rest of &lt;a href=\"banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Sylvanas' loyalists&lt;/a&gt; allied with the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of Zandalari rebels opposing Queen Talanji.\nBwonsamdi saved Talanji from a Widow's Bite assassination attempt in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; by giving the young Darkspear &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; an invisible shove, causing him to knock a poisoned cup out of the assassin's hand. Frustrated with the Horde, Talanji subsequently returned to Dazar'alor and asked Bwonsamdi to let her see her father's spirit so she could ask his counsel. The loa refused, reminding her that he was not her servant.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; later sent Zekhan to Dazar'alor to act as the Horde's ambassador, watch over Talanji, and convince her to accept a place on the council. While the queen was showing him around the royal palace, the two were attacked by more Widow's Bite members. Bwonsamdi intervened again by distracting one of the assassins, allowing Zekhan to kill him. After the attack, Bwonsamdi appeared to a startled Zekhan to thank him for protecting his \"investment\" and offer him a bargain: Bwonsamdi would grant him a vision of death, and in return, Zekhan had to convince Talanji and the Zandalari to remain with the Horde, as this would be best for Zandalar and\u2014more importantly\u2014best for Bwonsamdi. Zekhan agreed, and the loa showed him a vision of his late mentor &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; reunited with his family in a blissful afterlife. Unbeknownst to Zekhan, this vision was a lie.\nAs time passed, the Widow's Bite began burning Bwonsamdi's shrines and killing his priests throughout Zuldazar and Nazmir, causing him to grow weaker and weaker. Because of their bond, this caused Talanji's strength to diminish as well. Bwonsamdi told the queen that something had to be done soon and pointed out that she could seek help from the Horde. However, because the Horde was still working with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the woman Talanji blamed for Rastakhan's death\u2014the queen demanded something in return: if she kept Bwonsamdi safe and restored him to his full strength, he would break the pact between them. The loa reluctantly accepted the deal but warned Talanji that she might not like what it meant to be all alone.\nAfter learning from the Horde that the Widow's Bite were working with Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, Talanji immediately sent her soldiers to protect Bwonsamdi's remaining shrines, but the effort was thwarted by the dark rangers. During the confrontation, Zekhan was nearly killed and began entering the Maw, but Bwonsamdi managed to reach his soul and return it to his body. At this point, the loa of graves was so weak he appeared almost translucent, and he was using all of his remaining power to keep trolls away from the Maw. The loa explained the state of the Shadowlands to Zekhan and Talanji and informed them that if they did not stop Blightcaller and the rebels, nothing would stop all souls from entering the Maw forever. Back in Dazar'alor, Talanji again asked Bwonsamdi to summon Rastakhan's spirit, but he told her that she needed to find her own way and that there was still hope of stopping the rebels at the loa's last remaining place of power: the Necropolis.\nMeanwhile, the Widow's Bite and the dark rangers captured the &lt;a href=\"Zo%27bal%20Ruins\"&gt;Zo'bal Ruins&lt;/a&gt; near the Necropolis. That night, Bwonsamdi appeared to Nathanos in the form of his dead cousin &lt;a href=\"Stephon%20Marris\"&gt;Stephon&lt;/a&gt; to taunt him, telling him that Sylvanas had made some powerful enemies in the Shadowlands. The following day, the rangers and rebels rounded up Bwonsamdi's worshippers at the temple and threatened them into summoning their god. The death loa appeared in person and raised an army of troll spirits from the graves around the Necropolis to attack the intruders. At the same time, Horde forces\u2014led by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;\u2014finally arrived in Dazar'alor and joined Talanji's army as they rushed to defend the loa. Together they managed to defeat most of the rangers and rebels, but Nathanos stubbornly continued fighting Bwonsamdi. Though her strength was nearly spent, Talanji offered a prayer to the loa to empower him, and Nathanos was forced to flee after the Horde leaders surrounded him.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Bwonsamdi's shrines were quickly rebuilt, and tales of his heroic stand in the Necropolis brought him more popularity and worshippers. Following a victory celebration, Bwonsamdi went to honor his pact with Talanji. While the queen stated that he had to relinquish some of his say in matters and let other loa advise her, she revealed that she had decided to let him remain the loa of kings; she knew that she would face more threats in the future and wanted Bwonsamdi's power on her side, only this time on her own terms. As a show of gratitude, Bwonsamdi summoned Rastakhan's spirit to allow father and daughter to reunite for a brief time before returning the king to his care and departing.\nSylvanas was displeased by Nathanos' failure and noted that Bwonsamdi's survival would complicate her plans considerably. However, she felt that it was a blow she could overcome. She dismissed Nathanos and told him to return with means to prevent the loa's meddling.\nShadowlands.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi approached the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; and warned them that all of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; was in danger. He asked them for aid, as the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; was too proud to deal with the loa. He called upon them to join him on the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;Other Side&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned that Ardenweald was where &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; spirits went for rebirth after dying on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; before revealing how someone very powerful was making the loa spirits disappear under the Winter Queen's nose. Thus, he and the Maw Walker investigated the &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s within the &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Pools\"&gt;Tranquil Pools&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that both &lt;a href=\"Dambala\"&gt;Dambala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; were missing.\nThe pair worked to discover who was behind the theft, with Bwonsamdi becoming briefly stunned at learning that his boss, &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; was behind it. Declaring that Mueh'zala had gone too far this time, he directed the Maw Walker with striking against Mueh'zala's loyalists to the point of killing &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rakazodu\"&gt;High Priest Rakazodu&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that Mueh'zala was resurrecting Dambala and Hakkar to serve in his army. Knowing that Mueh'zala had to be stopped, Bwonsamdi turned to the Winter Queen for aid, who initially believed it to be a mere squabble between loa, before learning of the true scope of Mueh'zala's plans. For turning to the Winter Queen for aid, he earned nothing but disdain for his old boss, with Mueh'zala declaring that Bwonsamdi's time was done, his power spent, and he was coming to collect. While the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; beat back Mueh'zala's forces, Bwonsamdi moved to personally deal with him.\nFollowing the death of Dambala, the adventurers entered the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;Other Side&lt;/a&gt; where they discovered Bwonsamdi fighting against Mueh'zala, who demanded the souls of &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; who died during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and who Bwonsamdi has been keeping away from him. In order to better his odds in the fight, Bwonsamdi called upon them to collect some of his old &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Manastorms\"&gt;former business&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dealer%20Xy%27exa\"&gt;partners&lt;/a&gt;. After Mueh'zala was defeated, Bwonsamdi bound him and declared himself the boss now.\nAfter Mueh'zala let slip that he had stolen something from the Winter Queen, Bwonsamdi recruited the Maw Walker, and then had the pair travel to his &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;. After revealing that Mueh'zala's followers were attempting to free their master, Bwonsamdi directed his ally with killing their leader &lt;a href=\"Zel%27han%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Zel'han the Summoner&lt;/a&gt;, and then collecting &lt;a href=\"Zel%27han%27s%20Broken%20Armor\"&gt;Zel'han's Broken Armor&lt;/a&gt; in order to end any hope Mueh'zala had of escape. At the same time &lt;a href=\"Hanzabu\"&gt;Hanzabu&lt;/a&gt;, one of Bwonsamdi's followers, directed them with collecting the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Mojo\"&gt;Dark Mojo&lt;/a&gt; from Mueh'zala's followers and rescuing other worshippers in order to help his master with his gambit.\nAfter these tasks were completed, he revealed that ritual involved feeding Mueh'zala a bit of life essence from all within the Necropolis. He confidently waved off the concerns of the Maw Walker and remarked that as Mueh'zala fed, they would pull the truth from him. He then had &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; summoned to witness the ritual and subsequently began it. Bwonsamdi and his allies then learned that Mueh'zala had trapped an ancient spirit in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, for refusing to join him and the Jailer. After acquiring this information Bwonsamdi, annoyed by Mueh'zala's threats, sent him back into the Other Side, and then suggested that they get payback on Mueh'zala by rescuing the spirit in question, and then bring said spirit to the safety of the Winter Queen.\nWhen Vol'jin voiced concern about entering the Maw, Bwonsamdi reminded him how Mueh'zala revealed his soul was still tied to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, he did warn Vol'jin to not fully manifest his spirit, and then allowed Vol'jin and the Maw Walker the use of his personal portal to Ardenweald. After the pair rescued &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi joined them in delivering the spirits to the Winter Queen. The Winter Queen subsequently took the spirits and Vol'jin, due to being intrigued by his spirit being entwined with that of the fallen loa &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, under her care. After sharing a mutual salute with Vol'jin, Bwonsamdi then attempted to request something in exchange for Vol'jin soul, only to be told to depart. Though complying with the request, he reminded her that if she ever needed him, to just come on over to de Other Side. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; can visit &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Vaal\"&gt;Tirna Vaal&lt;/a&gt; and see Bwonsamdi looking upon Vol'jin's wildseed, where it is resting.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt; was killed and the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; beaten back, a &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Mask of Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; was present within the Winter Queen's court.\nApperance.\nBwonsamdi is a &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; with the appearance of a large troll with gray skin and a white painted face and body in the form of a skeleton with two bright blue lights in the sockets and long, spiky black hair.\nQuotes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGossip.\nHow goes de soul collection, hm?\nI hope you are keeping count, loa know ol' Bwonsamdi isn't.\n&lt;Bwonsamdi laughs.&gt;\nIn all seriousness, I hope you have not forgotten our bargain.\nFollowers.\nBesides the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi also had another big temple at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Terrace of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion \"\", Bwonsamdi serves as the patron of Bwonsamdi's Zombies, an unsettling, death-obsessed team of troll &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, and personally appears as . His flavor text reads: \"Everyone's dying to meet him.\"\nSpeculation.\nBecause of the similarities between the troll loa &lt;a href=\"Samedi\"&gt;Samedi&lt;/a&gt; and Bwonsamdi, with both being troll loa of death and being based on the same real-world , it is possible that the two are one and the same, just being addressed by slightly different names."}

Bring the Soul Gem to Jaina's Ritual Circle, where a combined effort might save Grom from the Demons' influence.\"\nTranscript.\nDuring the Mission.\n\"Infernals fall from the sky and start running down the ridge towards the bases!\"\nOutro.\n\"At Jaina's base, the priests and shaman use spells to purify the captured Grom of the demons' influence. Eventually, Grom becomes normal again, shrinking back to his normal size and returning to his regular green skin color.\"\nThe battle.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; met in preparation for their joint assault on the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Warsong\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; Clan. Thrall was very uneasy about all of this, as not only would he be fighting his own people, but he would be working with the humans too. Jaina gave Thrall a magical &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; which would allow him to capture &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; without harming him. Once Hellscream was subdued, they would be able to purge him of the demonic corruption. Jaina then left to take charge of her own forces nearby. Thrall confided in Cairne that he feared if Grom couldn't be saved, then the orcish race may be doomed.\nThe battle soon began as Horde and Alliance soldiers clashed with the Warsong clan. The Warsong orcs did not give ground easily. The demonic corruption had given them enhanced strength and endurance. It had also stripped them of any qualms about killing their own brethren. Nevertheless, while Alliance troops held the Warsong advance, Thrall's forces attacked and pushed their way through, rescuing a number of captive Trolls along the way.\nWhile the battle raged on, the skies suddenly turned red and caught fire. &lt;a href=\"Infernals\"&gt;Infernals&lt;/a&gt; came crashing down onto the battlefield inflicting heavy damage on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces. The demonic invasion of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; had begun. Despite this, Thrall fought on determined to reach Hellscream at all cost.\nAfter defeating Hellscream's cadre of &lt;a href=\"Doomguard\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Felhound\"&gt;Felhound&lt;/a&gt;s, and orcish Warlocks, Thrall confronted Grom himself. Thrall pleaded with Grom to surrender and come with him. Grom refused and declared that &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; was the master of the orcs now. Thrall didn't understand what Grom was talking about. Grom then revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; had corrupted the orcs because they had been allowed to do so. Back on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Grom and the other Chieftains willingly drank Mannoroth's blood and knowingly condemned themselves to be slaves of the Burning Legion. Thrall was enraged by this revelation and attacked Hellscream. After a desperate struggle, Thrall managed to regain control of himself and used Jaina's Soul Gem to capture Grom. He then returned to Jaina.\nThrall's shamans and Jaina's priests successfully purged Grom of the demonic influence. Now freed of the demons' control, Grom was ashamed of his recklessness and tried to apologize to Thrall. Thrall, however, was in no mood for apologies. He needed Grom to help him save their people. Grom told him that Mannoroth was waiting for them in a nearby canyon. Thrall replied that they had best go and confront the demon lord, as he didn't want to \"keep the bastard waiting.\"\nStrategy.\nThe stage can be finished surprisingly fast if one successfully obtained the &lt;a href=\"Necklace%20of%20Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Necklace of Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;previous chapter&lt;/a&gt;. Have one of your heroes carry the Soul Gem, the Necklace of Spell Immunity, and items that can sustain their health such as a &lt;a href=\"Health%20Stone\"&gt;Health Stone&lt;/a&gt; and or a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Greater%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Greater Healing&lt;/a&gt; before beelining to Grom's location and avoiding getting trapped by an encirclement. Both have their respective perks as Cairne's &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; gives him a longer safety window should he get encircled while Thrall has faster movement speed even against a Level 3 Endurance Aura and can aggro enemies using Feral Spirit to better avoid encirclement. If a hero has taken too much damage, it is possible to camp in between the Warsong camp and the &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Guard%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Doomguards&lt;/a&gt; at Grom's entrance to regenerate health before moving on. Once Grom is caught, immediately head back home, while again avoiding encirclement. Optionally, one can send out their army to attack the Warsong Camp to further pull away the defenders so that the Soul Gem carrier can return safely. If done correctly, the player can finish the stage just after the infernals begin spawning."}

It is a weapon of great power whose name means \"troll slayer\" in the ancient tongue of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Troll Wars.\n&lt;a href=\"Ignaeus%20Trollbane\"&gt;Ignaeus Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, general of the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and ancestor of the Trollbane line, famously wielded Trol'kalar against the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. The sword was Arathor's greatest weapon.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMillennia later, Trol'kalar was carried by &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, King of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, until he was murdered by his son, &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Prince Galen&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Thoras and the sword were buried in &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Trollbane's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Crypt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Trol'kalar was magically encased in a stone sheath, held in the grip of its master's stone likeness, and could only be unlocked with the &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Ignaeus\"&gt;:sigil of Ignaeus&lt;/a&gt;. To protect the sword, Galen split the sigil into four pieces. He kept the &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Trollbane\"&gt;:sigil of Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; on his own person, entrusted the &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;:sigil of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Valorcall\"&gt;Lieutenant Valorcall&lt;/a&gt;, and divided the &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Thoradin\"&gt;:sigil of Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; into pieces which he dispersed among the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Militia\"&gt;Stromgarde Militia&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth piece, the &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Strom\"&gt;:sigil of Strom&lt;/a&gt;, was stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Thoras dead and Stromgarde in ruins, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; sought to steal Trol'kalar so that they could use it in their coming battles against the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; trolls of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; himself sent the hunter &lt;a href=\"Zengu\"&gt;Zengu&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to procure the sword. Zengu dispatched agents of the Horde to hunt down the portions of the sigil of Ignaeus, culminating in killing Galen himself to claim his piece. The agents then used the combined sigil to release Trol'kalar from Trollbane's Tomb and bring it back to Zengu, who planned to deliver the blade to &lt;a href=\"Nimboya\"&gt;Nimboya&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nZengu did not get far, however. When he attempted to leave Arathi, the forces of Stromgarde simply killed him, took back the sword, and returned it to Trollbane's Tomb. This time the tomb was sealed with the &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Trollbane\"&gt;:sigil of Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, which like its predecessor was divided into four pieces. Prince Galen, resurrected as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, directed Horde soldiers to once again find the divided sigils and reobtain Trol'kalar for his new master, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. As before, the &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Thoradin\"&gt;:sigil of Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; had been divided among Stromgarde's soldiers while the &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;:sigil of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; had again been given to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Valorcall\"&gt;Lieutenant Valorcall&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Strom\"&gt;:sigil of Strom&lt;/a&gt; had been stolen again by the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, and the fourth piece was still held by Galen personally. With the combined sigil, the agents retrieved Trol'kalar from its tomb and gave it to Galen, who promised to once again take up the duty of guarding the blade and claimed that it would be used as a weapon to bring death to the living in Sylvanas' name.\nLegion.\nIn reality, Galen meant to use Trol'kalar to legitimize his own claim to the throne of Stromgarde. With the sword in hand, he rebelled against Sylvanas and took over Stromgarde Keep with his undead subjects. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; sought to raise Thoras as one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, but they needed Trol'kalar to open the king's tomb. Galen agreed to grant the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; access in exchange for them ridding Stromgarde of invading &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark&lt;/a&gt; trolls. However, he then betrayed the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s and tried to kill the Deathlord with Trol'kalar. The Deathlord executed him, used the blade to open the crypt, and resurrected Thoras before returning to the . It is not mentioned what happened to Trol'kalar after this. As far as the are aware, the sword's present whereabouts are unknown.\nIn the RPG.\nThis bastard sword is notched and old, but its appearance belies its sharpness and balance. Trol'Kalar pulses with a dim white radiance, almost as if alive. The weapon's name means \u201cTroll Slayer\u201d in an ancient tongue. The scion of the Trollbane family, Prince Galen of Stromgarde, wields Trol'Kalar against forsaken, the Syndicate, &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s instead of its traditional foes. The blade still proves deadly.\nWhen the Trollbane family manor was hit with a surprise bandit raid while much of the house guard was out fighting the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, a human servant called &lt;a href=\"Yernim%20Weltom\"&gt;Yernim Weltom&lt;/a&gt; hid the family's artifacts in the kitchen, filling the priceless chalice of opal voices with gravy, tossing the ancient sword Trol'kalar into the pile of pig offal and putting the cloak of elemental protection on himself and jumping into the massive kitchen fire to hide. &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Trollbane\"&gt;Prince Liam&lt;/a&gt;, grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, was so impressed with his servant's ingenuity in hiding the castle's artifacts that he appointed him &lt;a href=\"Caretakers\"&gt;Caretaker&lt;/a&gt; of Artifacts with a staff of two, and commanded the young servant to come up with a better plan to protect the artifacts.\nPowers.\nWhen a troll is slashed by this bastard sword, it cannot regenerate as it would when hurt by a common melee weapon. The wounds heal at their normal rate, just as if the troll victim didn't count with additional regeneration powers at all. The Trol'kalar also procs additional holy damage to all evil creatures (trolls included).\nThe Trol'kalar curses any evil creature attempting to use it with one negative level (debuff). This curse inflicts the wielder as long as the sword is wielded. This one negative level curse cannot be cured nor dispelled, it will affect the wielder as long as he has the sword at hands.\nIn the TCG.\n&lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane%20%28Betrayal%20of%20the%20Guardian%29\"&gt;depicted&lt;/a&gt; wielding Trol'kalar during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The sword uses the same design as in \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSpeculation.\nThoras may have taken Trol'kalar and transformed it into the &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; he is seen wielding as a death knight. Trol'kalar is last mentioned being used by the Deathlord to open the way to &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Trollbane's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20King%20Rises\"&gt;The King Rises&lt;/a&gt;. When they raise Thoras, he does not initially have a weapon; however, the next time they encounter him in , he is already equipped with an unnamed runeblade."}

They are one of the world's oldest known native races. Trolls are divided into many subgroups adapted to different environments, namely &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMany trolls have no loyalty except amongst their own tribes, but some important groups have joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Some forest trolls cling to their allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;villainous offshoots&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraits and characteristics.\nTroll is a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; grouped into &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s, with each varying from being tall, lanky, and muscular, and being different than the others both physically and culturally. They have both &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;-like characteristics with their fierce tusks and long ears. Their long arms, strong legs, quick reflexes as well as their incredible agility and strength make them adept hunters.\nTrolls have three fingers, and three toes with one protruding from the heel. Most trolls do not wear standard shoes or boots as they are simply more comfortable barefoot, however, some do. And adorning them for battle or war is done by some.\nMale trolls frequently squat in place, while the females do not.\nTrolls and their various subgroups are some of the tallest mortal races on Azeroth. Both males and females have a variety of tusk styles ranging from small to large, they also feature a wide range of wild hairstyles, though mohawks are very common. The three largest subgroups of troll are the &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who on average are much larger than their kindred. There is another variant of troll\u2013albeit not a subgroup\u2013that far exceed the normal size range, these trolls are called &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nForest trolls' bodies can support plant life to a limited extent due to a mutation that took place many millennia ago. A thin layer of moss may grow on their skin shortly after they are born, giving them their characteristic greenish color.\nJungle trolls' bodies are covered in short, soft fur which causes them to appear purple or gray. However, their range of color is even broader as many appear in shades of blue as well as tints of green.\n&lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai\"&gt;Kun-Lai&lt;/a&gt; stated that the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt; could cope with the cold better than he could. However, he managed to get used to it very rapidly. With how naturally adaptable trolls are, (as confirmed by their numerous subgroups), it wouldn't be surprising if this wasn't true for most trolls.\nTrolls have a characteristic way of speaking. Words like \"yo\" (a greeting) and \"mon\" (man) are common expressions. They speak with varying Caribbean and African accented English.\nTroll regeneration.\nAlthough enough physical damage can kill them, all trolls possess incredible physical resilience and can &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;regenerate&lt;/a&gt; grievous physical injuries at an astonishingly accelerated rate, giving them a large advantage in battle. All trolls are naturally able to regenerate lost limbs and organs thanks to their unique physiology. Meaning they do not need the blessings of a &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; to be able to regenerate.\nExamples.\nThe average speed of regeneration is not entirely known, however. While there are several impressive and rapid feats, there have also been examples of trolls that have been depicted as critically wounded and at least temporarily disabled by their injuries in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nControl.\nTrolls are capable of controlling their regeneration, though how they do so is unknown, but a troll can make a conscious decision to not heal a scar as to leave a mark of what has happened to them. An example of this is &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; who\u2014after having been the victim of an attempted assassination\u2014decided to not fully heal his throat and lung, as a reminder of his mistake to accept &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;. The scar left upon and inside his throat also altered his voice, making it sound unmelodious.\nIt is most likely this control that allows trolls to retain piercings, tattoos, and other bodily modifications that would otherwise be considered damage needing to be repaired by the body.\nCulture.\nTroll children are taught about those cursed by the loa, unable to heal even flesh wounds, to instill the proper respect for their patron spirits.\nThere are tales in troll culture about those blessed by the loa that can regenerate nearly the entirety of their bodies. The tale of &lt;a href=\"Vula%27jin%20the%20Void\"&gt;Vula'jin the Void&lt;/a&gt; speaks of how he regrew almost his entire body after standing in a pool of &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tik%27su\"&gt;Tik'su&lt;/a&gt; charged trolls for their arms and legs as a result of trolls being able to regrow their limbs.\nTrivia.\nTrolls are so well known for their regenerative abilities that there are &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; mixtures\u2014which induce some form of regeneration\u2014referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Strong%20Troll%27s%20Blood%20Elixir\"&gt;troll's blood elixir&lt;/a&gt;s\" despite not actually containing any troll blood, judging by the reagents used to make them. When it comes to troll blood, however, an interesting thing to note is that &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt; blood is thick enough to hold in your hand.\nRetcons.\nTroll regeneration has been subject to inconsistencies over the years and has fluctuated in terms of strength and whether it was natural or a blessing from the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. Though while it has remained fairly consistent in some cases, below is a list of retcons and inconsistencies.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nAt the heart of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; lay the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, an enormous lake filled with powerful energies. The Well accelerated the cycles of growth and rebirth on the primordial continent, and soon sentient life forms arose from the wilds. The trolls were among the first and most prolific.\nTrolls are one of the oldest races on Azeroth. Before the days of empires such as the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s were the leaders of small groups of trolls that over time formed small tribes. Over time, as trolls gathered in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;great cities&lt;/a&gt;, their influence was lessened. Despite this, the position is still a highly respected one.\nThe early trolls developed an array of superstitious customs. Some practiced cannibalism and warfare, others mystic practices and meditation, and others honed their ties to the dark and powerful form of magic known as &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt;. What all trolls shared was a common religion centered around Kalimdor's &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, which the trolls worshipped as deities under the name \"&lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;\". The troll tribes gathered near the sacred mountain range of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where many of the loa dwelt. The lesser tribes built small encampments on Zandalar's slopes, but the most powerful tribe, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, claimed the highest peaks and plateaus. There, they built a cluster of shrines that would later come to grow into the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. The tribes would then unite under King &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt; to form the Zandalari empire.\nEmpires.\nAbout 16,000 years ago (long before the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; summoned the wrath of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;), trolls lorded over much of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, which was then a single continent. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; were the earliest known trolls - the first tribe from which all tribes originated. The Zandalari were allied with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;their empire&lt;/a&gt;, but both the mogu and Zandalari held contempt for one another. The Zandalari thought themselves above the mogu for two reasons: the presence of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, and that the Zandalari did not use slaves as the mogu did. The mutual contempt between the two would grow to polite indifference. They trusted the other not to attack because they were confident they would defeat the other. While Zandalari and mogu stood back to back, they did not watch the other and did not see the other falter.\nThe Zandalari Empire was heavily dependent on a caste system, and as time went on those castes evolved into their own people. The lower castes eventually left the Zandalari Empire, and the Zandalar trolls were content to see them go, seeing them as children who would see the folly of youthful rebellion and come back begging for Zandalari approval.\nHowever, the trolls would not return. Over time two distinct troll empires emerged: the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; of the middle forestlands and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; of the Southeastern jungles. Smaller tribes lived far North in the region now called &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. These tribes founded a small nation known as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, but they never achieved the size or prosperity of the southern empires.\nIt was not uncommon for these powerful tribes to go to war with each other, usually over disputed territories or for specific resources. For the most part, however, these wars were benign and rarely lasted long enough for any major conflicts to occur. The trolls were so very skilled at hunting and fighting that any large confrontation would prove to be extremely costly for all parties involved, regardless of which side won. Untouched and unclaimed land was plentiful in every direction, and the various factions quickly realized that it was wiser to resettle or withdraw rather than to risk an open and potentially costly war.\nThere was only one location which the trolls were actively forbidden from disturbing by their priests and mystic. This was a dark mound of blackened earth and stone located at the base of the Zandalar Mountains. The loa warned troll priests of severe consequences should they disturb this place, and for centuries none dared to. Eventually, however, a group of curious and rebellious trolls led by the Gurubashi outcast &lt;a href=\"Zan%27do\"&gt;Zan'do&lt;/a&gt; resigned to throw caution to the wind and plumbed the forbidden mound. What they discovered was that the black stones were not rocks\u2014they were the jagged hide of a large and monstrous creature. Stunned and excited by their discovery, they incorrectly believed that what they had unearthed was a loa. They further concluded that this loa must be one of a particular power, as the other spirits appeared to be afraid of its presence. Determined to awaken this being, the trolls performed vile ceremonies and rituals, including living sacrifices. Roused by the ritually-spilled blood, a gigantic &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi general known as &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; emerged from its millennia-long slumber and immediately viciously slew those who had revived it.\nKith'ix, fully awakened, knew it would delight the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s to see this pitiful civilization rent to ashes. It reached out with its mind and took control of the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; dwelling underground. The aqiri swarms began building a vast subterranean &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt;, and when they had swollen enough in number, the C'Thrax led them to make war against the trolls in a conflict now known as the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aqiri threat was unlike any the trolls had ever faced. As they got dangerously close to the Zandalar Mountains, the Zandalari moved to act. They united the disparate troll tribes into a single mighty force, which they called the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;. Its members would put aside their differences and work together to destroy the aqir.\nThe trolls fought the aqir for many thousands of years but never succeeded in winning a true victory over them. Eventually, due to the trolls' persistence, the aqiri kingdom split into thirds as its citizens fled to separate colonies in the far Northern and Southern regions of the continent. Three aqiri kingdoms then emerged: &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; in the Northern wastes, &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; in the Southern desert, and &lt;a href=\"Manti%27vess\"&gt;Manti'vess&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;domain of mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Though the trolls suspected that there were other aqiri colonies beneath Kalimdor, their existence was never verified.\nWith the insectoids driven into exile, the twin troll empires returned to normalcy. Despite their great victories, neither civilization expanded much further than their original boundaries. However, ancient texts speak of a small faction of &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s who broke off from the Amani Empire and founded their own colony in the heart of the dark continent. There, the pioneers discovered the cosmic &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, which allegedly transformed them into beings of immense power. Some legends suggested that these troll adventurers became the first &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, and this was later confirmed by &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt; when asked by the legendary explorer, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmpires' fall.\nAfter their discovery of the Well of Eternity, the descendants of these dark trolls, now calling themselves \"&lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;\" in their &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;new language&lt;/a&gt;, came to power. Despite the trolls' attempts to keep them from expanding their territories, the night elves built a strong empire that expanded rapidly across primordial Kalimdor. Wielding magics never before seen by their ancestors' kin, who remained largely superstitious, the night elves had little trouble demolishing the trolls' twin empires, an act the aqir could not accomplish.\nThe night elves systematically dismantled the trolls' defenses and supply chains. The trolls, unable to counter the elves' destructive magics, buckled under the onslaught. The actions of the night elves incurred the trolls' long-lasting hatred and disdain. The Gurubashi and Amani Empires fragmented within only a few short years.\nEventually, the night elves' reckless overuse of magic lured the demonic Burning Legion to the world. The demons destroyed much of the night elves' civilization. Though there are no records to indicate that the Legion attacked either troll civilization, it is likely that battles took place across the breadth of the continent. Some dark gray-skinned trolls guarded &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, magically kept under the Aspect's sway.\nAt the end of this conflict, known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the Well of Eternity imploded. The resulting shockwave shattered the greater landmass of Kalimdor. The center of the continent was blasted beneath the sea, leaving a group of multiple, broken, continents. Thus, great chunks of both the Amani and Gurubashi Empires were lost to the waves, but plenty of their land still exists in the present-day lands of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; (respectively). The Azj'Aqir kingdoms of Azjol-Nerub, Ahn'Qiraj, and Manti'vess have also survived in present-day &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nBoth troll civilizations recoiled from the vast destruction of the world they had known. The trolls later rebuilt their ravaged cities and set about to reclaim some of their former power.\nThe Troll Wars.\nOne of the oldest wars in Azeroth was between the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. High elves founded their kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; over ground sacred to the trolls, beneath which lay an ancient troll city. This sparked conflict between the high elves and trolls, but the elves' magic frightened away the superstitious and angry troll warbands. 4,000 years passed while the trolls plotted and schemed as their numbers grew. Finally, a mighty troll army charged out from the shadowy forests and once again laid siege to the shining spires of Quel'Thalas.\nThe elves were hopelessly outnumbered. Believing defeat to be imminent, the high elves in desperation sought the aid of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, teaching them the ways of magic in exchange for their assistance. Together the high elves and humans stood against the troll armies at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and used fire magic to set the trolls ablaze and prevent them from regenerating their wounds. The troll armies broke and attempted to flee, but were chased by enemy forces and eventually killed. The forest trolls would never fully recover from their defeat, and history would never see them rise as one nation again.\nWrath of the Soulflayer.\nThe long centuries following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world were difficult ones for the troll race. Famine and death were commonplace within the broken kingdoms. The Gurubashi trolls, driven to desperate ends, sought aid from ancient, mystical forces. Though both of the troll kingdoms shared a central belief in a great pantheon of primitive gods, the Gurubashi fell under the sway of a darker one.\n1,500 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; from War of the Ancients), a darker spirit, heard the trolls' calls of distress and decided to aid them. Hakkar gave his secrets of blood to the Gurubashi and helped them extend their civilization across most of Stranglethorn Vale and certain islands of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. Though he brought them great power, Hakkar demanded souls be sacrificed to him daily. He wanted to gain access to the physical world so that he could terrorize and devour mortal creatures. In time the Zandalari helped the Gurubashi realize what kind of creature they had courted with, and both forces turned against him. The strongest tribes rose up against Hakkar and his loyal priests, the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe devastating war that ensued between Hakkar's followers and the rest of the Gurubashi tribes was not well-recorded and has mostly been passed on through oral tradition. The budding empire was shattered by the magic unleashed between the angry god and his rebel children. Just as the war began turning away from the trolls' favor, they succeeded in destroying Hakkar's avatar and banishing him from the mortal world.\nThe Atal'ai priests were eventually driven from the capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and forced to survive in the uncharted swamplands of the North. Within the dense ferns, they built a great temple, &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of their fallen god, where they continued to worship and serve him.\nThe rest of the Gurubashi tribes separated after the great civil war had left their lands in ruins. The &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodscalp%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodscalp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;s set off to claim their own lands within the vast jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. Though a fragile peace had settled over the broken empire, rumors of a prophecy that Hakkar would one day be reborn into the world spread.\nThe Horde.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; first arrived on Azeroth the troll tribes initially ignored the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, but when the Horde destroyed &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and was moving to destroy &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the forest trolls saw the perfect chance to gain vengeance for their defeat in the Troll Wars. Led by the mighty &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; the Forest Trolls proved to be a great asset to the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and were able to successfully strike against the high elves of Quel'Thalas. However when &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; decided to launch an assault on the humans of Lordaeron instead of continuing the invasion of Quel'Thalas Zul'jin grew furious. The forest trolls ultimately left the Horde when the orcs were defeated and placed into &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; still having a small amount of loyalty to the Horde. The troll race would then return to the former policy of ignoring the Horde until the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Third War, the young Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; heeded the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;'s words to set sail to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, his ships crash-landed on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20islands\"&gt;Darkspear islands&lt;/a&gt; and his forces encountered the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;. After helping the Darkspear tribe against the attacking &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces, all sides were captured by &lt;a href=\"murlocs\"&gt;murlocs&lt;/a&gt; under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Sea Witch Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt;. After being saved and following &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s dying wishes the Darkspear tribe swore loyalty to the Horde.\nFollowing the aftermath of the Third War, the orcs sent emissaries to the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; to renew the bonds of loyalty with their former forest troll allies. While the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark&lt;/a&gt; refused outright, the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk trolls&lt;/a&gt; agreed and have become the Horde's ally.\nEnd of the troll capitals.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance and Horde adventurers have launched constant assaults on the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20troll\"&gt;Sandfury troll&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt;, leaving it a barren wasteland.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; were able to successfully bring forth &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt; quickly joining them in hopes of restoring themselves to their former glory. When word of Hakkar's presence reached the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, they sent a contingent of Gurubashi high priests to stop him. When word reached the Zandalari that the priests had been enslaved by Hakkar, &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; sent emissaries from the island of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; to recruit champions from Azeroth's many races in the hope that Hakkar could once again be defeated. The Zandalari's call to arms was answered by the proud members of the Alliance and Horde, who slew the enthralled high priests, the Gurubashi witch doctor &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately Hakkar himself, leaving Zul'Gurub but a shadow of its former glory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elves&lt;/a&gt; joined the Horde, Zul'jin ventured out of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and became enraged that the Troll's eternal enemy joined with his former ally. He saw the opportunity when most of the blood elves and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were busy fighting on Outland. He had his champions harness the power of the loa with the help of the cunning &lt;a href=\"Hex%20Lord%20Malacrass\"&gt;Hex Lord Malacrass&lt;/a&gt;. Not wanting to fight a war on two fronts, the Horde sent a task force of some of their strongest champions to kill the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; leadership. At the entrance to Zul'Aman, adventurers encountered &lt;a href=\"Budd%20Nedreck\"&gt;Budd Nedreck&lt;/a&gt;, who convinced them to also steal the treasures within as well. With Zul'jin dead the forest troll capital became quiet with the surviving Amani grouping under &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; became under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. In desperation to counter the Scourge threat, the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari trolls&lt;/a&gt; began sacrificing their own &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; and draining their power for themselves. The Zandalari went to Zul'Drak to intervene on the behalf of the Loa and chronicle the end of the Drakkari empire. The empowered Drakkari soon became power-mad and threatened the forces of the Alliance, Horde, and Argent Crusade who were attempting to fight back the Scourge in Northrend. As a result, the adventurers employed by these forces were, after neutralizing the Scourge threat in the lowest reaches of the city, directed against the Drakkari and, with the aid of the Loa who escaped the Drakkari's plot, managed to take out all of the empowered trolls in the city. These adventurers soon converged on Gundrak itself, and there they slew the remaining champions of Zul'Drak, including their leader; High Prophet Gal'darah.\nAs a result of these events, the Zandalari considered Zul'Drak to have been destroyed by the Scourge.\nA new troll empire.\nThe recent cataclysm has seen the Revantusk become members of the Horde who are fighting to claim the entire Hinterlands for the tribe and the Horde. The cataclysm has also seen the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; end their isolationist policy and join the Horde which was now under the command of the new Warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, a new adventurer who traveled through Stranglethorn would gain the friendship of a &lt;a href=\"Ohgan%27aka\"&gt;raptor chick&lt;/a&gt;. Through this chick and its adventurer companion, the Alliance and Horde discovered that Jin'do, now a shade, had enacted a plan to restore the Gurubashi to greatness by resurrecting their high priests and champions (himself included of course) and summoning Hakkar. And while the resurrection of Mandokir and Venoxis was successful, the adventurer managed to throw a wrench into his plans by destroying Jeklik's body and preventing her resurrection.\nThe Shatterspear was not the only tribe who has seen a change in their stance on the other nations, however. The chaos unleashed by the recent Cataclysm caused immense damage to Zandalar itself and has thus reshaped the Zandalari's stance about the world as well, and the dwindling remnants of their race. Around the time of the Alliance and Horde's siege on the Twilight Highlands, a meeting was then by the mysterious prophet &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the fate of their people. Among those in attendance at the meeting are Vol'jin of the Darkspear, Jin'do of the Gurubashi, Daakara of the Amani and an unknown ice troll leader.\nThere the tribe leaders are reminded of the falls of Zul'Farrak and Zul'Drak. Zul then says that the troll tribes must unite to form a new Troll Empire. He entices both Jin'do and Daakara with promises of restoring Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman to their former glory. As the other trolls agree to join the Zandalari, Vol'jin begins walking away and only stops when asked if he would betray his people. Vol'jin retorts that the Horde are his people and promises to stop the Zandalari should they bring war to the land.\nKnowing that a new troll empire would be a grave threat to Azeroth, Vol'jin has sent Darkspear emissaries to both Orgrimmar and Stormwind, knowing that the Horde alone can not stop the Zandalari. While Vol'jin's efforts have been able to keep the Amani contained within Zul'Aman, the Gurubashi were able to launch an attack on Stranglethorn before being pushed back to Zul'Gurub. Vol'jin's Darkspear have been able to keep themselves entrenched within both Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub, the Revantusk and Shatterspear tribes have also refused to join the Zandalari and have stayed true to the Horde.\nWith the aid of &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s rangers, Vol'jin and the Darkspear were able to keep the Amani hold up inside Zul'Aman. After deciding an appropriate battle plan Vol'jin personally leads a strike force into Zul'Aman and with the aid of adventurers puts an end to &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt; which severely weakening the Amani even further and ends Zandalari's efforts within Zul'Aman.\nHowever empowered by the Zandalari's offer the Gurubashi launched an all-out assault to claim Stranglethorn, though with the effort of brave adventurers they are pushed back into Zul'Gurub where Darkspear agents have claimed the entrance. These agents were then able to discover that &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; is wrestling Hakkar the Soulflayer into submission, holding him by spirit chains and stripping out his power into himself. With this knowledge, they recruited adventurers who ventured into Zul'Gurub and put an end to the Gurubashi leadership before freeing Hakkar who swiftly killed Jin'do. Thus dealing the Gurubashi a severe blow though and removing the Zandalari's influence, though at the cost of the Soulflayer's freedom.\nThe return of the Thunder King.\nWhen the mists hiding the southern continent Pandaria lifted, the Zandalari realized they had an opportunity to claim the land as their own by resuming their allegiance with the mogu. To cement this allegiance, and their place on Pandaria, the trolls invaded the Kun-Lai region of the continent to find and retrieve the corpse of Lei Shen, the Thunder King and the first emperor of the mogu empire. With their powerful voodoo magic, the Zandalari were successful in resurrecting him, and, shortly after the Alliance and Horde made landfall, the resurrected Thunder King began an earnest campaign to restore the Mogu Empire to glory. He was aided by the united troll forces, with the Council of Elders, a group consisting of the leaders of the Farraki, Gurubashi, Drakkari, and Amani, standing guard over the entrance to his palace.\nIt wasn't long, however, before the forces of the Alliance and Horde assaulted the Thunder King's palace and eliminated the troll presence within, an act that Lei Shen was thankful for as he considered them 'filth'. Shortly afterwards, these adventurers would end Lei Shen's life as well, ending the threat of both empires on Pandaria.\nBlood in the Snow.\nThis failure did not stop the Zandalari. In Dun Morogh, an emissary of Zandalar arrived to aid the Frostmane tribe in building an army to assault Ironforge. Using enslaved elementals, the Frostmane summoned a mighty blizzard around their home and kidnapped a number of dwarven scouts. While the Bronzebeard and Wildhammer clans refused to take action out of distrust for the Dark Iron clans, Moira chose to lead her people to defend Ironforge herself; aided by King Varian Wrynn and a trio of adventurers. Their combined forces rescued the prisoners, stopped the blizzard, and killed Hekima the Wise, ending the Frostmane threat.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; on their campaign across the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; with a strong presence in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and .\nA sole &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Defector%20Dazgo\"&gt;Dazgo&lt;/a&gt; was seen in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third time&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear tribe participated in the defense of Azeroth and offensive against the demons, joining various &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s. Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; also died during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by the demons as well.\nSeveral Zandalari trolls were later found captured by &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the Horde rescued the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; started operating with the Horde, becoming allies.\nEmissaries of all troll tribes gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Speakers\"&gt;Terrace of the Speakers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nTroll hostility.\nMost of Azeroth's savage trolls are infamous for their extreme hatred of other races. Trolls are very isolated beings. Most trolls, excluding a few tribes (one such being the Darkspear), don't speak any of the common languages. Wild jungle trolls are territorial and hostile toward trolls of other tribes. \nThey are highly tribally spiritual. The center of a tribe's spirit is the tribe's &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; or superior &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther than tribes such as the Darkspear, most trolls will attack outsiders on sight, even trolls of other tribes. Uncivilized trolls live all across Kalimdor and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The jungle near &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Kingdoms is infamous for its many aggressive jungle troll inhabitants.\nHowever, trolls &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20Camp\"&gt;willing to fight and work&lt;/a&gt; for travelers and armies in exchange for gold are not unknown. &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Dissension\"&gt;used troll mercenaries on a mission&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend (though they were likely retconned into human mercenaries). The &lt;a href=\"Shadowtooth\"&gt;Shadowtooth&lt;/a&gt; tribe of &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s also assisted in the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;.\nTroll language.\nWhen speaking &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"common%20%28language%29\"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; or any other &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, trolls often sound as Caribbean and African people would speak English. However, when speaking their own, native language of Zandali, the accent is not necessary but likely varying between the various subgroups, tribes, and empires.\nIt is unknown how much their tusks, especially those of male trolls, affect their pronunciation and/or accent, especially for &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s whose tusks are much larger than most.\nTroll names.\nTrolls, both male and female, often have names with &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt; suffixes and/or prefixes, sometimes consisting entirely of both. They also do not normally have family names as seen by the majority of trolls lacking one, however, there are exceptions, of which some adopt the name of their tribe as their surname, as seen below.\nTrolls with surnames.\nWhile it is fairly rare (and a minority) to see trolls bearing surnames (especially of &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt; spelling &amp; meaning) there are trolls that do, such as:\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Lore%23What_is_.22canon.22_lore.3F\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;\nTrolls with shared surnames\nNotes.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"comic\"&gt;comic&lt;/a&gt;s &amp; &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt; \nIn the \nIn the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt; \nTroll titles.\nThe following prefixes or suffixes are added to a troll's name to denote positions of honor or tribal status:\nCannibalism and voodoo.\n&lt;a href=\"Cannibalism\"&gt;Cannibalism&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively common troll practice. Several specific troll tribes have been confirmed as cannibalistic, including the &lt;a href=\"Mossflayer\"&gt;Mossflayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; tribes. All of the currently known tribes of &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s practice cannibalism. Sand trolls, forest trolls, dark trolls, and jungle trolls are also frequently cannibalistic. Notable exceptions include the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; tribes. The &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; practiced cannibalism until they joined forces with the Horde, who forbade the practice.\nNot all trolls practice &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt;, but it is as widespread as cannibalism. Little is known about the emergence of voodoo among the trolls, for most tribes that possess such knowledge are unwilling to share it with outsiders. However, with the recent advent of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s to Yojamba Isle, many researchers have speculated that voodoo may have originated with the Zandalari.\nDire trolls.\nA small number of trolls are strikingly larger and more heavily muscled than the rest of their brethren. &lt;a href=\"Dire%20troll\"&gt;Dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s do not have a racial distinction from the rest of the troll race. A variety of reasons might be behind this unusual size and musculature. For example, these trolls might have been altered alchemically or magically (see &lt;a href=\"troll%20berserker\"&gt;troll berserker&lt;/a&gt;). They might also simply have evolved to be larger than average. These large trolls are not regarded as monstrous by other trolls.\nSome trolls appear capable of turning into a dire troll at will, such as &lt;a href=\"Battok%20the%20Berserker\"&gt;Battok the Berserker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Berserker%20%28Throne%20of%20Thunder%29\"&gt;Gurubashi Berserkers&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nMummification.\nDisplayed in many troll tribes, the trolls have mummified their deceased in the past. In all cases seen so far, the trolls have had the power to reanimate their dead. The &lt;a href=\"Sandfury\"&gt;Sandfury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; are such tribes. Other races can also reanimate deceased and mummified trolls, as can be seen in Northrend, where many undead trolls are a part of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; legions.\nThe Zandalari started to move away from mummification to favor cremation after a blood plague broke out.\nFaith.\nThe troll belief system is complex, full of dark spirits and primal, often animalistic gods known as &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. Countless loa exist, most weak, but some very powerful. Most are shapeless, whereas others have animal or creature forms. Troll families often worship their own family loa, cities usually have their own civic deities, and the greatest loa are worshiped by the nation as a whole. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; believe that powerful, enlightened Zandalari can become loa upon their death.\nTroll groups.\nOther kinds of trolls are mentioned, but their validity is disputed:\nHistory of their discovery.\nAt one time, only four groups of trolls had been discovered on the continents of the Eastern Kingdoms and other known lands. It was commonly believed by eminent scholars from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere that these were the only four groups of trolls on all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. These included forest trolls, jungle trolls, ice trolls, and the Zandalari themselves. &lt;a href=\"Alonda\"&gt;Alonda&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; strongly believed that there was a fifth groups yet to be discovered based on references she had discovered in her research. Her theory was commonly ridiculed by most scholars in the world, including &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. It was also believed that trolls were nearly extinct, but were reappearing with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring the Third War, with the discovery of Kalimdor, two more groups were discovered including the rare sand trolls and dark trolls, found only on that continent. The orcs discovered the Darkspear island trolls, an offshoot of the jungle trolls, on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20islands\"&gt;Darkspear islands&lt;/a&gt; during their flight from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Zandalari trolls were first encountered by various races when they set up an expedition on Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale in order to find allies to defeat the god Hakkar, mentioned above.\nHistorians and physicians generally classify trolls into four categories: forest trolls, jungle trolls, ice trolls, and sand trolls. The trolls of the Zandalar tribe are considered unclassifiable because the Zandalari are the earliest known trolls, from whom all other trolls are descended. Some debate exists as to how many categories are necessary in order to describe the various groups within the troll race. Several notable authorities on the topic have chosen to specify a fifth category: namely, the dark trolls.\nIn \"Warcraft III\", dark trolls are referred to as dark forest trolls, implying they believe them be a type of forest troll or derivation thereof. Darkspear trolls are mainly classified as &lt;a href=\"island%20trolls\"&gt;island trolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Day of the Dragon,\" &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; talks about trolls: \"As with elves, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and especially humans, there had existed different types of trolls. Some few spoke with the sophistication of elves \u2014 even while they tried to take one's head. Others ranged toward the more savage, especially those who frequented the barrows and other underground realms. Yet Vereesa doubted that there could be any lower form of troll than the three base creatures that had captured her and &lt;a href=\"Falstad\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and clearly had darker designs for them.\"\nSome of the scholarly debate includes those that classify Zandalar trolls as jungle trolls or as their own species. Trolls found in desert areas are classified as desert trolls. Because there is only evidence of a single tribe of the species in existence, scholars have begun to classify the species as the Sandfury trolls. Most scholars think them a small and anomalous deviation of the more common troll species, namely the jungle trolls.\nPlayable race.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", only trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; are playable. The Horde-aligned forest troll tribe, the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt;, has a village in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. Another Horde-aligned jungle troll tribe, the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore and legends.\nThere are many tales and legends of trolls in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the known tales today come from the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;. With the many millennia of trolls having inhabited Azeroth and documented history, the amount of undiscovered legends and stories is likely very high.\nMoon over the Vale.\n&lt;a href=\"Moon%20Over%20the%20Vale\"&gt;Moon Over the Vale&lt;/a&gt; is a short poem or song describing the life of these trolls on an old stone tablet.\nGri'lek the Wanderer.\n&lt;a href=\"Gri%27lek%20the%20Wanderer\"&gt;Gri'lek the Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; tells of a troll who lost his arm. Because he turned away from the spirits, he's now doomed to wander. The story is written on a stone tablet, but there's also a &lt;a href=\"Worn%20Leather%20Book\"&gt;Worn Leather Book&lt;/a&gt; named \"Arm of Gri'lek\".\nFall of Gurubashi.\n&lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Gurubashi\"&gt;Fall of Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; is a legend carved in a stone tablet how &lt;a href=\"Min%27loth\"&gt;Min'loth&lt;/a&gt; fought an ancient &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed afterwards.\nThe Emperor's Tomb.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Emperor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;The Emperor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; is a very short poem or song, which tells the trolls to leave or die. Like most troll lore, it can be found on a stone tablet\nThe Stone of the Tides.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;The Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; is a Gurubashi legend about a mighty artifact - the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;. It chooses a so-called &lt;a href=\"Tidebearer\"&gt;Tidebearer&lt;/a&gt;, giving him immense power, but also killing him slowly. The only source of this tale today is the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library\"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Twin Empires.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Twin%20Empires\"&gt;The Twin Empires&lt;/a&gt; is an in-game book that describes how the Gurubashi and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;s defeated &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Founding of Quel'Thalas.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;The Founding of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; is an in-game book that describes the first encounter between the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar\"&gt;Dath'Remar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nArathor and the Troll Wars.\n&lt;a href=\"Arathor%20and%20the%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Arathor and the Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; is an in-game book that describes how the trolls were defeated by the combined &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and high elf forces.\nOthers.\n&lt;a href=\"Legends%20of%20the%20Gurubashi%2C%20Volume%203\"&gt;Legends of the Gurubashi, Volume 3&lt;/a&gt; is an essay about troll legends.

Trolls are an ancient and widespread people, with most living savage, crude lifestyles and attacking other races on sight. The Darkspears originally hailed from the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, but after being pushed out by warring tribes, they found an unlikely friendship with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and sailed with them to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;new lands&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to , due to a &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;traitor&lt;/a&gt; having taken control of &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;their intended home&lt;/a&gt;, trolls started out alongside orcs in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt;. This changed when the Darkspears at long last reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Isle\"&gt;Darkspear Isle&lt;/a&gt;, which is now where they begin their adventures.\nAlongside being where young trolls start out, Darkspear Isle serves as a capital of sorts for the tribe (albeit a small one). The troll racial mount is a &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;, and their language is &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;. They have also learned &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with their allies. Troll characters can select from ten classes or every class except two (paladin and demon hunter), a versatility matched only by dwarves and blood elves.\nCustomizations for this race include the ability to depict either a &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nCreation screen description.\n\"Once at home in the jungles of Stranglethorn Vale, the fierce trolls of the Darkspear tribe were pushed out by warring factions. Eventually the trolls befriended the orcish Horde, and Thrall, the orcs' young warchief, convinced the trolls to travel with him to Kalimdor. Though they cling to their shadowy heritage, the Darkspear trolls hold a place of honor in the Horde.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"The Darkspear tribe of Trolls, ousted from their tropical homelands, pledged their arms and shadowy magics to the Horde after having been saved by the orcs in a time of need. Now, these fierce people seek to reclaim the former glory of their tribe.\"\nClassic opening cutscene.\n\"The vicious trolls that populate the numerous jungle isles of the South Seas, are renowned for their cruelty and dark mysticism. Barbarous and superstitious, they carry a seething hatred for all other races. Long since exiled from their ancestral homeland in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear tribe was nearly destroyed by rampaging &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Rescued by the young &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his orcish warriors, the Darkspear tribe swore an allegiance to the Horde. Led by the cunning Shadow Hunter, Vol'jin, the Darkspears now make their home in Durotar along with their orcish allies. As one of the only surviving Darkspears, it falls to you to reclaim the glory of your tribe.\"\nCataclysm opening cutscene.\n\"Exiled years ago from their land in Stranglethorn Vale, the Darkspear trolls attempted to make a new home for themselves among the disparate races of the Horde. Under the leadership of the noble Warchief Thrall, Vol'jin and his savage trolls had finally found the honor and purpose they had been searching for but now, under the rule of the headstrong Garrosh Hellscream, the trolls fear that the Horde could tear itself apart. Vol'jin knows that whatever threats loom ahead, whether they be from within the Horde or from without, it is cunning trolls like you that will fight to preserve the honor of the Horde.\"\nHistory.\nAs tribal rivalries erupted throughout the former &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear tribe found themselves driven from their homeland in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Having settled on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20islands\"&gt;Darkspear islands&lt;/a&gt;, which are believed today to have been a part of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the tribe soon found themselves entangled in a conflict with a group of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually they also found new enemies in &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s when a &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;-fleet landed on the island in search for some orcs who had stolen some ships. The trolls' fate seemed sealed until the orcish &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his band of newly freed orcs, which were the orcs the humans were looking for, took shelter on the island after a heavy storm. The orcs managed to defeat the humans, but their victory was short-lived. Controlled by a &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Underworld%20Minions\"&gt;Underworld Minions&lt;/a&gt; captured the Darkspears' leader &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; along with Thrall and several orcs, trolls and humans. They were all brought to a complex prison made by caves below the island. Thrall managed to free himself and his companions, but was ultimately unable to save the trolls' leader. Although &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; was sacrificed to the Sea Witch, he was able to reveal a vision he had in which Thrall would lead the Darkspear trolls from the island.\nAfter returning to the island's surface, Thrall and his followers managed to fend off further attacks by the Sea Witch and her murloc minions, and set sail for Kalimdor once again. Under the new leadership of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear swore allegiance to Thrall's &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and followed him to Kalimdor. Now considered enemies by all other troll organizations except the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear\"&gt;Shatterspear&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear are held in contempt to this day. Yet, the Darkspear have not forgotten being driven from their ancestral homes, and this animosity is eagerly returned - especially towards the other jungle trolls. Having reached and founded the orc's new homeland, &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls carved out another home for themselves \u2014 this time among the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern shores of the new orc kingdom.\nHowever, with another approach by Kul Tiras and its navy, the Darkspear were forced to retreat inland under the onslaught of the misguided commander &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The trolls, fighting alongside their Horde brethren led by the &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, defeated the enemy and reclaimed their new home. Shortly thereafter, a witch doctor by the name of &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; began using dark magic to take the minds of his fellow Darkspear. As his army of mindless followers grew, Vol'jin ordered the free trolls to evacuate, and Zalazane took control of the Echo Isles. The Darkspear have since settled on the nearby shore, naming their new village after their old leader, Sen'jin. From &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; they, along with their allies, send forces to battle Zalazane and his enslaved army.\nThe Darkspears\u2019 efforts, however, failed to drive Zalazane from the Echo Isles. Following the victory against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in the frozen continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Vol\u2019jin renewed his bid to defeat Zalazane and launched a brilliant assault on the isles. With the help of the tribe\u2019s ancestral loa, the courageous Darkspears killed the maddened witch doctor and seized their embattled home. Of late, political changes within the Horde have sparked fears among the Darkspear tribe regarding its future. Vol\u2019jin\u2019s close ally Thrall recently named Garrosh Hellscream temporary Horde warchief. Thus far, the brash young orc has put the Darkspear leader and his tribe on edge, causing many trolls to leave the Horde capital, Orgrimmar. Although spirits are high among the Darkspears after Zalazane\u2019s Fall, tension lingers concerning what place the trolls will have in Garrosh\u2019s Horde.\nAppearance.\nDarkspear trolls have skin colors that range from pale, ghostly blue to bruised purple to sickly green. Their skin color is usually just one of those three colors, although sometimes there are trolls with mixed skin pigments but this is not so common. Trolls' hair is usually brightly coloured, ranging from vibrant purple to deep green. Hair is usually grown long by both males and females, and often styled in a striking arrangement. Trolls have large, long ears often pierced with rings, and long, pointed noises, with both of these feature more pronounced in males. \nFemale &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s are on average 7'2\" tall while males stand at a much taller 8'4\", however, males tend to slouch over and thus hide their true height. Males\u2014despite their height\u2014are of a lithe and slender build, with long limbs and faces. Male trolls have long, protruding tusks that grow from their upper jaw, large noses and long ears not unlike those of night elves. Female trolls on the other hand stand up straight and possess wildly different tusks; instead of growing from their upper jaw, female tusks are elongated lower canines.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Good at destroying buildings and flying units (with their suicidal special ability). The fire obsessed troll batriders are often used as reconnaissance for the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nInformation.\nTroll Batriders are fairly weak aerial units like &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Machine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Flying Machines&lt;/a&gt;, though they make up for it with their roles of unconventional anti-air killers.\nBatriders come with the Unstable Concoction ability upon being trained. It can only be used on aerial units, but it is a powerful ability against armies that have massed aerial units. When used, the Batrider becomes invulnerable and flies towards the targeted air unit, killing themselves but also dealing 600 damage to the primary target and 140 splash damage to nearby aerial units. This ability is extremely effective against enemy air units, as well timed and placed suicide runs can destroy whole aerial armies in seconds.\nWhen the Fortress is obtained, the research Liquid Fire becomes available. Once researched, this ability allows the Batrider's attacks to prevent enemy workers from repairing their buildings until the fire is extinguished. With 15 or so Batriders, they can easily raze a base if it is not well-defended. You may want to bring &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wind Rider&lt;/a&gt;s with them to help take out enemy workers due to siege's poor damage against all but unarmored-type armor.\nIf the player attempts to use Troll Batriders to target your town halls, build a ring of defensive towers around them. The Troll Batrider has poor range, low health and cloth armor, so massed towers of any sort will easily repel any attack from them.\nOutside of bases, simply running ground heavy armies will work, since the Troll Batrider deals negligible damage towards them. &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Engine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Siege Engines&lt;/a&gt; with Barrage work wonders on them, despite being countered by their siege damage.\nSpells and abilities.\nUnstable oncoction.\nThis is the Orc's anti-air option, as Wind Riders are general heavy air units that will have trouble dealing with anti-air specialists. It should only be used on &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Machine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s because Unstable Concoction will generally kill them in a single cast, while it'll take more to kill a &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gryphon Rider&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrm&lt;/a&gt; which is a bad trade-off on your resources. However, Batriders can still be used as emergency anti-air for ground-based armies. A surprise Batrider attack can clean out the enemy's air power or at least eliminate key targets, letting you clean up and push the advantage with your superior ground force while the enemy must take time to rebuild.\nNote that skilled Undead players may use Stone Form if their Gargoyles get targeted. If the Batrider targets the Gargoyle and he is charging when it uses Stone Form, then the Troll Batrider will die without killing the Gargoyle. \nUnstable Concoction deals physical damage, meaning it is reduced by armor. Even fragile targets like Gargoyles can often survive an Unstable Concoction with armor upgrades.\nThe attack is a success when the Batrider yells \"The ends justify da' means!\".\niquid Fire (Passive).\nIf the Batriders are sent to attack bases, this is a useful ability to prevent defensive towers from dealing as much damage, and prevents workers from repairing buildings struck by the Batrider. It is generally less effective against human players due to their ability to compact more towers in a smaller area, along with two of their three defensive towers possessing Heavy instead of Fortified armor."}

Here you can learn about: \nTroll Categories.\nHistorians and physicians generally classify trolls into four categories: forest trolls, jungle trolls, ice trolls, and sand trolls. The trolls of the Zandalar tribe are considered unclassifiable because the Zandalari are the earliest known trolls, from whom all other trolls are descended.\nThere is some debate as to how many categories are necessary in order to describe the troll race. Several notable authorities on the topic have chosen to specify a fifth category: namely, the dark trolls. \nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/&lt;/a&gt;."}

All that is known for certain is that a tribe of nocturnal humanoids came to live on the shores of the first Well of Eternity, and the Well's cosmic energies changed them into the night elves we know today.\nCertainly many trolls do believe that the humanoids who developed into the night elf race were trolls. The theory does have some credibility, for there is at least a superficial physical resemblance between trolls and night elves. Furthermore, the troll race dominated much of ancient Kalimdor--the only continent on Azeroth before the Great Sundering--long before the night elves came into power.\nNevertheless, many night elves find this theory preposterous and abhorrent. They are quick to point out that the first night elves began their rise to power by defeating a number of nearby troll tribes. As a consequence, the trolls came to fear and respect the might of their new rivals. The troll theory of night elf ancestry may have been a direct result of this early conflict. The trolls hated the night elves--a sentiment that persists to this day--and may have wished to marginalize the night elf race and its accomplishments. Also, attributing the night elf race with a troll heritage likely helped the trolls come to terms with their own shocking defeat.\nWithout additional data, there is little point in debating the merits of this controversial theory. No doubt it will remain a matter of contention for years to come.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/trollsandnightelves.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/trollsandnightelves.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

From their beginnings as lords of Kalimdor to the devestation of the Sundering and the rise and fall of the Gurubashi and Amani Empires, the trolls share a blood-stained history.\nThe Rise of Troll Civilization.\nThe earliest known trolls belonged to the Zandalar tribe, from which all other trolls are descended. On the whole, the Zandalari valued knowledge above all else, but a significant portion of the tribe hungered for conquest instead. These disaffected trolls eventually departed to form tribes of their own. As time went on, what remained of the Zandalar tribe came to be regarded as an overarching priest caste for all trolls. The Zandalari worked tirelessly to record and preserve troll history and traditions, and these wise trolls acted to further the goals of troll society as a whole. Greatly respected by all other trolls, the Zandalari nevertheless remained apart from the day-to-day politics of their people.\nAbout 16,000 years ago, trolls lorded over much of ancient Kalimdor, which was the only continent on Azeroth at the time. Out of the tribes that had split off from the Zandalari, two troll empires had emerged: the Gurubashi empire of the southeastern jungles and the Amani empire of the middle forestlands.\nSeveral smaller troll tribes were also driven out of civilized lands and into the far north, where they settled in the region that would later be known as Northrend. These tribes founded a small nation known as Zul'Drak, but this kingdom never achieved the size or prosperity of the southern empires.\nThe Gurubashi and Amani empires had little love for one another, but their conflict rarely escalated into war. At the time, their greatest common enemy was a third empire: the civilization of Azj\u2019Aqir. The aqir were intelligent insectoids who ruled the lands of the far west. These clever insectoids were greatly expansionistic and incredibly evil. The aqir were obsessed with eradicating all non-insect life from the fields of Kalimdor.\nThe trolls fought the aqir for thousands of years, but never succeeded in winning a true victory. Eventually, due to the trolls' persistence, the aqiri kingdom split in half. Its citizens fled to separate colonies in the far northern and southern regions of the continent. Two aqiri city-states emerged: Azjol-Nerub in the northern wastes, and Ahn\u2019Qiraj in the southern desert. Although the trolls suspected that there were other aqiri colonies beneath Kalimdor, their existence was never verified.\nWith the insectoids driven into exile, the two troll empires returned to business as usual. Neither civilization expanded much farther than its original boundaries.\nNewer Foes: The Kaldorei.\nThe night elves developed along the shores of the Well of Eternity, and so they were strengthened by its energies. Despite the trolls\u2019 attempts to keep this new race from claiming further territories, the night elves built up a mighty empire that expanded rapidly across Kalimdor. Wielding fierce magics never before imagined by the trolls, the night elves soon threatened the two greatest empires in the world.\nThe night elves systematically dismantled the troll\u2019s defenses and supply chains. Unable to counter the elves\u2019 destructive magics, the trolls buckled under the onslaught. The territories of the Gurubashi and Amani empires fragmented within only a few years, and the night elves' shockingly quick victory incurred the trolls' eternal hatred.\nEventually the night elves were burned by the arcane fires they had sought to control: the elves' reckless use of magic lured the Burning Legion to the world of Azeroth. The demons crushed much of the night elves\u2019 civilization. There are no records to indicate that the Legion attacked either troll civilization, but it is likely that battles took place across the breadth of the continent.\nAt the end of this terrible conflict, known today as the War of the Ancients, the Well of Eternity imploded. The resulting shockwave shattered ancient Kalimdor into several landmasses and drove the center of the continent far beneath the sea. Large tracts of land that once belonged to the Amani and Gurubashi empires still exist in the present-day lands of Quel\u2019Thalas and Stranglethorn, respectively.\nA Savage God.\nThe long centuries following the Great Sundering were difficult ones for the troll race. The dauntless trolls rebuilt their ravaged cities and set about reclaiming some of their former power. Even so, famine and terror became commonplace within the broken kingdoms. The jungle trolls, driven to desperate ends, sought aid from ancient mystical forces. Both troll empires shared a central belief in a great pantheon of primitive gods, but the Gurubashi empire alone would fall under the sway of the darkest one.\nHakkar the Soulflayer answered the jungle trolls\u2019 plea. Hakkar gave the trolls his secrets of blood and helped them extend their civilization across most of Stranglethorn Vale and certain islands in the South Seas. He brought the jungle trolls great power, but in return the bloodthirsty god required that souls be sacrificed to him.\nHis demands quickly escalated, and he grew impatient with his loyal priests, the Hakkari. He told them to find a way to summon him physically into the world, so that he might directly drain the blood of his victims. So vast was his hunger that he dreamed of devouring the lives of all mortal creatures. Most of the Hakkari had already begun to guess at his insatiable appetite, and they were horrified at the prospect of the damage he might wreak and the power he might gain if given the ability to feed unchecked. Nonetheless, the Atal'ai, a small extremist faction of the Hakkari, decided to do as Hakkar wished.\nCivil War Among the Jungle Trolls.\nBefore the Atal'ai could complete the summoning, the other jungle trolls, including the Hakkari, rose up in open revolt against the cruel god. Even the Zandalar tribe was drawn into the conflict, for they saw that Hakkar presented a deadly threat to the entire world. The magics that were unleashed laid waste to Zul'Gurub, but just as the battle seemed most hopeless, the trolls succeeded in destroying Hakkar\u2019s avatar. Driven from the jungles, the Atal'ai were hunted nearly to extinction. Only a small group of Atal'ai escaped into the Swamp of Sorrows, where they secretly built a great temple to their god: the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.\nHaving helped fight the fanatical Atal'ai, the Hakkari hoped their role in carrying out sacrifices for Hakkar would go unpunished. They soon discovered otherwise. Once the more immediate threat of the Atal'ai had been eliminated, the jungle trolls turned on the Hakkari as well. Many former priests were tortured and executed in grisly public spectacles. Others were torn apart in mob violence. The luckiest Hakkari were simply stripped of all their possessions and forcibly ejected from Zul'Gurub. They were warned not to return on pain of death.\nBitter and desperate, the surviving Hakkari reached a terrible decision. They tracked down their former enemies, the Atal'ai, and offered to help them summon Hakkar into the world. Pleased by the suffering that the Hakkari had clearly undergone, the Atal'ai were convinced of the Hakkari's change of heart, and accordingly welcomed them into the temple. The Atal'ai and Hakkari continued to do their god's work there, preparing for his arrival into the physical world. The green Dragon Aspect, Ysera the Dreamer, soon learned of the evil priests' plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's ruins are guarded by mighty green dragons.\nThe remnants of the Gurubashi empire went their separate ways, claiming territories in the vast jungles of Stranglethorn Vale. These scattered tribes began fighting one another, and at length the Darkspear tribe, which was smaller than most of the other tribes, was driven off the continent altogether and took to the ocean. Hoping to avoid further conflict, they settled on a remote desert island.\nA fragile peace settled over the broken empire. Nevertheless, trolls spoke of a prophecy that Hakkar would one day be reborn into the world, and on that day, he would consume it whole.\nDefeat of the Amani Empire.\nThe War of the Ancients and the Sundering both came about because the night elves had abused arcane magic. Still, the highest caste of night elves, the Highborne, refused to relinquish arcane magic. As a result, they were exiled from Kalimdor, and they sailed across the sea and landed in Lordaeron. These exiles renamed themselves the high elves.\nAs they pressed further inland, the high elves developed a blood feud with the forest trolls, who controlled most of the northern reaches of Lordaeron. Finally the weary elves reached a forested region that reminded them of their distant homeland in Kalimdor. Driving out the resident trolls, the high elves established the kingdom of Quel\u2019Thalas.\nElven magi crafted monolithic Runestones along the borders of Quel\u2019Thalas. These massive stones powered a magical shield intended to mask the elves' magic from extra-dimensional threats and protect the land from invasion. The Runestones also frightened away the superstitious trolls for a time.\nThe hard-won peace of Quel'Thalas endured for roughly four thousand years, at which point the forest trolls gathered together and staged a vicious campaign to destroy the elven intruders forever. The high elves were hopelessly outnumbered. King Anasterian Sunstrider of Quel'Thalas desperately sought allies to aid him in the war, and so it came to pass that the king struck a partnership with the human nation of Arathor.\nThe elves taught a small number of humans how to wield magic. With these new magi and the armies of Arathor, the high elves succeeded in destroying the trolls\u2019 power base. The Amani empire would never fully recover from its defeat. \nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/trolls/history.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/history.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

In addition, the tribe takes justifiable pride in counting &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; as one of its members. In spite of his disappearance after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Zul'jin remains the most famous and respected forest troll in history.\nAfter the Amani empire was shattered by the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, most forest trolls settled in areas that were a comfortable distance from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Amani tribe sneered at such precautions as cowardice. Beset by the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;' powerful sorcery, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; was greatly reduced in size, but the Amani tribe remained entrenched at the easternmost edge of the enchanted kingdom.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; into Quel'Thalas during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani tribe witnessed the resulting slaughter with glee. Acting swiftly, the trolls launched a series of attacks on high elf settlements in the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. To the trolls' surprise, the few high elves who had survived the invasion seemed greatly weakened and put up a poor fight. The Amani claimed a significant portion of the forest before the elf &lt;a href=\"Prince\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Quel'Thalas.\nGathering all the surviving elves he could find, the prince gave them a new name: the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. These blood elves began draining &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; from nearby creatures, and they seemed to gain new strength. Even worse, Kael'thas organized them into a fighting force that proved frustratingly effective against the Amani tribe's efforts, even after Kael'thas and his strongest warriors left Quel'Thalas to fight the Scourge elsewhere.\nIn recent days, the blood elves have shown signs of increased magical training and use. The elves' spells have increased in power, and they have rebuilt portions of Quel'Thalas. Most infuriating of all, the blood elves have begun retaking Eversong Forest. Nevertheless the Amani tribe remains fiercely dedicated to its battle against the elves, for the greatly diminished elven populace cannot long prevail alone in fighting both the trolls to the east and the Scourge to the south.\n&lt;a href=\"Firetree%20Tribe\"&gt;Firetree Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhere: &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;\nCategory: &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s\nLeader: Unknown\nBackground: The Firetree trolls are one of two tribes of forest trolls that belong to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;, a renegade group of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, trolls, and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s who dwell in Blackrock Spire. Commanded by &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Horde has not given up the battle to claim &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, although Rend's forces are significantly smaller than &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. A group of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s drives the Dark Horde, which has not relinquished the original Horde's involvement in &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;demonic magic&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Horde is essentially still fighting the Second War, but Rend and his group know that they stand little chance of success, despite their alliance with the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dark Horde's numbers are dwindling, and it has no means of recruiting new members. Realistically these evil individuals are well aware that their days are numbered. Such knowledge has given them a grim mindset: they are desperate, bitter, and completely ruthless in battle.\nFiretree trolls revere the memory of Zul'jin and consider the &lt;a href=\"Smolderthorn%20tribe\"&gt;Smolderthorn tribe&lt;/a&gt; acceptable allies, but despise all other forest trolls as deserters, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which is loosely affiliated with Thrall's Horde. Ironically the Revantusks consider the Firetree trolls traitors for failing to leave Blackrock Spire and aid Thrall and his followers, for the Revantusks believe that Thrall leads the true Horde. In general, trolls outside the Dark Horde have long since decided that the Firetree and Smolderthorn trolls are insane for allying themselves with the black dragonflight and continuing to fight an unwinnable war (if, indeed, it can be called a war).\n&lt;a href=\"Mossflayer%20tribe\"&gt;Mossflayer Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhere: &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; (primarily in the northeast and southwest)\nCategory: &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s\nLeader: Unknown\nBackground: The Mossflayer tribe split off from the Amani empire after the Troll Wars and decided to abandon that section of Lordaeron altogether. Even so, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity continued to harry the forest trolls. The Mossflayer tribe had been driven out of much of its ancestral territory in Lordaeron by the time the Second War broke out.\nLike all other forest trolls, the Mossflayers allied themselves with the Horde during the Second War under the leadership of Zul'jin, a famous troll hero from the Amani tribe. When the Horde was soundly defeated, Zul'jin disappeared, and the forest trolls abandoned their orcish allies. Disgusted with the Horde's defeat, the Mossflayer trolls decided they would have nothing further to do with such incompetent and reckless allies.\nInstead, the trolls focused on trying to keep humanity from overrunning all of Lordaeron. When the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; began spreading across the land, the Mossflayer tribe was quick to take advantage of the blossoming chaos. Because the plague was designed to convert only the human race into undeath, human defenses soon faltered, and the Mossflayers managed to retake parts of their ancient territory.\nThe plague has since had taken its toll on the landscape. The verdant lands in which the Mossflayer tribe settled now form the northeast corner of the Eastern Plaguelands. The plants and animals, while not undead, are diseased and decaying. Yet despite these nightmarish conditions, the trolls have refused to relinquish the lands they had just recovered.\nA large hunting party of Mossflayer trolls left their settlement some time ago in search of live game to take back to their people. The hunt took them far from home, for many animals had been affected by the plague. At last the trolls came upon several animals that seemed healthy. Slaying the beasts, the trolls rewarded themselves by feasting on a portion of the hunt.\nUnfortunately for the hunting party, a powerful &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; had deliberately altered the beasts. Any living creature that consumed the animals' flesh would be converted into undeath. Afterwards, the lich was able to impose his will upon the &lt;a href=\"undead%20troll\"&gt;undead troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Following the lich's commands, most of the undead trolls formed a base of operations in the southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the undead trolls was given a horrifying mission by his new master: to return home and infect the rest of his people. &lt;a href=\"Infiltrator%20Hameya\"&gt;Hameya&lt;/a&gt; managed to hold onto his willpower long enough to scribble a brief account of what had occurred. His desperate note offered a reward for anyone who killed him before he reached his home.\nRecent reports on the Mossflayer tribe paint a grim picture of subsequent events. A large number of fresh graves have been dug near the village, and several undead trolls have been spotted, hiding themselves among their unsuspecting brethren. It would seem that no one was able to stop Hameya in time, and he succeeded in accomplishing the lich's dread mission. Unless the Mossflayers come to their senses and flee the Eastern Plaguelands, the tribe will certainly be transformed in its entirety.\n&lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Tribe\"&gt;Revantusk Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhere: &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; (primarily in &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Village\"&gt;Revantusk Village&lt;/a&gt;)\nCategory: &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s\nLeader: &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Torntusk\"&gt;Primal Torntusk&lt;/a&gt;\nBackground: Never one of the larger tribes in the Amani empire, the Revantusk tribe was nearly wiped out by the Troll Wars. Reluctantly the trolls yielded to practicality and moved a safe distance away from the elven invaders. Like other forest trolls, the Revantusks swore that one day they would have their revenge.\nThe Second War gave the forest trolls that opportunity. &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; asked the trolls to ally themselves with the Horde. In return, Doomhammer promised that the Horde would vanquish the high elves and assist the forest trolls in reestablishing the Amani empire.\nAs leader of all the forest trolls at the time, Zul'jin eventually accepted Doomhammer's offer. A few tribes of forest trolls joined their new allies on the battlefield. Shortly thereafter, the Horde burned down the borderlands of Quel\u2019Thalas and slaughtered many high elf civilians. Furious at this wanton destruction of life, the elves subsequently committed all their resources to the war, which the Alliance ultimately won.\nSeveral additional battles later, most of the vanquished orcs on Azeroth were rounded up and placed in &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s. In the war's disastrous aftermath, the Horde was shattered, and many forest trolls deserted their former orc allies without a moment's hesitation. The Revantusks had little choice other than to flee as well, for their numbers were far too few to liberate the captive orcs, particularly when the orcs themselves seemed uninterested in freedom. Because they continued to feel some loyalty toward the Horde, the Revantusks were the target of many attacks from other forest trolls. Eventually the Revantusk tribe relocated to the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, where they hoped to avoid further notice.\nThen the courageous orc Thrall began reassembling a new Horde. He resolved that his people would return to their &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic traditions and establish a nation of their own. Word of the revitalized Horde and its noble goals soon reached the Revantusk trolls, who were still dwelling in Lordaeron. The news stirred the trolls' interest, and the tribe immediately dispatched its speediest runners to make contact with the orcs.\nThrall was wary of the trolls at first, but he came to see that the Revantusk trolls were unique among forest trolls in a fundamental way. The Revantusk tribe had never had much in the way of the fighters or resources, and so it had instead decided to specialize in the trickier art of negotiation. By the time they spoke with Thrall, the Revantusks had acquired a reputation for trustworthiness that was well deserved.\nThe trolls were impressed by Thrall and his dream. Even so, they remembered the recklessness and corruption of the first Horde. Thus, the Revantusks declined to rejoin the Horde, but they did agree to a pact of friendship and mutual assistance.\nToday the Revantusk tribe continues to live in a village along the southeast coast of the Hinterlands. Due to the tribe's small size and the Revantusks' pact with Thrall, all other forest trolls regard the Revantusk trolls as weaklings and enemies. Similarly the honorable Revantusks regard other forest trolls as traitors to the Horde. There is also a long-standing enmity between the Revantusk tribe and the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, who dwell in the Hinterlands and are considered enemies of the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Smolderthorn%20tribe\"&gt;Smolderthorn Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhere: &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;\nCategory: &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s\nLeader: &lt;a href=\"War%20Master%20Voone\"&gt;Warmaster Voone&lt;/a&gt;\nBackground: The Smolderthorn trolls are one of two tribes of forest trolls that belong to the Dark Horde, a renegade group of orcs, trolls, and ogres who dwell in Blackrock Spire. Commanded by Rend Blackhand, the Dark Horde has not given up the battle to claim Azeroth, although Rend's forces are significantly smaller than Thrall's Horde. A group of warlocks drives the Dark Horde, which has not relinquished the original Horde's involvement in demonic magic. The Dark Horde is essentially still fighting the Second War, but Rend and his group know that they stand little chance of success, despite their alliance with the black dragonflight.\nThe Dark Horde's numbers are dwindling, and it has no means of recruiting new members. Realistically these evil individuals are well aware that their days are numbered. Such knowledge has given them a grim mindset: they are desperate, bitter, and completely ruthless in battle.\nSmolderthorn trolls revere the memory of Zul'jin and consider the &lt;a href=\"Firetree%20tribe\"&gt;Firetree tribe&lt;/a&gt; acceptable allies, but despise all other forest trolls as deserters, particularly the Revantusk tribe, which is loosely affiliated with Thrall's Horde. Ironically the Revantusks consider the Smolderthorn trolls traitors for failing to leave Blackrock Spire and aid Thrall and his followers, for the Revantusks believe that Thrall leads the true Horde. In general, trolls outside the Dark Horde have long since decided that the Smolderthorn and Firetree trolls are insane for allying themselves with the black dragonflight and continuing to fight an unwinnable war (if, indeed, it can be called a war).\n&lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20Tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhere: &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; (primarily in the east)\nCategory: &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s\nLeader: &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Priestess%20Hexx\"&gt;Vile Priestess Hexx&lt;/a&gt;\nBackground: The Vilebranch tribe split off from the Amani empire after the Troll Wars and returned to their ancestral lands, in the area that is now called the Hinterlands. Like all other forest trolls, the Vilebranch allied themselves with the Horde during the Second War under the leadership of Zul'jin, a famous troll hero from the Amani tribe. When the Horde was soundly defeated, Zul'jin disappeared, and the forest trolls abandoned their orcish allies.\nFurious at the orcs' failure to live up to Doomhammer's promise, the Vilebranch trolls returned home and eventually discovered that the Revantusk tribe had moved into the area. The Vilebranch decided that the small Revantusk tribe would be an easy source of victims for ritual sacrifices.\nIn this assumption, the Vilebranch were mistaken. The Revantusks fought back with strength and cunning, and the Horde began sending reinforcements to aid the Revantusk tribe. Nonetheless, thanks to their unusually large numbers, the Vilebranch trolls remain confident to this day that they will defeat the Revantusks once and for all.\n&lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhere: &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; (primarily in the south) and the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; (primarily in the southeast)\nCategory: &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s\nLeader: Unknown\nBackground: The Witherbark tribe split off from the Amani empire after the Troll Wars and returned to their ancestral lands, in the areas that are now called the Hinterlands and the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Like all other forest trolls, the Witherbarks allied themselves with the Horde during the Second War under the leadership of Zul'jin, a famous troll hero from the Amani tribe. When the Horde was soundly defeated, Zul'jin disappeared, and the forest trolls abandoned their orcish allies.\nThe Witherbarks living in the Hinterlands have since happened across the Revantusks and launched many attacks against the small tribe, but the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; have also become a noticeable threat. In the meantime, the Witherbarks living in Arathi Highlands have grudgingly allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s in order to wipe out a far more hated enemy: the Horde forces who have constructed the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;. \nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/foresttribes.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/foresttribes.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

A thin layer of moss inevitably grows on the skin of forest trolls shortly after they are born and gives them their characteristic green coloring.\nMost forest trolls hold all other races in contempt and will only work with them if doing so might eliminate either a more hated foe or a greater threat. The forest trolls' hostility explains in part why they are regarded as evil by most other races. It is also well documented that forest trolls sometimes practice ritual sacrifices. Although all trolls dislike elves in general due to their contentious past, forest trolls have a special hatred for high elves, blood elves, and orcs.\nHistory: The forest trolls ruled all of Lordaeron long before the Great Sundering. Their empire took its name from the strongest tribe of forest trolls: the Amani. In modern times, the word Amani can refer to the forest trolls' ancient empire (and thus to forest trolls as a whole) or to the Amani tribe in particular. The Amani and Gurubashi empires battled the relentless aqir until the insectoids' kingdom was split in two, but the trolls never achieved a true victory.\nWhen the high elves first arrived in Lordaeron, they used their sorcery to drive the forest trolls out of a region in the north, where the elves subsequently established the enchanted kingdom of Quel'Thalas. The forest trolls resolved to overthrow the elven invaders and topple the spires of Quel'Thalas.\nIn pursuit of this vengeance, the forest trolls united under Zul'jin--the most revered forest troll in history--and allied with the Horde during the Second War. A few of these tribes joined their orcish allies on the battlefield. However, in the war's disastrous aftermath, most forest trolls were furious at the Horde's failure to carry out its promise and deserted the orcs without a moment's hesitation. Zul'jin himself disappeared after the war, but he is still greatly respected by all forest trolls, regardless of their current allegiance.\nOnly one tribe of forest trolls is loosely affiliated with the Horde today: the Revantusk tribe. Two other tribes of forest trolls--Firetree and Smolderthorn--are part of the Dark Horde, a renegade group that is based in Blackrock Spire and led by Rend Blackhand.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/foresttrolls.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/foresttrolls.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

These barbarous trolls settled far in the north of ancient Kalimdor, adapted to their snowy environment, and formed the nation of Zul'Drak. After the Sundering, the Drakkari tribe continued to live in what had become the bitterly cold continent of Northrend. To this day, the ruins of the Drakkari civilization are scattered throughout the eastern side of Northrend.\nLike Zandalari trolls, the Drakkari average eight feet in height: significantly larger than all other documented trolls. There the resemblance ends. Unlike the peaceful Zandalar tribe, Drakkari trolls are a ruthless and savage people who delight in battle and have no interest in the pursuit of knowledge. Hunting is also a popular pastime for Drakkari trolls because raw meat is the primary staple of their diet.\nRegardless of its combat skills, the Drakkari tribe respects the might of the Lich King and does its best to avoid the growing forces of the Scourge. Even so, the Lich King has raised a number of ice trolls into undeath and forced them to serve him. The Scourge has also recently taken possession of Drak'Tharon Keep, an ancient Drakkari citadel. War between the Scourge and the Drakkari may be inevitable, and the outcome would surely be disastrous for the trolls.\nFrostmane Tribe.\nWhere: Dun Morogh\nCategory: Ice trolls\nLeader: Great Father Arctikus\nBackground: The Frostmane tribe was once part of the nation of Zul'Drak. After the Sundering, the Drakkari tribe continued to live in what had become the bitterly cold continent of Northrend. The Frostmane and Winterax tribes, however, later settled in the Eastern Kingdoms. Due to the ice trolls' unrelenting hostility toward outsiders, historians have yet to learn how these two tribes were separated from the Drakkari and came to live so far from the ancient site of Zul'Drak.\nLike the Winterax trolls, Frostmanes do not share the unusually large size of their Drakkari brethren. Even so, the Frostmane trolls have been launching increasingly frequent and aggressive attacks against the dwarves living in Dun Morogh. The dwarves currently consider the Frostmane tribe little more than a nuisance, and have not made a concerted effort to vanquish them.\nWinterax Tribe.\nWhere: Unknown\nCategory: Ice trolls\nLeader: Korrak the Bloodrager\nBackground: The Winterax tribe was once part of the nation of Zul'Drak. After the Sundering, the Drakkari tribe continued to live in what had become the bitterly cold continent of Northrend. The Winterax and Frostmane tribes, however, later settled in the Eastern Kingdoms. Due to the ice trolls' unrelenting hostility toward outsiders, historians have yet to learn how these two tribes were separated from the Drakkari and came to live so far from the ancient site of Zul'Drak.\nLike the Frostmane trolls, Winterax do not share the unusually large size of their Drakkari brethren. Even so, up until recently the Winterax trolls aggressively defended their territory in Alterac Valley from a number of foes--most notably the dwarves of the Stormpike Guard and the orcs who once belonged to the Frostwolf clan.\nThen one day Korrak and his people simply disappeared, along with most of their belongings and supplies. The mystified orcs and dwarves concluded that the trolls had at last given up their home, which, after all, had devolved into little more than a bloody battlefield, and left in search of greener pastures. \nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/icetribes.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/icetribes.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

A few green-skinned ice trolls have also been observed, but they are very rare, for such cases are matters of pigmentation alone (not plant growth, as with the forest trolls). Ice trolls typically have thick manes of hair.\nIce trolls are particularly savage and cruel, even by troll standards, but these unpleasant traits are not the product of the trolls' snowy territories. Rather, several troll tribes were driven into the far north long ago as a direct result of their behavior, and over time they developed into ice trolls.\nHistory: Like other trolls, ice trolls are descended from the Zandalar tribe, but broke off to form several small tribes of their own. These new tribes proved too bloodthirsty for other races to tolerate. Driven out of civilized lands, the trolls were forced to settle in the far north of ancient Kalimdor, in the region that later become the continent of Northrend. Long before the Great Sundering, these ice trolls founded a small nation known as Zul'Drak, which never achieved the size or prosperity of the two southern empires.\nFor the most part, ice trolls have had little to do with the so-called civilized world; many of them still dwell in Northrend. Only recently have ice trolls been sighted in significant numbers in the Eastern Kingdoms, where the Frostmane tribe is launching increasingly frequent and aggressive attacks. \nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/icetrolls.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/icetrolls.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

Hakkar brought the trolls great power, but in return the bloodthirsty god required that souls be sacrificed to him.\nHis demands quickly escalated, and he grew impatient with his loyal priests, the Hakkari. He told them to find a way to summon him physically into the world, so that he might directly drain the blood of his victims. Most of the Hakkari were horrified at the idea, but the Atal'ai, a small extremist faction of the Hakkari, decided to do as Hakkar wished.\nBefore the Atal'ai could complete the summoning, the other jungle trolls, including the Hakkari, rose up in open revolt against the cruel god. Even the Zandalar tribe was drawn into the conflict, which finally ended with the destruction of Hakkar\u2019s avatar. Driven from the jungles, the Atal'ai were hunted nearly to extinction. Only a small group of Atal'ai escaped into the Swamp of Sorrows, where they secretly built a great temple to their god: the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.\nThe Atal'ai knew that they needed greater numbers to achieve their goal. Fortunately their unwavering loyalty to Hakkar had pleased him greatly, and he taught them further dark magics, including necromancy. With a number of swift and secret missions, the fanatical trolls retrieved the corpses of the Atal'ai who had fallen in battle or been killed during their flight to the swamplands. Using what Hakkar had taught them, the Atal'ai raised their slain brethren into undeath and put them to work.\nThe Hakkari, too, were killed or exiled for the evil deeds they had done in Hakkar's name, despite the fact that they had fought the Atal'ai. In great bitterness and despair, the surviving Hakkari tracked the Atal'ai to the Swamp of Sorrows and pledged to help the Atal'ai summon Hakkar into Azeroth. Pleased by the Hakkari's obvious suffering, the Atal'ai welcomed their former brethren into the temple. Even so, Hakkar had not forgotten that the Hakkari had betrayed him in opposing his first entry into Azeroth, and so the hungry god would always regard the faithful Atal'ai with greater favor. Both groups bent all their efforts toward bringing about Hakkar's entry into the physical world.\nThe green Dragon Aspect, Ysera the Dreamer, soon learned of the evil priests' plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's ruins are guarded by mighty green dragons. What much of Azeroth does not know, however, is that the dragons are actually guarding the wrong location. In recent years the exiled Atal'ai have discovered that Hakkar's physical form can only be summoned within the ancient capital of the Gurubashi empire, Zul'Gurub.\nJammal'an the Prophet, leader of the Atal'ai, told his people that if they succeeded in bringing Hakkar physically into Azeroth, then Hakkar would grant the Atal'ai immortality. The Atal'ai and Hakkari lost no time in dispatching a number of their most skilled priests to Zul'Gurub, where their efforts met with success at last. Numerous spies have confirmed the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the ruins.\nAccording to several reports, Hakkar has enthralled five high priests of the trolls' primal gods. Unable to oppose his will, the priests are channeling the power of their gods into Hakkar. Only their deaths can sever the connections that are vastly increasing Hakkar's might while draining the other gods of power.\nWord of Hakkar's presence reached the Zandalar tribe in the South Seas, and they were horrified to discover the enslavement of their kindred, the Zandalari high priests. King Rastakhan has therefore sent emissaries from the island of Zandalar to the Eastern Kingdoms, where the trolls recruit champions from Azeroth's many races in the hope that Hakkar will once again be defeated.\nBloodscalp Tribe.\nWhere: Stranglethorn Vale (primarily in the northwest)\nCategory: Jungle trolls\nLeader: Gan'zulah\nBackground: The Bloodscalps split off from the Gurubashi empire after the defeat of Hakkar the Soulflayer. The various tribes claimed territories in the vast jungles of Stranglethorn Vale but quickly began fighting one another.\nThe Bloodscalp tribe has since settled in the northwest of Stranglethorn. To this day the Bloodscalps fight off all interlopers, including the nearby Skullsplitter tribe, in order to hold onto the land they have taken. Bloodscalps have nothing but contempt for the Darkspear tribe, which is the only tribe of jungle trolls to have joined the Horde.\nDarkspear Tribe.\nWhere: Durotar primarily, but also in many other places throughout the world\nCategory: Jungle trolls\nLeader: Vol'jin\nBackground: The Darkspear tribe split off from the Gurubashi empire after the defeat of Hakkar the Soulflayer. The various tribes claimed territories in the vast jungles of Stranglethorn Vale but quickly began fighting one another. At length the Darkspear tribe, which was smaller than most of the other tribes, was driven off the continent altogether and settled on a remote desert island.\nBefore the Third War broke out, the courageous orc Thrall escaped his enslavement and reassembled his people into a new Horde. Rather than try to make a home in the Eastern Kingdoms, he decided to lead the revitalized Horde over the sea to Kalimdor. Along the way, a violent storm drove the ships to seek shelter in the cove of a nearby island. The elderly leader of the Darkspear trolls, Sen'jin, greeted the orc newcomers.\nSoon a group of murlocs captured Sen'jin, Thrall, and several other orcs and trolls. Thrall fought his way out of his prison cell and freed a number of other captives, but despite his best efforts, a murloc sorcerer succeeded in sacrificing Sen'jin to a mysterious sea witch. Mortally wounded, Sen'jin revealed that he had seen a vision in which Thrall would lead the Darkspears from the island.\nThe sea witch was furious at the slaughter of her minions and the defilement of her sanctuary. She summoned powerful waves to batter the island. Regardless, Thrall and his forces managed to defeat further murloc attackers, repair the damaged fleet, and retrieve a number of troll survivors.\nIn Sen\u2019jin's honor, Thrall offered the Darkspears a place in the Horde and sanctuary in the kingdom he planned to establish in Kalimdor. Vol\u2019jin, the son of Sen\u2019jin, took control of the Darkspear tribe and accepted Thrall's offer. After the orcs departed, a large group of Darkspears also sailed for Kalimdor. Vol'jin and the rest of the tribe weathered the sea witch's anger, gathered all the supplies they could take with them, and joined their brethren roughly a year later in the new orc nation, Durotar. They made a home for themselves on the Echo Isles, just off the southeastern coast.\nThe Darkspears were not to know peace for long. After the Third War, Grand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore led a large fleet of battleships against Thrall's forces on Durotar. Under heavy attack, the trolls were forced to evacuate to the mainland of Durotar, but the Horde managed to defeat the misguided admiral.\nMuch relieved, the Darkspear trolls began returning to the Echo Isles, only to be betrayed by one of their own. A witch doctor named Zalazane used dark magic to rob several other trolls of their free will, forcing them to obey him. As his influence spread, his army grew while the number of free Darkspears dwindled. Fearing that all of his people would fall to Zalazane's insidious sorcery, Vol'jin ordered the tribe to abandon the Echo Isles.\nThus, the free Darkspear trolls left the islands and created the fishing village of Sen\u2019jin on the Durotar coast, just northwest of the Echo Isles. Today the Darkspears and their allies frequently strike at Zalazane\u2019s holdings on the Echo Isles, determined to win back the trolls' first home on Kalimdor. Meanwhile, Zalazane has not given up in his efforts to enslave his entire tribe, and so he continues to send his trolls to the mainland in order to drag further Darkspears under his sway.\nAs the only tribe of trolls in the Horde, the Darkspears are considered enemies by all other trolls except the Revantusk. The Darkspears return the sentiment and bear a special hatred for other jungle trolls, for the Darkspears have not forgotten being driven out of Stranglethorn Vale.\nGurubashi Tribe.\nWhere: Stranglethorn (primarily in Zul'Gurub)\nCategory: Jungle trolls\nLeader: Bloodlord Mandokir\nBackground: Established long before the Great Sundering, the Gurubashi empire took its name from the strongest tribe of jungle trolls at the time. The jungle trolls ruled the southern jungles of ancient Kalimdor until the Burning Legion's first invasion, which wrought havoc and devastation throughout the continent and culminated in the Great Sundering.\nThe long centuries following the Sundering were difficult ones for the troll race. The jungle trolls, driven to desperate ends, enlisted the aid of the god Hakkar, also known as the Soulflayer. Hakkar brought the trolls great power, but in return the bloodthirsty god required that souls be sacrificed to him.\nHis demands quickly escalated, and he grew impatient with his loyal priests, the Hakkari. He told them to find a way to summon him physically into the world, so that he might directly drain the blood of his victims. Most of the Hakkari were horrified at the idea, but the Atal'ai, a small extremist faction of the Hakkari, decided to do as Hakkar wished.\nBefore the Atal'ai could complete the summoning, the other jungle trolls, including the Hakkari, rose up in open revolt against the cruel god. Even the Zandalar tribe was drawn into the conflict, which finally ended with the destruction of Hakkar\u2019s avatar. Driven from the jungles, the Atal'ai were hunted nearly to extinction. Yet a small group of Atal'ai escaped into the Swamp of Sorrows, where they secretly built a great temple to their god: the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. The Hakkari, too, were killed or exiled for the evil deeds they had done in Hakkar's name, despite the fact that they had fought the Atal'ai. In great bitterness and despair, the surviving Hakkari tracked the Atal'ai to the Swamp of Sorrows and pledged to help the Atal'ai summon Hakkar into Azeroth. Pleased by the Hakkari's obvious suffering, the Atal'ai welcomed their former brethren into the temple.\nIn recent years the exiled Atal'ai have discovered that Hakkar's physical form can only be summoned within the ancient capital of the Gurubashi empire, Zul'Gurub. Jammal'an the Prophet, leader of the Atal'ai, told his people that if they succeeded in bringing Hakkar physically into Azeroth, then Hakkar would grant the Atal'ai immortality. The Atal'ai and Hakkari lost no time in dispatching a number of their most skilled priests to Zul'Gurub, where their efforts met with success at last. Numerous spies have confirmed the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the ruins. Word of his reappearance reached the Gurubashi tribe, which had lost much of its power and prestige since Hakkar's avatar on Azeroth was destroyed. The Gurubashi eagerly returned to the capital to prove themselves to Hakkar and perhaps recapture their former glory.\nAccording to several reports, Hakkar has enthralled five high priests of the trolls' primal gods. Unable to oppose his will, the priests are channeling the power of their gods into Hakkar. Only their deaths can sever the connections that are vastly increasing Hakkar's might while draining the other gods of power.\nWord of Hakkar's presence reached the Zandalar tribe in the South Seas, and they were horrified to discover the enslavement of their kindred, the Zandalari high priests. King Rastakhan has therefore sent emissaries from the island of Zandalar to the Eastern Kingdoms, where the trolls recruit champions from Azeroth's many races in the hope that Hakkar will once again be defeated.\nThe Gurubashi tribe is convinced that the Soulflayer will restore the Gurubashi empire in return for the tribe's loyal service. These misguided trolls therefore guard Hakkar and his minions with reckless fervor.\nThe Hakkari.\nWhere: Swamp of Sorrows (in the Temple of Atal'Hakkar) and Zul'Gurub\nCategory: Jungle trolls\nLeader: Jin'do the Hexxer\nBackground: The long centuries following the Great Sundering were difficult ones for the troll race.

In great bitterness and despair, the surviving Hakkari tracked the Atal'ai to the Swamp of Sorrows and pledged to help the Atal'ai summon Hakkar into Azeroth. Pleased by the Hakkari's obvious suffering, the Atal'ai welcomed their former brethren into the temple. Even so, Hakkar had not forgotten that the Hakkari had betrayed him in opposing his first entry into Azeroth, and so the hungry god would always regard the faithful Atal'ai with greater favor. Both groups bent all their efforts toward bringing about Hakkar's entry into the physical world.\nThe green Dragon Aspect, Ysera the Dreamer, soon learned of the evil priests' plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's ruins are guarded by mighty green dragons. What much of Azeroth does not know, however, is that the dragons are actually guarding the wrong location. In recent years the exiled Atal'ai have discovered that Hakkar's physical form can only be summoned within the ancient capital of the Gurubashi empire, Zul'Gurub.\nJammal'an the Prophet, leader of the Atal'ai, told his people that if they succeeded in bringing Hakkar physically into Azeroth, then Hakkar would grant the Atal'ai immortality.

King Rastakhan has therefore sent emissaries from the island of Zandalar to the Eastern Kingdoms, where the trolls recruit champions from Azeroth's many races in the hope that Hakkar will once again be defeated.\nShatterspear Tribe.\nWhere: Darkshore (one village in the northeast)\nCategory: Jungle trolls\nLeader: Unknown\nBackground: The Shatterspear tribe split off from the Gurubashi empire after the defeat of Hakkar the Soulflayer. The various tribes claimed territories in the vast jungles of Stranglethorn Vale but quickly began fighting one another.\nThe Shatterspear tribe has since settled at the northeast edge of Darkshore, a continent away from Stranglethorn. Highly reclusive and apparently uninterested in claiming further territory, the Shatterspear trolls live in a small village that is almost entirely surrounded by jagged hills. Visiting the secluded village is a difficult endeavor, and a number of adventurers have fallen to their deaths in attempting to scale the steep hills around the Shatterspears' home.\nThe trolls' purpose in living here is unknown at this point in time. Certainly it is a strange location for any troll to choose to live: surrounded by mountains and, beyond that, the trolls' ancient enemies: night elves.\nSkullsplitter Tribe.\nWhere: Stranglethorn Vale (primarily in the center)\nCategory: Jungle trolls\nLeader: Ana'thek the Cruel\nBackground: The Skullsplitter tribe split off from the Gurubashi empire after the defeat of Hakkar the Soulflayer. The various tribes claimed territories in the vast jungles of Stranglethorn Vale but quickly began fighting one another.\nThe Skullsplitter tribe has since settled in the center of Stranglethorn. To this day the Skullsplitters fight off all interlopers, including the nearby Bloodscalp tribe, in order to hold onto the land they have taken. Skullsplitters have nothing but contempt for the Darkspear tribe, which is the only tribe of jungle trolls to have joined the Horde. \nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/jungletribes.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/jungletribes.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

Jungle trolls are also unusually lithe relative to other trolls.\nHistory: Much as the forest trolls came to dominate Lordaeron, the jungle trolls established a firm hold over the southeastern jungles of ancient Kalimdor. The jungle trolls' empire took its name from their strongest tribe: the Gurubashi. In modern times, the word Gurubashi can refer to the jungle trolls' ancient empire (and thus to jungle trolls as a whole) or to the Gurubashi tribe in particular. The Gurubashi and Amani empires battled the relentless aqir until the insectoids' kingdom was split in two, but the trolls never achieved a true victory.\nAfter the Great Sundering, famine and violence spread until the jungle trolls begged their gods for aid. One god answered: Hakkar the Soulflayer. He gave the jungle trolls great power, but in return he demanded that they sacrifice trolls in his name. As his hunger for blood grew, he ordered his priests, the Hakkari, to bring him physically into the world of Azeroth so that he could feed directly on his victims.\nMost of the Hakkari were horrified at the idea, but the Atal'ai, a small extremist faction of the Hakkari, agreed to do as Hakkar wished. Before the Atal'ai could complete the summoning, the Hakkari and other jungle trolls rose up in open revolt. Even the Zandalar tribe joined the fight against Hakkar, whose avatar on Azeroth was ultimately destroyed. The Atal'ai were driven from the jungles and hunted nearly to extinction. Still, a small group of them escaped into the Swamp of Sorrows and built a great temple to their god: the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.\nThe Hakkari, too, were slain or exiled for the evil deeds they had done in Hakkar's name. Bitter and desperate, they joined the Atal'ai in the swamps and resolved to bring the bloodthirsty god into Azeroth. The green Dragon Aspect, Ysera the Dreamer, soon learned what the Atal'ai and Hakkari were working toward, and she smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's ruins are guarded by mighty green dragons. Nevertheless, trolls spoke of a prophecy that Hakkar would one day be reborn into the world.\nThe remnants of the Gurubashi empire went their separate ways, claiming territories in the vast jungles of Stranglethorn Vale. These scattered tribes began fighting one another, and at length the Darkspear tribe left the continent altogether and settled on a remote desert island, where they remained until they joined the Horde and fought in the Third War. Today the Darkspears live along the southeast coast of Durotar. \nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/jungletrolls.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/jungletrolls.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

Alleged sightings of dark trolls usually involve hulking and brutish creatures who attack with little tactical planning or coordinated effort. Thus, it has been theorized that dark trolls are much less intelligent than other trolls.\nBackground: There is no evidence that the dark trolls have ever formed a civilization or nation. Indeed, their estimated numbers are so few that their existence as a distinct category of troll is considered highly questionable. In consequence, it seems likely that if the dark trolls do exist, they are derived from a single troll tribe.\nZanzil the Outcast and His Followers.\nWhere: Stranglethorn Vale (primarily in the southeast)\nCategory: Various, with a majority of jungle trolls\nLeader: Zanzil the Outcast\nDescription: Zanzil and the witch doctors who follow him have unscrupulously poisoned creatures of many different races, causing the affected individuals to die and rise from the grave as Zanzil's undead minions. Trolls from several different tribes are only one small part of Zanzil's private undead army.\nHistory: Zanzil was exiled from the Skullsplitter tribe for using his necromantic poisons on several of his unsuspecting fellow trolls, but his exile has not been the punishment that his kindred had hoped. Indeed, since that time, several witch doctors have joined Zanzil. With their assistance, he has built up an undead army that is loyal to him alone.\nZandalar Tribe.\nWhere: South Seas (primarily the island of Zandalar) and a few in Stranglethorn Vale\nCategory: Not applicable\nLeader: King Rastakhan\nHistory: The earliest known trolls belonged to the Zandalar tribe, from which all other trolls are descended. On the whole, the Zandalari valued knowledge above all else, but a significant portion of the tribe hungered for conquest instead. These disaffected trolls eventually departed to form tribes of their own. As time went on, what remained of the Zandalar tribe came to be regarded as an overarching priest caste for all trolls. The Zandalari preserved troll history, and they worked to further the goals of troll society as a whole.\nGreatly respected by all other trolls, the Zandalari nevertheless remained apart from the day-to-day politics of their people. The Zandalari average eight feet in height: significantly larger than all other documented trolls except the savage Drakkari. Despite the Zandalar trolls' greater size and knowledge, however, they have no sovereignty over other tribes, nor do the Zandalari seek such authority.\nAfter the Great Sundering, these wise trolls saw no need to leave what had become the island of Zandalar. Rebuilding their damaged settlements, the trolls continued their studies until the Gurubashi empire began showing a dramatic increase in power and territory. The jungle trolls attributed their victories to the influence of the god Hakkar.\nAt first the Zandalar tribe was glad for its jungle brethren. When the Gurubashi empire's territory kept expanding, the Zandalari's pleased surprise turned to disquiet. They consulted myths and delved into ancient historical accounts. What the Zandalari learned horrified them.\nHakkar was also known as the Soulflayer, a name he had richly earned. He filled his adherents with murderous rage and reveled in their dark emotions. The carnage that invariably followed Hakkar suited him perfectly, for having consumed blood, he had developed a taste for it. Worse, he became more powerful as he consumed the blood shed in his name, and his tie to the world that was feeding him grew stronger.\nEvery Zandalari who could fight immediately set out for Stranglethorn Vale and brought the terrible tidings to the jungle trolls. The Gurubashi empire was already in a state of civil unrest due to the numerous sacrifices that Hakkar was demanding. With the Zandalar tribe's news, the jungle trolls banded together with the Zandalar tribe and rose up in open revolt against the bloodthirsty Soulflayer.\nEventually the avatar of Hakkar was destroyed, and Hakkar's priests, the Atal'ai and Hakkari, were hunted nearly to extinction. Yet survivors from both groups managed to escape into the Swamp of Sorrows, where they built the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. Working together, the Atal'ai and Hakkari prepared to summon Hakkar himself into Azeroth, so that he could feed on all living things.\nThe green Dragon Aspect, Ysera the Dreamer, soon learned of the evil priests' plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's ruins are guarded by mighty green dragons. What much of Azeroth does not know is that the dragons are actually guarding the wrong location. In recent years the exiled Atal'ai have discovered that Hakkar's physical form can only be summoned within the ancient capital of the Gurubashi empire, Zul'Gurub. The Atal'ai and Hakkari lost no time in dispatching a number of their most skilled priests to Zul'Gurub, where their efforts met with success at last. Numerous spies have confirmed the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the ruins.\nHakkar has also enthralled five high priests of the trolls' primal gods. Unable to oppose his will, the priests are channeling the power of their gods into Hakkar. Only their deaths can sever the connections that are vastly increasing Hakkar's might while draining the other gods of power.\nWord of Hakkar's presence reached the Zandalar tribe in the South Seas, who were even more horrified to discover the enslavement of their kindred, the Zandalari high priests. King Rastakhan has therefore sent emissaries to Yojamba Isle, off the northwest coast of Stranglethorn Vale. There the trolls recruit champions from Azeroth's many races in the hope that Hakkar can be defeated.\nOnce part of ancient Kalimdor, Zandalar is the birthplace of troll civilization, and, as such, strictly neutral territory for trolls. When the first Well of Eternity imploded, a hole was punched through Kalimdor. Deep fissures appeared in the continent, and the Zandalari hastily cast strong protective spells to protective their home from destruction. Even so, they could not shield the rest of the continent from widespread upheaval. The ground immediately beyond the Zandalari's shield was drawn underwater when Kalimdor broke into separate landmasses. When at last the Sundering was over, the Zandalari saw that their home had become an island.\nZuldazar, the capital city of Zandalar, is built in a series of giant ziggurats that look like a towering mountain from a distance. Different troll tribes distrust one another and have often fought one another, but every six years, envoys from all the troll tribes arrive in Zuldazar in order to share information and discuss matters that may affect the entire troll race. \nReferences.\nThe information could be retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/othertrolls.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/othertrolls.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Great Sundering shattered the jungle trolls' territory and left the Sandfury tribe stranded in the middle of what swiftly became the desert of Tanaris.\nEventually the trolls adapted to their harsh new environment, and today they bear only a rough resemblance to the jungle trolls from whom they are descended. Since the Sundering, the sand trolls have been forced to yield much of Tanaris to outsiders, and so the trolls fiercely defend what remains of their lands.\nNevertheless, new battles break out daily between the sand trolls and a wide assortment of interlopers. Much of the motivation behind this constant strife is that the two halves of a powerful sword known as Sul'thraze the Lasher are rumored to be somewhere inside Zul'Farrak. In addition, the sand trolls worship a massive hydra they call Gahz'rilla. Illustrations and descriptions of the beast have fired the imagination of adventurers for generations. \nReferences.\nThe information could be retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/sandtribes.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/sandtribes.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

Beginning with the Second War, continuing through the enslavement of the orcs and the renaissance of the Horde under Thrall, and up to the death of Sen'jin and the settling in Durotar, the trolls have played a vital role in the history of the Horde.\nForest Trolls and the First Horde.\nEarly in the Second War, the isolationist elves took little interest in the war's progress and provided only token support to the Alliance of Lordaeron. Then Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer offered the forest trolls a place in the Horde. If the trolls accepted, Doomhammer promised that the Horde would vanquish the high elves and assist the forest trolls in reestablishing the Amani empire.\nThe forest trolls' leader, Zul'jin, declined the tempting offer at first. As a famous hero of the Amani tribe, he had accomplished an amazing feat by uniting all forest trolls under his rule. Still, the forest trolls were primarily interested in fighting the high elves, and Zul'jin was skeptical about the Horde's plans. A short while later, human soldiers captured a war party led by Zul'jin. When the Horde rescued the trolls, Zul'jin changed his mind and agreed to an alliance with the Horde. A few tribes of forest trolls joined their new allies on the battlefield. Shortly thereafter, the Horde burned down the borderlands of Quel\u2019Thalas and slaughtered many high elf civilians. Furious at this wanton destruction of life, the elves subsequently committed all their resources to the war.\nBy the time the Horde was driven back, however, the orcs and their allies had already achieved their true goal: to steal and desecrate many of the Runestones that powered the elves\u2019 defensive shield. The warlock Gul\u2019dan then used the pilfered stones to power his devious Altars of Storms.\nNevertheless, the Alliance ultimately won the Second War, and after a number of additional battles, most of the vanquished orcs on Azeroth were rounded up and placed in internment camps. In the war's disastrous aftermath, many forest trolls were furious at the Horde's failure to carry out its promise and deserted their former orc allies without a moment's hesitation. Today only one tribe of forest trolls--the Revantusk tribe--is loosely affiliated with the Horde, much as the Wildhammer clan of dwarves is associated with, and yet not a member of, the Alliance.\nAlthough the Second War ended some years ago, the Dragonmaw and Blackrock orc clans and their allies--among them two tribes of forest trolls--have not given up trying to defeat humanity. Referred to as the Dark Horde by outsiders, this group is led by the orc Rend Blackhand, who has named himself warchief. A force of approximately five thousand strong, the Dark Horde regards itself as the true Horde, and believes that Thrall and his followers are foolish weaklings. Rend's forces reside in Blackrock Spire, and they have allied themselves with the black dragonflight.\nRebuilding the Horde.\nBefore the Third War broke out, the courageous orc Thrall escaped his enslavement and began assembling a new Horde. This Horde would make no pacts with demons, nor would Thrall and his orcs seek further conflict with humans. Instead, at the urging of a prophet, Thrall led the revitalized Horde over the sea to Kalimdor.\nThe voyage grew perilous when a violent storm appeared and inflicted heavy damage on the orc fleet. Fearing that the ships would not reach Kalimdor intact, Thrall ordered the Horde to seek shelter in the cove of a nearby island. The elderly leader of the Darkspear trolls, Sen'jin, greeted the orc newcomers and warned them that a group of humans had established an outpost on the island.\nUnfortunately the humans were not the only threat on the island. A group of murlocs captured Sen'jin, Thrall, and several other orcs and trolls. Thrall fought his way out of his prison cell and freed a number of other captives, but by the time he reached Sen'jin's cell, the wise old troll was missing. The murlocs had taken him away in order to sacrifice him to a mysterious sea witch.\nDespite Thrall's best efforts, a murloc sorcerer succeeded in carrying out the sacrifice. Mortally wounded, Sen'jin revealed that he had seen a vision in which Thrall would lead the Darkspears from the island.\nThe sea witch was furious at the slaughter of her minions and the defilement of her sanctuary. She summoned powerful waves to batter the island. Regardless, Thrall and his forces managed to defeat further murloc attackers, repair the damaged fleet, and retrieve a number of troll survivors.\nIn Sen\u2019jin's honor, Thrall offered the Darkspears a place in the Horde and sanctuary in the kingdom he planned to establish in Kalimdor. Vol\u2019jin, the son of Sen\u2019jin, took control of the Darkspear tribe and accepted Thrall's offer. After the orcs departed, a large group of Darkspears also sailed for Kalimdor. Vol'jin and the rest of the tribe weathered the sea witch's anger, gathered all the supplies they could take with them, and joined their brethren roughly a year later in the new orc nation, Durotar. They made a home for themselves on the Echo Isles, just off the southeastern coast.\nFurther Turmoil for the Darkspear Tribe.\nThe Darkspears were not to know peace for long. After the Third War, Grand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore led a large fleet of battleships against Thrall's forces on Durotar. Proudmoore could not be convinced that this new Horde was any different from the corrupted Horde of the First War. Under heavy attack, the trolls were forced to evacuate to the mainland of Durotar, but the Horde managed to defeat the misguided admiral.\nMuch relieved, the Darkspear trolls began returning to the Echo Isles, only to be betrayed by one of their own. A witch doctor named Zalazane used dark magic to rob several other trolls of their free will, forcing them to obey him. As his influence spread, his army grew while the number of free Darkspears dwindled. Fearing that all of his people would fall to Zalazane's insidious sorcery, Vol'jin ordered the tribe to abandon the Echo Isles.\nThus, the free Darkspear trolls left the islands and created the fishing village of Sen\u2019jin on the Durotar coast, just northwest of the Echo Isles. Some Darkspears have remained in the village, and others have ventured farther afield. Vol'jin himself dwells in Orgrimmar, the capital city of Durotar. Orcs make up the majority of the city's inhabitants, but there is a strong troll presence in the Valley of Spirits.\nToday the Darkspears and their allies frequently strike at Zalazane\u2019s holdings on the Echo Isles, determined to win back the trolls' first home on Kalimdor. In the meantime, Zalazane has not given up in his efforts to enslave his entire tribe, and so he continues to send his trolls to the mainland in order to drag further Darkspears under his sway.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/trolls/history2.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/history2.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

It presented a variety of information about trolls. The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/trolls/troll-info.html\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/trolls/troll-info.html&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nPhysical Features.\nSize.\nTrolls average seven feet in height and two hundred pounds in weight, save for two tribes, the Drakkari and the Zandalari, who tend to be somewhat larger than their kindred. As with other races, there are also scattered trolls who far exceed the normal size range. For further discussion of these outliers, consult the below section on these so-called \"monstrous\" trolls.\nHealth.\nAll trolls possess astonishing physical resilience: they can heal grievous physical injuries and regenerate lost limbs. This accelerated rate of healing makes trolls formidable adversaries on the field of battle.\nSpecific Issues.\nCannibalism.\nMost trolls seem to practice cannibalism. Several specific troll tribes have been confirmed as cannibalistic, including the Mossflayer and Vilebranch tribes. Furthermore, all the currently known tribes of ice trolls practice cannibalism. Sand trolls, forest trolls, and jungle trolls are also frequently cannibalistic, though not always. Even the mysterious dark trolls are believed to be cannibals for the most part. Yet there are several notable exceptions. For example, the Zandalar and Revantusk tribes do not consume troll flesh. The Darkspear tribe, too, was cannibalistic until it joined the Horde, at which point the Darkspears officially gave up cannibalism.\nVoodoo.\nNot all trolls practice voodoo, but it is certainly at least as widespread as cannibalism. Little is known about the emergence of voodoo among the trolls, for most tribes that possess such knowledge are unwilling to share it with outsiders. However, with the recent advent of Zandalari trolls to Yojamba Isle, several notable researchers have come to speculate that voodoo many have originated with the Zandalari.\nDire trolls.\nA small number of trolls are strikingly larger and more heavily muscled than the rest of their brethren. There is no racial distinction between them and the rest of the troll race. A variety of reasons might be behind this unusual size and musculature. For example, dire trolls might have been altered alchemically or magically. They might also simply have been born larger than average. Regardless of the day-to-day prejudices that these trolls must contend with from other races, dire trolls are not regarded as monstrous by other trolls. \nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/troll-info.html\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/story/trolls/troll-info.html&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Trolls&lt;/a&gt;, having lived in the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;forests&lt;/a&gt; of the far north for centuries, have devised a unique method of harvesting.

{"id": "26004", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26004", "title": "Troll Wars", "text": "The Troll Wars were a series of conflicts between the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; and an alliance of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, ending approximately 2,800 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict began when the Amani, hungry for revenge after having been driven from their lands by the high elves millennia prior, launched an all-out assault on Quel'Thalas. Facing certain defeat, the elves turned to Arathor and agreed to teach a &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;select number&lt;/a&gt; of humans &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic in exchange for their aid. Together the two nations thoroughly defeated the Amani army at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and shattered their empire.\nThe Troll Wars were the longest and bloodiest war humanity had seen up to that point, but through it they won a strong friendship with the elves and were introduced to the arcane. For Quel'Thalas and Arathor, the war signaled the beginning of a glorious new era, while for the trolls it marked a dark turning point in history from which they would never fully recover.\nPrelude.\nAround 6,800 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, the exiled &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; who would become the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the northernmost parts of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, where they encountered the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The trolls already harbored a hatred of elves from the days of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and skirmishes between the Amani and Highborne fostered a mutual blood feud between the two races. The elves used their arcane powers to drive out the Amani and founded the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, centered around the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and their new capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. However, they soon learned that they'd built their kingdom atop Amani ruins that the trolls still considered sacred. The Amani, who outnumbered the elves by more than ten to one, immediately began attacking elven settlements en masse. Under &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership, the elves held off the assault and erected the magical barrier \"&lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;\" to frighten away the superstitious trolls, who eventually retreated back to their capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and resigned themselves to attacking elves that strayed outside the barrier. For the next four thousand years, Quel'Thalas thrived in peace.\nThe Amani spent the millennia plotting revenge in Zul'Aman, but suffered from infighting and a lack of a strong leader. In 2,800 BDP, their fortunes changed when they received aid from the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The Zandalari, who saw themselves as protectors of all trolls across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, wanted to revitalize the Amani and reassert troll dominance in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. A handful of Zandalari emissaries traveled to Zul'Aman and helped the Amani prepare for war by appointing the warrior &lt;a href=\"Jintha\"&gt;Jintha&lt;/a&gt; as their ruler and enlisting the aid of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; demigods.\nMeanwhile, the Amani's southern neighbors, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; tribes, continued to war with each other even as Amani incursions into human territories became more aggressive over the span of a few decades. The &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi tribe&lt;/a&gt; realized that something was changing among the Amani and that humanity would stand little chance in a true war against the trolls if they remained divided. The Arathi's leader, &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;, declared himself king and, over the course of six years, united the other human tribes into the empire of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; before establishing the capital of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nSiege of Quel'Thalas.\nAfter they received aid from the Zandalari, small Amani warbands began attacking Quel'Thalas' borders while hiding their true numbers in order to test the high elves' strength. After several successful skirmishes, they launched an all-out campaign to wipe out the elves. Tens of thousands of trolls, accompanied and magically empowered by their loa, emerged from the forests and laid waste Quel'Thalas' outer reaches. The elves were hopelessly outnumbered and quickly lost ground while their casualties climbed. The Zandalari were confident that the trolls' ultimate victory was only a matter of time. To help defend Quel'Thalas, the elves founded the order of &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest of whom was &lt;a href=\"Talanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Talanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Over the course of months, rumors of the war trickled down to Arathor, but Thoradin and his generals agreed that they would not risk their own kind by sending aid to the reclusive elves and instead kept most of their forces in Strom.\nIn desperation, the high elf king &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; sent ambassadors to Strom to ask for aid, in the hopes that there were humans who could become useful in combat if given magical training. The elven ambassadors told Thoradin that the troll armies were vast and would move to attack Arathor once they had destroyed Quel'Thalas. Thoradin and his advisors concluded that they did not have enough forces for an open fight with the Amani and that they would need magic to defeat the trolls. After some further negotiations, Thoradin and Anasterian reached an agreement, and elven magi traveled to Strom to teach exactly &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;one hundred humans&lt;/a&gt; the ways of magic in exchange for the humans' military aid. Meanwhile, Thoradin sent his generals to establish &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Fortress\"&gt;Alterac Fortress&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; as a staging point for their future offensive, along with several other forts in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Alterac Fortress.\nOnce the elves had finished tutoring the human magi, many months later, Arathor began its offensive. Over twenty thousand human soldiers gathered at Alterac Fortress and then marched toward Quel'Thalas under Thoradin's command. The magi stayed behind, hidden in the fortress. Thoradin's generals &lt;a href=\"Ignaeus%20Trollbane\"&gt;Ignaeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt; acted as the Arathi vanguard, riding days ahead of the rest of the host and clearing out Amani scouts and raiders. After weeks of marching, the Arathi host smashed into the Amani's southern flank on the outskirts of Quel'Thalas. In coordination, the high elves launched a counterattack on the trolls' front lines from the north. Jintha considered the humans to only be a nuisance and turned his attention on them, intending to quickly eradicate them and then refocus on exterminating the elves. Thoradin's army began a slow retreat back to Alterac. Weeks of brutal fighting ensued as the Amani chased the humans toward the mountains, while the elves marched out of Quel'Thalas to harry the Amani's rear flank.\nAt one point during the retreat, the Amani began gaining on the humans too fast and threatened to flank and overwhelm them. General Lordain and five hundred of his warriors volunteered to stay behind and hold off the trolls in a narrow valley, sacrificing their lives in order to allow the rest of the Arathi to continue south. The humans eventually reached Alterac Fortress and prepared for the Amani's attack, which came on a foggy morning shortly after. The ensuing battle lasted for many days. Even though the Arathi were outnumbered, neither side gave ground. The high elves soon caught up and smashed into the Amani's rearguard.\nWhen the humans and elves were confident that they had worn down the Amani ranks, they unleashed their secret weapon. The one hundred human magi emerged from the fortress and, alongside the elven sorcerers, did something unprecedented. Instead of attacking individually, they pooled their power and unleashed a single devastating spell, creating a massive column of fire which tore down from the sky and engulfed the Amani army. The magical flames prevented the trolls from &lt;a href=\"Troll%23Troll%20regeneration\"&gt;regenerating&lt;/a&gt; their wounds and burned loa and troll alike from the inside out. Jintha was one of the first to be killed. Without their leader, the surviving trolls broke ranks and fled north. The human and elven armies ran them down and killed everyone they could find. The Troll Wars thus ended with the humans and elves triumphant.\nAftermath.\nThe disastrous battle at Alterac shocked the Zandalari emissaries, who returned to &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in disbelief and shame. To them, the defeat represented a dark turning point in troll history. The Amani never fully recovered from their defeat, and they would never again rise as one nation. The Amani Empire, which had previously lorded over most of northern Lordaeron, remained in existence but was reduced to small remnants in eastern Quel'Thalas and the southern &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. Several forest troll tribes\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Mossflayer%20tribe\"&gt;Mossflayers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusks&lt;/a&gt; (nearly wiped out by the war), &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark&lt;/a&gt;\u2014split off from the empire after the war, opting to return to their ancestral lands a safe distance away from Quel'Thalas. The most powerful, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;, remained entrenched in Zul'Aman. For the next 2,800 years, the forest trolls remained scattered and without the numbers to reclaim their former lands.\nFor Quel'Thalas and Arathor, the Troll Wars marked the beginning of a prosperous new era. For months after the war's end, celebrations filled the streets of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. In gratitude, the high elves made a pledge of undying loyalty and friendship to Arathor and to Thoradin's bloodline. Humans and high elves went on to nurture peaceful relations for over two thousand years. With the absence of trolls in the northlands, the elves focused on rebuilding Quel'Thalas. Every year, they honored the anniversary of the final battle of the Troll Wars with the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance\"&gt;Remembrance&lt;/a&gt; celebration. The losses they sustained in the war are reflected in the song \"&lt;a href=\"Lament%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Lament of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\", originally an ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; song whose lyrics were revised after the war.\nIn Arathor, the original &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;One Hundred&lt;/a&gt; spread knowledge of the arcane among the humans. The proliferation of magic allowed Arathor to expand across Lordaeron\u2014including former Amani territories in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and establish new cities like &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, which over the centuries grew into &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;independent city-states&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; can trace its origins to the Troll Wars. One of the soldiers who'd been saved by &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;General Lordain&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice during the retreat to Alterac was his sister, &lt;a href=\"Mereldar\"&gt;Mereldar&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, she dedicated herself to caring for humanity's wounded veterans and began receiving visions of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, teaching her to use holy magic. She and others who'd received the visions formed a religious movement based on the Light, which grew to become the dominant human religion and was centuries later codified by &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s leaders into the Church of the Holy Light.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, millennia later, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s supreme commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, the last descendant of King Thoradin, reminded the high elves of the oath they had sworn his ancestor in order to secure their aid against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. During the same conflict, the Amani warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; reunited the forest troll tribes and allied with the Horde in a (ultimately failed) bid to restore the Amani Empire and take revenge on the elves and humans for the events of the Troll Wars.\nWeapons of the war.\nSeveral named high elf and human weapons notably saw use during the Troll Wars."}

If you have multiple Spirit Lodges for Shamans it's pretty easy to research &lt;a href=\"%23Upgrades\"&gt;Witch Doctor Adept&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Upgrades\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; training and add some Witch Doctors to the mix.\nWitch Doctors are weak spellcasters. Run whenever the enemy attacks them.\nSpells and abilities.\nSentry Ward.\n&lt;a href=\"Sentry%20Ward%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Sentry Wards&lt;/a&gt; last 10 minutes! The Witch Doctor comes with this spell initially, so build one and place Sentry Wards around key locations such as Fountains, enemy towns, enemy mines, key traveling points on the map, and your town, in order to spot invisible units. If you're having trouble with Night Elves using Shadowmeld or &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s using &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Wind%20Walk\"&gt;Wind Walk&lt;/a&gt;, the Sentry Ward is the perfect solution.\nUse Invisibility Detection to reveal Sentry Wards and destroy them. \nStasis Trap Ward.\nUse Stasis Trap for town defense. Place a &lt;a href=\"Stasis%20Trap%20Ward%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Stasis Trap Ward&lt;/a&gt; right inside your town. If the enemy attacks your town, they will either have to run away or be stunned by the Stasis Trap.\nCast a Stasis Trap behind enemy units in combat. If they attempt to run they will be stunned and their retreat will be cut off.\nCast a Stasis Trap in enemy towns. If they stick around to defend the town they will be stunned.\nStasis Traps will destroy other Stasis Traps within their area of effect.\nTypically people \"spam\" Stasis Traps all around so if the enemy kills one, another one will still work.\nThe enemy can steal your Stasis Trap with Control Magic so beware and stop using it if that starts happening. This might be difficult to notice.\nUse Stasis Traps to buy yourself some time to rebuild your army and get reinforcements to the area. If you lay down a line of Stasis Traps in the enemy's path you can delay them for quite a while.\nAlways kill any enemy Stasis Traps the second you see them. Kill the Stasis Trap before it becomes invisible. Ranged units like Archers are especially good at doing this. If you try to use Melee units you may lose your army trying to reach the Stasis traps. That's why ranged units are best.\nIt takes 10 seconds to activate a Stasis Trap. If players run before the trap stuns they can get away.\nCommand 1 weak unit to run in and trigger it, then run in with the rest of your army.\nUse Control Magic from the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt; to take control of the Stasis Trap.\nHealing Ward.\n&lt;a href=\"Healing%20Ward%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Healing Wards&lt;/a&gt; only have 5 hit points and 0 Medium armor.\nHealing Wards are one of the best Orc abilities. Cast a Healing Ward then collect all damaged units around it for healing.\nCast a Healing Ward next to units fighting in combat then collect them around the Ward during the battle.\nLay down multiple Healing Wards. If the enemy kills one you will then still have backups. Multiple Healing Wards don't increase the amount of healing received but they can cover a larger area to make sure everyone is covered by the Healing Wards and back each other up if one falls.\nDestroy the Healing Ward or force the enemy units trying to heal out of range of the Healing Ward's power."}

Sometimes, alchemical or magical alteration can lead those berserkers to become &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Members of other \"wild\" races such as the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; can also become &lt;a href=\"berserker\"&gt;berserker&lt;/a&gt;s, but in these cases they are generally plainly &lt;a href=\"Rage\"&gt;enraged&lt;/a&gt; melee warriors instead. The &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; was also known to create &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt; berserkers in blood &lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;rituals&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeavily muscled, the troll berserkers are fueled by a cocktail of primitive and dark magic, potions concocted by the shadowy &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s that send the ferocious &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s into a blood-chilling frenzy.\nThis article will only list the berserkers deployed by the trolls, in the form of normal soldiers or dire trolls identified as such. For lists about the other kinds of berserkers, read their respective pages.\n&lt;a href=\"Golden%20Troll%20Berserker\"&gt;Golden Troll Berserker&lt;/a&gt;s are common children's toys in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nBerserkers were a bloodthirsty sect of &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the total annihilation of their hated enemies, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. Suffering numerous experiments with strange chemicals and &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s by the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Alchemist%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;goblin alchemists&lt;/a&gt;, the berserkers had many strange abilities bestowed upon them that made them all but unstoppable in the heat of battle. Berserkers were hardier and stronger than most trolls, effectively transforming them into a veritable whirling cyclone of death and destruction.\nBerserkers were often seen frequenting the &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Troll%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mills&lt;/a&gt; of their people to ingest the potions given to them by the goblin alchemists. These potions enabled them to throw their axes greater distances or sharpen their sight, as well as increase the speed at which their &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28racial%29\"&gt;regeneration&lt;/a&gt; occurred.\nThird War.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll%20Headhunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll headhunters&lt;/a&gt; could be upgraded into berserkers, which were tougher and had the Berserk ability. Like headhunters, berserkers benefitted from &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28racial%29\"&gt;troll regeneration&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nJungle troll berserkers hail from the same ranks as the &lt;a href=\"headhunter\"&gt;headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s. These veteran soldiers, however, learn to channel their rage to become even more fearsome in combat. Troll berserkers often lead small bands of headhunters against the enemy, setting up ambushes or performing devastating raids against their foes. In battle, these elite combatants are even more fearsome than the dreadful headhunters. Many scars mark the light-blue skin of this battle-hardened troll. A chain shirt of dark gray covers his muscular torso. The warrior carries several spears, which stick out from a specially designed quiver strapped upon his back. Expert at throwing spears, berserkers enjoy attacking their foes from afar before charging into the fray. Whenever they can, they rage and spend several rounds throwing projectiles, targeting the least armored foes and any known spellcaster first. Then they charge into melee with their last spears in hand, focusing the bulk of their attacks on the most heavily wounded opponents in order to drop as many of them in as short a time as possible. One of the troll berserkers' favorite tactics is to hide in the undergrowth and catch their enemies by surpise. When a berserker works with a band of headhunters or other berserkers, they carefullly prepare lethal ambushes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe iconic skill of troll berserkers, &lt;a href=\"Berserking\"&gt;Berserking&lt;/a&gt;, was given to the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;troll player race&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

He is attacked by a constant flow of non-elite Drakkari trolls. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Trollgore was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Bombardment\"&gt;Bombardment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill him once again.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; were among the most vicious troll tribes and Trollgore was a paragon of the tribe's savagery. This hulking monstrosity discovered that his vaunted ferocity paled in comparison to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s and he now serves as a grisly warning to all that dare challenge Arthas' reign.\"\nTactics.\nThis is basically a tank'n'spank fight. He will be attacked during the fight by waves of undead which he will kill and their bodies will explode. To avoid getting hit by the explosions pull him just after he has killed a wave and tank him at the top of the stairs facing down so that he is half on the platform and half on the stairs. There is then no danger of any of the group getting aggro from the adds and also the explosions will go over the head of the tank and melee on the stairs. Range and healing stands at the bottom of the stairs.\nIt is suspected that Trollgore uses any corpses for his Corpse Explosion, such as critter corpses and remains from the Death Knight's Ghoul Army.\nHeroic.\nChanges from normal\nConsume: A stacking 5% damage buff that also causes Trollgore to grow in size. It is applied every swing. This replaces his Cannibalize buff from normal.\nTrollgore on heroic is a tank and spank DPS race with add complications. If an add makes it to Trollgore he will immediately aggro to the troll add and one shot them regardless of how much threat the tank has. Any add corpses can be used by Trollgore to cast Corpse Explosion for massive AoE damage. The group needs to be able to deal over 400K damage in less time than it takes Trollgore to build his Consume buff to the point that his damage cannot be healed through. He hits for 7-8k per swing with a 120-130% Consume buff.\nHeroic Tactics.\nTank Trollgore in the room away from the stairs.\nKill the adds on the stairs.\nMages: &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; will quickly kill any and all spawned adds. A &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; followed by a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt; or two will also do the job. Arcane explosion is NOT recommended as Trollgore's Corpse Explosion radius is equal too or greater than the area of an Arcane Explosion and he can and will one-shot you.\nHold nothing back.\nNot counting dodges and parries (not sure if he applies the buff on blocks) this gives a 5-man group 25-30 hits with which to deal 415k damage with moderately-frequent breaks to handle adds. This means that between 3 DPS and the tank, each will have to deal over 1k dps to take down Trollgore assuming everyone is able to stay away from the corpse explosions (which will instantly kill you if you get hit)."}

Trolling is prevalent in most forum or comment-based media, and World of Warcraft is no exception.\nThe term \"troll\" predates WoW, and as such is not at all connected to the Troll &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;. The word comes from a type of fishing that involves pulling lines or nets from behind a slow moving boat to catch fish.\nExamples of trolling.\nNote that if any player does something troll-ish on accident, then it is not considered trolling.\nAny of the following behavior can be considered Trolling:\nAvoiding being trolled.\nIt is rarely difficult to spot someone acting deliberately obnoxious or ignorant, so the best thing to do is just leave a troll alone. If they don't get a rise out of others, they will stop.\nIgnoring a troll will prevent them from annoying you directly via chat, but it is impossible to keep others from falling into the trap and bothering you with their mass of replies over general chat.\nSometimes it helps to call out a troll if you notice one on general chat. Trolls are almost universally despised, so you will receive help from others wishing to rid themselves of the offending players."}

{"id": "199712", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=199712", "title": "Trophy fish", "text": "Trophy fish are rare exceptional &lt;a href=\"fishing%20items\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; that can be caught while &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; and then wielded or shown off. \nDisplay.\nMost of the trophy fish use the same model with different skin hue for different species. The same size model is used for all fish, \"weight\" is ignored in that regard. \nLobsters and groupers are an exception; currently, these are not displayed at all. \nMost trophy fish are wielded in the &lt;a href=\"off%20hand\"&gt;off hand&lt;/a&gt;. If you merely wield the \"trophy fish\", it will not show on your character. You have to type \"z\" to force the wielded items to display. (Exception, the lobster trophy fish do not display.)\nPress the \"z\" key to toggle displaying your equipped items. (With a ranged weapon equipped, you may have three display options, in which case it will step through them.) One of the display options will show the trophy fish being held in your off hand.\nStacking.\nSince trophy fish are wieldable objects, they do not stack in your inventory so each fish takes a slot; except the wieldable cooking ingredient fish, which do stack.\nThere are a few major subcategories of trophy fishes.\nLarge normal fish.\nMost (older) trophy fish are a variation of a normal or buffing fish, but unlike their non-trophy counterparts, these trophy fish cannot be eaten as fish nor used in recipes. They are available in a partially populated range of sizes, specified in pounds of weight. Since there is a consensus of which few sizes are available, it appears that these are generated off a table, not at random over a range of values.\nThese trophy fish do nothing, but can be equipped in the &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; and displayed (with the exception of the trophy groupers and trophy lobsters which cannot be displayed.) \nWhile the main purpose of these fish is to be displayed proudly to other players, they can be fed to hunter pets that eat fish, but only producing the same results as feeding a normal fish of that type. There is no benefit from the specialness nor extra size. \nThese non-stat trophy fish are not &lt;a href=\"bind\"&gt;bound&lt;/a&gt;, and can be sent via mail, sold to vendors, sold on the auction house, and traded. The demand in the auction house is low, but they do sell, and you can get surprisingly much money for your trophy fish on occasion. The item type and subtype for these fish is Miscellaneous, Junk; this is where you find them in the auction house. \nThese fish include the following: \nLarge ingredient fish.\n\"\" added two fish which can both be trophy fish or can be used in cooking recipes (see above):\nThese have the Miscellaneous Junk type and subtype, even though you might expect them to be trade goods; they are even used in &lt;a href=\"Cooking\"&gt;Cooking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Outland%20cooking%20recipes\"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtisan Fishing quest trophy fish.\nThe &lt;a href=\"%23Quest%20fish\"&gt;quest fish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20Ahi\"&gt;Feralas Ahi&lt;/a&gt; can be caught when on the quest and wielded in the off hand as a trophy fish. The fish has the &lt;a href=\"unique\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; property, so you can only have one, and the fish must be turned in to complete the &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle%2C%20Angler%20Extreme\"&gt;Nat Pagle, Angler Extreme&lt;/a&gt; quest, which formerly granted &lt;a href=\"artisan\"&gt;artisan&lt;/a&gt; level fishing skill, raising the fishing skill cap from 225 to 300. Before this, people wanted to turn in the quest to advance their fishing, but now catching the fish as a trophy to wield and leaving the quest open is slightly more common.\nFaction trophy fish.\nThese &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be traded, and are very rare (estimated roughly 0.1% of catches in their respective locations.)\nWeapon fish.\nThese very rare fish provide the unique novelty of a weapon that looks like a fish. These &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20equip\"&gt;bind on equip&lt;/a&gt;, so can be sold at the auction house. Due to their uniqueness, they can fetch a high price. They are weapon items. All three of these weapons are &lt;a href=\"one%20hand\"&gt;one hand&lt;/a&gt; weapons, and none of them are &lt;a href=\"unique\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt;. That means that any class can wield them. Single wield characters can only wield them in the main hand. Dual wield characters can wield them in either hand, or if you have two, they can be dual wielded.\nAchievements.\nBoth \"Old Crafty\" and \"Old Ironjaw\" are achievements for fishing in a particular area.\nAttempting to catch \"Old Crafty\" will fulfill the Orgrimmar half of - Fish something up in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; - when you catch your first catch in Orgrimmar. While you are there, Alliance, you may want to do &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; for the achievement. \nFor the achievement - Catch one of the &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20items%23Fish\"&gt;rare fish&lt;/a&gt; in the list below (Need 1 out of 10): \nSeven are trophy fish, heaviest of species (rarest):\nThree are very rare weapon fish:\nThe achievement, the overall fishing achievement, requires completion of \"One That Didn't Get Away\", but not \"Old Crafty\" and \"Old Ironjaw\"."}

Mounted travel is almost always faster than walking/running (amphibious mounts such as the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Turtle%20%28mount%29\"&gt;Sea Turtle (mount)&lt;/a&gt; provide only circumstantial speed boosts on land).

However, some mounts do not cost any gold or other currencies (such as &lt;a href=\"honor%20point\"&gt;honor point&lt;/a&gt;s) and will drop at very low rates from bosses in instances such as &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Tempest%20Keep%29\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Halls\"&gt;Sethekk Halls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Utgarde Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;.

There were also zones which should be there lore-wise but were empty and unfinished.\nSince \"Cataclysm\", players could fly all over &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; but are still unable to fly in &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.

The zone makes extensive use of the terrain &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt; technology.\nHistory.\nEarly history and War of the Ancients.\nThe massive forested peak of Mount Hyjal was the original refuge and sacred place to the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, protected and watched over by &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s, ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; used to live in the networks of deep caverns stretching under Hyjal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; have held this great mountain sacred and it remained untouched by their sprawling empire by the orders of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The public believed it was out of respect for strong ties the mountain had with nature, but the Queen secretly feared the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s that resided on it. When the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the resulting implosion triggered the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Mount Hyjal endured, however, and the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;night elven resistance&lt;/a&gt;, who had escaped to the Summit, emerged to rebuild their society \u2014 though without arcane magic this time.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; created a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;new Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; atop Mount Hyjal. After the night elves learned of this, they planted the &lt;a href=\"world%20tree\"&gt;world tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; on top of it. It was blessed by three dragon aspects: &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and served two purposes: to keep others from abusing the magic of the new Well, but also to prevent the second fount\u2019s power from growing too great over time. Nordrassil grew deep roots into the earth, spreading life-giving energies and healing the land around the mountain. It also empowered the kaldorei against diseases and aging. Illidan was in turn imprisoned in one of the &lt;a href=\"barrow%20den\"&gt;barrow den&lt;/a&gt;s under Hyjal.\nThird War.\n&lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; led his demonic army towards the Summit, destroying the woodlands around him, in order to get to the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. He used the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to further despoil the forest, thus creating the &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. The fel magics seeped up all the way to the edge of the new Well It is here that the united forces of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the battle, the &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s of Hyjal converged on Nordrassil to defeat Archimonde. In the ensuing explosion, Nordrassil was damaged, its enchantments destroyed, and the immortality of the kaldorei was thus gone. Once &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; was planted, the night elves moved their capital from Mount Hyjal to the new World Tree.\nThe &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowtooth%20clan\"&gt;Shadowtooth clan&lt;/a&gt; were eventually wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFor years, Mount Hyjal and the wounded &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, remained cut off from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Sealed away within a protective field of dense foliage by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Nordrassil slowly recovered from the devastation of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when Malfurion called upon the tree's power to destroy the archdemon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and repel the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the impending &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that scarred its glades and craggy mountainside, the World Tree's well-being was threatened once more. &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; unleashed &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and his minions on the land. With the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, they burst into Hyjal from the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, and prepared to set Nordrassil ablaze, a conflagration that would endanger all life on Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; revived &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, as well as saved &lt;a href=\"Tortolla\"&gt;Tortolla&lt;/a&gt; from imprisonment at the Twilight's Hammer's hands, and fought off Ragnaros. Hyjal later served as the invasion point for Cenarion Circle's attack on the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragon Aspects gathered to bless Nordrassil in order to speed the process of rejuvenation of the world tree and the world, which caused Ragnaros to unleash his forces once more. Learning of this, Malfurion gathered the defenders of Hyjal for a counterattack against the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, eventually establishing the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt; within the Firelands. After heavy fighting, they pushed into &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt; itself and destroyed Ragnaros, re-establishing peace at Hyjal. The aspects yet again gathered at Nordrassil, and channeled their energies into the great tree, reviving the surrounding wildlife and healing the land once more.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was able to destroy most of &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Hyjal's Well&lt;/a&gt;, but some of its magical waters yet remained. According to &lt;a href=\"Celestine%20of%20the%20Harvest\"&gt;Celestine of the Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, as long as at least one drop remains there was still hope. While the Well was harmed, Nordrassil was undamaged.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; created an illusion of Hyjal to trap &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; in a nightmare of his death during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The druids of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; came to his rescue.\nThe Legion would later attack and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Shrine of Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, making the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; to relocate at the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; scars and &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the area under the World Tree, disturbing the &lt;a href=\"Frantic%20Faerie%20Dragon\"&gt;local faerie dragons&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tholo%20Whitehoof\"&gt;Tholo Whitehoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anren%20Shadowseeker\"&gt;Anren Shadowseeker&lt;/a&gt; fought against them and &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Warden\"&gt;Hyjal Warden&lt;/a&gt;s stood in defense as well. &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt; came to assist the Hyjal defenders as well, fighting against an &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20Leviathan\"&gt;Azerite Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; that emerged in the lake. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; felt that Nordrassil was in danger and arrived with an adventurer wielding the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to provide further help, both protecting Hyjal and healing the sudden wounds that had erupted.\nAfter the Fourth War.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Nordrassil has become a temporary home for the night elves following the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and was where a tense meeting between members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; took place.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, some areas have been healed, including what was once known as the Circle of Cinders.\nGeography.\nMount Hyjal is a massive &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Its highest point, &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;, is where the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; are located.\nAlthough a zone in \"World of Warcraft\", the mountain is far larger, composed of the &lt;a href=\"Zone\"&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; of Mount Hyjal proper, &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes parts of the edges of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nPortals.\nThe portals to Mount Hyjal in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Western Earthshrines&lt;/a&gt; unlock after players complete a quest underneath &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Those portals will always drop players off underneath the World Tree.\nQuests.\nThe quest line in Hyjal is intensively phased and takes players from &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; to the four shrines to &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; and finally to &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Spire\"&gt;Sulfuron Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Hyjal is one of the few non-starting-experience zones that has a phased zone map as well as phased terrain, unlocked halfway through the storyline.\nAt level 85, adventurers are &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.2.0\"&gt;called once again&lt;/a&gt; to Hyjal, this time for the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20Invasion\"&gt;Firelands Invasion&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nDevelopment.\nThe zone before Cataclysm.\nBefore ', two versions of the Hyjal zone were present in the game. The first one in terms of lore-chronology is the map used for the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; instance \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit%20%28Caverns%20of%20Time%29\"&gt;This map&lt;/a&gt;, however, was a retouched version of the zone which was already present in the game from the very beginning but was inaccessible via normal means. Nevertheless, it used to be possible to access the pre-\"Cataclysm\" zone, known then only as Hyjal, via &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; with some skillful rock climbing, or a glitch that allowed you to die close to the zone's entry gate then resurrect on the other side. However, after &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1.2\"&gt;patch 2.1.2&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard implemented a \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Man%27s%20Land\"&gt;No Man's Land&lt;/a&gt;\" teleport that removed players from the zone. It was still possible for a shaman to chain-cast &lt;a href=\"Far%20Sight\"&gt;Far Sight&lt;/a&gt; from neighboring zones such as Winterspring to see inside Hyjal.\nThe ruins of the Alliance and Horde bases from the Battle of Mount Hyjal do not appear in the \"Cataclysm\"-era Hyjal, most likely either due to retconning or game mechanics. In place of the former Alliance bases are the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Aessina\"&gt;Grove of Aessina&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Goldrinn\"&gt;Shrine of Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Thicket\"&gt;Verdant Thicket&lt;/a&gt; is located in place of the former Horde base.\nIn the early alpha, Hyjal was concepted to be \"an ultra high-level raid zone\", filled with demons and dragons battling each other. The challenge would have been to re-purify the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;\"familiar skeleton chained to a rock\"&lt;/a&gt; nearby.\nWorld of Warcraft: Cataclysm.\nDescription from official site.\n\"In , players will have the opportunity to explore the newly reopened Mount Hyjal as Azeroth's heroes, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion Stormrage and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, are called upon to push back the armies of the Firelord, banish Ragnaros to the Elemental Plane and lay waste to the twilight dragon stronghold in nearby &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. This all-new level 78-82 zone will feature multiple quest hubs, phased terrain and quest lines, portals to micro-zones within the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, an all-new raid dungeon, and much more.\"\nThe World Tree.\nPlayers will be able to enter Hyjal by way of &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, to take on a series of high-stakes quests in a historic location alongside some of Azeroth's most renowned heroes. With a longstanding rivalry among the night elf leadership threatening to undermine the campaign against &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, players will quickly discover the task of defending Nordrassil is more daunting than they had anticipated. In order to succeed, they must seek out the help of extremely powerful allies: the &lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe Ancients.\nTo protect Nordrassil and heal the devastation the invading fire elementals are causing across Mount Hyjal, players must first recapture the shrine of the wolf god &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;. The ogres surrounding the shrine will not leave peacefully, but seizing the shrine will allow players their first opportunity to infiltrate the Firelands and shut down a key Twilight portal, slowing the advance of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in Hyjal. With the first portal dismantled, players will soon be sought by the wilderness spirit &lt;a href=\"Aessina\"&gt;Aessina&lt;/a&gt; to assist in cleansing and healing the nearby forest, ultimately returning the land to its former splendor. This small victory, however, isn't enough to deter the Twilight Remnants from attempting to scorch the forest once more. As you struggle to keep these foes at bay, you'll also need to help the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; -- a new neutral faction of druids and worshipers of the Ancients\u2014repopulate the forest with animal life. It's even rumored that &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; has been spotted in the wilderness. Perhaps further investigation is necessary... Amid the chaos, the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; will need players' assistance to resurrect the goddess of winged creatures. Players begin the process by helping to slay a group of black dragons and closing a second Firelands portal from within. Just when you think things might be heating up, you'll need to fight through a burning night elf town to shut down the third and final portal with the assistance of the turtle god &lt;a href=\"Tortolla\"&gt;Tortolla&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarkwhisper Gorge.\nYour successes in Hyjal will ultimately lead you to the assembly of the Ancients, who have set a plan in motion to bring a powerful ally and demigod back into this realm. Before that can happen, however, you will need to infiltrate Darkwhisper Gorge disguised as a follower of the Twilight's Hammer, acting quickly to sow discord within the entrenched faction, weakening it for the coming struggle. Only time will tell if the Ancients' plan is a success\u2014but you'll need to do your part if there's any hope of saving Mount Hyjal from the twilight dragons, Ragnaros, and his minions of the Elemental Plane.\"\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nThe massive summit of Mount Hyjal is one of the most impressive places in Kalimdor. Here, the World Tree known as Nordrassil regrows, with the second Well of Eternity below. The site of the final battle of the Third War, the land here is now as well protected as anywhere in the world \u2014 protected by the power and majesty of dragons. The blue, red and bronze dragonflights keep a constant vigil over the recovering World Tree here, seeking to prevent the Burning Legion from ever again reaching the shores of the Well of Eternity and the branches of the sacred tree. From the lofty peak, one can see much of Ashenvale, Winterspring and Felwood far below.\nThree important groups form the bulk of the people at Mount Hyjal. The first are the night elves, humans and others who steadfastly guard the World Tree against future attacks. These demon hunters are some of the most experienced and powerful adventurers in the world, and rightly so; most of them either fought in the Battle of Hyjal in the Third War or otherwise have considerable experience tracking down and destroying demons. These demon hunters are assisted by dryads and keepers of the grove, who have an even greater investment in Mount Hyjal\u2019s safety. Hyjal\u2019s summit is sacred to the dryads and keepers, just as it is to the night elves, but it is also their home \u2014 in some cases, for many thousands of years.\nFinally, three &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s carefully watch over the massive tree, their high numbers perhaps a form of compensation for their noted absence during the Third War. The blue dragonflight is particularly devoted to this cause, and while their numbers here are not large, they guard the tree from lower on the mountainside in their caverns of Mazthoril\nFew elves live at the peak of Mount Hyjal, but the mountain and the World Tree shelter the night elves in the forests and shores at the foot of the mountain. The forests and rocky mountain slopes harbor many dangerous beasts. With the magic of the Well of Eternity and the World Tree saturating the air and infusing the groundwater, the creatures of the forests are stronger and smarter than those anywhere else on Kalimdor. Deadly black tigers and bears prowl the forests, as do powerful stags. These creatures do not fear fights; they even seek them if the prey looks weak enough. Even smarter and deadlier beasts inhabit the forests. Hippogryphs and chimaera are a common enough sight among the forested peaks of the Summit. Hippogryphs, magical beasts that look like a stag crossed with a raven, patrol the skies and attack anyone they deem a threat to the forests. Although friendly to night elves, they do not show kindness to strangers or to those they consider a menace. Wild dire wolves also lurk on the mountain slopes. They have no natural enemy and are fearless even when met with several armed hunters. The forests of Hyjal are also known to be home to the occasional treant and stray ancient. These sentient, mobile trees protect the night elves' towns and the surrounding forests.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; have long held this great mountain sacred. When the first Well of Eternity was destroyed in the first demonic invasion, the resulting implosion triggered a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that made the world shudder. Mount Hyjal endured, however, and the night elves emerged to rebuild their society \u2014 though without arcane magic this time.\nOne of the fleeing night elves \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, brother to the mighty &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 had taken a portion of water from the Well of Eternity. Illidan could not bear to live without the Well's magic. After the Sundering, he poured this water into a lake at the peak of Mount Hyjal, creating a second Well of Eternity. The night elves were outraged at this act, for it was the first Well's energies that originally brought the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan was imprisoned, and Malfurion met with three great &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to create the World Tree Nordrassil. The World Tree grew over the Well to obscure and protect it. In the centuries that followed, the night elves were a constant presence, nurturing and protecting the World Tree that stood in the valley between the twin peaks of Mount Hyjal. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; targeted the World Tree during the Battle of Mount Hyjal, but, infused with the combined power of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s mortal races, it blasted Demon Lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; into oblivion and freed the world of the demon menace.\nMountain.\nMount Hyjal is the name of a massive mount in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. It was the site of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the final conflict of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Two gray peaks rise high above the surrounding forests. The arcane &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; lies on Hyjal Summit and the great &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, blackened and wounded in the Third War, stands over it. Divine magic permeates Mount Hyjal and the animals that make their homes in its forests are more intelligent than any others. &lt;a href=\"Nightsaber\"&gt;Nightsaber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"frostsaber\"&gt;frostsaber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s slink through the trees, while &lt;a href=\"hippogryphs\"&gt;hippogryphs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chimera\"&gt;chimera&lt;/a&gt;s fly overhead. &lt;a href=\"Bear\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; prowl the forests. These creatures are friendly to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; that live here, but attack intruders. &lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20Valley\"&gt;Winterspring Valley&lt;/a&gt;, near the summit, is a small realm of perpetual winter where &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s clash with night elves and frostsaber &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGeography.\nThe geography of Hyjal Summit is dominated by temperate rugged and forbidding mountains. Hyjal Summit rises high above northern Kalimdor, surrounded by Winterspring, the Moonglade, and Felwood. The mountain's twin peaks are the highest points on Kalimdor and home to Nordrassil, the massive World Tree. The climb to the peak takes travelers past everything from dense forests at the foot to rocky meadows with sparse growth as the grade gets steeper. Nordrassil's sheer enormity strikes awe into any who have the rare honor of approaching it. The root system spreads over the entirety of Hyjal's peak, and its vast, charged branches seem to touch the sky. Damaged in the recent war, it now heals itself at a rapid rate. Although the World Tree rests upon a high mountain peak, its magic keeps the weather pleasant and warm year round - until the year after Battle of Mount Hyjal, when Hyjal saw its first winter. Otherwise, the air remains warm and crisp and the sky is always a dark blue peppered with a blanket of stars. The night elves hope the regenerating tree will begin to regulate the weather again soon.\nThe top of Mount Hyjal shares the plight of Ashenvale: it is mostly uncorrupted, but bears scars and gashes from the battles of the Third War. In the center of the summit is the World Tree, stretching far above the mountaintop even in its damaged state. The forests are inhabited by the usual untainted beasts, which the dryads and keepers of the grove care for. The dryads and keepers are friendly, having worked alongside mortals in the Third War, and are much less shy and worried than those encountered in Ashenvale. Night elves control the majority of the area, but a number of small camps and ruins are spread over Hyjal Summit. Its capital is considered to be &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt; with 4,000 inhabitants, and the area total population is 5,000.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

For millennia, Xuen was alone, able to do nothing but watch the mogu empire inflict unforgivable cruelty on its slaves. Then he saw the seeds of revolution take hold. The pandaren &lt;a href=\"Kang\"&gt;Kang&lt;/a&gt; learned how to fight without weapons, using the strength of his opponents against them, and taught it to many others. Soon he and his followers escaped to Kun-Lai, where they honed their abilities and philosophies in secret. One day Kang climbed to the top of Mount Neverest to meditate, and instead found Xuen. The White Tiger's isolation had not made him angry or bitter; it had simply made him eager to help. He guided Kang and the other novice monks in the ways of strength - not simply the strength of raw power, but the strength of endurance.\nTwo thousand years later, during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the newly crowned &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; ascended Mount Neverest, seeking wisdom from the Jade Serpent &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt; about what to do with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and how to save &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;his kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

While these good-natured animals lack ferocity, they compensate with uncommon durability and strength. The thickness of their fur helps them withstand the biting winds of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and the sharp claws of the mountain beasts that populate the region.\nColors\nLevel 20\nLevel 40\nGnomes.\nThe gnomes' revolutionary mechanostrider represents yet another marvel of their engineering prowess. Each strider is specifically designed with the individual rider in mind. They are constructed using state-of-the-art steam compression, servo-motor dynamics, and duro-steel plating. This offers the rider a reliable and durable means of transportation. Some claim that the mechanostrider's lack of true sentience makes for a very dumb mount. However, the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s counter that under a skilled rider, the mechanostrider is more responsive than even the best trained live mount.\nThe mechanostrider can move at speeds up to 30\u00a0mph. This is the one device that gnomes refuse to restructure for their larger allies. All gnome tinkers agree that the striders are only available for small humanoids. Although some goblins have purchased striders for themselves, most of these striders have only proud gnomish passengers.\nColors\nLevel 20 \nLevel 40\nNight elves.\nSabers: Before they were domesticated by the Sentinel Army and trained as mounts, Kalimdor's savage nightsaber panthers were considered to be among the continent's most vicious inhabitants. While many of these grand predatory beasts still prowl the dusky shores and forests of the night elves' homeland, the finest pedigrees of the species, recognized by their superior swiftness and agility, now serve a more practical purpose for those skilled enough to ride them.\nColors\nLvl 20\nLvl 40\nHumans.\nHorses: The strong bond between the humans of Azeroth and their warhorses has existed for generations. However, since the fall of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, only select varieties continue to be bred throughout Alliance-controlled lands. Most prized among these are the stately Evendales of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, renowned for their loyalty and even tempers. These horses command a hefty sum, but they reward their owners with steadiness and speed.\nColors\nLvl 20\nLvl 40\nDraenei.\nElekk: One of the many creatures the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; brought with them to Azeroth. Originally native to the vast plains of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, many Elekk were tamed by the Draenei due to their similar peaceful and placid nature. However, like their stalwart riders, The Elekk are fierce creatures in battle, charging enemies head on with there massive ivory tusks. The Draenei continue to breed the Elekk on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nColors\nLvl 20\nLvl 40\nWorgen.\nWorgen will not have a racial mount, but will instead have &lt;a href=\"Running%20Wild\"&gt;Running Wild&lt;/a&gt;, in which they take to all fours and travel at mount speed. \nHorde mounts.\nOrcs.\nWolves: Wolves are indigenous to many parts of Azeroth. They live on every known continent and have a wide variety of subspecies and social habits. Although most are hostile towards anyone who trespasses on their territories, a few unique dire wolf packs have befriended the Horde in recent years. These cunning and ferocious creatures have found an especially welcome home among the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, who admire their endurance and keen survival instincts.\nColors\nLvl 20\nLvl 40\nUndead.\nSkeletal Horses: Not even the noble steeds that succumbed to the Plague are allowed any rest in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Through an arcane mix of alchemy and necromancy, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; has raised numerous fallen steeds to serve as mounts for the vengeful dead. These undead steeds are as strong as they were in life, and far more resilient. An unfortunate characteristic, however - one that the Forsaken are none too enamored with is the steeds almost universal stubbornness. From death and beyond, the mighty steeds still cling to the willful spirit that served them in life.\nColors\nLvl 20\nLvl 40\nTroll.\nRaptors: The savage ferocity of Kalimdor's raptors has enthralled the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20troll\"&gt;Darkspear troll&lt;/a&gt;s since their arrival. They consider a raptor to be the truest form of a hunter, and as such, the tamed Troll Raptor is their mount of choice. A tamed raptor is truly a fearsome beast, as a skilled troll is able to channel the reptilian steed's savagery to suit the rider's will. A tamed raptor is also one of the most auspicious signs of status amongst the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s; many have died trying to tame these swift and deadly hunter beasts, and to possess one indicates great station.\nColors\nLvl 20\nLvl 40\nTauren.\nKodos: There is but one creature in all of Kalimdor that possesses the strength and stamina to bear a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; rider into battle: the majestic kodo beast. Swifter and slightly smaller than their wild cousins, kodo mounts nevertheless demonstrate the same resilience and fearlessness found in their untamed brethren, traits that serve them well when bearing their equally resolute riders. It is said that only the most virtuous of tauren can win the affection of a kodo war mount, for these mighty beasts only serve those that approach them with honor and respect in their hearts.\nColors\nLvl 20\nLvl 40\nBlood elves.\nHawkstrider: A member of the &lt;a href=\"tallstrider\"&gt;tallstrider&lt;/a&gt; family these birds have been breed to be able to not only carry a passenger but to look good while doing it. They come in a variety of bright colors and have a thin, curved beak and burning orange eyes.\nColors\nLvl 20\nLvl 40\nGoblin.\nTrike: A three-wheeled mechanical vehicle similar to the &lt;a href=\"Mekgineer%27s%20Chopper\"&gt;Mekgineer's Chopper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mechanohog\"&gt;Mechanohog&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Gnomish &lt;a href=\"Mechanostrider\"&gt;Mechanostrider&lt;/a&gt;, the Trike is mechanical by nature. Trikes can be purchased from a vendor in the Goblin Slums of Orgrimmar. The history behind the development of the Trike is unknown at this time. \nClass mounts.\nPaladin.\nPossessed of a noble spirit and deceptive intelligence uncommon among its kind, the warhorse is a regal charger that only the most inspiring of paladins can call to service. Once it pledges its service to a worthy master, the warhorse holds to its responsibility as a loyal mount and steadfast companion with a devotion that cannot be found in its lesser cousins. The &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s warhorse is more than a steed; it is a tireless cohort for its valorous master, carrying the paladin across Azeroth on a ceaseless crusade to vanquish evil wherever it may lurk.\nWarlock.\nThe remote plains of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; were once home to a unique breed of horse too proud and wild to countenance riders. Yet it is precisely this willful conceit that enticed the elders of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; to bind these majestic steeds to their service with dark rituals too horrific to perform by any but the most depraved of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. Although they retain their imposing forms, these newly-christened felsteeds have become twisted with infernal energies, treading flames and breathing fire. Where their eyes once shone with exuberance and a zest for life, they now burn with hatred for the warlocks who corrupted them and anguish at the passing of the lives they once knew."}

Works with 3.0.2. Replace mount names with the names of your mounts. The easiest way to do this is to open your mount pane and then shift click each mount into the macro. This does not work in Northrend\nFly where possible, ground mount elsewhere.\n /run if IsMounted() and not IsFlying() then Dismount() return end local t if (IsFlyableArea() and (GetRealZoneText()~='Dalaran' or GetMinimapZoneText()==\"Krasus' Landing\")) then t={4} else t={3,2} end CallCompanion(\"MOUNT\",t[random(#t)])\nThis will detect if the zone is flyable or not and summon a random mount accordingly. If you're in Dalaran, the flying mount will only be summoned at Krasus' Landing. In the example, my flying mount is 4, my ground ones are 3 and 2, the number stands for the order in your mount tab starting from 1. If you're flying above ground level you won't dismount so to avoid deaths by misclicking.\n--Fixed by Allene of Malygos\nFly where possible, ground mount elsewhere (improved).\nA variation on the Macro above, with Wintergrasp taken into account (Wintergrasp is reported as a flyable area, but isn't):\n /run local z=GetZoneText(),t; if (IsMounted()) then Dismount() return end; if (not IsFlyableArea() or (z==\"Dalaran\" and GetSubZoneText()~=\"Krasus' Landing\") or z==\"Wintergrasp\") then t={X,Y,Z} else t={F} end CallCompanion(\"mount\", t[random(#t)])\nRemember to replace {F} with the index of your flying mount and {X,Y,Z} with the indices your ground mounts.\n--Gromm of Stormreaver\nSmart Random Mount.\n /run if (not IsMounted()) then local t={x,y,z...} CallCompanion(\"MOUNT\", t[random(#t)]) else DismissCompanion(\"MOUNT\") end\nThis will call a mount listed at a random index listed within the t array. For instance, if you set t={1,3,5}, this macro will randomly call the mount referenced at index 1, 3, or 5. This macro is useful if you want to call a random type of mount, such as a swift flying mount, or swift ground mount. The down side to this macro is that the list of mounts are alphabetized, so any time you add a new mount, odds are you will have to reindex t. The DismissCompanion call is optional. This macro allows for a greater list of random indices than the macros above, at the expense of the user needing to create two macros - one for ground mounts, and one for flying mounts (obviously, you would also need to know when each one applied).\nMount / Hearthstone.\n #showtooltip Hearthstone\n /use [button:2] Hearthstone\n /dismount\n /use [flyable,nomodifier:alt] &lt;flier 1&gt;\n /use &lt;mount 1&gt;\nThis one will make you ride your grounded mount in Azeroth, ride your flying mount in Outland, and Hearthstone on right-click. If you alt+click it, it'll summon your normal mount wherever you are. If you set the macro icon to the Question Mark, it'll also show the Hearthstone icon, cooldown, and tooltip.\nConditionals are common in mount macros that make choices based on your location. You should replace the gray conditionals with ones that best suit your key bindings.\nNo-dismount flight.\n #showtooltip\n /stopmacro [mounted]\n /use [flyable] &lt;flier 1&gt;; &lt;mount 1&gt;\nor\n #showtooltip\n /stopmacro [flying,nobutton:2]\n /use [flyable] &lt;flier 1&gt;; &lt;mount 1&gt;\nThe first macro mounts if not already mounted, but does not cause accidental or intentional dismounting.\nThe second macro will dismount or mount a grounded steed whenever flight is impossible, but prevent flying dismounts unless specifically ordered (in this case, by right-click).\nEither macro can give you a preview of what they will do through the icon they display. Set the icon to the Question Mark when copying the macro into your settings.\nNo automatic dismount either!\n #showtooltip\n /use [button:2] &lt;flier 1&gt;\n /console autoDismount 0\n /stopmacro [button:2]\n /use &lt;mount 1&gt;\n /console autoDismount 1\nWith Patch 2.1.0, Blizzard introduced the ability to automatically dismount in the event that you cast a spell. This is good when on the ground, but dangerously bad for most classes when using a flying mount. While there is a toggle for this in your Interface Options, the above macro will enable auto-dismount when using your ground mount and disable auto-dismount when using your flying mount.\nIf you are flying, you can no longer cast spells -- The message \"You are mounted\" is displayed and the casting fails. If you are on the ground (flying or ground-bound mount) you will automatically dismount. (Confirmed as of Patch 2.4)\nMount while moving.\nThere is no way to detect motion in a macro, and any attempt to mount while moving will fail. Therefore, most classes will have to stand still until a mount macro finishes channeling. Dismounting may still occur under any condition.\nExceptional cases are found in &lt;a href=\"Useful%20macros%20for%20druids\"&gt;Druids'&lt;/a&gt; Travel and Flight Forms, and &lt;a href=\"Useful%20macros%20for%20shamans\"&gt;Shamans'&lt;/a&gt; Ghost Wolf abilities, which are instant-cast.\nIt may also be desirable to include an ability that increases speed or otherwise closes distance into a travel macro. If the ability is dependent on a target, like Intervene, put it at the macro's beginning. If the ability is independent but has a cooldown, like Sprint, put it at the macro's end.\nMounts and vanity pets.\n /cleartarget\n /targetexact Speedy\n /use [noexists]Turtle Box\n /stopmacro [noexists]\n /userandom [flyable]&lt;flier 1&gt;,&lt;flier 2&gt;;&lt;mount 1&gt;,&lt;mount 2&gt;\n /dismount\nThis macro will dismount the player, if applicable. It then looks for a vanity pet by name and summons it if the pet is not found. If the pet was already present and the player was on foot, mounting occurs.\nWhile neat, this macro is not without its problems. It's long, and in the version presented here was originally 252 characters. This can be resolved by using item numbers, or you can eliminate the randomization of mounts altogether. Clearing the target is unavoidable as there is no other way to check for a vanity pet: [pet] and [nopet] conditionals only work with combat pets.\nHere's a version that will let you keep your old target!\n /focus\n /cleartarget\n /targetexact &lt;NAME OF VANITY PET EXACT&gt;\n /use [noflying,noexists] item:&lt;ID OF \"box\" THAT BRINGS OUT YOUR VANITY PET&gt;\n /cleartarget\n /target [target=focus]\n /clearfocus\n /cast [flyable] item:&lt;ITEM ID FLYING MOUNT&gt;;item:&lt;ITEM ID GROUND MOUNT&gt;\n /dismount\nBasically what it does additionally to the one above is this:\nIt uses the \"focus\" target as a buffer to store your old target..once we are done with the check for the vanity pet we can thus restore the old target (and will clean up the \"focus\" too at that point)\nTo shrink the macro to 255 use itemIDs instead of itemNames!\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowwiki.com/Useful_macros%23Get_itemNumber_.28Used_to_shrink_a_macro.29\"&gt;How to grab the itemIDs of your Items&lt;/a&gt;\nP.S. obviously you'll loose any focus targets you had though...\nDruid Pre-Swift Flight Form/Post Epic Flying Button.\nThis macro is highly useful for druids who have yet to get their &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Flight%20Form\"&gt;Swift Flight Form&lt;/a&gt;, but have bought their 300 riding skill and an epic mount. This mount macro will load your flyer if you're in Outland, your Swift Mount when in Azeroth, and while flying, will dismount and switch to Flight Form instantly. This allows the Druid to quickly switch to Flight Form in order to use a gathering profession with the added ability of being able to fly away if aggro is gained.\n #showtooltip [flyable,mounted]Flight Form;[flyable]&lt;flying mount&gt;[noflying]&lt;Ground Mount&gt;\n /use [nomounted,flyable]&lt;flying mount&gt;;[nomounted,noflyable]&lt;Ground Mount&gt;\n /stopmacro [nomounted]\n /dismount [flyable,mounted]\n /cast [flyable] Flight Form\nEquip and Unequip Riding Gear depending on location.\n /equip [mounted] item:30449; [indoors] item:30449; item:25653\n /equip [mounted] item:29369; [indoors] item:29369; [flyable] item:32538\n /use [flyable,nomounted] item:25471; [nomounted] item:29471\n /dismount [mounted]\nThis macro completes four tasks. Line 1 equips your combat trinket if mounted, equips your combat trinket if indoors (for those times when you run inside and auto dismount), otherwise it equips your riding crop. Line 2 equips your combat cape if mounted, equips your combat cape if indoors, or equips your slowfall cape if you're in a flyable zone. Line 3 uses your flying mount if you're in a flyable zone or otherwise uses your ground mount. Line 4 dismounts you if you're mounted.\nDK mount cast.\n /cast [nomount] Acherus Deathcharger; [mounted] Path of Frost\n /cast [mod:shift] &lt;2nd mount here&gt;\n /cast [mod:ctrl] &lt;flying mount here&gt;\n /dismount [mod:alt]\nOr, if you'd like to keep it rather simple:\n /cast [nomod] Acherus Deathcharger\n /cast [mod:shift] &lt;2nd mount here&gt;\n /cast [mod:ctrl] &lt;flying mount here&gt;\n /cast [mod:alt] Path of Frost"}

Benevolent and solitary by nature, the mountain giants have awakened to find that the tranquil world they once helped to shape has become a hectic battlefield of fire and sorrow. Now the mountain giants have pledged their courage and strength to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves'&lt;/a&gt; cause -- and stand ready to banish the last remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from the world. These massive melee units that can take incredible amounts of punishment from attackers.\nInformation.\nMountain Giants are one of the Night Elves' ultimate melee unit - the other being &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Claw%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt;. Though extremely expensive and taking up a massive amount of food, Mountain Giants are incredibly bulky to make up for this; 1,600 health and several abilities to compliment it.\nTaunt prompts the Mountain Giant to perform a yell, forcing all hostile units to target the Mountain Giant, overriding all commands (such as focusing on an enemy Hero). This forces the enemy to reinsert the command again to make their units act the way they wanted them to. \nMake sure to research Hardened and Resistant Skin when using the giants. Hardened Skin reduces all attack damage the giant receives by 12 (after damage calculations), with a minimum of 3 damage taken from any attack should the resulting damage be less then 12. Resistant Skin will make the giants immune to some spells and any spells and effects that would harm the giant is reduced.\nMountain Giants may also rip trees from the ground to use as massive battering clubs against the enemy. This will override the giant's attack type from Normal to Siege, but grants it slightly more damage and an attack range of 200. The \"club\" will last for 15 swings before being discarded.\nSpells and abilities.\nardened Skin (Passive).\nThis means that lower units can't really damage him. You will need to use Tier 3 units such as Tauren, Knights, Bears, and Abominations.\nRsistant Skin (Passive).\nThis gives the unit hero magic resistance, similar to the resistance that level 6+ creeps have.\nNamely, you can't be Polymorphed, Possessed, etc, and all offensive spells have a shorter duration on the target (such as stuns, Ensnare, etc).\nIt DOES NOT reduce damage dealt to the target, however. That\u2019s an effect of &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20armor%20and%20attack%20types%23Hero_2\"&gt;hero armor&lt;/a&gt;, not hero magic resistance. "}

Wielding both enchanted warhammers and hand axes, these fierce fighters live to test themselves against worthy opponents. Unconcerned with their race's preoccupation with mechanical devices and mining precious minerals, Mountain Kings live only for battle. Dedicated to safeguarding the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; which saved their kingdom during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Mountain Kings can be counted upon to rally behind any banner that stands between freedom and the ever looming shadow of evil.\nHero names.\nBor Stonebreaker, Munin Ironcliff, Thorgas Broadaxe, &lt;a href=\"Kelv%20Sternhammer\"&gt;Kelv Sternhammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Grim Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, Buri Frostbeard, Huginn Ironcliff, Thordin Rockbeard, Bandis Forgefire, Gar Doomforge, Beazel Bludstone, Modi Stonesmith, Aggronor the Mighty.\nInformation.\nThe Mountain King is one of the top melee Heroes along with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf\"&gt;Night Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas the Demon Hunter and Blademaster take some additional time to invest, the Mountain King is good even at the start of the game, thanks to his powerful offensive skills. \nStorm Bolt is easily his best ability, because of its massive versatility - it is a powerful Hero killing spell, can disrupt channeled abilities and deals a lot of damage to boot. There is almost no delay when the hammer is thrown, meaning experienced human players can hit and run against an unfortunate target as soon as it is cast.\nThunder Clap is a trickier spell to use because the Mountain King has to get up close in order to deal damage with it. It is still a useful spell because Thunder Clap can affect more units than Storm Bolt can - professional players will often get their Heroes away should they be targeted, and Thunder Clap ignores that. It is also good for harassing other human and orc players, as a single clap between their town hall and gold mine often hits all five workers at once.\nBash is fairly unpredictable but is a good side skill for a starting Mountain King to conserve mana for other spells. The faster the Mountain King can attack, the more he can activate it, making Bloodlust and Unholy Frenzy extremely beneficial for him.\nAvatar makes the Mountain King even more bulkier, and also immune to almost every spell allowing him to wade into enemy units and do whatever he wishes.\nA Mountain King will benefit greatly from &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; support - the Paladin can continually cast Holy Light on him to null any damage he takes, while an Archmage's Brilliance Aura allows him to regenerate mana faster. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Mage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blood Mage&lt;/a&gt;s in team matches may also be useful, but note that the Blood Mage requires immense mana to operate properly. \nWhen it comes to items, try to give the Mountain King durability and mana-boosting items so he can take more punishment and have enough mana to make the most out of his devastating spells. Boots of Speed can also be beneficial so he can catch up with fleeing troops - combined with an Endurance or Unholy Aura, he shouldn't have much trouble doing so.\nAs a melee hero, a Mountain King can be fairly hard to kill because of his immense bulk. However, this doesn't mean he is completely impossible to counter.\nUse high-damage ranged units and Heroes with good hero killing capability against the Mountain King if he is not under his Avatar state. The faster he falls, the less likely he will bite back at your army.\nBecause his spells are especially deadly, it is highly recommended that you prevent the Mountain King from using them as much as possible. Either use the Demon Hunter's Mana Burn, &lt;a href=\"Firelord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt;'s Soul Burn or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Ranger&lt;/a&gt;'s Silence to prevent him from using his spells in battle. In most maps, the Mountain King won't have enough mana or mana-restoring items, so the faster his mana disappears, the less of a threat he becomes in battle. \nRead &lt;a href=\"http%3A//classic.battle.net/war3/basics/herokillers.shtml\"&gt;Hero Killers&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells and abilities.\nStorm Bolt.\nStorm Bolt is an incredibly powerful spell by the Mountain King; he'll throw his hammer at the targeted unit. Experienced micro players can essentially cancel the throw animation by moving him immediately as soon as he launches the hammer, giving him additional breathing space if the enemy decides to pursue him. This also makes the hammer almost instantaneous and almost impossible to react to. It also works well against normal units.\nIt starts off with impressive damage and increases by 125 damage each level, making it a powerful finisher spell. Against the Undead, it can be combined with Holy Light for devastating killing potential, dealing up to 650 damage almost instantly when both Heroes' spells synchronize perfectly with each other.\nUse Storm Bolt to interrupt spells that require &lt;a href=\"http%3A//classic.battle.net/war3/basics/spellbasics.shtml%23spellchanneling\"&gt;spell channeling&lt;/a&gt;.\nDon't forget Storm Bolt works on aerial units too.\nThunder Clap.\nThis spell will not work on air units. \nIt's a useful ability for dealing with numerous enemies surrounding the Mountain King, as struck units have a 50% attack speed and movement reduction for a short duration. Wade the Mountain King into a group of hostile units and use Thunder Clap. However, it's not a powerful Hero finisher and any Mountain King build leaning toward that side should opt for Storm Bolt instead.\nBash (Passive).\nBash is free stun and damage while the Mountain King attacks normally. When the Mountain King triggers Bash, his hammer will slam with greater than usual force (indicated with a blue slam). Putting the Mountain King under the effects of Bloodlust, Unholy Frenzy and potential Gloves of Haste drops from creep camps can allow him to potentially stunlock enemies due to his increased attack speed, and the attack will deal great damage thanks to the bonus damage and the Mountain King's naturally high Strength stat.\nBash also works on aerial units; just make sure the Mountain King is equipped with an orb so he can attack them.\nAvatar (Ultimate).\nNotes: Mountain King stats in Avatar Form:\nAvatar is very useful. Be sure to use it whenever possible but don't waste it.\nThis ability is great when sieging an enemy base with large amounts of towers or taking part in an intense battle, as the bonus hitpoints and armor make the Mountain King an excellent meat shield and prevents him from being focused down as easily. Remember, you can still cast &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Holy%20Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; on an Avatared Mountain King.\nRun away until the Avatar wears off and then engage in battle.\nManual description.\nThe mountain kings, or 'Thanes' as they are known in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, are the mightiest dwarven warriors of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Wielding both enchanted warhammers and battle-axes, these fierce fighters live to test themselves against worthy opponents."}

{"id": "15863", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15863", "title": "Mountain giant", "text": "Mountain giants are colossal creatures, crafted by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s when the world was young.\nBackground.\nMountain giants are composed of living stone and stout flora. Crafted epochs ago by the titans from massive sections of stone, these creatures seek to protect the natural environment from any who would cause it harm. Benevolent and solitary by nature, the mountain giants have awakened to find that the tranquil world they once helped to shape has become a hectic battlefield of fire and sorrow. Now the mountain giants have pledged their courage and strength to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' cause \u2014 and stand ready to banish the last remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from the world. These giants can take incredible amounts of punishment from attackers.\nThe mountain giants awoke from their \"timeless slumber\" when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attacked in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, apparently having helped the night elves long ago. They seem to have started sleeping when &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; initiated stasis of the giants. The mountain giants assisted the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; not due to a desire to help them in particular, but because the night elves were the largest local force who opposed the Burning Legion. Short of a planetary threat, it is rare to see mountain giants, &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt; fighting with a mortal army. However, mountain giants helped the night elves after the Battle of Mount Hyjal. When the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; were fighting against &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; brought mountain giants from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to the isles to aid &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Giant%20%28Feralas%29\"&gt;mountain giants&lt;/a&gt; were rallied in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; and aided the night elves once again, although Horde adventurers were in turn sent to kill some of them and capture their spirits. &lt;a href=\"Rockbiter%20%28mountain%20giant%29\"&gt;Rockbiter&lt;/a&gt; also served as an Alliance quest-giver in Feralas.\nA healthy giant eats three square meals a decade, and they relieve themselves every fifteen to twenty-five years. The ancient cliff giants of the southern region of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; consume the rock and buildings of the land for sustenance. The excrement from their consumption is a highly malleable and extremely strong crystal known as &lt;a href=\"Crystallized%20Azsharite\"&gt;Azsharite&lt;/a&gt;. The formations litter the southern arc, but few are ever recovered due to the extremely violent nature of the &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s. The giants devour trespassers, and their organic bodies are also transformed into Azsharite. Many heroes recover enough of the Azsharite for the creation of powerful weapon's body.\nThe cliff giants of Feralas are extensions of the earth itself. When nature thrives, they are benevolent protectors and peaceful guardians. But when the forest is tainted, so too are they. When the mountain giants are distraught, they rage in frustration and weep, and their tears fall upon the stones as shining crystals known as &lt;a href=\"Stonetear\"&gt;Stonetear&lt;/a&gt;s. The mountain giants are the night elves' most powerful allies of the forest. They're carved from the land itself. The mountain giants left the mountains to aid the night elves when the burning legion appeared in the world.\nDespite being creations of the titans, some mountain giants, like &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Kazum\"&gt;Baron Kazum&lt;/a&gt;, serve the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lieutenants\"&gt;Elemental Lieutenants&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt; enthralled the behemoth known as &lt;a href=\"Landslide%20%28mountain%20giant%29\"&gt;Landslide&lt;/a&gt; when she took up residence in &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown what the story is behind the others.\nAppearance.\nThe mountain giants of stone have northwestern &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; as their main area, where they go under the names of &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Giant\"&gt;Cliff Giant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Land%20Walker\"&gt;Land Walker&lt;/a&gt;. Mountain giants appear to adapt to their surrounding environment and take on characteristics, such as taking on a differing coloration than their standard grey and green. Mountain giants found in desert regions and other places where the soil is naturally red-tinted take on a sandy-colored appearance, but their mossy covering usually remains greenish. Mountain giants found in particularly rocky areas without much greenery can carry mossy covering with a decidedly gray or silvery appearance.\nIn the RPG.\nThe giant has a thick humanoid build and weathered and rocky skin. Its arms are very long for its build, while its legs are quite short. This great creature looks to be composed of roughly hewn stone, patched with moss. Its fists are the size of human torsos, each of its fingers the width of a human arm. It rumbles as it stares down at you. Birthed from the stone, the mountain giants were created to shape the world's mountains. Once they roamed everywhere, crafting the craggy peaks and carving the valleys of Azeroth. Now, few remain to carry out their work. Those left, though, are considered mighty creatures of mythic power and are seen as the mightiest warriors in the world. Mountain giants measure a towering 20 feet tall and weigh nearly 12,000 pounds. Their natural life spans measure into the thousands of years. They carry valuables in cracks and ledges of their skin, tucking jewels and items into niches where they will fit. They leave larger items in mountain caves. They normally eat three meals per decade and go to toilet every 15 to 20 years.\nMountain giants are hermitic, content to hide away in the remote mountains of the world. They are slow to anger, ignoring most annoyances as temporary problems that will eventually disappear. When stirred to anger, however, they are frightening and dangerous. A few years ago, they awakened to discover that the tranquil world they loved is besieged by fire and ash. They left their mountain peaks to join their old allies, the night elves, against the Burning Legion and other forces of destruction. Mountain giants do not reproduce. All mountain giants that exist today are the same creatures that the titans created at the dawn of the world, and the immortal creatures tend to be perpetual and unchanging. Thus, every mountain giant that falls in battle is one that cannot be replaced.\nMountain giants can see twice as far as humans in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions. Mountain giants are immortal and never suffer the effects of aging, nor can they die of old age. They can die through other means, as can mortal creatures. Mountain giants eagerly enter melee combat, believing (usually correctly) that they can destroy anything with their clubs and can absorb whatever their enemies throw at them. They enter the most violent areas of melee, offering themselves as targets to protect their allies. Mountain giants use longspears formed from mountain stone. The stony hide of the mountain giant is hard and thick, providing it with some protection from magical and normal attacks. A mountain giant can throw rocks as well as any giant. A mountain giant can catch rocks as well. A mountain giant can shape an existing piece of stone into any rough shape, up to thirty cubic feet at a time. The mountain giant can also use this ability to heal itself. Mountain giants speak Darnassian and Titan. Mountain giants do not concern themselves with learning other languages, but a few of the more adventurous ones find it beneficial to speak Common. But their speech tends to be crude and dim-witted. Every once in a while, a mountain giant leaves its home in Kalimdor and travels into the larger world. An adventuring giant usually joins a particular night elf friend, but not always. Mountain giants rarely explain their actions; they simply walk out of the forests, then travel the roads, or the trackless wilderness, or board a ship without a word; perhaps they simply assume that everyone else takes it on faith that they know what they\u2019re doing."}

Wielding both enchanted warhammers and hand axes, these fierce fighters live to test themselves against worthy opponents. Unconcerned with their race's preoccupation with mechanical devices and mining precious minerals, Mountain Kings live only for battle. Dedicated to safeguarding the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; which saved their kingdom during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the mountain kings can be counted upon to rally behind any banner that stands between freedom and the ever looming shadow of evil.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; they served the Alliance in various battles.

The armor is also simply known as the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Heritage of the Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nThe most respected and revered of the Ironforge dwarves' warriors, mountain kings represent mighty champions of their race. While some Ironforge dwarves are enamored of the new firearms, and others unlock the secrets of their titan heritage, mountain kings continue a legacy that has existed for millennia. This is a legacy of beer, blood, booze, and thunder, of red-glinting axes and crushing hammers. It is a legacy continued by some of Ironforge's renowned heroes, including &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, deceased brother of King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge.\nMountain kings boast prodigious combat abilities. They are ferocious in melee combat, wielding the traditional weapons of their race to decimate their foes. Their attacks leave opponents stunned and reeling. While they do not focus their efforts on discovering the secrets of the titans, they have long known of a powerful spark within every Ironforge dwarf - and mountain kings draw upon this spark and fan it into a raging flame. They conjure magic hammers and axes to hurl at their targets, stunning and slowing them so they can get close enough to use their real weapons. They transform themselves into silver-sheened creatures of living stone, shrugging off all attacks and hacking through flesh and bone with frightening ease.\nMountain kings in the world.\nMountain kings are champions of Ironforge, and as such they protect Ironforge's interests. Some remain in Khaz Modan, protecting their homelands from the depredations of trolls, troggs, and worse creatures. Others travel the world searching for the foes of Ironforge and, by extension, the Alliance \u2014 demons, undead, Dark Iron dwarves, troggs, and ice trolls. They are crusaders for their race, stamping out their enemies before they have a chance to strike at Ironforge or Stormwind. Other mountain kings travel the world on missions provided by their king, the Explorers' Guild, other patrons, or perhaps themselves.\nMountain kings have a tradition of proving themselves against mighty foes. Some Mountain kings fall to &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, or other ferocious creatures, but mountain kings are famous for overcoming these challenges and then seeking out another, even mightier beast. Mountain kings live only for battle; they are unconcerned with their race's preoccupation with technological gadgets, with mining precious materials, or with crafting great weapons. They feel a debt to the Alliance, which saved their kingdom during the Second War. Wherever the banner is raised against the forces of evil, there stand mountain kings, gripping their axes, slugging back ale, and loudly asking why the battle has yet to begin.\nIronforge dwarves also call mountain kings \"&lt;a href=\"thane\"&gt;thane&lt;/a&gt;s,\" an honorary title that respects the mighty warriors' prowess and strength. This moniker also recalls the day when most, if not all, mountain kings truly were kings of the mountains, leading the dwarf clans in the deep caves. In modern times, Ironforge has a single king - but many mountain kings are nobles or other honorary personages, the scions of families whose names and deeds echo through the generations. Other mountain kings are the first of their kith to attain such greatness, and look to carve their names into Ironforge's history.\nTypical mountain king.\nMountain kings are the elite of the Ironforge warriors, imposing \ufb01ghters who tap into mystic powers to become true champions of their race. Many mountain kings remain in Khaz Modan, defending their people against attack. Others wander the world, however, \ufb01ghting alongside other Alliance forces to destroy all manner of evil creatures. Mountain kings are impressive in combat both for their own skill and for their ability to direct troops, and they are often found leading elite forces against powerful opponents. They have the respect of every Alliance \ufb01ghter, and many treat them with awe and a little fear. One such mountain king is &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Grim Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;.\nRace.\nMountain kings are &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; only. Some speculate that &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; may have their own, perverted version of this heritage.\nAffiliation.\nAny mountain kings who leave the Alliance are branded as traitors and outcasts.\nClass features.\nThough they willingly battle under any circumstances, mountain kings spent much time in their people\u2019s tunnels and are adept at fighting in the dark places below the earth. Some of this ability is skill and some of it is morale and con\ufb01dence.\nMountain kings are more than proficient with their ancestral weapons \u2014 axes and hammers. They draw upon their traditions and ancient techniques to enhance the deadly powers of these weapons, finding vulnerable areas and swinging with extreme force and from the appropriate angle to add extra oomph to their blows. A mountain king can strike so hard he sends his opponents reeling with the power of his blows.\nThe mountain king can use &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;storm hammers&lt;/a&gt; as a spell-like ability. The mountain king can use &lt;a href=\"thunderclap\"&gt;thunderclap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt;. Mountain kings have learned tricks with their axes and hammers to enable them to strike past their opponents\u2019 defenses. The mountain king\u2019s blows are so strong that he leaves his opponents dazed and unable to act. Through his internal drive and the titan forces that reside in all Ironforge dwarves, the mountain king is able to turn his flesh to stone casting &lt;a href=\"stoneform\"&gt;stone\ufb02esh&lt;/a&gt;.

What were they thinking?\nInvulnerable?\nYou're a fool that should heed my warnings. No one is invulnerable. You would be wise to remember that bit of advice.\nI'll tell you what. Since you fancy yourself the hero type, if you can make your way through the Badlands to the Searing Gorge and bring me back something to prove your heroics, I'll see what I can do about getting you a key.\nIn the southeasternmost corner of Searing Gorge is a lady almost as tough as me, Margol the Rager.

As seen from the map, it is near where the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Citadel%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Black Citadel&lt;/a&gt; was located.\nLocation.\nThere are no locations in Outland in World of Warcraft carrying these mountains' name. Moreover, it's difficult to estimate where they in any case would have been located. In the TBC \"Behind the Scenes\" DVD, one of the designers stated that players had only visited &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; during Warcraft III. As such, the Mountains of Flame can be assumed to have been part of the northern Hellfire Peninsula - possibly another name for the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Black Citadel - which in \"Warcraft III\" was located in Hellfire Peninsula - was later &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned to actually be the same as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; which is located in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.

The Forsaken were formerly led by their founder, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the former Ranger-General of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken's capital was the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, in the royal catacombs beneath the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;capital city of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken were displaced at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, when Sylvanas &lt;a href=\"Plague\"&gt;plagued&lt;/a&gt; the Undercity rather than let the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; capture it. Eventually, after Sylvanas abandoned the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil's&lt;/a&gt; return, Calia led the effort to reclaim the Ruins of Lordaeron for the Forsaken, retaking their home. Calia and the remaining Forsaken leaders then united as the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt;, ready to discover a new destiny for the Forsaken.\nWhile comprised primarily of undead &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the Forsaken are a diverse faction that include several different races at their biological core. However, they have all assumed their racial identity as \"Forsaken,\" due to their shared goals and loyalties.\nIntroduction.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s grasp on his vast armies faltered after the Third War, a contingent of undead broke free of their master's iron will. Although this freedom seemed to be a blessing at first, these former humans were soon tormented by memories of the unspeakable horrors that they had committed as mindless Scourge agents. Those who did not descend into madness were faced with a chilling realization: the entirety of Azeroth sought their destruction.\nIn their darkest hour, the renegade undead were rallied together by the former ranger-general of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Defeated during an attack on her kingdom and transformed into a powerful Scourge banshee, Sylvanas had also regained her freedom from the Lich King. Under their new queen's guidance, the independent undead \u2013 known as Forsaken \u2013 established the Undercity beneath the ruins of Lordaeron's capital. While some Forsaken feared Sylvanas, others valued the security she provided. Many of the free-willed undead, however, found a purpose to their cursed existence through the banshee queen's burning desire to destroy the Lich King.\nDespite not being affiliated with the Scourge, the Forsaken came under threat from humans who were dedicated to eradicating all undead. As a means to further her own goals and protect her budding nation, Sylvanas sent emissaries to various factions in search of allies. The kind-hearted &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; proved to be the most promising contact. Specifically, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; saw the potential for redemption in Sylvanas' people, even though he was fully aware of the Forsaken's sinister nature. Thus, the tauren convinced &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, despite his misgivings, to forge an alliance of convenience between the Forsaken and the Horde. In the end, the Forsaken's chances of victory against the Lich King were bolstered, while the Horde gained an invaluable foothold in the Eastern Kingdoms.\nHistory.\nThird War and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the once-glorious capital of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, was decimated by a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army under the command of Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. Death offered no escape for the scores of humans killed during the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign to scour the living from Lordaeron. Instead, the kingdom's fallen were risen into undeath as Scourge minions and forced to wage an unholy war against everything and everyone that they once held dear.\nIn the wake of &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s failed attempt to melt the icy continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the powerful energies possessed by the Lich King inside his &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; slowly began to decay. Inexorably this resulted in a partial loss of control of the more distant &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces. The result was that many undead under the Lich King's mental domination had their conscious will restored. Their spirits and memories were somehow returned to their undead bodies. Even the Lich King's champion, Arthas, began to weaken as the Lich King's power waned. Arthas the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; and his lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; were suddenly thrust into an undead civil war. Still fanatically loyal to the Lich King, Arthas heeded the call of his master and returned to Northrend as Illidan launched his second attempt to destroy the Lich King directly. Arthas left Kel'Thuzad in command of his forces when he departed.\nLady Sylvanas Windrunner rallied half of the standing undead forces in Lordaeron and staged a coup for control over the undead empire. With their leader's sharp cunning and the assistance of their &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s, the undead forcibly coerced a number of lingering forces in Lordaeron to fighting their battles with them; such as gnolls, bandits, and ogres. First, the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Dark Lady, and swiftly sold his loyalty to Lady Sylvanas in return for sparing him. With Varimathras' assistance, the undead forces successfully deposed the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; and his army, allying with the considerable forces of the mind-controlled &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt; in order to free Lordaeron from the control of the remaining dreadlord, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;. Garithos, though despising non-humans, joined forces with the undead and their inhuman allies to this end. Lady Sylvanas promised to leave Lordaeron to his jurisdiction after the battle was won, despite herself never having any intention to respect their pact, and together with their new allies, the undead marched to end Balnazzar.\nWith their combined forces, the undead and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; dismantled the final bastion of the dreadlords' power in Lordaeron, and Varimathras personally destroyed his nathrezim brother. No sooner had Garithos demanded that the Forsaken leave the land that Sylvanas promised him when she turned on him and executed the human leader; claiming the ruins of Lordaeron for the free-willed undead instead. With her immediate enemies dealt with and the ruins of Lordaeron firmly in her hands, Lady Sylvanas proclaimed her faction of self-aware undead as the \"Forsaken,\" and resolved to slaughter anyone who would dare stand in the way of their dominion. \nFollowing this, Queen Sylvanas and the Forsaken claimed the Undercity as their own and completed the winding network of catacombs and crypts that the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; had begun constructing. Today, rivers of poisonous sludge flow through all avenues of the vast Undercity. The toxic fumes and fetid odors permeating every corner of the stronghold have made it a place almost unbearable for the living members of the Horde. Yet for Sylvanas and her cursed followers, the Undercity has become a much-needed refuge in a world where her kind is still feared and hunted.\nWhile the Forsaken had claimed a base of power, their hold on Lordaeron was tenuous at best. To this end, the Dark Lady looked to finding allies.\nAlliance with the Horde.\nSylvanas worked to ensure that the damned such as herself would have a home free from threats by the living. As a means to further her own goals and protect her budding nation, Sylvanas sent emissaries to various factions in search of allies. To that end, she sent ambassadors to both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Her emissaries to the Alliance never returned. Sylvanas suspected that they hadn't survived long enough even to make it past the gates of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the humans were generally unaware of the Forsaken's existence and of their split from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. On the other side the world, the kind-hearted &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; proved to be the most promising contact. Specifically, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; saw the potential for redemption in Sylvanas' people, even though he was fully aware of the Forsaken's sinister nature. Knowing that no human agency would ever give them shelter or aid against the Scourge, now their hated enemy, they eventually turned to the Horde, based across the sea in the distant land of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, for assistance.\nTo convince the Horde to accept the Forsaken into its alliance, the undead ambassadors claimed that they merely sought a cure for their degenerative condition, which they said only the powers of shamanism and the life-giving energies of the earth could provide. In exchange for this healing aid, the Forsaken vowed to support the Horde in all of its ventures throughout Lordaeron and Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; also claimed she merely wanted to aid the Forsaken in their quest to finding a path back to being human and was thus one of the prominent proponents for the alliance between the tauren and the Forsaken.\nHaving done battle with the undead on many occasions, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and tauren chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde were immediately suspicious of the Forsaken's motives. However, due to growing political tensions, the warriors acquiesced to a council of sages known as The &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;. The council argued that it was the Horde's duty to aid the Forsaken, who wrestled with inner demons just as the orcs had for generations.\nThus, the tauren convinced Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, despite his misgivings, to forge an alliance of convenience between the Forsaken and the Horde. In the end, the Forsaken's chances of victory against the Lich King were bolstered, while the Horde gained an invaluable foothold in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Though Thrall and Cairne secretly suspect the worst, it remains to be seen what Sylvanas and her fanatical Forsaken have planned...\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; are not particularly fond of the Forsaken because of their &lt;a href=\"shamanistic\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; beliefs, but tolerate them and have learned to trust them in times of war.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAs the primary &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; force in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken went about dealing with a number of their surrounding enemies. New free-willed undead, freed by Lady Sylvanas, were inducted into the Forsaken's ranks and assisted their new (and old) people in the tasks set before them within &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. For years this blighted area has been home to Queen Sylvanas and her Forsaken, as well as the remaining vestiges of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Their zealots, bent on wiping out any and all undead from Azeroth regardless of affiliation, have long been a thorn in the Forsaken's side. Recently, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; has offered assistance to Sylvanas' people against the Crusaders' constant harassment in eastern Tirisfal Glades. In addition, the Forsaken have begun a fresh march on their enemy's stronghold \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in an effort to finally secure their homeland from external threats.\nConcurrent with securing the immediate regions pertaining to Lordaeron, the Forsaken turned their attention to numerous conflicts neighboring their kingdom. The humans and dwarves of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the perennial enemy of their Horde allies, remained at large on the continent. The Forsaken launched several offenses against their new enemies, resulting in the conflict for resources in &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; (which the &lt;a href=\"Defilers\"&gt;Defilers&lt;/a&gt; were tasked with securing) and a number of conflicts around &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; arose. Furthermore, the Forsaken began research into a certain form of plague that could be used against the Scourge (and ostensibly, the living). The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; rose to meet this goal, and has been conducting a number of low-key experiments ever since.\n&lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, the Champion of the Forsaken, was liberated by Lady Sylvanas herself from the Scourge. After they had proved themselves to the queen, the Blightcaller tasked Forsaken members with killing the beast that had taken his life, retrieving a document pertaining to both his and the banshee queen's time as living comrades from a &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;lodge of exiled elves&lt;/a&gt;, and assaulting the Scarlet Crusade's primary power-base in Lordaeron.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, newly invigorated by the returned &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; and the new powers at their disposal, went about reclaiming and rebuilding their ancient capital and expelling the Scourge from their lands. Lady Sylvanas, who had lost no love for her homeland even in death, offered numerous methods of support to her former people and was a strong supporter of their acceptance into the Horde. Together with the sin'dorei, a regiment of Forsaken troops assisted their elven allies in reclaiming much of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, including the town of &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken also assisted the blood elven &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; order in forging a stone of great power to wield against the Scourge; their intimate knowledge of the Lich King's grasp proving an essential component in its creation.\nThe Forsaken continued their research into their progressing plague in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, where numerous apothecaries such as &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Azethen\"&gt;Apothecary Azethen&lt;/a&gt; took and experimented with a variety of new ingredients for Forsaken uses.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken dealt with curing the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; pledged itself to destroy the Scourge's &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es.\nWar against the Lich King.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; began to make his presence known to the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken came ever closer to achieving their vengeance upon the despoiler of Lordaeron. The Forsaken were one of the major powers in the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Antoine%20Brack\"&gt;Antoine Brack&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and a champion of the Forsaken, was captured by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nLady Sylvanas moved to and from the frozen wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and oversaw the construction of a proper Forsaken town within the region of &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. One of the new Forsaken camps in Northrend is &lt;a href=\"New%20Agamand\"&gt;New Agamand&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the Royal Apothecary Society's members took up residence to finish perfecting the plague to unleash upon the Lich King. Lady Sylvanas had been methodically and patiently overseeing the creation of this contagion for several years now, and it seemed the time at last had come to test it.\nDuring the Lich King's initial attack on the cities of the Horde and Alliance, a renowned apothecary named &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; set up camp in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; to counter the Lich King's own spreading plague. After numerous stages of experimentation, Putress succeeded in forming a counter-agent and curbing the spread of the plague of undeath. For his efforts, he gained favor within the Forsaken's ranks, and Sylvanas dispensed him to assist the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Horde advance&lt;/a&gt; into Northrend. Both Sylvanas and Putress were present during the Scourge attack on &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dark Lady assisted &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and several adventurers in fighting the invaders off. Nevertheless, the attack convinced Warchief Thrall to commit to a Northrend campaign, much to Sylvanas' approval.\nThe Forsaken were one of the major superpowers to advance on Northrend. While the main Horde force attacked and conquered regions of &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken fleet (comprised of customized Lordaeron ships dredged up from the ocean) laid siege to Howling Fjord. Coming under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Hand of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken army tasked with delivering apt revenge against Arthas, the queen's navy swiftly crushed the Alliance Northwatch fleet and cornered them on the shores of the Fjord. No sooner had the Forsaken began their assault, however, had the Lich King turned his gaze back to his former servants: &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Prince Valanar&lt;/a&gt; offered the Forsaken commander &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Anselm\"&gt;High Executor Anselm&lt;/a&gt; the chance to renounce his fealty to Queen Sylvanas and return to the Scourge's embrace. However, Anselm swiftly disposed of the &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt; prince, and had adventurers slay him for his insolence in making mock of the queen and killing his men.\nThe Hand of Vengeance also waged a war against the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, and the Royal Apothecary Society's field-testing plaguebringers drenched a number with a potent strain of blight in order to test its final stages of production.\nTheir efforts would come to a head during the events of &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, where the Forsaken stationed at &lt;a href=\"Venomspite\"&gt;Venomspite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; perfected the final strains of the plague brought over from New Agamand. The Forsaken also came into conflict with their old enemy the Scarlet Crusade, now dissolved and reformed into the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, just as the hour of the Forsaken was to approach, tragedy struck. During the battle for &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, Grand Apothecary Putress and renegade plaguebringers made their appearance. After questioning the newly-arrived Lich King as to whether he thought the Forsaken had \"forgotten\" or \"forgiven\" him for what he had done, Putress drenched the battlefield in a massive strain of blight, causing huge losses to the collaboration of Horde and Alliance forces present. The blight was so powerful, in fact, that Arthas himself was brought to his knees. The Lich King fled back to Icecrown, and Putress was left to cackle triumphantly at the destruction wrought on by the plague.\nPutress' actions were outside the orders of the Forsaken and, concurrently with the Wrathgate attack, Varimathras had usurped control of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas barely escaped with her life and her loyalists, and the Forsaken were taken in by Thrall while they planned their next move. In a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and Sylvanas reveal that Putress had allied with the treacherous dreadlord in order to depose the Dark Lady's rule. Despite this, Jaina warns them that &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless holds them responsible, and is considering leading an army into the Undercity in order to reclaim Lordaeron for the Alliance. Unwilling to abandon the Undercity to the traitors, Sylvanas, Thrall, and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; lead a &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Horde counterattack&lt;/a&gt; in order to remove Varimathras from power and restore the Undercity to the Forsaken. After fighting their way through a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;-controlled Undercity, the Banshee Queen and the Warchief succeed in killing Varimathras and retaking the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt;. As they prepare to strike at Putress, however, King Varian enters and declares his intention to end it all there. Before the battle can increase in intensity, Jaina swiftly teleports the Alliance forces out of the Undercity, resulting in a successful Horde restoration.\nThough the Undercity had been restored to its rightful masters, the repercussions of the Wrathgate have hounded the Forsaken relentlessly. Their abomination guardians were either removed or relegated to the sewers, and &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Overseer%20%28Undercity%29\"&gt;Kor'kron overseers&lt;/a&gt; were deployed to watch over the Forsaken from that point forward. Thrall's trust for the Forsaken seems to have become thinner than ever, and their credibility in the eyes of the wider Horde has also suffered.\nWith the Undercity securely back in Horde hands, Lady Sylvanas personally made her way into Northrend in order to claim vengeance upon Arthas. Together with her dark rangers, the Banshee Queen infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and fought her way through to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, where she came face-to-face with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;the blade that took her life&lt;/a&gt;. After Arthas successfully fought her off, however, Sylvanas was forced to face her inability to defeat her greatest foe alone.\nWith the combined efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King finally fell. However, with his death, a void was left - while Sylvanas and the Forsaken had existed solely to claim their vengeance, the Dark Lady could only ponder what was left for them.\nCataclysm.\nAs it happens, the Forsaken - having successfully partaken in the fall of the Lich King - have turned their attention to other pursuits. For one: the complete conquest of Lordaeron. Now, along with being mistrusted by her own allies, Sylvanas recognizes that many of Azeroth's other inhabitants still see her people as a threat, even after the Lich King's defeat. As their numbers dwindle by the day, the Forsaken have begun fortifying their holdings around the Undercity, working to prove their loyalty to the Horde's cause even as they ready themselves for any future attacks.\nAfter the Lich King's death, a number of the more intelligent former &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; members were accepted into the Forsaken's ranks by Queen Sylvanas. Some of them, the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, have brought with them a new age for the Forsaken: the ability to \"procreate\" via their necromantic abilities, bolstering their numbers. The second generation Forsaken are individuals who were raised into undeath by these Val'kyr.\nThe risen dead of the new Forsaken generation are given a choice of what to do after they are reborn. Some of them, such as &lt;a href=\"Valdred%20Moray\"&gt;Valdred Moray&lt;/a&gt;, accept their fate, and seem keen to make themselves useful and serve the Forsaken in death. The resurrected Prince &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; seemed resigned to the fate that befell him and while not particularly enthusiastic about killing his former allies, he personally gave the quests to slay them for the good of the Dark Lady.\nOn the other hand, others do not react so positively. &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; reacts in horror to what she had become, and &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Redpath\"&gt;Marshal Redpath&lt;/a&gt;, not happy with his fate, attacks &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt; after the transition. Some of the new Forsaken simply kill themselves on the spot. &lt;a href=\"Dumass\"&gt;Dumass&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most extreme case of how the process can strip away rational thought and intelligence.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken launched an offensive against &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, after being ordered by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to do so. The Forsaken appear to be taking on a more offensive stance regarding the war with the Alliance, and with their new ability to bolster their ranks, their stranglehold on Lordaeron has become tighter than ever. The Forsaken have also began to fortify their own territories, stepping up from their previous preferences of run down human-esque buildings in favor of their own architecture, seen briefly in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nForsaken activity on is in &lt;a href=\"Warspear\"&gt;Warspear&lt;/a&gt; and Horde Garrison, alongside other members of the Horde. Forsaken \"ambassador\" is &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Fennick\"&gt;Captain Fennick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;Recruiting Officer&gt;, and he can change orcish garrison guards to Frostwall Deathguards.\n&lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Gibb\"&gt;Benjamin Gibb&lt;/a&gt; ventured into &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; as Sylvanas's agent. He explored &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison\"&gt;Admiral Taylor's Garrison&lt;/a&gt; and later joined the Garrison Commander as a follower.\nLegion.\nWith the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the dying Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; chose Sylvanas as the new Warchief of the Horde. During the invasion, various Forsaken joined the &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s and aided them in the fight against the Legion. Meanwhile, a group of Forsaken known as the &lt;a href=\"Queensguard\"&gt;Queensguard&lt;/a&gt; clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; over control of the &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Tower\"&gt;Warden Tower&lt;/a&gt;s across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, going back and forth over control and attack of each tower. During the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible that the garrison at &lt;a href=\"Starstalker%27s%20Point\"&gt;Starstalker's Point&lt;/a&gt; is overrun by the Legion and slain.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was preoccupied with running the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, several individuals from the Forsaken set up the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; as an interim-government for the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; in the Dark Lady's absence. Some within the Desolate Council were dissatisfied with the Forsaken's strict culture of forgetting their past lives and enforced continued undead existence; they had hoped to one day convince Sylvanas to institute reforms. When King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; proposed a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; in order to reconcile the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; with their Forsaken relatives, Sylvanas gave it her permission on the stipulation that the Desolate Council help organize it and be its sole Forsaken participants. However, the Gathering ended in tragedy. &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; had incited the Forsaken participants of the event to defect to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which elicited Warchief Sylvanas's slaughter of all the Forsaken participants and Calia to curb any sedition to her authority. While the Alliance buried the Forsaken that were killed at the Gathering at an &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas has used the failed reunion to further alienate the Forsaken from their human counterparts.\nSylvanas later convinced the Horde that they need to take the initiative now that &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; threatened to shift the balance of power between the Alliance and Horde. Thus the Horde instigated the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; to sow discord among the Alliance and coerce the Alliance into submission. Although the Horde successfully conquered the &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; lands, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; had failed to kill &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, which Sylvanas believed was integral to killing the Alliance's defiant spirit. Sylvanas then ordered the burning of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; in order to inflict a terrible wound on the Alliance and give the Horde a chance to win the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs expected, the Alliance retaliated by attempting to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Horde's best efforts, the Alliance routed the Horde from the city. Saurfang who disapproved of Sylvanas' dishonorable tactics, was left alone to be captured by the Alliance. Rather than let the Alliance claim Lordaeron as a stronghold, Sylvanas had rigged all of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and Lordaeron Keep to be &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt;. Having fled from their home, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Refugee\"&gt;Forsaken Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s that were evacuated before the battle were forced to settle in Orgrimmar.\nThe Forsaken stand adamantly as Sylvanas loyalists throughout the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, with her using her psychologically manipulative tactics to ensure they remained angry and spiteful towards the Alliance and, eventually, towards Saurfang's loyalists as well, and with her &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;eliminating any Forsaken who attempted to break away&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken recouped their losses by raising slain &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; into undeath. After discovering that &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; had become the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and her forces had returned to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim the night elves' lost lands, the Forsaken were sent to oppose them during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Fourth War, Sylvanas would employ extreme tactics such as raising &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; into undeath and depriving him of free will to use as a weapon against the Alliance. Such tactics did not sit well with individuals such as &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt; since free will was what distinguished Forsaken from the Scourge. Thomas Zelling aided in Derek Proudmoore's escape to Alliance lands, which subsequently led to Sylvanas executing him for treason.\nUltimately Sylvanas betrays even the Forsaken, denouncing them, like the rest of the Horde, as 'nothing' and abandoning the majority of them. This leaves the Forsaken without a home or a leader, and now, like the rest of the Horde, they have an uncertain future of their own to find. &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; eventually stepped up to represent her people, serving as an interim representative for the Forsaken in the newly formed Horde council that would lead the Horde in place of the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, though she notes she will only do so until a more viable leader steps forth to take the reins of their people's fate.\nShadowlands.\nSometime after the death of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken took to mustering in the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as they sought to reclaim as much as they could of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken had successfully taken &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and were in the process of rebuilding it, when &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt;, influential figures that had risen to prominence among the Forsaken, plotted their next moves to secure the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting Voss wanted to directly focus on dealing with the plague in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, Belmont questioned what they should do about Calia, only for Velonara to declare that they should focus on the blight. She then turned to Master Apothecary Faranell and questioned if he had more plague eaters, only for him to reveal to Calia and the others that he only had one left, and that while he could make more for them to be effective, they must be formulated to survive the plague. This in turn inspired Calia to point out that they might be able to turn to the plague-lords of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; for insight. When Faranell revealed that he required an undiluted sample of the plague from deep within its reaches, Calia vowed to acquire it for him, but both Faranell and Belmont were skeptical of her being able to acquire it and survive. Calia then called upon the light and with the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; by her side, she ventured into the plague and successfully acquired the plague sample, which greatly surprised Belmont. With the sample in their possession, Calia, Voss, the champion, and the plague eater went to Maldraxxus.\nIn time they returned with the empowered plague eater, where Calia informed Faranell of how the blight sample became a living manifestation, to which Faranell was quick to declare it ingenious, as it would be easier to kill. This plan was ultimately successful as the plague manifested as an &lt;a href=\"Amalgam\"&gt;Amalgam&lt;/a&gt; and was slain, liberating the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from the plague. Following this, Voss declared that the Forsaken have many points of view and should be led by a council, not a single ruler, a motion accepted by the other Forsaken leaders. Thus a new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; consisting of Lilian Voss, Calia Menethil, Deathstalker Commander Belmont, Dark Ranger Velonara, and Master Apothecary Faranell was created to lead the Forsaken.\nCulture and people.\nThe Forsaken capital of &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; is always awake, just like the Forsaken themselves. The city is a place of dark, somber colors, stone walkways, and steps. The Undercity has inns, forges, and businesses that cater not only to the undead, but visitors from the Horde, with whom the Forsaken have allied themselves. There are some illuminations in the form of dim lamps and muted torches. These sources of light are not merely there to serve the living; though the undead have no true need of light, it perhaps gives Undercity's chief inhabitants a facade of some other existence.\nThe Forsaken navy is composed of ships dredged up from the bottom of the ocean. Most of them were once among &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s fleets.\nThe living may refer to the Forsaken by various pejorative terms, including \"deaders\", \"rotters\", and \"bonebags\".\nBecoming Forsaken is an unpredictable process. The body and mind are certain to change, but it is impossible to know to what extent and how well someone will cope with the process. According to &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, everyone go a little mad when they become Forsaken, and some more than others.\nAlignment.\nWhile most Forsaken are loyal to the Undercity and their Banshee Queen, there are different cases. &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Barthalomew\"&gt;Leonid Barthalomew&lt;/a&gt; looks at his undeath as a malady and an illness that merely requires treatment, hence his loyalties to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; simply continued to serve the Light, becoming a true neutral member of the priestly &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; instead of repledging loyalty to the Alliance or joining the Horde.\nFree will.\nUpon first being raised, a process called \"the Gift\", a Forsaken does not have free will. It takes more concentrated magic to release an undead's mind. Newly-raised Forsaken are soothed, celebrated, and gently guided into their new lives. They are asked their names and how they died in group sessions, since this helps them settle in better, accept their fate, and cope with any resurfacing traumatic memories. Free will is one of the cornerstones of Forsaken culture, with the great capacity for both good and evil that it entails. However, some undead, especially those who die in combat or under extreme stress and are raised soon after, enter into a violent, frenzied state. Undead in this state are easily manipulated and their rage is often directed at the foes of those who raised them. After the effects wear off, if the risen corpse has not been destroyed, they are given the same ultimatum that other Forsaken are offered: join the Dark Lady or return to the grave. Psychological pressure can also be used to turn freshly-raised undead to the side of the Forsaken instead of the one of their former allies. Once sufficient duty has been given, all it takes to be released from Sylvanas' command is a respectful asking. Though she demands loyalty, she would not hold her agents in thrall.\nEach Forsaken member follows their queen for various reasons: fear, loyalty, no where else to go.\nThe Forsaken were strongly discouraged from revisiting places they had loved in life. Their home was no longer Lordaeron but the Undercity. Sometimes books from outside were confiscated, and it was stated that there was no need to remember their human history as only the history of the Undercity mattered. After Sylvanas became Warchief, the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; was established to fill the power vacuum left with Sylvanas dealing with the Horde on Kalimdor. Except that, the Council was a response to these strict rules; for their needs were not being met. They also felt that Sylvanas needed to stop forcing them to live again if they did not wish to. When it comes to fashion, Forsaken are prescribed to stick to black, gray, and dark purple colors.\nTrue death.\nTrue death is the harshest punishment exercised in Forsaken law \u2014 in essence, an execution. &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt; and his followers were sentenced to true death for turning some Forsaken into mindless zombies, threatening their way of life. True death appears to be reserved for criminals who have committed high treason against the Forsaken's leadership, like &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, proved themselves a threat to the Forsaken's way of life, or taken up arms in rebellion against the Forsaken, like the &lt;a href=\"Rotbrain%20undead\"&gt;Rotbrain undead&lt;/a&gt; or the ones who ran with Calia away to the Alliance side during the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;, \"Bash'a no falor talah!\" means \"Taste the chill of true death!\" which is a threat generally directed at undead. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; said this when defending &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nLast Death.\nThe experience when a Forsaken accepts his or her death willingly is called the Last Death.\nFaith.\nSome still adhere to their old faiths, such as the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; was created through the (re)discovery of the teachings of bishop &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt; by Forsaken priests in Lordaeron after the capture and refurbishing of the Undercity. Shadow priests generally do not practice openly, and not all members are Forsaken, although they formed the cult.\nPriests of the Forgotten Shadow believe that the faiths they held in life have failed them. They instead turn to &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;dark energies&lt;/a&gt; to accomplish their goals. They teach that there must be a balance between Light and darkness, and members of the cult must know the Light as well.\nSome Forsaken priests continue to wield the Holy Light. While it is possible for them to use or be healed by the Light to its full effect like any living humanoid, it is accompanied by intense pain, making it require notable willpower to suffer through. Though painful, this does not cause any actual harm or damage on their undead bodies, even over long periods of time. In fact, some Forsaken with persistent contact with the Light over many years have even started to experience a return of their senses, which is not a pleasant experience given their rotted state.\n&lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Marjhan\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Marjhan&lt;/a&gt; also retained her paladin abilities after becoming a &lt;a href=\"risen\"&gt;risen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Forsaken believe that without a purpose, even &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20horse\"&gt;beasts of burden&lt;/a&gt; suffer in undeath.\nCuisine.\nWhile Forsaken are capable of feeding, they have no need of food or drink and only eat if they want to. The undead experience very little taste when eating, since their tongues have rotted beyond tasting. To some, everything they eat tastes like ashes. However, in the absence of taste, their tongues have instead become accustomed to the textures and sensations of food.\nThe Forsaken experience a hunger for the flesh of other humanoids and can replenish their own health by &lt;a href=\"Cannibalize\"&gt;cannibalizing&lt;/a&gt; dead bodies. Some have been known to comment that other humanoids look \"delicious\" or to try to eat wounded allies.\nThe regular Forsaken diet includes slimy mushrooms, &lt;a href=\"cockroach\"&gt;cockroach&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"snail\"&gt;snail&lt;/a&gt;s (when they put their mind to cooking an exotic meal), and living slime molds from the ooze canals of the Undercity. Unsurprisingly, non-Forsaken tend to complain that Forsaken fare is bland and moldering and get sick when they eat it.\nBecause of the shifted focus to texture and sensation rather than taste, Forsaken find tea delightful, and there are some among them who read tea leaves in order to divine the future. Forsaken can become drunk. They do not experience the same pleasure from alcohol as the living do, but many continue to drink out of habit. Some Forsaken pubs serve empty mugs that the patrons only pretend to drink from as a way of maintaining this habit. One Forsaken-made drink is the &lt;a href=\"%3AUndercity%20%22Skull%20Shocker%22\"&gt;:Undercity \"Skull Shocker\"&lt;/a&gt;, which has a kick so strong that even the dead can feel it.\nRelations.\nUndercity is the home of the Forsaken. They also have control of Tirisfal Glades and Silverpine Forest and have several towns in the regions. \nThough the Forsaken do not trust anyone and no one trusts them, they are members of the Horde and, for now, do their best to help their allies and placate their ambassadors. Forsaken have even less love for the Alliance, particularly because they clash constantly with the human organization called the Scarlet Crusade.\nThe only other Horde faction they even have a semblance of trust with is Silvermoon City and the blood elves. This is probably because Sylvanas was a high elf ranger in life and finds trust in her former companions. The Forsaken and blood elves even took control of the village of Tranquillien in the Ghostlands to fight the Scourge in the area together.\nRecently, the Forsaken gained a new enemy in form of the Gilneas people. While Sylvanas is now shown to cooperate with the High King of the Alliance, old hatred with the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; will escalate in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelations with the Horde.\nConvinced that the primitive races of the Horde can help them achieve victory over their enemies, the Forsaken entered an alliance of convenience with the savage &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the proud &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, they didn't hesitate to quietly kill prisoners of war, or experiment on and kill their own new allies if it suited their needs. \nTheir position in the faction later solidified, given that they were able to sponsor the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' entrance into the Horde. This was strained by the events at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, in the following quests it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;'s actions were &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;not very well received&lt;/a&gt; among most of the city's denizens. This seems to suggest that the Forsaken consider themselves part of the Horde now, or are at least upset by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Overseer%20%28Undercity%29\"&gt;limitations&lt;/a&gt; his failure has placed on them. The Forsaken appear to be more or less loyal to the Horde, but still have their own machinations. Some in the Horde are uncertain of their true intentions.\nBecause of bad reputation after the events of Wrathgate, the warlock &lt;a href=\"Felgrim\"&gt;Felgrim&lt;/a&gt; was once attacked by two orcs.\nRelations between the Forsaken and the Horde are shown to remain strong in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; as shown when Thrall told Voss that \"The Horde is not the Horde without the Forsaken.\nThe Grimtotems.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Direhorn%20Post\"&gt;Direhorn Post&lt;/a&gt; there is &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Cylla\"&gt;Apothecary Cylla&lt;/a&gt; with her direct &lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Letter%20%28Dustwallow%20Marsh%29\"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and proof of an alliance between the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; and the Forsaken.\nIt's unknown whether the pact continues after the betrayal of Varimathras and Putress and after Magatha's exile.\nLanguages.\nForsaken speak &lt;a href=\"Gutterspeak\"&gt;Gutterspeak&lt;/a&gt;, also simply known as \"Forsaken\". Forsaken also learned &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome Forsaken forgot how to speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; after being raised back from their graves.\nNames.\nThe majority of Forsaken have taken new given names or surnames for themselves. They do so to mark their rebirth; to cast aside their old identities and to take pride in their new lives and the roles they play in their unified society. In other cases, newly-raised Forsaken give themselves new names due to not being able to remember what they were called in life. Known instances are &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, born Marris, and &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Vellcinda Benton&lt;/a&gt;, born Elsie.\nA cure for undeath?\nMany of the other races (mainly the tauren) pity the Forsaken and a number of Horde healers all over Azeroth, such as &lt;a href=\"Bena%20Winterhoof\"&gt;Bena Winterhoof&lt;/a&gt;, work tirelessly in the hopes of creating a cure for undeath. Some of the Forsaken feel that their undeath is an illness or curse and long for a cure, but many think it is impossible to attain one.\nThere are tauren that wish to help the Forsaken like the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt seems that &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; wanted to help the Forsaken. According to her, the tauren ways may restore the undead back into humans.\nMilitary.\nSince their independence from the Scourge, the Forsaken have created different military organizations:\nThey also include different types of undead and units within their ranks:\nAbominations.\n&lt;a href=\"Abomination\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;s mostly serve the role of soldiers and guards, though there are exceptions to this. Some abominations have risen as high as the rank of sergeant.\nApothecaries.\n&lt;a href=\"Apothecary\"&gt;Apothecaries&lt;/a&gt;, serving under the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; and based in the &lt;a href=\"Apothecarium\"&gt;Apothecarium&lt;/a&gt; of the Undercity, are a crucial part of the Forsaken society. They are the innovative force behind the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt;. They can be found across the whole of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, trying to find ways to improve the blight. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blightspreader%20%28Shadowfang%20Keep%29\"&gt;Forsaken Blightspreader&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"mad%20scientist\"&gt;mad scientist&lt;/a&gt;s who as their name implies, spread the Forsaken blight.\nBanshees.\nMany &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s can be found within the ranks of the Forsaken, as most of them were followers of Sylvanas Windrunner in life, so they are in undeath.\nDark rangers.\nSylvanas Windrunner, being one herself, employs many &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s under her service. Initially, almost all of these elite agents are &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; women raised into undeath, just like the Banshee Queen herself. There existed at least one exception, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos however, has recently been training a new generation of Forsaken rangers comprising of undead &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, making the undead racial composition more diverse. Following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken raised numerous slain &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Dark%20Ranger\"&gt;Kaldorei Dark Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDark Wardens.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, several night elven &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s were slain and raised to undeath. Embittered that &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves had allowed such a fate to befall upon them, Dark Wardens such as &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; now serve the Forsaken to get vengeance.\nDeath knights.\nThe Forsaken have also brought &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s into their ranks. The death knight &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; is referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;her majesty's&lt;/a&gt; top death knight\".\nDeathguards and dreadguards.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathguard\"&gt;Deathguard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dreadguard\"&gt;dreadguard&lt;/a&gt;s make up the bulk of the Forsaken military force, mostly serving as soldiers on the front lines or as guards in Forsaken settlements.\nDeathstalkers.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt; are an organization of Forsaken &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, serving as secretive agents of the Banshee Queen's will.\nExecutors.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Executor\"&gt;Executor&lt;/a&gt;s are officers within the Forsaken army. They seem to perform different tasks of military and civil nature, like commanders, lieutenants, captains or even region governors and city magistrates. Apparently, as military top officers, they also have medium-control over members of the &lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt; that are working in their area of influence. They are the most skilled warriors and fighters within the Forsaken ranks, acting as strategists and leading the Dark Lady's military actions to victory.\nForsaken trooper.\n&lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20trooper\"&gt;Forsaken trooper&lt;/a&gt;s consists of the freshly raised undead created by the necromantic powers of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Trooper\"&gt;Forsaken Trooper&lt;/a&gt; serve as basic infantry, and have been raised from the fallen humans on the battlefield. Most recently, this new army \"recruited\" from the peoples of Silverpine and Hillsbrad. Forsaken Troops replenish the whittling armies of the Forsaken, whose numbers cannot be compensated without an act of reproduction.\nShadowstalkers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shadowstalkers\"&gt;Shadowstalkers&lt;/a&gt; are spies \u2014 whose job description includes assassinations \u2014 and are in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; by orders of &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;.\nNecromancers.\nThere are two well-known &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s who joined the Forsaken \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Gunther%20Arcanus\"&gt;Gunther Arcanus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt;, the former apprentice to &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nVal'kyr.\nIn \"Cataclysm\", after the death of the Lich King, several &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; became \"unemployed\" and made a pact with Sylvanas to raise more Forsaken and bolster their numbers. At the time of the Silverpine quests, the Val'kyr could only raise humans into undeath. However, Sylvanas later indicated that she can raise other races during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; said she could always grow in power down the line.\nOther members.\nThe Forsaken include numerous other races and types of undead. Notably, at least three &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s are seen existing within the Forsaken empire. The level of trust such beings receive is dubious, though &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Crispin\"&gt;one is referred to&lt;/a&gt; as having \"bent the knee\" to the Dark Lady, thus making him \"one of us.\" There is also at least one &lt;a href=\"wraith\"&gt;wraith&lt;/a&gt; within the ranks of the Forsaken, two &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, and at least one &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.\nMounts and pets.\nForsaken mainly use &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt;s as ground mounts and &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s as flying mounts. As a means of transportation, they also use carriages pulled by subjugated &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThey keep pets such as the undead &lt;a href=\"blighthound\"&gt;blighthound&lt;/a&gt;s and the magical &lt;a href=\"darkhound\"&gt;darkhound&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Jeremiah%20Payson\"&gt;Jeremiah Payson&lt;/a&gt; sells pet &lt;a href=\"cockroach\"&gt;cockroach&lt;/a&gt;es to his fellow Forsaken.\nWhen fallen heroes are raised into undeath, so too are their horses.\nThrough the years, the Forsaken have grown a kinship with the &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; and have managed to domesticate and breed them. Spiders now serve them as regular household pets and beasts of battle. The Forsaken loathe &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s, but through ingenuity they have devised a way to make use of them. They use the living bears at their spider farm as living egg feeders. Their spiders lay their eggs in the bear flesh and the eggs thrive off of the meat and blood of the beasts.\nBiology.\nNote that the information included here is regarding the common Forsaken &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. It may differ from individual to individual, as a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; cannot be expected to have the exact same biological properties as a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.\nForsaken are commonly 5\u20136 feet tall, scrawny, and gaunt. Their skin is deteriorating, and their hair is unkempt. Both males and females have a variety of decomposing figures. Forsaken come in all stages of death, from freshly slain or partially rotting to almost mummified. Some are in a good enough condition to almost pass for living humans.\nForsaken, similar to certain other undead, have &lt;a href=\"%3AIchor%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;:Ichor of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; running through their bodies, which can cause throat tickles. They bleed this green liquid when wounded, though some Forsaken have no blood or liquid running through their bodies at all.\nGiven enough time, Forsaken may slowly lose their consciousness and devolve into a &lt;a href=\"mindless%20state\"&gt;mindless state&lt;/a&gt;. This appears in the form of a chilling sensation, making the Forsaken feel physically cold. However, if a Forsaken's body is kept intact, they could potentially avoid this altogether and live forever.\nForsaken cannot naturally sleep or dream. Forsaken do not require physical rest in the traditional sense, however, from the existence of beds and coffins in Forsaken buildings, and Forsaken innkeepers saying \"Rest your weary bones...\" it can be deduced that Forsaken most likely benefit from resting, as it possibly helps to preserve their bodies longer.\nForsaken do feel the need to breathe, though they can last at least a dozen days without taking a fresh breath of air. As they are undead, they don't need air to live, and some Forsaken can no longer breathe at all. This also means it is impossible for them to drown. Most Forsaken speak normally by forcing air through their dead lungs, but some have to speak through magical means due to having harmed jaws.\nAside from magical potions, Forsaken can \"heal\" themselves in numerous ways. To name a few, they can replace their body parts by harvesting and sewing on the body parts of others, eat other humanoids and undead, and drain the life force of others. Some Forsaken prefer \"traditional\" medicine like leeches and bonesaws. When the Holy Light is used with the intention to heal a Forsaken, it is immensely painful, yet effective. The Forsaken restoration process requires the stitching or grafting of new sinew, muscle and skin to repair their bodies; and since the Forsaken body does not naturally heal itself, it is the predominant method of keeping Forsaken bodies functional. It should also be noted that a Forsaken's body, or the parts of the body they've grafted onto it, may only be preserved in the same condition as it was found when deceased. Since Forsaken bodies can't grow new muscles, a body part of a new Forsaken will never naturally grow stronger and thus will only improve if one replaces the unsatisfactory body part with another one containing more muscles. The downside to Forsaken undeath is their bodies are henceforth fragile to injury or rot and may require constant body part transplants to maintain. As such, Forsaken generally do not applaud or stamp their feet, as it prematurely wears out their limbs; clapping, in particular, is terrible for their hands.\nDecapitation or even dismemberment is not enough to kill a Forsaken, and many times enemies have to burn the remains of a destroyed Forsaken body. Otherwise, it can reattach its limbs and joints by temporarily melting their skin, knitting muscle and clicking bones back together. It should be noted, however, that this ability is considered rare among the undead, and many cannot simply re-attach limbs on their own.\nNature of undeath.\nThe CM Nyorloth supplied information on the nature of undeath on February 9th, 2012 on the European Story Forums, stating:\nForsaken who have been raised into undeath or \"awoken\" as the Forsaken call it, may be terrified, confused, or disoriented by the experience. Part of this stems from being traumatized by witnessing their own skin and body decaying for the first time. Other times, it may be because they were raised with some sort of terrible malady like having only half a brain. Some don't survive the shock, turning into &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s. Others retain just enough humanity to seem normal on the outside, but are \"sick\" inside. Even after being freed from the Lich King's control, it takes time for an undead to recover their memories and learn to determine their own destinations again; for some time, it remains easier for them to follow directions from others than to act independently.\nGenerally, most enslaved undead are tormented and restless by their subjugation. Some welcome it if it grants them the benefits of eternal life. Many undead who are sentient enough to understand their circumstances appear emotionally dispassionate if not melancholy. The most known emotions that the undead seem to emote are remorse, pity, or rage. Records of undead emoting positive emotions are rare, though there are reports, however, that some Forsaken have slowly experienced a sharpening of their dulled senses of touch, smell, etc., as well as an increase in the flashes of positive emotions that have otherwise become so rare since their fall into undeath, when influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. The drawback however, is that they also become disgusted with themselves and are likely to increase attempts at their own self-destruction; for regaining these senses would force the undead to smell their own rotting flesh, taste the decay in their mouths and throats, and even feel the maggots burrowing within their bodies. Some take comfort from the happy memories they experienced when they were alive or the bonds they've developed, as demonstrated by the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of those that freed themselves from the Lich King's grasp are tormented by memories of the unspeakable horrors that they had committed as mindless Scourge agents and are driven into madness or consumed by regret, whereas others embrace their new condition and may go on to indulge in their vile vices. Others don't even remember their time as a mindless slave of the Scourge and so bear no emotional trauma from it at all.\nIn the RPG.\nThe forsaken are humans transformed into the undead, with all the powers associated with the Scourge. They serve the Banshee Queen, Sylvanas, looking to her as their savior for delivering them from the Lich King\u2019s mental dominance. The forsaken dwell within the bowels of the ruins of Lordaeron\u2019s capital city, which they have taken to calling the Undercity. Dedicated to seek vengeance upon the Scourge for damning them to their condition, they strive to undermine the Scourge\u2019s control of Lordaeron.\nThe forsaken are limited in their ability to reinforce their numbers, having no necromancers among their kind. Instead, these fearless undead warriors are comprised mostly of fighters and warlocks dedicated to building a culture of their own amidst a world that hates and fears them.\nBalance.\nForsaken culture reflects its people; just as the Forsaken stand on the line between life and death, their culture balances between the beliefs each Forsaken held in life and each one's quest for a place in the present. Former healers find this transition more difficult than most Forsaken find it. Priests of the Holy Light in particular struggle to reconcile the philosophy that guided their life with their unfortunate new condition. Some balance their own beliefs with their new forms, but most follow one of two paths.\" (It goes on to give very brief descriptions of the Forgotten Shadow and the Echo of Life.)\nPerhaps the greatest element of Forsaken culture, and their culture's only universal element, is their reverence of death. Every Forsaken respects the dead, and damns those who do not. General society coddles new Forsaken like children, while venerating those who are losing themselves to the Scourge, giving them the greatest comforts before they are put out of their misery. Forsaken treat each other with a measure of respect, as it takes a strong soul to rise, and a stronger soul to not fall to mindless undeath (more on this later). Arthas earns their greatest ire, as the Lich King shows no respect for the living or dead. While Forsaken create undead, they do so with respect to the souls and bodies they use. Life and death is a balance. The Lich King, however, enslaves the dead, stripping their free will. His path is an abomination to the Forsaken.\nAlignment.\nAlthough most of the race is evil, the Forsaken cannot be thought of in purely dualistic terms entirely. Although undead, the Forsaken are still inherently human, the majority of whom were victims of the plague spread by Kel'Thuzad. Thus some of the Forsaken are still good beings, if no longer living. As the above suggests, some individuals among them are capable of a tragic form of nobility, in that they do not allow their inability to obtain redemption to prevent them from trying.\nThose that try often leave the Forsaken, seeing its flaws, and join other causes. These Forsaken rebel against their race, seeking a better way to end the Lich King's reign or search for a way to reclaim their lost humanity, while others work to reform it from within, such as &lt;a href=\"Roberick%20Dartfall\"&gt;Roberick Dartfall&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Barthalomew%20the%20Revered\"&gt;Leonid Barthalomew the Revered&lt;/a&gt; of the Argent Dawn is probably the greatest example of this. (&lt;a href=\"Trevor\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; in fact aspires to leave and join Leonid.) Others that have left include &lt;a href=\"Kegan%20Darkmar\"&gt;Kegan Darkmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is arguable that such nobility is the only truly genuine form that exists, in that it comes not from duty, religion, or custom, but from a decision born purely of free will.\nFaith.\nSome still adhere to their old faiths, such as the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven as they believe they have been abandoned by their faith, so have the Forsaken abandoned the faiths of their living days. Many no longer cling to any religion, placing their faith in their queen and their dark science. Most, however, have embraced new philosophies of their own creation: the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Life\"&gt;Echo of Life&lt;/a&gt;, or the simple value of knowledge. Some have even turned to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as a source of power, believing that only it is potent enough to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; is largely based out of &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt; and the warrior quarter in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Priests of the Forgotten Shadow believe that the faiths they held in life have failed them, and so they instead rely on the power and teachings of the Shadow. The members of the Cult vary between lawful and chaotic, evil and neutral, and are taught to eradicate anything having to do with the Holy Light \u2014 and life in general. It is also a philosophy of &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow%23Divine%20Humanism\"&gt;divine humanism&lt;/a&gt;.\nPriests of the Forgotten Shadow teach that there must be a balance between Light and Shadow, and while they should never forget that they are from the Shadow, members of the cult must learn the Light as well. Being intelligent undead, the Forsaken fully understand the limitations and vulnerabilities associated with unlife. One of these disadvantages is that they can be turned, rebuked or even commanded by powerful positive or negative energy forces. Naturally, the Forsaken are always on the lookout for ways to limit or negate this vulnerability.\nThe figure wore the robes of a priest of the Holy Light - not uncommon among the Forsaken, who mocked the order by wearing their garments and allowing the sacred robes to be soiled and tainted by their bloody work. Somehow, &lt;a href=\"Andarin\"&gt;Andarin&lt;/a&gt; sensed, this figure was different; the robes seemed to be in almost tolerable condition, even if the body wearing them was not. \"You wear the robes of a priest, Trevor. Why do you not channel the Light in battle, if you seek redemption?\" The priest seemed to wince at that. \"While I refuse to wield the shadow, the Light has refused me, or so it seems. And so, I am truly a broken man; I learned to wield spears of Light like Uther's knights did in the Second. Without the Light, I am unarmed and unarmored -- but not entirely helpless, as you see.\" Andarin couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the fallen priest, if his story was true. Perhaps a man, no matter how virtuous, could not channel holy power while in such a form.\"\nBiology.\nForsaken, unsurprisingly, look like dead people. Their skin is gray and rotting, showing bone and flesh in places. Their pupil-less eyes glow with dim, white ghostlight. Their muscles are withered, making them scrawny. Their movements are slow but jagged. Forsaken hardly ever smile (unless their lips have rotted away - in which case they can appear to be smiling all the time). Necromantic magic keeps them somewhat preserved, but natural decay still proceeds, just slower than normal.\nNecromancers in the Forsaken ranks.\nThe Dark Lady, Sylvanas Windrunner, realized how valuable &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; was to their cause. Though Forsaken heal naturally, many go to the priests of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; for \"repairs\". Necromancers can also free enslaved, mindless undead and research powerful spells that might one day return the Forsaken to life. Sylvanas knew she needed necromancers to heal, strengthen and replace her people, and she set about wooing necromancers away from the Scourge, mainly by force.\nThe Forsaken are desperate for the powers of a necromancer. As such they tried to stop &lt;a href=\"Linnena%20Hallow\"&gt;Linnena Hallow&lt;/a&gt; and to convert her students to their side.\nA cure for undeath?\nForsaken with an undead soul can be brought back with raise dead and &lt;a href=\"reincarnate\"&gt;reincarnate&lt;/a&gt;. The spells work normally on them. Resurrection, true resurrection and similar effects restore them to their undead life rather than to the being they were before they became undead. A Forsaken's body of this type is undead\u2026 and so is its soul, corrupted and changed to such a degree that it belongs to its new body now, rather than its old one. Forsaken priests have the power to restore those foolishly slain in battle, though only to unlife. Nothing short of a &lt;a href=\"miracle\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt; can return true life.\nNames.\nLike their Dark Lady, Forsaken tend to keep the names they had when they were alive. If a Forsaken cannot remember their name or simply wish to change their name; they may make up a suitable name or read one from a headstone. Some invent surnames that imply their desire to eradicate the Scourge or about their undead nature."}

The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Trooper\"&gt;Forsaken Trooper&lt;/a&gt; serve as basic infantry and have been raised from the fallen humans on the battlefield. Most recently, this new army \"recruited\" from the peoples of Silverpine and Hillsbrad. Forsaken Troops replenish the whittling armies of the Forsaken, whose numbers cannot be compensated without an act of reproduction.\nUndead, especially those who die in combat or under extreme stress and are raised soon after, enter into a violent, frenzied state. Undead in this state are easily manipulated and their rage is often directed at the foes of those who raised them. After the effects wear off, if the risen corpse has not been destroyed, they are given the same ultimatum that other &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; are offered: join the Dark Lady or return to the grave. Presumably, this is what occurs during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken slew &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Laborer\"&gt;Alliance Laborer&lt;/a&gt;s and Frightened Provincial Minutemen, raising them as Forsaken troopers and were able to use their \"charmed\" state to not only fight for those who killed them in life but also against their former allies.\nWars for Lordaeron.\nInvasion of Gilneas.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken were ordered to move south into &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; because the Horde wanted a port in northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; initially spearheaded the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; using the Forsaken as meatshields for orcs and taking the brunt of Gilneas' defenses. Lady &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; returned to take command of the invasion of Gilneas to preserve her people.\nIn a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; (whom Sylvanas does not appear to think particularly highly of), Sylvanas reveals the newest allies of the Forsaken - the &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, the ascended vrykul women who once served the Lich King. Sylvanas demonstrated their value by using them to raise dead human corpses of the people of Silverpine as Forsaken troopers. Sylvanas pointed out that this was her solution to the undead not being able to procreate and compensate for their casualties in war. Garrosh was not pleased because the Val'kyr reminded him of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, he could not deny their effectiveness. After an insulting exchange with the highly revolted Garrosh, &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; is dispensed to \"guard\" the Dark Lady and keep tabs on the Forsaken.\nNew Troopers were first involved in the fights at &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20High%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken High Command&lt;/a&gt;, where they fight the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;rebel worgen&lt;/a&gt;. Those with Horde adventurers defeated and secured a part of Silverpine Forest. The next task was to get more troopers. The Val'kyr were deployed to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; where the Horde slew &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Refugee\"&gt;Hillsbrad Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s and raised them as more troopers for the Forsaken. In response to the Forsaken's assault, the Hillsbrad refugees in &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; made a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; and turned themselves into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, preventing the Val'kyr from raising them into undead.\n&lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Forsaken%20Trooper\"&gt;Veteran Forsaken Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s are later deployed at the battle near &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, many of their number fell after an ambush with the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang worgen&lt;/a&gt; while crossing &lt;a href=\"Olsen%27s%20Farthing\"&gt;Olsen's Farthing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sends adventurers to fetch their insignias in order to &lt;a href=\"Honor%20the%20Dead%20%28Silverpine%20Forest%29\"&gt;honor their sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere was also a group of level 80 Veteran Forsaken Troopers under the command of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Forteski\"&gt;Master Forteski&lt;/a&gt; that was sent by Sylvanas to corner and crush the worgen leaders of the Gilneas Liberation Front-- &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt;-- in the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elem%20Mine\"&gt;Deep Elem Mine&lt;/a&gt;. However, they discovered that it was a trap and all but the Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; survived the ambush.\nForsaken Troopers can be found fighting mainly in Silverpine. In Gilneas, elite &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Vanguard\"&gt;Forsaken Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;s are being led by &lt;a href=\"Forward%20Commander%20Onslaught\"&gt;Commander Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; but after they lose to rebel worgen, they withdrew to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Front\"&gt;Forsaken Front&lt;/a&gt;, which had gathered Troopers, &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Sea%20Dog\"&gt;sea dogs&lt;/a&gt;, Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Ambermill%20Mage\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Catapult\"&gt;catapults&lt;/a&gt; and more in a final battle at Silverpine.\nUltimately, they were able to coerce a retreat from the Gilneas Liberation Front by threatening to turn a captured &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; into an undead subservient to Sylvanas. The peace of victory did not last long as the Forsaken were betrayed by their own agents, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Baron Ashbury&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Walden\"&gt;Lord Walden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; would later lead Horde adventurers and Forsaken troopers to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; to slay the traitors.\nBattle for Andorhal.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; began efforts to claim the war-torn city for their respective faction, though they still had to wrestle it from the control of the occupying &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of the Forsaken forces was &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt;, and he preferred to focus on the Scourge first before fighting with the Alliance. His non-aggressive tactics against the Alliance and friendship with the Alliance general &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in honorable combat and a temporary ceasefire between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The Scourge was wiped out from Andorhal by the combined efforts of the Alliance and the Horde, but there were some in the Forsaken who disapproved of Koltira's leadership. Sylvanas, under the guise of &lt;a href=\"Lindsay%20Ravensun\"&gt;Lindsay Ravensun&lt;/a&gt;, took advantage of the situation, and called her Val'kyr into battle.\nFrustrated with how Koltira was conducting the battle, Sylvanas had the Val'kyr deploy under the leadership of a Horde adventurer and together, they created new Forsaken Troopers from slain Alliance laborers. The Horde adventurer personally led the training of these new troopers to supplement the Forsaken forces. Together with the &lt;a href=\"Andorhal%20Deathguard\"&gt;Andorhal Deathguard&lt;/a&gt;s, they easily overpowered the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; by slaying and reanimating the Alliance militia to reinforce their numbers in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Andorhal claimed for the Forsaken, Koltira Deathweaver was imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, where he was punished for his compassionate conduct during the Battle for Andorhal.\nLeaders.\nThe following have been observed to lead contingents of Forsaken troopers:"}

{"id": "693730", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=693730", "title": "Forsworn rebellion", "text": "The Forsworn rebellion was a civil war among the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, fought between the &lt;a href=\"Ascended%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ascended&lt;/a&gt; loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, and the dark kyrian &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; who are disillusioned with the current order. Originally led by the former Paragon of Loyalty &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsworn resent the need for kyrian to let go of their former lives on their path to &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;ascension&lt;/a&gt;, believing instead that they should embrace their old emotions and burdens. The Forsworn are also in league with the forces of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, although not all members of the rebellion are aware of this fact.\nAfter their initial surprise attack on the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Temple of Purity&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsworn gained control of many parts of Bastion while waging war against the Ascended of &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, they would even strike at the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Spires of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; and the Archon directly, though the attack was defeated and Devos slain. Despite its failure to take control of Bastion, the rebellion has caused even the Archon to rethink the traditions which sparked the unrest.\nHistory.\nAfterlives.\nThe Paragon of Loyalty, &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt;, would go on to create the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; after her experience with the soul of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; upon his arrival in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Devos took Uther under her supervision and sought to personally oversee his path to &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;ascension&lt;/a&gt; that all &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; souls must undergo, but was shocked to discover that his soul itself had been &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;wounded&lt;/a&gt; by the power of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, which should have been impossible. When Devos gave her warning to the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; and the other Paragons, however, her worries were dismissed out of hand as contradicting the path. Shocked and angered by this reaction, the Paragon came to the conclusion that the path itself must be flawed to allow such an obvious warning to be ignored.\nReturning to Uther, Devos carried out his ascension immediately. When the time was right, she ventured with Uther to retrieve the soul of the one who killed him, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and cast it into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; as vengeance. With this act, Devos committed herself to opposing the ancient ways of the kyrian, and set about creating the Forsworn to overthrow the old order of Bastion.\nRise of the Forsworn.\nIn secret, Devos was able to recruit many other kyrian to her cause, including Uther and &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt;, convincing them that they needed to seize control of Bastion from the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; and her followers. At some point, the former Paragon of Loyalty also made contact with the Jailer and learned of his imprisonment in the Maw, which she felt to be an injustice and further proof of the Archon's betrayal. Devos would align her new faction with the Jailer's interests, even providing him ascended kyrian to serve as &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;. As the Forsworn prepared to make their move, their fellow kyrian remained totally unaware of the threat.\nAn &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought planned by the Jailer would eventually sweep through Bastion and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, while souls destined for these realms were diverted to the Maw. This shortage of anima and aspirants caused unrest among the kyrian; many aspirants began having more serious doubts which they could not overcome. At the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Temple of Purity&lt;/a&gt;, aspirants at risk of falling to these burdens were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Temple of Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; to be bolstered, not knowing that it had since become the base of the Forsworn in Bastion. Far from reassuring doubting kyrian, Devos and her allies encouraged their attachment to their former lives and offered them a place in the Forsworn ranks, swelling their numbers.\nWhen the dark kyrian chose to strike, they did so at the Temple of Loyalty in southeastern Bastion, having first sabotaged the wards in &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; that guarded the temple against attack. Devos's Hand of Doubt, Lysonia, would lead the assault. Taking the temple's defenders completely by surprise, the Forsworn swept into the temple and killed or captured most of its denizens. Only &lt;a href=\"Eridia\"&gt;Eridia&lt;/a&gt; and a small force held out against the attack, though they soon began to strike back at the invaders. Eventually, Eridia confronted Lysonia at &lt;a href=\"Purity%27s%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Purity's Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; and battled her above the temple. Lysonia would have won if not for the intervention of the Paragon of Purity &lt;a href=\"Vesiphone\"&gt;Vesiphone&lt;/a&gt;, who arrived and forced her to retreat.\nNow alerted to the threat, the Ascended and their allies now began to investigate the Forsworn presence, before reporting to the Archon and Paragons (including Devos) at Elysian Hold. Meanwhile, the Forsworn also sabotaged the ward protecting the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt; in Bastion's west, leaving the site open to attack. The dark kyrian had coordinated with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, also allies of the Jailer, and the Maldraxxi now launched a devastating attack on the temple. Caught by surprise, the temple was quickly overrun and razed, although the Paragon of Courage &lt;a href=\"Xandria\"&gt;Xandria&lt;/a&gt; would lead a counterattack that dealt with the invasion force.\nDespite the high-profile actions of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Devos managed to avoid suspicion and remained the Paragon of Loyalty to her brethren.\nBattle for the Spires.\nAs the Forsworn continued to wage war on the Ascended throughout Bastion, the Archon decided that remaining &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; stores should be directing toward creating new &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt; kyrian to bolster their ranks. The chosen aspirants were first sent to complete their trials at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Elation\"&gt;Court of Elation&lt;/a&gt;, only to find the area occupied by the Forsworn. The aspirants would eventually push through the rebels to complete their trial, and returned to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; victorious for their ascension.\nAs the ceremony was underway, with the Archon and Paragons gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, Devos suddenly interrupted the proceedings by striking at the Crest and shattering it. The Paragon of Doubt then confronted a shocked Archon to reveal her betrayal and leadership of the Forsworn, before signaling for a gathered force to attack Elysian Hold and the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Spires of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. Forsworn swarmed the city in force, catching many of the Ascended by off guard, and a desperate defense was mounted. The attack on the Hold was the first to be pushed back, as the kyrians' &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortal allies&lt;/a&gt; pursued Devos into the Spires, as the Paragon fought the Archon for control of the city.\nIn the battle for the Spires of Ascension, many kyrian were slain on both sides but the defenders were able to overcome some of the most powerful Forsworn forces including &lt;a href=\"Kin-Tara\"&gt;Kin-Tara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ventunax\"&gt;Ventunax&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oryphrion\"&gt;Oryphrion&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Archon's Rise&lt;/a&gt;, these defenders also joined the Archon in a desperate battle against Devos herself as the fallen Paragon tried to obtain the Archon's Spear to seize control of the Spires. Devos was killed in the ensuing battle, ending the assault and dealing a major blow to the Forsworn. Afterwards, the Archon would express regret at the Paragon's demise, and admitted that parts of the old order may need to change once the threat of the Jailer was dealt with.\nRebuilding the Crest.\nAfter Devos's demise, her Hand of Doubt &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt; succeeded her as leader of the Forsworn, and continued the campaign against the kyrian loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe failed attack on the Spires of Ascension had left the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; destroyed and thus unable to create any new &lt;a href=\"ascended\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt; for Elysian Hold. To remedy this, work began on building a new Crest which could be empowered to create even stronger ascended than before. The Forgelite Prime &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt; would travel to the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Forge\"&gt;Eternal Forge&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; to get the tools and materials needed for the task, namely the hammer known as &lt;a href=\"Phaestus%2C%20Genesis%20of%20Aeons\"&gt;Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons&lt;/a&gt;. Under &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Atticus\"&gt;Overseer Atticus&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsworn had since occupied the facility and began using it to construct an army of dark &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt;s for their war against the Archon. In addition to recovering the hammer, Mikanikos also ensured that the Forsworn occupying the forge were decimated by &lt;a href=\"Bron%20%28goliath%29\"&gt;a new centurion prototype&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Crest physically rebuilt, the Ascended began to hunt down powerful artifacts from the other realms of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; to empower it.\nOther hostilities.\nThe Forsworn would make determined efforts to eliminate one of Bastion's strongest defenders in the form of the &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt; colossus &lt;a href=\"Heraclor\"&gt;Heraclor&lt;/a&gt;, with Paragon &lt;a href=\"Xandria\"&gt;Xandria&lt;/a&gt; sending allies to prevent this. The rebels would also attack a colossus as part of a battle for the &lt;a href=\"Vestibule%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Vestibule of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Andromede%2C%20Herald%20of%20the%20Forsworn\"&gt;Andromede&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortal allies&lt;/a&gt;, the kyrian were able to repair the colossus and use its weapons to blast a path to Andromede, before eliminating her. Other colossi, such as &lt;a href=\"Valinor\"&gt;Valinor&lt;/a&gt;, were successfully converted by the Forsworn and had to be defeated by the Archon's forces.\nThe battle against the Forsworn's &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; allies at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt; continued after the initial attack. The Ascended would eventually work with their own &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; allies in the form of &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; to end any further threat at the temple and take the fight to &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; in Maldraxxus."}

The fort stands on the eastern side of the &lt;a href=\"Battlescar\"&gt;Battlescar&lt;/a&gt;, and is in constant conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; outpost at &lt;a href=\"Desolation%20Hold\"&gt;Desolation Hold&lt;/a&gt; across the gorge.\nFort Triumph was vital to the Alliance's continued expansion into the Barrens during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and represented their most fortified presence in the region outside &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The fort was eventually looted and razed in the lead-up to the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Battle of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; by a massive Horde army, though recent efforts have been made to re-establish the position.\nHistory.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; began to push further into the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; against resistance from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. These efforts involved establishing Fort Triumph in the center of the region, as a means of linking &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; and the major stronghold at &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; by land. As such, the fort became vital for Alliance expansion in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround the same time as Fort Triumph's founding, the Horde established their own stronghold directly across the &lt;a href=\"Battlescar\"&gt;Battlescar&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Desolation%20Hold\"&gt;Desolation Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The site for Fort Triumph was chosen by the Alliance military's &lt;a href=\"High%20Command\"&gt;High Command&lt;/a&gt;, though it was discovered to be sitting on a sizeable &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; mound. After setting back the construction of fortifications, the silithid and their tunnels were eventually dealt with by the fort's defenders.\nAt the same time, the battle with the Horde at Desolation Hold became more intense, with both sides warring for control of the central pass. The garrison at Fort Triumph would meet at least some success against the Horde, though their &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s proved ineffective in the theater. Throughout this conflict, still uncompleted, the fort was kept supplied by shipments from &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and Theramore. Fort Triumph also acted as a garrison for &lt;a href=\"General%20Hawthorne\"&gt;General Hawthorne&lt;/a&gt;'s troops during the Alliance's operations further north. After Hawthorne's assassination by Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Twinbraid\"&gt;General Twinbraid&lt;/a&gt; intended to travel to the fort take over command. In the interim, it was &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Roberts\"&gt;Commander Roberts&lt;/a&gt; who oversaw operations.\nTides of War.\nIn the wake of the Cataclysm, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; began a new campaign against &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and its holdings. A vast army subsequently pushed through the Barrens, overcoming &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and soon marching on Fort Triumph. It is said that &lt;a href=\"Forward%20Command\"&gt;Forward Command&lt;/a&gt; was abandoned and its soldiers went to help Northwatch. Survivors from Northwatch would regroup in Fort Triumph. However, the fort stood no chance, and inevitably fell to the attackers. After this, the Horde looted the fort's siege weapons to be used for their upcoming &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is unknown how many fell in the defense of Fort Triumph, or whether there were many survivors from its destruction. &lt;a href=\"General%20Twinbraid\"&gt;General Twinbraid&lt;/a&gt;, having apparently been in command, did later appear on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; with the new rank of High Marshal. Though the ruins of Northwatch Hold were later reclaimed and rebuilt, Fort Triumph was left dormant for the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; brought fresh conflict between the Alliance and Horde to the Barrens. Seeking to re-establish Fort Triumph and regain their presence in the area, the Alliance sent forces against &lt;a href=\"Desolation%20Hold\"&gt;Desolation Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Our%20Fort%20Was%20a%20Triumph\"&gt;Our Fort Was a Triumph&lt;/a&gt; states that the Alliance force was sent to Desolation Hold, but the mission's location is stated to be Fort Triumph. It could be speculated that &lt;a href=\"Crawgol\"&gt;Warlord Crawgol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; actually held the conquered Fort and were encountered while en-route to Desolation Hold. Alternatively, the location information could be a mistake and was meant to be Desolation Hold instead."}

The result is currently a 48-bit number so meets that contraint.\n= Tests performed and result analysis =\nBelow is an array of tests that both algorithms have been submitted to. For a hash analysis, these tests are fairly basic and the result analysis is somewhat unscientific, but they will do to illustrate the difference between the Java hash and StringHash, which is all this document set out to do.\nPerformance test.\nThis test simply hashes the string \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\" in a loop 20 000 times and clocks the start and stop time. The loop is included in the resulting time.\nResult analysis.\nStringHash is slightly faster than the Java hash; likely not enough to matter, but certainly enough that the perceived \"increased size\" of StringHash can be discounted as an argument against it - it's actually faster!\nThe reason is of course that the math.mod() call is relatively expensive compared to extracting characters from a string and performing multiplications. StringHash does 3 extract + multiply per mod() call. The Java hash in its standard implementation has to do one mod() call per character.\nOn the testing computer, a P4 at ~3Ghz, StringHash hashes in the neighborhood of half a megabyte per second; certainly not bad for a scripted language using only standard math library operations!\nBit distribution test.\nThis test measures how many times each bit is 1 for a given set of inputs. The target value is for each bit to be 1 50% of the time, and 0 50% of the time, though there will obviously be deviations from this, which are expected and accepted, up to a certain point.\nIn this test, we feed each hash the same set of inputs: 10000 random strings consisting of \"aaaaaaaaa\" followed by 15 random bytes.\nThe results show the absolute difference between 50% and the result, i.e. 49.4 and 50.6 will both be reported as \"0.6\". Only differences of 0.5% or greater are shown (0.5% is in no way a ceiling of the expected difference; it just cuts down on the amount of output).\nResult analysis.\nBoth algorithms perform roughly as expected. With these samples, StringHash performs a little bit better, but that is to be expected as it mixes more bits; either way, the differences are not really meaningful. The test only attempts to evaluate if all possible result bits are used efficiently without unexpected \"holes\" in the output.\nA more thorough test would attempt to find biases in different sets of bits, but that is really more meaningful for testing and than it is for this type of light string hash.\nCollision frequency test.\nThis test takes the result of 20000 random strings consisting of ASCII characters 0-255, and selects 15 bits for testing. The resulting value becomes 0--32767, which, for anything other than a , will result in a fair amount of collisions. We expect the frequency of collisions to match a and compare the test results to it.\nLong random string 32-127 bits 1-15.\n Java SH Expected\n 1: 10940 10981 10863\n 2: 6552 6554 6630\n 3: 2043 1998 2023\n 4: 388 396 411\n 5: 65 65 62\n 6: 12 6 7\nLong random string 0-255 bits 1-15.\n Java SH Expected\n 1: 10717 10728 10863\n 2: 6796 6724 6630\n 3: 1995 2073 2023\n 4: 376 420 411\n 5: 110 55 62\n 6: 6 7\nLong random string 0-255 bits 6-20.\n Java SH Expected\n 1: 10788 10875 10863\n 2: 6768 6628 6630\n 3: 1989 1971 2023\n 4: 400 460 411\n 5: 55 60 62\n 6: 6 7\nLong random string 0-255 bits 12-26.\n Java SH Expected\n 1: 10917 10791 10863\n 2: 6630 6612 6630\n 3: 1881 2049 2023\n 4: 492 452 411\n 5: 80 90 62\n 6: 6 7\nLong random string 0-255 bits 18-32.\n Java SH Expected\n 1: 10828 10795 10863\n 2: 6590 6860 6630\n 3: 2127 1932 2023\n 4: 380 360 411\n 5: 75 35 62\n 6: 18 7\nResult analysis.\nBoth hashes perform roughly as expected without showing too great variations over different bits; there are one or two aberrations in the higher collision counts, but that may just be the result of a too-small sample size. I will not investigate further as this test is only a rough indication of performance.\nA more complete analysis would include testing smaller modulii, and certainly ones that are not a power of 2. A modulus constructed around series involving 31 and 32 will most likely produce \"interesting\" results for the Java hash, but that is an expected side effect of its construction.\nBit transmutation test.\nThis test measures how many bits of the hash changes as a result of a single input bit changing, i.e. how close to an we're getting. The result is described as the number of times a given number of bits have been seen to change for the entire run.\nThe input starts out as a string of 0s (ASCII NULs), flipping bits on and off one at a time. Then a number of runs are executed starting out with random values.\nAll the below tests work with 13-byte strings, and execute for 50 runs, i.e. one run based on ASCII NULs, and 49 runs with fresh random numbers each time.\nA good generic hash algorithm will tend toward flipping 50% of the bits for each input bit changed, though that is obviously unattainable. We do however expect a fair hump around 13-17 bits changed, and very low counts toward the extremes. 0 bits flipping may indicate a broken hash algorithm (the hash result didn't change at all as a result of changing the input).\nJava, flip all bits in bytes 1 through 13.\n 0: 0 1: 173 2: 208 3: 194\n 4: 188 5: 159 6: 160 7: 150\n 8: 200 9: 231 10: 228 11: 292\n 12: 343 13: 476 14: 503 15: 469\n 16: 418 17: 318 18: 210 19: 143\n 20: 69 21: 45 22: 11 23: 9\n 24: 2 25: 1 26: 0 27: 0\n 28: 0 29: 0 30: 0 31: 0\n 32: 0\nThis test does not show 0 bits changing, but the changes we do see are spread quite flat over the spectrum. There is a hump around 13-17 but not as marked as it should be. We get quite a few single bit changes, which is quite expected given the algorithm. The last few bytes in the string do not end up affecting very much of the end result.\nStringHash, flip all bits in bytes 1 through 13.\n 0: 0 1: 0 2: 0 3: 45\n 4: 70 5: 77 6: 71 7: 56\n 8: 45 9: 53 10: 115 11: 203\n 12: 327 13: 405 14: 533 15: 588\n 16: 620 17: 593 18: 499 19: 371\n 20: 259 21: 146 22: 76 23: 32\n 24: 12 25: 3 26: 1 27: 0\n 28: 0 29: 0 30: 0 31: 0\n 32: 0\nStringHash has a much more pronounced hump around the 16 bits changed mark. There are no single bit changes, and no two-bit changes in the tests. This is expected as each bit changed is guaranteed to affect at least three bits of the hash, even for the last few bytes of the input.\nJava, flip all bits in bytes 12 through 13.\n 0: 0 1: 173 2: 208 3: 154\n 4: 108 5: 75 6: 53 7: 17\n 8: 6 9: 1 10: 3 11: 2\n 12: 0 (rest 0)\nHere is where the weakness of the hash shows the most: changes in the last few bytes affect relatively few bits, thereby increasing chances for collisions.\nStringHash, flip all bits in bytes 12 through 13.\n 0: 0 1: 0 2: 0 3: 45\n 4: 70 5: 77 6: 71 7: 56\n 8: 36 9: 26 10: 36 11: 40\n 12: 54 13: 51 14: 57 15: 49\n 16: 42 17: 39 18: 23 19: 15\n 20: 9 21: 3 22: 1 23: 0\n 24: 0 (rest 0)\nWhile not precisely shining compared to strong hashes, StringHash stirs quite a few more bits over a much larger spectrum.\nResult analysis.\nStringHash outperforms the Java hash by distributing bit changes over more result bits, thus reducing the collision chance.\nCollision finding test.\nThis test exhaustively computes all possible values of a given input set and tests for collisions. The size of the input sets is unfortunately constrained by RAM and CPU, but it is believed to be a fair indication of hash strength.\nASCII codes 64-89 (upper case A-Z), 3 bytes.\n JavaHash\n 17576 non-colliding values\n StringHash\n 17576 non-colliding values\nASCII codes 64-89 (upper case A-Z), 4 bytes.\n JavaHash\n 456976 non-colliding values\n StringHash\n 456976 non-colliding values\nASCII codes 32-127 (all printable), 2 bytes.\n JavaHash\n 62 non-colliding values\n 62 instances of 2 inputs producing the same hash (124 strings)\n 2638 instances of 3 inputs producing the same hash (7914 strings)\n 279 instances of 4 inputs producing the same hash (1116 strings)\n StringHash\n 9216 non-colliding values\nAlready here, with only searching all possible combinations of 2 letters of printable ASCII, the Java hash is showing poor results.\nASCII codes 32-127 (all printable), 3 bytes.\nThis is about as exhaustive we can go in Lua without resulting to data compression techniques for the result sets: all possible combinations of 3 letters of printable ASCII for a total of 884736 outputs.\n JavaHash\n 62 non-colliding values\n 62 instances of 2 inputs producing the same hash (124 strings)\n 1630 instances of 3 inputs producing the same hash (4890 strings)\n 224 instances of 4 inputs producing the same hash (896 strings)\n 62 instances of 5 inputs producing the same hash (310 strings)\n 1630 instances of 6 inputs producing the same hash (9780 strings)\n 62 instances of 7 inputs producing the same hash (434 strings)\n 224 instances of 8 inputs producing the same hash (1792 strings)\n 68606 instances of 9 inputs producing the same hash (617454 strings)\n 5214 instances of 10 inputs producing the same hash (52140 strings)\n 5214 instances of 11 inputs producing the same hash (57354 strings)\n 9672 instances of 12 inputs producing the same hash (116064 strings)\n 558 instances of 13 inputs producing the same hash (7254 strings)\n 558 instances of 14 inputs producing the same hash (7812 strings)\n 558 instances of 15 inputs producing the same hash (8370 strings)\n StringHash\n 884736 non-colliding values\nASCII codes 32-127 (all printable), 3 bytes, with prefix.\nThe same input values as the 32-127 x 3 test, except all prefixed with the string \"01234567890123456789\".

The only cases where it behaves well are the A-Z cases; as long as the input subset is constricted to 32 unique values, it is collision free for 6 bytes (6 * 5 bits = 30 bits), in other words, it is a perfect hash for e.g. short strings consisting of only upper case ASCII letters A-Z. This is an expected property of the algorithm. Though taken with the rather abysmal results for more generic strings above (or, indeed, any sort of string longer than 6 bytes), the Java hash demonstrably makes for a poor choice for general input.\n= Result summary =\nIn the two simplest cases: collision frequency and bit distribution, the two hashes seem comparable. But on comparing bit transmutation patterns, StringHash tends toward much better spreads of input bits to output bits.\nThe theory is confirmed in the exhaustive collision search tests, where StringHash remains collision free for the small data sets used, while the Java hash produces more collisions (double, tripe, quadruple, etc) than it does collision-free results.\nAdded to this, the Lua implementation of StringHash is slightly faster than the Lua implementation of the Java hash (at least in its most straight-forward implementation).\n= Applicability to other languages =\n&lt;a href=\"StringHash\"&gt;StringHash&lt;/a&gt; was designed to be reasonably collision-resistant and fast in a Lua standard library environment. Other interpreted languages capable of 50-bit integer math (i.e. through using 64-bit floats) should also be able to make a fair use of it.\nLanguages with access to lower level primitives (XOR, ANDs, rotations) would do better to look at e.g. Bob Jenkins' &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c\"&gt;lookup3&lt;/a&gt; hash, or at least read his &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html\"&gt;page on hash analysis&lt;/a&gt;.\n= Appendix: Lua hash analysis code =\n mod=math.mod;\n -- This is the \"Java hash\", a variant of Dan Bernstein's old \"33\" hash posted long ago in the comp.lang.c newsgroup.\n -- The *31 basically translates to \"new = old\u00ab5 - old\", i.e. you never completely lose data from earlier bytes as you would by only shifting\n -- The mod is necessary in Lua; otherwise the value turns floating-point and you lose precision after ~10 characters\n -- This function would be better with a prime modulus, but 2^32 is chosen as a mod to emulate the 32-bit math used in the original\n function JavaHash(text)\n local counter = 0; \n local len = string.len(text); \n for i = 1, len do \n counter = (counter*31) + string.byte(text, i)\n counter = mod(counter, 4294967296); -- 2^32\n end; \n return mod(counter, 4294967296); -- 2^32\n end\n \n -- This string hash is ~30% faster due to working with 3 characters at a time; the mod expression is fairly expensive\n -- The multiplications are all chosen to affect 3 areas of the accumulator at a time:\n -- 8161 = 8192 - 32 + 1 : 2\u00ab13, 2\u00ab 5, 2\u00ab0\n -- 16776193 = 16777216 - 1024 + 1 : 2\u00ab24, 2\u00ab10, 2\u00ab0\n -- 8372226 = 8388608 - 16384 + 2 : 2\u00ab23, 2\u00ab14, 2\u00ab5\n -- 3932164 = 4194304 - 262144 + 4 : 2\u00ab22, 2\u00ab18, 2\u00ab10\n function StringHash(text)\n local counter = 1;\n local len = string.len(text); \n for i = 1, len, 3 do \n counter = mod(counter*8161, 4294967279) + -- 2^32 - 17: Prime!

He carried with him a greatsword forged by vrykul, empowered by elves, and bloodied on the fields of countless battles.\"\n\"Strom'kar, ender of wars, was lost with Thoradin. One strong enough to recover the sword would bring to bear a blade unlike any seen in the ages since.\"\nArtifact lore.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; history is not complete without mention of Strom'kar. With this blade, a visionary warlord named Thoradin united his race into a single nation. He led his people to victory against the trolls in one of the greatest wars humankind has ever fought. He changed the destiny of the world. Strom'kar's story is one of violence and bloodshed, of cunning and desperation. And, ultimately, of bravery and sacrifice.\"\nHistory.\nUnited Humans - Thoradin.\nStated by the deceased &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;, Strom'kar was forged by a master swordsmith and imbued with &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; magics.\nBefore founding &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, Thoradin convinced all of the human tribal leaders he recruited to lend him their personal blades, after which &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; took shards of metal from each weapon and added them to the king's greatsword. This secured the eternal loyalty of the tribes, for many early human warlords believed that the spirits of their ancestors lived on in their weapons, and no one would ever dare rise up against Thoradin and risk striking the sword that contained their own forefathers. When the work was done, Thoradin renamed his sword \"Strom'kar, the Warbreaker\".\nWith &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;'s founding, Thoradin used Strom'kar to carve out the boundaries of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; in the dirt and ordered his masons to begin construction.\nTroll Wars - High Elf.\nOne account tells of an &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; troll ambush that separated the king from his warriors. Though he was outnumbered ten to one, Thoradin did not flee or cower. He sharpened Strom'kar's edge on the skulls of his enemies and painted its steel with their blood. When his guards reached him, they found the king standing over ten broken Amani corpses. Using Strom'kar during the war, Thoradin violently carved a path to the southern side of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to assist Arathor's &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; allies with his men. After the Troll War, Thoradin's group left Quel'Thalas.\nBefore Thoradin left Quel'Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; had the elves' greatest blacksmiths and enchanters to give the human king a gift by imbuing Strom'kar with extraordinary power, making it weigh almost nothing in the king's hands and ensuring that it would never lose its edge.\nThoradin abdicated in his elderly years and spent some time in Tirisfal studying its ruins and becoming obsessed with the humanity's history as well as that of the vrykul. Using the elven enchantments of Strom'kar, he located Tyr's tomb.\nUnlike previous human chieftains, Thoradin took Strom'kar with him with his abdication. By then, Strom'kar has subconsciously spread among human society as a symbol of kingship. He wished to prevent his citizens to become dependent on an object to crown the right to rule the future.\nTomb of Tyr - Zakajz.\nThe sword's elven enchantments forced the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; into a deep slumber and kept it from regenerating for centuries. However, due to constant contact, Strom'kar gained &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; attributes into itself when retrieved later.\nArtifact traits.\nBase.\nHidden trait: &lt;a href=\"Surrounded%20by%20Trolls%21\"&gt;Surrounded by Trolls!&lt;/a&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Stromgarde is all that remains of the mighty human Arathorian Empire. The &lt;a href=\"Team%20color\"&gt;national color&lt;/a&gt; of Stromgarde is red, and its symbols are a closed fist, which is similar to the symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and a bird with its wings spread. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Stromgarde, joined his kingdom with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom declined rapidly following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, losing control of much of its territory and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt;, and Thoras being murdered. In the aftermath, his son, Prince &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, was unable to hold the city together after an invasion of combined &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark&lt;/a&gt; forces. The city fell into ruins, with only a single district still held by the kingdom by the end of it; leading to the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;Refuge Pointe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, it became an independent kingdom of the undead, free from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance and ruled by King &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. This new position was short-lived as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; killed Galen after his betrayal and raised Thoras as one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;; who revealed that he had been slain by none other than his son. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt, and Lord &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; finally returned after many years far from home to reclaim his family's lands and bring his nation back into the Alliance. Unfortunately, its capital had become one of the &lt;a href=\"warfront\"&gt;warfront&lt;/a&gt;s between the two great powers of the Alliance and Horde, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Alliance eventually claimed victory, bringing peace to Stromgarde at last.\nHistory.\nArathor.\nThe city of Stromgarde was founded by the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi tribe&lt;/a&gt; of humans in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Originally named Strom, the city became the capital of the great empire of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. Following the peak of that empire's power many of its citizens left to found other cities, including &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20City\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these newer cities began to attract settlers at an astonishing rate, and it was only a matter of years before the once-powerful Arathi Empire was splintered into &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;seven distinct human nations&lt;/a&gt;. Strom was no longer the center of the human lands, and it was during this time that the leaders of the remaining warriors changed its name to Stromgarde. After the departure of &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s ruling descendants one thousand years or so after Strom's founding, the &lt;a href=\"Trollbane\"&gt;Trollbane family&lt;/a&gt;, children of the legendary and feared general &lt;a href=\"Ignaeus%20Trollbane\"&gt;Ignaeus Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, ascended to the throne by rebuilding Stromgarde's crumbling infrastructure.\nBefore the Second War.\nBefore the coming of the orcs, the human kingdoms of Lordaeron faced challenges and obstacles from each other as the games of politics played out. Amidst those nations, there were no two rivals like Alterac and Stromgarde. The proximity of the two and the apparent ambiguity of their mountain borders had led to several wars and skirmishes. On more than one occasion, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;King Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; led the armies of Stromgarde into battle against the honorable &lt;a href=\"Hath\"&gt;General Hath&lt;/a&gt; of Alterac. The tension of their repeated discord was noticeable at the Alliance summit as Perenolde glared at Trollbane. It is conceivable that this discord had alienated Alterac and its leader from the other Alliance nations who had positive relations with Trollbane. This alienation, in turn, would contribute to Perenolde's willingness to turn on those allies midway through the Second War.\nSecond and Third Wars.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde was a harbor city that controlled the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the island-fortress of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;. Though not the largest, it was one of humanity's most powerful kingdoms. Led by &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, it was also a close and loyal ally of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and their mutual friendship would allow it to quickly join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to stop the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Following the start of the Second War, Stromgarde sent half of its standing army to join the main Alliance forces. The rest of its army was occupied defending the &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;Northlands&lt;/a&gt; from an orcish invasion through the dwarven realm of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom also sent several taskforces behind enemy lines, to siege &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt; and attempt to wrest control of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; from the orcs, until its garrison at &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;its capital&lt;/a&gt; both fell under heavy attacks by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThoras was the first to become suspicious of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;'s true allegiance, and quickly dispatched a force to investigate what was happening in that kingdom. Thoras was able to discover that &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; had allowed the orcs to pass through some unguarded mountain passes, giving them free passage into Lordaeron. Thoras and his troops quickly dispatched the orcs stationed there and prevented further orc reinforcements from passing through.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde built a military outpost along the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The outpost was raided by the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in order to get the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; back from the Alteraci. Thoras Trollbane petitioned King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron to annex the eastern portion of Alterac's territory to Stromgarde in recognition of the latter's sacrifices and valor during the Second War. This created a great deal of political tension between the two powers, which was all the more tragic considering the friendship between Trollbane and Terenas. The Alterac debate was a contributing factor when Stromgarde left the Alliance. Additionally, Trollbane had grown displeased at King Terenas' decision to not execute the captured orcs as the expense at maintaining the internment camps grew. He finally pulled out of the Alliance around the same time as &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"The%20Alliance%20Splinters\"&gt;Alliance splintering&lt;/a&gt; in consequence of the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde managed to prevent the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; from ravaging through its lands, and sent a detachment of troops, the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Brigade\"&gt;Stromgarde Brigade&lt;/a&gt; to accompany &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the darkest hour of Stromgarde was yet to come. Thoras was ultimately secretly murdered by his son, &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen&lt;/a&gt;, who sought the throne of Stromgarde for himself. Stromgarde also came under siege by both the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, the two forces winning several victories against the now weakened kingdom, and managing to occupy much of its terrain, including most of the capital city, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Third War.\nThough weaker than before, its population and territory greatly diminished, Stromgarde was still remembered as the starting point of humanity. Though much of the capital was lost, its armies maintained a base of strategic operations at the crevasse known as &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;Refuge Pointe&lt;/a&gt; in the Highlands, as well as portions of the devastated capital city itself, then occupied by ogres and the criminals of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;. The forces of Stromgarde formed the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, which fought to free the rest of the Arathi Highlands, the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, and its many resources from the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Defilers\"&gt;Forsaken Defilers&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;. Prince &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; ruled from his one remaining holdout in the city until his own demise at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Galen was later raised into undeath by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly pledging allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; while her forces reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt; and raised his former citizens into undeath.\nLegion.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Galen had turned his back on the Forsaken and declared Stromgarde an independent undead kingdom. When the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; approached Galen to request access to his father's tomb, Galen agreed on the condition that they help secure the city against the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark trolls&lt;/a&gt; encroaching upon it. Galen refused to hold up his end of the bargain, however, and ordered the death knights killed. Instead, the death knights slew Galen and raised &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; into undeath as a member of their new &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. The newly-raised Thoras then gave up his kingdom for lost.\nThough Stromgarde's fate remains uncertain, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Thoras Trollbane's nephew \u2014 once vowed that he would one day return to Stromgarde and restore it to its greatness.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Arathi Highlands became a &lt;a href=\"warfront\"&gt;warfront&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Citizen\"&gt;Citizens&lt;/a&gt; seem to have moved back into the retaken capital and, led by &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, the Stromic defended their rebuilt city against the invading &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Alliance planned to use Stromgarde to cut off the Horde forces from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; in the north, the Horde aimed to use it as a staging ground to break north, prevent the Alliance from building up, and to attack &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. During the invasion, various heroes of the Alliance arrived to defend the city, such as &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, with the forces of the united &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;; with Danath heading forces as well. They faced off against champions of the Horde, such as &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;her elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; trolls, and &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and his veterans of the Horde.\nThe battle ultimately ended in the Alliance's favor, with Stromgarde victorious, thanks to the leadership qualities of &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, and the tenacity of all the soldiers who fought. This victory restored Stromgarde Keep as the capital of its eponymous kingdom, leaving the Horde stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Ar%27gorok\"&gt;Ar'gorok&lt;/a&gt; in ruins, and the various settlements of the kingdom in the hands of the Alliance once more.\nFollowing the Alliance victory, the soldiers returned home, leaving only a few behind as a precaution. When &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; presented himself to Stromgarde during his mission for &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Danath blessed him to inspect the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Crypt&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Danath's &lt;a href=\"outrider\"&gt;outrider&lt;/a&gt;s spotted an armed and cloaked woman traveling with a group of Horde refugees throughout the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, and the new leader of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; subsequently informed his old friend &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, as she and Turalyon were riding through the region searching for the whereabouts of her sister &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople and culture.\nThe correct demonym for people coming from Stromgarde is \"Stromic\".\nStromgarde shares its red signature color with the &lt;a href=\"Alteraci%20tribe\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt;, the human tribe &lt;a href=\"Ignaeus%20Trollbane\"&gt;Ignaeus Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; hailed from.\nAs Stromgarde is a mountain kingdom, its people grew up learning to climb the rock faces and scale the peaks.\nForearm handshake is a common gesture of friendship with the soldiers of Stromgarde.\nFounded centuries ago, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; spread its faith in Stromgarde, the citizens of the kingdom thus becoming followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, as indicated by the &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; with its &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt;, and the graves with the symbol of the church in their cemeteries. &lt;a href=\"Altarite%20Jesse%20Taylor\"&gt;High Priest Altarite Jesse Taylor&lt;/a&gt; is the highest-ranking member of the clergy present in the city.\nLike the other realms, the Kingdom of Stromgarde can apply the death penalty for its criminals, the task being accomplished by an &lt;a href=\"executioner\"&gt;executioner&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary.\nThe crimson-clad soldiers of Stromgarde are known for the martial discipline in battle and have proven themselves in the Second War which they were able to hold off the entire Horde for quite a while on their own, allowing the rest of the Alliance to mobilize.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and later being under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; served as a major training ground for the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; of Stromgarde.\n&lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Cavalryman\"&gt;Stromgarde cavalrymen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Defender\"&gt;defenders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Troll%20Hunter\"&gt;troll hunters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Soldier\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt; can be seen as part of the Stromic army. Many of them wear a &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Badge\"&gt;badge&lt;/a&gt;. The cavalry was led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Valorcall\"&gt;Lieutenant Valorcall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Militia\"&gt;Stromgarde Militia&lt;/a&gt; was based in &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;Refuge Pointe&lt;/a&gt;. Their captain used to be &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, but after he went missing it is now probably led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Nials\"&gt;Captain Nials&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruined%20Kingdom\"&gt;The Ruined Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; the Stromic soldiers in Stromgarde Keep were undead, though that change was not reflected in the overworld.\nStromic soldiers line the city, wearing a red footman armor. Danath Trollbane is accompanied by the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, who serve as his main lieutenants across the battlefield. &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Footman\"&gt;Stromgarde footmen&lt;/a&gt; can be found throughout the city prior to it being besieged by the Horde. Other forces include &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Arbalest\"&gt;arbalest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Spellweaver\"&gt;spellweaver&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Priest\"&gt;priestesses&lt;/a&gt;. The elite forces consist in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, wearing the League of Arathor tabard, and &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Veterans of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Their leadership appears to all be wearing the same armor, which is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Gladiator%27s%20Battlegear\"&gt;Deadly Gladiator's Battlegear&lt;/a&gt;'s plate for the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; class.\nIn Warcraft II.\nLeader: \"&lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;\"\nNation Color: \"Red\"\nBackground: \"The kingdom of Stromgarde retains a strict martial philosophy which makes it a highly regarded addition to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Situated amongst the foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde serves as a sentinel against any invasion across the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;-controlled borders of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Possessing a long history of warfare against the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Trolls&lt;/a&gt;, the warriors of Stromgarde are well prepared to engage in open combat with all enemies of humanity.\"\nIn Warcraft III.\nA \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" map is spelled \"&lt;a href=\"Stromguarde\"&gt;Stromguarde&lt;/a&gt;\".

While Lordaeron brought the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde brought the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. This kingdom borders &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and served as the first area of defense from land-based attacks for the humans. Stromgarde left the Alliance after the Second War, upset with certain political decisions.\nMilitary.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Defenders\"&gt;Stromgarde Defenders&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Snipers%20Company\"&gt;Stromgarde Snipers Company&lt;/a&gt; are the forces protecting Stromgarde.\nTheir determination and courage are known throughout Azeroth as some of humanity's greatest fighters. In battle, the &lt;a href=\"footmen\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; would march to face the enemy in tight ranks with broadswords and shields. The famed &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s of Stromgarde are used as shock troops to support these warriors especially against &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; forces. The &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Snipers%20Company\"&gt;Stromgarde Snipers Company&lt;/a&gt;, made up of &lt;a href=\"Rifleman%23Dwarven%20rifleman\"&gt;dwarven rifleman&lt;/a&gt;, provide them with covering fire. Captain &lt;a href=\"Dathanor%20Cromwell\"&gt;Dathanor Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; commands the infantry unit, while Captain &lt;a href=\"Ariana%20Thesslocke\"&gt;Ariana Thesslocke&lt;/a&gt; leads the cavalry unit.\nFilm universe.\nStromgarde participated in the council that would eventually lead to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;."}

In ages past, the settlement was a cradle for &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; civilization, when it served as the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Arathorian%20Empire\"&gt;Arathorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; under the name of Strom. By the time of the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;, it stood as a major power center as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during and after some time following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nStromgarde was eventually sacked and left in ruins at some point after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and remained in this condition for many years to follow. It was divided into three sections \u2014 one around the inner &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; itself and under the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; district largely under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist clan&lt;/a&gt; ogres with aid from the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark trolls&lt;/a&gt;, while the last section remained under the control of the Stromgarde military and once served as the headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Prince Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, until his death.\nThe outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; brought a revival for the fallen capital. Supported by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and led by Lord &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; fully re-established itself in Stromgarde and began restoring the settlement to its former glory. However, it soon became the focal point of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; between the Alliance and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for control of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the Alliance managed to defeat the Horde, returning most of Arathi into the hands of Stromgarde after many years of strife.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nFounding.\nStromgarde was founded under the name \"Strom\" as the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Empire of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, the first human kingdom, around 2,800 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;. After uniting the human tribes, Arathor's king, &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;, set out to found a new capital. According to one legend, his father appeared to him in a dream one night, wearing the pelt of a black wolf, and told him that his people would prosper if he built his capital in an arid land to the southeast. Thoradin sought out the region now called the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and, as the story goes, saw a black wolf roaming the terrain. On that spot, the king used his sword, &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt;, to carve out the boundaries of a city in the dirt and ordered his masons to begin construction of Strom. The semiarid terrain acted as a buffer zone between humanity and their enemies, the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;, prohibiting the trolls from launching their feared forest ambushes. Word of the fortress-city soon spread among human tribes across the continent, and many traveled to it for safety.\nIn addition to being their first capital, Strom was also the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; for humanity. During the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the city and taught &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;one hundred humans&lt;/a&gt; the arcane arts in exchange for Strom's military aid against the Amani Empire. Together the elves and humans went on to defeat the trolls.\nDecline.\nAlthough Arathor grew and prospered after the Troll Wars, Thoradin feared that his kingdom would splinter apart if it overextended itself and maintained that Strom was the center of the empire. After his death, Arathor expanded across the Eastern Kingdoms and founded new city-states, the first of which was &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Many magi ended up moving to the latter to escape growing prejudice and the strict laws governing magic in Strom. This was followed by the creation of other city-states like &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. The rulers in Strom feared that these settlements would become too autonomous, but despite their efforts the cities grew increasingly independent over the decades.\nBound by mountainous terrain and lacking natural resources, Strom could not compete with the economies of the other city-states and steadily declined in power. Circa 1,200 BDP, many of the capital's noble families finally sought to leave the Arathi Highlands in favor of more fertile lands in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Thoradin's descendants, the last of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; bloodline, argued that Strom should not be abandoned, which incurred the displeasure of the greater citizenry who were also eager to leave. The nobles soon left regardless and moved to Lordaeron, where they founded a &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;city-state of the same name&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, Thoradin's descendants, led by &lt;a href=\"Faldir\"&gt;Faldir&lt;/a&gt;, also abandoned Strom and sailed south to found the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Strom was left in the hands of a few ruling families who were too stubborn to leave, including the &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%20family\"&gt;Trollbanes&lt;/a&gt;, the descendants of a &lt;a href=\"Ignaeus%20Trollbane\"&gt;famous general&lt;/a&gt; of the Troll Wars. These families rebuilt the crumbling infrastructure of the capital and renamed it \"Stromgarde\". Although Stromgarde developed into a nation in its own right, the city would never regain its former glory.\nSecond War.\nAfter several battles against the forces of Stromgarde, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; eventually attacked the capital of the kingdom with a maritime assault.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nOne of the highest-ranking leaders of the Syndicate, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Falconcrest\"&gt;Lord Falconcrest&lt;/a&gt;, commanded Syndicate efforts in the Arathi Highlands from the ruined city. The Stromic army had placed a bounty on his head and sought the help of the Alliance heroes.\nThe sword &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary bane of trolls and heirloom of the Trollbane family, was sealed away in the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Trollbane Family Crypt&lt;/a&gt; and protected by &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; until adventurers of the Horde killed him, unsealed the tomb, and took the sword to &lt;a href=\"Zengu\"&gt;Zengu&lt;/a&gt;. Zengu tasked the adventurers to retrieve the sword so that it could be used against the trolls of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. When he got the sword he quickly took off alone, but was killed by the humans of Stromgarde. They returned the sword to its proper place, resealed the tomb, and once again split the sigils among their people, under Galen's successor's orders.\nCataclysm.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Galen Trollbane was raised by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and aided them in reclaiming the sigils and ultimately Trol'kalar in the city, this time for their own use. The Forsaken and the League of Arator sent adventurers to continue fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; criminals.\nLegion.\nSome time before the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Galen was finally able to reclaim Stromgarde Keep for himself before or after he broke off from the Forsaken. The city was now almost completely under the control of undead Stromic people, including &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Defender\"&gt;Stromgarde Defender&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Cavalryman\"&gt;cavalrymen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Troll%20Hunter\"&gt;troll hunters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Citizen%20%28undead%29\"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt;s. Only a group of &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; trolls remained in the former mage district.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; came to resurrect his father, Galen tried to double cross them and made a last stand in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, where he died a second and probably final time.\nBefore the Storm.\nAs agreed by &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde Keep was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to act as the base for the &lt;a href=\"Stormwindian\"&gt;Stormwindian&lt;/a&gt; people participating in the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; priests, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, gave them blessings in its chapel. During the Gathering, Alliance leaders stayed atop the ruined ramparts to observe the meeting.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Citizen\"&gt;Stromgarde citizens&lt;/a&gt; seem to have returned home, along with the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;League of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. The city was rebuilt and supported by engines of war and barracks for soldiers. The city served as the Alliance's base of operations during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, as the Horde forces of &lt;a href=\"Ar%27gorok\"&gt;Ar'gorok&lt;/a&gt; sought to conquer the Arathi Highlands. After Stromgarde Keep temporarily fell to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the course of the conflict, Stromgarde Keep apparently laid in ruins with the &lt;a href=\"Vengeful%20Ghost\"&gt;Vengeful Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance's dead haunting it. The Alliance then needed to gather enough resources to restore the base and continue their bid to conquer Arathi.\nThe battle ultimately ended in the Alliance's favor, with Stromgarde victorious, thanks to the leadership qualities of &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, and the tenacity of all the soldiers who fought. Their victory restored Stromgarde Keep as the capital of its eponymous &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the Horde stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Ar%27gorok\"&gt;Ar'gorok&lt;/a&gt; in ruins and the various settlements of the kingdom in the hands of the Alliance once more.\nFollowing the Alliance victory, the soldiers returned home, leaving only a few guards behind as a precaution.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and over 20 soldiers were searching for Horde &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s fleeing Stromgarde Keep.\nAlthough not visible in-game, the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Crypt&lt;/a&gt; are still present in the capital, lorewise, and have been inspected by &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; with Danath Trollbane's blessing.\nIn the RPG.\nOnce called simply Strom, the city formerly served as the capital of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, the former &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;'s capital of Stromgarde is still held (barely) by its rightful leader, &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Prince Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. The city is the center of a power struggle between the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Snipers%20Company\"&gt;city's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Defenders\"&gt;defenders&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. A mysterious man called &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Falconcrest\"&gt;Lord Falconcrest&lt;/a&gt; commands the Syndicate in the city.\nStromgarde's ruins include the &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%20Family%20Crypt\"&gt;Trollbane Family Crypt&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nLike with &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on the keep hasn't been mentioned in any other sources besides \"\". \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" actually presents Stromgarde when the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; was revealed. No attack on the keep has been mentioned there, and Thoras's guard captain only complained about not having enough soldiers to move into Alterac because the soldiers were with the main Alliance army. That would mean that if the Horde attacked, Stromgarde would probably have fallen without the relocated soldiers."}
