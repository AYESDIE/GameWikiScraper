Before then, as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he hunted down creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this time that he encountered &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt;. Locus-Walker killed Lothraxion, but he did not kill him inside the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; on purpose, allowing Lothraxion to regenerate. This is because Locus-Walker had seen a unique destiny for him.\nLothraxion has since joined the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Grand Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, an organization born from the survivors of worlds ravaged by the Legion and led by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;, of which &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; are high-ranking members.\nA Thousand Years of War.\nFollowing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Lothraxion journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;shattered realm&lt;/a&gt; in order to recruit &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; into the Army of the Light. Sometime later the Army of the Light raided a small Legion prison world only to discover all the demons permanently dead due to the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. During the raid, Alleria would be attacked, infected with the void, and granted visions. In time she would become fascinated with the void and Lothraxion would reveal all that he knew of it to her. He would also reveal to her the existence of the Locus-Walker and conveyed their shared history to her. After learning that she believed that the shadow would be beneficial against the Legion Lothraxion warned her to not say such things where Xe'ra might hear.\nLothraxion fought side by side with Turalyon on Argus and would later be attacked by an &lt;a href=\"Eradication%20%28eredar%29\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; seeking to claim Turalyon's life. During the battle against the assassin, Alleria (who had left the Army of the Light) returned and drove him off. Unable to stop the soulstone from draining Turalyon's soul Alleria used the Void to rip the assassin's poison out of Lothraxion, who saved Turalyon's soul and cleansed the poison from him in turn. After killing &lt;a href=\"Eradication%20%28eredar%29\"&gt;the assassin&lt;/a&gt; with the void Turalyon warned her to leave, as Xe'ra would not accept her use of the Void. However Alleria refused to leave and when the naaru arrived, she was ready to punish - even execute - Alleria for her actions. Turalyon and Lothraxion pled for mercy for Alleria, and Xe'ra was swayed by their words. Instead, Xe'ra would imprison Alleria, planning to keep her incarcerated until she renounced the void.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Lothraxion was held captive on the Legion world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, where he was found and freed by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Lothraxion, his name unknown to them at the time, informed the Highlord that the Legion planned to attack &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;.

You get , , , and from NPCs in the three participating cities of your faction (the capital cities prior to &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;). Guards give \"Pledges of\" and non-guards give \"Gifts of\". \nIf you do not have the &lt;a href=\"Adored\"&gt;Adored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;, you get the \"of Adoration\" item and the adored debuff for one hour (of real time, not game time), then for that hour you can only get the \"of Friendship\" item. Both gifts contain a pledge item (see Creates section below), but the Gift of Adoration contains a functional gift as well. Think of the \"of Friendship\" item as a farmable consolation prize you can collect between the availability of the real gifts. All of the \"of Adoration\" gifts, from guards and non-guards, from any city, from either faction, contain the same random functional items, but the pledge items are unique, so each city's NPCs (by race) give a specific set of container items that contain the NPC type specific and city specific pledge item. An NPC of a race associated with another city gives the gifts of that other city. \nThe NPC must have a heart floating over their head, and few of the non-guard NPCs have the heart. You will only be able to give the Love Tokens to NPCs if you are wearing for female NPCs or for male NPCs, and you will only be able to see the hearts if you are wearing either. The hearts have a 1-2 minute cooldown after anyone gives the NPC a Love Token and receives a gift. \nYou will not always get a gift, sometimes you will receive a &lt;a href=\"Heartbroken%20%28debuff%29\"&gt;Heartbroken&lt;/a&gt; debuff instead. This debuff lasts an hour and prevents you from using Love Tokens, but can be removed by another player using an on you. You must have an open slot in your inventory or a stack of less than 100 in your inventory to have an Unbestowed Friendship Bracelet successfully used on you, creating a Friendship Bracelet and removing the Heartbroken debuff. As of Love is in the Air 2009, there is an achievement to use Unbestowed Friendship Bracelets on players (requires them to have the Heartbroken debuff), so if you get the debuff, it is not terribly difficult to find someone willing to remove it, even in the wee hours of the morning. \nOnly the NPCs with the city's guard name count as guards. &lt;a href=\"Vendor\"&gt;Vendor&lt;/a&gt; NPCs are non-guards, but also named NPCs with guard duties; basically anyone who isn't a generic guard. The &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;s have the floating heart but do not count as non-guard NPCs for the event; they do not give gifts, rather, they are the source for the items you need to farm the gifts, the cologne, perfume and Love Tokens, (and their heart is always visible, not requiring that you be wearing cologne or perfume).\nYou must have an open slot in your inventory to receive a Gift of Friendship. The item does not stack. If you attempt to obtain one without an empty slot, your Love Token is consumed, the NPC's floating heart goes on cooldown, you run the risk of the Heartbroken debuff; you just don't get the item."}

The first \"Love is in the Air\" event occurred in 2006, and has been repeated since then.\nIn 2010, this event was significantly changed. This page covers the version of the event up to 2009. See &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; for the current version.\nFrom the official site:\nDetails.\nTo start, talk to an &lt;a href=\"Innkeeper\"&gt;Innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; with a heart () over their head and purchase &lt;a href=\"Love%20Token\"&gt;Love Token&lt;/a&gt;, and either a &lt;a href=\"Perfume%20Bottle\"&gt;Perfume Bottle&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Cologne%20Bottle\"&gt;Cologne Bottle&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately use either the perfume or cologne on yourself. This will provide a 60 minute Cologne/Perfume &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;. Walk around any major city and you should see &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s with hearts () above their heads.\nGiving Tokens.\nInteract with any one of them and you will be prompted (talk bubble) to give them a love token.\nAn NPC will not give out items after receiving a token for 1\u20132 minutes.\nIf your inventory is full and you talk to an NPC with a heart above their head and they accept your token, they will not give you something in return.\nCologne vs. Perfume.\nAfter giving a token, several things will happen:\nPledge or Gift.\nIf you do not currently have the debuff &lt;a href=\"Adored\"&gt;Adored&lt;/a&gt;, you will receive a or &lt;a href=\"gift\"&gt;gift&lt;/a&gt;, and the debuff Adored. If you do currently have the debuff Adored they will give a or gift. This rule applies for all NPCs.\nIn both cases, Pledges are received from guard NPCs, while Gifts are received from non-guard NPCs.\nHeartbroken.\nSometimes when you attempt to give a token to an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; they will not give you an item in return and will instead give you the \"&lt;a href=\"Heartbroken%20%28debuff%29\"&gt;Heartbroken&lt;/a&gt;\" debuff. This debuff prevents you from giving tokens to any &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s for 60 minutes. This happens randomly.\nThe debuff can be removed if a &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; uses an on you. Once this happens the debuff will disappear and you will have a in your inventory. This item does not have a known purpose.\nThe debuff lasts 60 minutes game time, not real time.\nPledge of Adoration.\nWhen you get a Pledge/Gift of Adoration, you cannot receive another until the Adored Buff fades. During that 60 minute period you will receive Pledges/Gifts of Friendship instead.\nThe Pledge/Gift of Adoration can contain a variety of items:\nPledge/Gift of Friendship.\nAn NPC will give you a package after getting a token if you have the Adored Buff. What this contains highly depends on who you talk to.\nOther Items.\nIt is not widely talked about, but during this time, a special item drops from four elites in a variety of old-world dungeons. - This item acts the same as , but has an unlimited number of shots. It randomly drops from &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Galford\"&gt;Archivist Galford&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illyanna%20Ravenoak\"&gt;Illyanna Ravenoak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Polkelt\"&gt;Lorekeeper Polkelt&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Princess Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. As of 2009, it is no longer possible to get this item from these bosses &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D14990774504%26amp%3BpageNo%3D3%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%2347\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 2009 event of \"Love is in the Air\", the was introduced for those characters with access to Northrend.

Peddlefeet.\n&lt;a href=\"Kwee%20Q.%20Peddlefeet\"&gt;Kwee Q. Peddlefeet&lt;/a&gt; is the host of the event. He is a goblin with wings. There is a Kwee Q. Peddlefeet by each faction leader. If you codice_1 Kwee Q. Peddlefeet he gives a 60 minute +200 health buff. He also accepts Alliance and Horde Gift Collections.\nWhen you turn in an Alliance or Horde Gift Collection, Kwee Q. Peddlefeet will give you a and your choice of 5 , 5 , or 5 .\nYour turning the collection in counts as one vote for the popularity of the leader of the faction of the city that you turn the collection in at. At the end of the the Love is in the Air seasonal event, the capital city leader with the most gift collections will have Kwee Q. Peddlefeet stay by them to buff players for another week.\nYou can ask Kwee Q. Peddlefeet about the gift voting standings. He gives the number of turn-ins for each participating city leader and the totals for each faction. \nDisproportionate voting stacked toward one particular leader will give either faction that does so a better chance of winning. \nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Dearest%20Colara%2C\"&gt;Dearest Colara,&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance quests).\nNote: you will only be able to do one of these quests per character.\n&lt;a href=\"Dangerous%20Love%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Dangerous Love (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: Dearest Colara is the introduction to this quest. If you have it in your log, you can't get this one. However, if you start this chain before doing Dearest Colara, you will not be able to do that one.\nDangerous Love starts by the bank in Stormwind with &lt;a href=\"Aristan%20Mottar\"&gt;Aristan Mottar&lt;/a&gt;. The first objective is to get a Stormwind Guard's Card. Then you must give a &lt;a href=\"Perfume%20Bottle\"&gt;Perfume Bottle&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Cologne%20Bottle\"&gt;Cologne Bottle&lt;/a&gt; (purchasable at the inn) to &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Pestle\"&gt;Morgan Pestle&lt;/a&gt;. You will receive a box of chocolate and a handful of rosepetals for completing this step.\nUpon talking to &lt;a href=\"Aristan%20Mottar\"&gt;Aristan Mottar&lt;/a&gt; again, he will ask you to speak with Innkeeper Allison. Allison will tell you to talk to Evert Sorisam, a man in \"The Finest Thread\" in the Stormwind Canals. &lt;a href=\"The%20Finest%20Thread\"&gt;The Finest Thread&lt;/a&gt; is near &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Square\"&gt;Cathedral Square&lt;/a&gt;. He will lead you to &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Staffron%20Lerent\"&gt;Apothecary Staffron Lerent&lt;/a&gt;, who is behind &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. Just in front of the manor you will see a practice ring, behind that is a path through the mountains. Go through that path and then to the left. You can sort of see on the map how this leads behind the manor.\nAfter talking to him, he will offer you the contents of his cauldron, which is a choice of:\nNote: You must right click on his cauldron and open it, otherwise you will not get your reward.\n&lt;a href=\"Dangerous%20Love%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Dangerous Love (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: Before you can do this, you must complete Dearest Elenia.\n&lt;a href=\"Fenstad%20Argyle\"&gt;Fenstad Argyle&lt;/a&gt;...\nThe short quest chains that start with Dangerous Love eventually lead to the discovery of who is behind the love plague. The end reward is a choice of:\nAchievements.\nThe meta-achievement &lt;a href=\"Fool%20For%20Love\"&gt;Fool For Love&lt;/a&gt; can be completed during this time.

{"id": "32676", "revid": "819614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=32676", "title": "Lower Blackrock Spire walkthrough", "text": "The entry room.\nWhen you enter BRS, you will be in an \"entry room\" from which you can enter the Upper Spire (on the left) or the Lower Spire (on the right). The Upper Spire requires the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, and is entered through the door on left just up the short stairs. The Lower Spire can be reached by simply jumping off a ledge through the archway on the right-hand side, just up the stairs.\nAfter entering the first room, pull the 2 orcs on the left. Kill the patrols, and move to the bridge. Jump down the drop-off on the right side of the bridge. \nTo the Omokk/Voone fork.\nYou will now move through a series of platforms with groups of orcs and wolves. At the end of this section you will be at a fork where you can choose to enter the Ogre area (for Omokk) or to descend into the Troll area (for Vosh'gajin and Voone).\nAfter jumping down from the ledge, wait for another patrol there, being careful not to aggro it until it is far enough from the other mobs in this room. Pull and kill it.\nYou are now facing your first 'big' pull, of 4 orcs and 2 non-elite wolves.\nThe warlock must be controlled or killed immediately, because it will open a portal and summon demons which will overwhelm your group. If one of the Orcs is a warlock, follow these rules:\nAfter this group, go through the archway to the next room, which has another group of 4 orcs and 2 wolves. This group can often be split if you pull the left-hand wolf first. Warlock control rules apply again, as for all encounters in this area. You can then hug the left-hand wall to skip the orcs, as well as the next group of orcs as you descend the ramp down into the room.\nBy hugging the left you wall you can reach the bottom of the ramp and handle another four orcs and two wolves. Cross the wooden bridge to the left and start pulling the groups of four orcs. This is where the pulls get tricky because you have to fight in a very small perimeter, while dealing with a warlock, and other casters that you must somehow pull to your group (using counterspell, earth shock, shield bash) to avoid runners.\nClear the next platform, unless the whole group is 60, in which case the left-most group can be skipped. Take the next wooden bridge to the right, clear the mobs after the 2nd bridge, and move up. Along the left wall you should see clickable \"Roughshod Pikes\". Pull the sleeping orcs next to them, and then loot the pike. It is needed for the quest Urok Doomhowl later on. By now, you should already have met Warosh, that ugly Trogg looking npc roaming around, and you should have the quest from him.\nPull to the right, then move up around a large crack in the floor. Be careful near this crack, characters below 60 or a misplaced totem near the edge will aggro many, many trolls from the area below the crack. Doing so will cause an almost certain wipe. You will now be facing an arch guarded by 3 ogres. This is the first fork. You may proceed through the arch to the ogre area, or go right and down the slope to the troll area. We'll be doing the ogre area first!\nThe Ogre Area.\nPull the ogres down the hallway, avoiding the bridges. The Ogre reavers have a knockback attack that will tend to toss people in the air and off the bridge if you're not careful. After you pass the bridge, you will enter a big room.\nSeveral rare mobs spawn around this area. On the left is a small rock \"hill\" with ogres on it. It can be ignored as long as everyone stands close to the right wall, but sometimes you'll find a &lt;a href=\"Spirestone%20Battle%20Lord\"&gt;Spirestone Battle Lord&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Spirestone%20Lord%20Magus\"&gt;Spirestone Lord Magus&lt;/a&gt;. Also a &lt;a href=\"Spirestone%20Butcher\"&gt;Spirestone Butcher&lt;/a&gt; may appear on the bridge leading into the room. All drop decent rare quality items.\nClear a few more ogres, and you'll see Highlord Omokk and his two guards.\n&lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Omokk\"&gt;Highlord Omokk&lt;/a&gt; is possibly the easiest boss fight in Lower Blackrock Spire. Sheep, sap, freeze, or seduce one of the guards, or both if you can. If you can only control one, have your warrior tank the boss while the rest of the group focuses on killing the other ogre. Omokk has one annoying ability, which is an aggro-clearing knockback. The main tank should stand with his or her back to a wall so the knockback doesn't lead to an accidental pull on the hill, and should be ready to re-establish aggro with taunt or mocking blow.\nOmokk can drop a &lt;a href=\"Gemstone%20of%20Spirestone\"&gt;Gemstone of Spirestone&lt;/a&gt; needed for the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, and several blues, including the warrior set belt. The \"Important Documents\" required for the Horde quest &lt;a href=\"Warlord%27s%20Command\"&gt;Warlord's Command&lt;/a&gt; is on the floor next to where you fought Omokk.\nGo back to the fork, and this time go down the ramp toward the troll area.\nThe Troll Area.\nDescend the slope, clearing the few trolls there. Then start pulling the next room back to the slope. Pulling to the ramp is strongly recommended since the trolls are ranged and casters and all run when they get hurt.\nThe Witch Doctors cast Hex Frog, so have a priest or paladin ready to dispel if possible.\nOnce you feel you have pulled enough of the next room, move in. Straight ahead in the middle of opposite wall, a ramp leads up to &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Vosh%27gajin\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Vosh'gajin&lt;/a&gt;, an optional boss who drops the rogue set gloves and is the target of the Axecrafting quest.\nGo back to the big room and start clearing down the slope to the middle platform.\nTo Bijou.\nThe large troll room has witchdoctors, seers, headhunters, and berserkers. There are multiple patrols that criss-cross the center of the room and go up and down the ramps, so be careful and take your time. The witch doctors have a \"Flame Buffet totem\" that does AoE fire damage, and should be killed quickly.\nWhen you reach the platform in the middle of the three slopes, go up the opposite slope, and clear a few more patrols to reach the NPC goblin Bijou. Whether or not you have the quest to find her, she will grant you the follow-up quest \"Bijou's Belongings.\"\nGo back down to the middle platform, and take the slope leading down, then pull to the right. Clear yourself a way to the door in front of you down the last slope. You'll pull through the archway into the small room, clear the small room after that, and will then be facing Voone.\nWarmaster &lt;a href=\"Voone\"&gt;Voone&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoone is a straight-forward boss. He hits like a truck, especially by the end of the fight, so make sure your healers are ready and your tank has solid aggro.\nWhen he dies, Horde should check for \"Important Documents\" for the Warlord's Command quest. \nYou should also look for \"Bijou's Belongings\" which looks like a brown trunk. If it's not there, it will be further, in the Orc alley. Also, Warmaster Voone has a ~15% chance to drop the second Gem you need for the Upper Spire key, the Gem of Smolderthorn. Make sure everyone checks the corpse, as it may appear for any character. In his room you can also find the last tablet for the \"The Final Tablets.\"\nVoone drops the Hunter set gloves as well as a number of other unremarkable items.\nNow is the time to take your first big shortcut! Go back up all the way to the start of the troll area, past the big room full of trolls, until you are back at the first ramp, where you encountered the first trolls. The exact spot where you must jump down is located right next to the door connected to the big room. Be very careful before you jump: you must aim so you fall as close as possible to the corner right under you. If you jump too far or too much to the right, you will immediately aggro mobs. If you do though, keep your cool, deal with them, and be very careful to not let them run and aggro more.\nThe Orc Alley.\nAfter jumping down, ignore the Orcs on your right behind the rock. Start pulling from straight ahead of you. Your first two pulls should be patrols, a one-orc and a two-orc patrol.\nPulls are very tricky here, so do it with caution, as you can quickly get two camps at the same time. To avoid pulling two groups, it's advised you do long Line-of-Sight pulls to get all the casters to chase your puller to the end of the hallway to the area where you first jumped down. Firebrand Grunts are heavy-hitting melee types and the others are casters; fortunately there are no more warlocks. The Evokers do some mean damage, so typically you should kill them first. Watch out for a rare spawn, &lt;a href=\"Bannok%20Grimaxe\"&gt;Bannok Grimaxe&lt;/a&gt; who can sometimes be found in Orc Alley. He is a melee type who hits harder than other orcs.\nBijou's Belongings can sometimes be found somewhere on the sides, all along the Orc Alley, so keep your eyes open for a small brown trunk. Keep pulling and working your way through those orcs, until you reach the spider area.\nThe Spiders.\nThis is the place everyone dreads, where many groups stop and give up. But with a bit of organization, the spiders aren't that hard.\nThe deal: The first pull of spiders will consist of two Elite Spire Spiders (don't even try to split them) and a bunch of mini-spiders, which are tough normal mobs. They hit really fast, which is bad when they start beating on casters.\nThe big spiders cast a long stun (about eight seconds), which can hit several targets at a time, so it's best to make sure not too many characters stand close to them at a time. And when you kill one of the big spiders, a bunch of other little spiders spawn.\nThe drill:\nNote: Try to pull those spiders way down the ramp, on flat ground, to avoid evade bugs. Also note that the stun can be dispelled.\nIf you manage to be victorious, this means your group can probably go until the end of the instance. Congratulations. But don't cheer too fast though, there are many more spiders to kill. (I hear you cry)\nLoot the immature venom sacs and put them on a hotkey, you can right click them to remove the poison from Mother Smolderweb.\nMother Smolderweb.\nAfter the first pull of two spiders, you should be able to pull the spider named &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Smolderweb\"&gt;Mother Smolderweb&lt;/a&gt;. She acts much like a slightly tougher Spire Spider. She also splits into more little spiders when she dies. She can drop the Druid set boots.\nShe also casts the poison you need to keep on yourself if you want to finish the quest \"Mother's Milk\". If you do, after the spider dies, warp back to Kargath/Lakeshore and go to &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Crest\"&gt;Flame Crest&lt;/a&gt; as fast as you can. (It's kinda annoying because the venom of the spider is actually casting net on you and immobilizing you every now and then). Then just run back to the Spire, take the first shortcut (as described above), run down Orc Alley, and you're back in action.\nContinue up the ramp, and pull the solo roaming spider. You can usually skip the two spiders in the \"pit\" on the left. Just run as close as you can on the right, at the edge of those ledges. Stop at the point where they cross, and pull the next two spiders there. Deal with them exactly as I described the first pull.\nThe last (and third) double-spider pull might have a rare spawn, \"&lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Fang\"&gt;Crystal Fang&lt;/a&gt;,\" in it. Fang spawns twice the number of little spiders when killed. If Fang spawns, you have a chance at some interesting rare items, including half of the &lt;a href=\"Spider%27s%20Kiss\"&gt;Spider's Kiss&lt;/a&gt; set.\nIf you go through all the spider pulls sucessfully, you will reach a platform, with ogres all over it. Oh, and if you feel up to killing a few extra spiders, you can click the eggs and try to finish \"En-Ay-Es-Tee-Why\". Open one egg at a time, as it can spawn spiders.\nUrok Doomhowl's pad.\nOnce you have that pad full of ogres clear, you will find a pile of skulls in a corner. If you plant the Roughshod Pike and The Head of Highlord Omokk on it, a script will start.\n\"Don't do that now\" though, there is a very high chance you will wipe on this script. It is the hardest battle in the whole dungeon, and it is optional. You can come back after you have killed the other \"easy\" bosses and do this script as last thing you do before leaving the instance. I will describe in the last paragraph how to deal with this script.\nTo &lt;a href=\"Halycon\"&gt;Halycon&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the ogre pad, move on and pull a large group of non-elite scorpids. Tank them, and AoE them down. Another pull of those and wait for an orc patrol.\nGo up the stairs and wait for another patrol coming down from the other stairs. Turn right and pull the three orcs standing there against the wall. Left of those three orcs is the entrance to Halycon's Nest, so don't get too close until you are ready.\nIn any case, pull Halycon and defeat her. The only hard thing in the fight is that when she dies, her mate comes to avenge her. &lt;a href=\"Gizrul%20the%20Slavener\"&gt;Gizrul the Slavener&lt;/a&gt; is a bit tougher than Halycon, but it shouldn't be much of a problem. He comes immediately after the fight from the hallway ramp upon which you entered, so the casters at the back of your group should be ready to move.\nGizrul can drop several blue items, including the Druid set shoulders. \nBy killing Halycon, you complete \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pack%20Mistress\"&gt;The Pack Mistress&lt;/a&gt;\"/\"&lt;a href=\"Put%20Her%20Down\"&gt;Put Her Down&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTo Wyrmthalak.\nWhen coming out of Halycon's nest, you have two options. You can go right and up the wide stairs to clear an optional NPC, &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Zigris\"&gt;Quartermaster Zigris&lt;/a&gt;, who has some extra loot. Zigris always drops 5 Major Healing Potions and 5 Major Mana Potions, he sometimes has the plans for Annihilator, and in his room there is sometimes a chest. On the other hand, sometimes he has the potions, a few coins, and no other loot. So while optional, he's worth the time. Otherwise start pulling from the other door, up the stairs.\nPull a good chunk of the next room (a large room with cracks in the floor and wooden planks to cross them) before going up. Runners are the main killer here. Also, beware of the Evokers, which deal massive damage plus an AoE Knockback and stun. Control them first, and pull back to the hallway if you can. Also, there is usually a chest in this room, so keep an eye open for it.\nKeep pulling a path through this big room, until you can reach the opposite side and go through the door that leads you to the last area, and the last boss.\nOverlord Wyrmthalak.\nKeep going right and up until you face Overlord Wyrmthalak.\nWhen Wyrmthalak dies, don't forget to make everyone check the corpse for a possible Gem, and also check the floor for possible \"Important Documents\".\nThat's the end of the three mainbosses of Lower Blackrock Spire! That means you can farm them at will (they drop nice items), and also work on getting all three Gems for the key to Upper Blackrock Spire. Also, you may need to come back to complete pieces of your main quest.\nOverlord Wyrmthalak's loot list consists of six blue items, including the Hunter set shoulders, and, if you are lucky, a purple item.\n\"But\" - there is one last thing you must face before going out of the instance, you have to save that stupid Trogg, Warosh, and get his mojo back! In short, you have to defeat a very hard script, and Urok Doomhowl.\nFace Urok Doomhowl.\nGo back to the pad with the pile of skulls. You can take a shortcut by jumping down the first crack in the big room with the planks before Wyrmthalak. Move your group to the pad and brief them.\nWhen Omokk's head is placed on the pike in the pile of bones:\nIf you stay alive long enough through those waves of ogres, Urok Doomhowl will appear. He will most likely appear as you already are overwhelmed by ogres. But do not panic! He can be sheeped, succubus seduced, or even kited, as he walks very slowly so don't fight him until you have dealt with the last remaining ogres. The nuke-pike disappears when Urok spawns too, to spice things up a little more.\nOnce only Urok is alive, fight him. He isn't that hard when he is alone. He hits reasonably hard and fears, but isn't that bad otherwise.\nUpon killing him, Warosh will appear next to you. Loot the Mojo from Urok, and complete the quest!\nUrok Doomhowl's loot table consists of three blue items, including the Shaman set boots."}

Forewarned is forearmed.\nIn general... do not be directly on the tree-house platform when taking the &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Elixir of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you have cleared all the living mobs from the platform, when you take the elixir, you suddenly be exposed to all the time-lost mobs. Fewer of the time-lost are on the bridges, so that is a much better place to take the elixir when preparing to attack.\nYou need to be under the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Elixir of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; in order to see and interact with the Talonpriests. The elixir persists through death.\nHowever, if you are in a group with someone killing the Talonpriests, you need not have the elixir effect on you in order to get credit for the kill... but you will be unable to affect the Talonpriest itself.

A non-protected variant, InsecureActionButtonTemplate, was added in &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.2.0\"&gt;Patch 7.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, and allows protected actions to be performed only while combat lockdown is not in effect.\nCreating a SecureActionButton.\nTo create a SecureActionButton, simply create a button that inherits from the SecureActionButtonTemplate; to make the button instance useful, specify interesting attributes. This can be done in both XML, Lua and a mix of the two:\nUsing XML:\n &lt;Button name=\"myButton\" inherits=\"SecureActionButtonTemplate\" parent=\"UIParent\"&gt;\n &lt;Attributes&gt;\n &lt;Attribute name=\"type\" value=\"action\" /&gt;\n &lt;Attribute name=\"action\" value=\"1\" type=\"number\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Attributes&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\nUsing Lua:\n local btn = CreateFrame(\"Button\", \"myButton\", UIParent, \"SecureActionButtonTemplate\")\n btn:SetAttribute(\"type\", \"action\")\n btn:SetAttribute(\"action\", 1)\nMacro Example in Lua:\n local macroBtn = CreateFrame(\"Button\", \"myMacroButton\", UIParent, \"SecureActionButtonTemplate\")\n macroBtn:SetAttribute(\"type1\", \"macro\") -- left click causes macro\n macroBtn:SetAttribute(\"macrotext1\", \"/raid zomg a left click!\") -- text for macro on left click\nModified attributes.\nSome attribute may change value based on whether a particular combination of modifier keys is held down and/or a particular button is being clicked. Those attributes are typically called modified attributes, and are resolved by the SecureButton_GetModifiedAttribute function.\nThe \"modified attribute\" name takes the form of: modifier-name-button. The modifier is one of \"alt-\", \"ctrl-\", \"shift-\", or a combination of them in \"that\" order, and the button is a normally number from 1 through 5 or hyphen followed by an arbitrary string. Both the prefix and the suffix can be \"*\" to signify no regard to the modifier/button; \"*attribute*\" is thus equivalent to \"attribute\". Some examples are shown in the table to the right; both the modifier and the button must match the click details in order for the attribute value to be used.\nPlease note that non-default button clicks (this includes right-clicks) need to be registered with the actual button, by means of &lt;a href=\"API_Button_RegisterForClicks\"&gt;Button:RegisterForClicks()&lt;/a&gt;.\nA limited precedence order is defined by the Frame:&lt;a href=\"API%20Frame%20GetAttribute\"&gt;GetAttribute&lt;/a&gt; method.\nButton remapping.\nSecureActionButtons are also able to change the button being clicked in response to whether your target can be assisted ([help]) or attacked ([harm]) by you; the two relevant attributes are \"helpbutton\" and \"harmbutton\". The value of those attributes, should they match, will be used as the button to resolve the \"type\" and other required arguments.\nFor example, suppose we wanted to create a button that would alter behavior based on whether you can attack your target. Setting the following attributes has the desired effect:\nIf the button is remapped by the \"harmbutton\" or \"helpbutton\" attributes, the value of the \"unit\" attribute is reevaluated with the new button suffix: it is therefore to make a button that would check the hostility of one unit, and perform a reactive action on an entirely different unit.\nAction types.\nThe action the SecureActionButtonTemplate-inheriting frame actually performs is dependent on the value of its \"modified\" type attribute, and possibly additional attributes specific to a type. \nThe table below lists all valid type values and the attributes they use to perform their actions. All relevant attributes can be modified as previously described; and, to the extent possible, all types respect the \"unit\" attribute for targeting. Generally, variable names are used to refer to the value of the modified attribute sharing their name.\nAdditionally, the \"target-item\" or \"target-bag\", \"target-slot\" attributes allow you to create a button that would target a specific item in your inventory for a spell being cast. This targeting is performed after the main type processing, and only if a spell is currently being targetted. It is therefore possible to create a button that would cast a specific spell on a specific item by setting the relevant attributes. For instance, to disenchant an item in bag 1, slot 1:\n btn:SetAttribute(\"type\", \"spell\");\n btn:SetAttribute(\"spell\", \"Disenchant\");\n btn:SetAttribute(\"target-item\", \"1 1\"); -- (\"bag slot\")\nOther attributes.\nA few more attributes can affect how the button functions:"}

{"id": "147076", "revid": "612753", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=147076", "title": "Secure Execution and Tainting", "text": " \nThe User Interface API mandates human decision-making, particularly in combat, by protecting many functions from insecure or tainted use. This security model was largely introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0\"&gt;Patch 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and has been a cornerstone of the API ever since.\nTaint.\nWhen WoW begins executing Lua code, the execution starts off 'secure' and able to run protected functions in all situations. Execution remains secure until it encounters 'taint' - which is an indicator that a function or object came from an untrusted source (AddOn or /script). The basic idea is that execution becomes 'tainted' as soon as it reads data or code introduced by a third party, and any new data written by already-tainted execution becomes also tainted. If an AddOn spreads taint to important game functions, it will prevent them from working (especially in combat). Taint remains for the rest of the game until the player relogs or reloads the interface, which can be crippling because protected functions will refuse to operate if they detect a potentially insecure execution path.\nWhen the UI first loads, all code and data from Blizzard signed FrameXML and AddOns (plus their saved variables) is secure, and all code and data from third-party AddOns (plus their saved variables) is tainted. \nWhat can be tainted?\nAll Lua values and references can be tainted - local variables, global variables, table keys, table values: \nFunction closures can also be tainted, executing a function closure applies its \ntaint to the current environment. \nSecurely post-hooking.\nTaint is inherent to third-party code, but the API provides two powerful functions to avoid spreading taint to protected game functions:\nProtected frames and secure templates.\nWoW 2.0 also introduced a new Frame concept, protected frames, which can bypass interactivity restrictions during combat. However, the caveat is that these must be created and pre-programmed while out of combat using pre-defined attributes. Once combat begins, the game will manage showing, hiding, sizing and positioning the frames in accordinance with whatever attributes had been previously set. The attributes allow for some logic, but limited to a narrow set of rules that ensure practical human involvement. Notwithstanding, &lt;a href=\"Secure%20code\"&gt;Secure code&lt;/a&gt; is a special case that may bypass these restrictions for additional (but still limited) functionality in combat. \nOnce a frame has been declared protected it cannot be made unprotected, and protection is generally inherited from specially designed templates such as &lt;a href=\"SecureTemplates\"&gt;SecureTemplates&lt;/a&gt; (basic capability introduced in Patch 2.0) and &lt;a href=\"SecureHandlers\"&gt;SecureHandlers&lt;/a&gt; (expanded capability introduced in Patch 3.0).\nControl restrictions on protected frames are also applied to their parents and any frames they are anchored to. This is important when anchoring a protected frame to another normally non-protected frame, as it can lead to unexpected and often undesired behavior. This propagation is temporary, and re-anchoring or re-parenting the frame out of combat can release the restriction. \nProtected frames are important because they form the basis of the Blizzard action and spell buttons, but also because they allow for some new secure button templates. Since normal AddOn code is tainted, it cannot change targets or perform actions directly, however WoW 2.0 contains a number of secure templates which can be inherited by AddOn code. These secure templates provide one or more secure handlers, usually OnClick, that use frame attributes to perform actions. When a secure template is inherited then any handlers it defines remain secure unless they are overridden by the inheriting frame (or another template). \nThe secure templates are configured using frame:SetAttribute() methods pertinent to each template, but only outside combat. AddOns should check before creating secure frames, setting their attributes, or reconfiguring their attributes.\nTerminology.\nSince there are a number of similar concepts at work here, the terminology can \nbe confusing, here's a summary of the common terms and their meanings: \nImpact on gameplay.\nSecure execution profoundly limited what addons could do beginning with Patch 2.0, and was widely perceived as necessary to protect gameplay from cheating. Before this security model, addons were capable of vastly automating gameplay by choosing who to target and what spells to cast. \nFor example, before an addon might choose what spell (and what rank of that spell) to cast after any left click. Since Patch 2.0, this addon can cast one spell after a left-click and another after a right-click, but the human player must decide which button to click. The addon could still suggest a spell to the human player (by displaying information on the screen) but not make any decisions on the player's behalf.\n uses the modern API, including secure execution and tainting. Consequently, addons cannot perform the blatantly harmful automation in Classic that was technically possible in Vanilla."}

{"id": "94941", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=94941", "title": "Security guide", "text": "Introduction.\nWhilst the WoW game itself is relatively safe, there are several things you can do to protect your account, and information you have on your PC, from people who want to steal it. WoW accounts sell for a considerable sum on the black market. Thieves do not care that you spent five years getting a full set of top-tier gear on every character - they will sell it for the few pieces of gold they can get and transfer the money to gold farmers to make real-world money.\nSome of the things you can do to protect yourself are:\nIf this seems like a lot of effort, remember how long it took you to get all the gear you now have. Note also that it can take up to three weeks to get an account banned for botting and spamming (by the hacker) back. Some of your gear may never be retrieved completely. If the worst happens, then &lt;a href=\"%23Contact_Blizzard\"&gt;Contact Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; as soon as you can.\nKeyloggers will also have been after your log-in details to payment sites (such as PayPal), shopping sites (such as Amazon) and your bank and credit card details, so you may lose money in real life too.\nThe information on this page will never mean that your are 100% safe, as criminals are always coming up with new ways to \"beat the system\". However, like the camper who stopped to put on running shoes when his friend was already running from the bear, if you follow at least some of this advice, you will have a better chance.\nKeep your computer safe.\nKeep your computer updated.\nComputer programs are complex things, written by fallible human beings. As such they may contain unintended flaws. One of the most frequently used ways of getting malware onto a computer is to exploit one of these flaws.\nAs a consequence, the companies, or, in the case of Unix and Linux, the communities, who offer these operating systems (literally the programs that operate your PC), have to issue updates (patches) to fix them. These may address urgent security flaws, that could allow a criminal to craft a web page that could install malware (malicious software) on your PC. Or they may be fixes to things like drivers (pieces of code that drive a piece of hardware to do something) for your peripherals (such as your monitor or printer) or internal hardware (such as your graphics card or hard disk) that make your game go wrong. Every couple of years, the company may bring out a major new version, such as Windows 7, or Vista from XP. Typically they will have better security, but, may also introduce new faults too. Good advice is \"never install version x.0 of anything\". For Windows, when Service Pack 2 is issued, most of the major holes will have been addressed.\nMalware used to be typically written to show off a cracker's skills, or cause damage by corrupting or deleting a user's files. However, as broadband access became widespread, criminals realized that it was much easier to spy on a person's computer as they typed passwords into their banking website than to rob a physical bank.\nThough it is often claimed in forums that Apple and Linux users are \"safe\", this is increasingly being challenged as criminals realize that these users have grown accustomed to being lax about security. Vista's claim to be \"more secure than previous versions\" has also come into dispute in a recent survey of malware infestations.\nConsider using software such as the free &lt;a href=\"https%3A//psi.secunia.com/\"&gt;Personal Software Inspector&lt;/a&gt; to check all your other software is up to date. A full scan from a security suite such as will also advise you of software with known vulnerabilities.\nWindows Updates.\nMicrosoft tend to issues weekly on \"Patch Tuesday\" but may release urgent fixes to address serious flaws at any point. If you trust Microsoft to get fixes right most of the time, or cannot be bothered with security stuff, then set Windows to automatically update with the latest patches as follows:\nIf you are less trusting of Microsoft's ability to generate fixes that work and do not break something else, then you can choose a different setting.\nMac OS-X Updates.\nMac OS X has a software update tool:\nFor help on updating your Apple Mac, including how to set it to run automatically, see the Apple website &lt;a href=\"http%3A//docs.info.apple.com/article.html%3Fpath%3DMac/10.5/en/8514.html\"&gt;\"Mac OS X 10.5 Help\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nLinux.\nIf you are running WoW on Linux, you are probably technical enough to know how and why to update it. Otherwise, contact your Linux provider for information on how to download and install updates.\nOther software to update.\nIf you do not have version checker software, then check regularly for updates to:\nTypically the software will have an option under Help to \"Check for updates\".\nInstall good security software.\nThere is absolutely no need to purchase anti-virus software. There are some free alternatives out there that are excellent choices and will do a very good job of protecting your system. Just because you paid money for it doesn't mean it's good. Remember, a good anti-virus program is but one tool in your arsenal to keep your computer bug free. \nNecessary software.\nAs a minimum you will need:\nIdeally you should also have something to check for spyware, which, though it may not harm your computer, tends to send more personal information than you have authorized back to the company that created it. In the worst-case scenario, it may cause system instability , steal your email address resulting in spam, or result in Identity Theft (where someone pretends to be you and opens bank accounts in your name, or even redirects your post). Anti-spyware will also check for which slows your computer down and intrudes by popping up windows to their adverts. Typically these anti-spyware softwares are free, but they do require you to run and update them manually unless you buy a paid-for version.\nIf you think your computer is secure, and you do not need the hassle, try these tests:\nAntivirus.\nAs the best software changes annually, see for an up-to-date list and reviews.\nYou may want to look for anti-virus software with a games mode, such as GameSafe. Whilst these will not afford as much protection as a full anti-virus suite, they are designed to minimize the impact on game play. For example, when gamer mode is switched on, pop-ups will be disabled, and the update to virus signatures will be postponed.\nFirewalls.\nAs the best software changes annually, see for an up-to-date list and reviews.\nAnti-Spyware.\nTwo of the best programs are also free:\nSecure your router.\nIf you have wireless enabled, a default on most routers (the box that sits between your computer and the telephone line), then you need to ensure that it is less likely to be hacked either by your weirdo neighbor (search for what happened to Matt Kostolnik in the USA...) or by a drive-by hacker. This will also ensure no-one else is stealing your bandwidth for a faster gaming experience!\nThis requires administrator access to your computer.\nThe following is for Windows 8. Other versions and operating systems you will need to read the manual or search the internet for how to configure your router.\nUpdate the driver.\nFrom the Network and Sharing Center\nFor further steps you can take to secure your router, see \nCreate a low-privilege account.\nWindows allows you to create multiple accounts on a device. It is good practice to keep a separate account that has the highest privileges (an Administrator account) and use a low-privilege one for daily use on the internet. This will reduce the ability of malware to install bad software on your device. \nMake sure this Administrator account has a strong password (at least 12 characters using a combination of lower case, upper case, numbers and characters e.g. Th1$1$a$tr0ngPw0rd).\nUse the administrator account to update or install new software and run a weekly full virus scan. Use the low privilege account for everything else.\nIf you do not know how, for Windows 10, search for WindowsCentral \"How to use Windows10 non-admin and why\".\nTurn Off Auto-Play.\nWhilst convenient for music and videos, it also allows bad actors to install malware via pirated or fake or (rarely) manufactured software/music discs or copied from a friend's PC. Malware can also be installed simply by plugging in a USB stick used elsewhere on an infected PC.\nFor Windows 10:\nYou can also use the Administrator account to set this up as a group policy. Search for \"TechRepublic How to disable AutoPlay and AutoRun in Windows 10\" for details.\nUse WoW safely.\nRun WoW using the launcher.\nUse launcher.exe rather than wow.exe to run World of Warcraft. \nThe launcher that can catch some viruses/trojans&lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml%3Flocale%3Den_GB%26amp%3BarticleId%3D19644%26amp%3BpageNumber%3D1%26amp%3BsearchQuery%3Dlauncher\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that you may not know that you have on your computer. One primary example is trojan-downloader.win32.agent that was found on many computers using the Launcher.exe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D81960523%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. \nUse a strong password for your account.\nThink of the password as the key to unlock your account. If it is too simple, it is easy to pick the lock. Words from a dictionary, pets names, birthdays and \"password123456789\" are all easily guessable, or, with software, can be fired at a website by a botnet (massive networks of malware-infested PCs, thousands of them) until the password is cracked. A strong password, like a strong lock, means the thieves are more likely to be detected trying to break in, so will move on to easier pickings.\nA strong password is:\nRemember:\nUse a Blizzard Authenticator.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Blizzard_Authenticator\"&gt;authenticator&lt;/a&gt; is a small key-fob device that gives you a One Time Password (OTP) to enter in addition to your normal password, thus ensuring the user has something as well as knows something. These are cheaply available from the Blizzard store. Note that they are not infallible - you still need to keep your PC free of key-logging malware. These trojans, such as emcor.dll, can intercept the code you type in, tell you that you have \"entered an invalid code\" and send the real code, along with your user name and password, to a thief working in real-time. This is called a \"man in the middle\" attack.\nUse a separate email address for Blizzard.\nWith the merger of accounts into BattleNet, you will now have to use an email address to log into WoW. It is highly recommended that you set up a separate email address to use for, and only for, logging into WoW and getting eMails from Blizzard.\nClear stored fields and files.\nBe aware that this e-Mail address may be recorded if you use a public computer, so if you HAVE to use one to read Blizzard eMails or run WoW, (or you use a laptop that might be stolen) then:\nUse Real ID sparingly.\nThe only exception to the \"never tell anyone your e-Mail address for log-in\" is that Blizzard have decided this is what you have to share to use the &lt;a href=\"Real%20ID\"&gt;Real ID&lt;/a&gt; feature. This removes one level of security for your account log-in so ONLY share it with people you know in the real world (and trust) as it is ALSO your account ID.\nInstall Blizzard Updates via the Launcher.\nBlizzard have supplied a &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Launcher\"&gt;launcher&lt;/a&gt; which should automatically download and install updates for you. This is particularly useful when there is a large patch as they typically make it available in sections which can be downloaded over several days, thus reducing the impact on your PC and their server. More information is at the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml%3FarticleId%3D21070%26amp%3BsearchQuery%3Dblizzard%2520launcher%26amp%3BpageNumber%3D1\"&gt;Blizzard Background Downloader&lt;/a&gt; FAQ and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faq/blizzarddownloader.html\"&gt;Blizzard Downloader&lt;/a&gt; FAQ.\nHowever, there are times when the background downloader does not work. This seems to be an issue with Windows Vista users who allowed Blizzard to automatically create the Public &gt; Games &gt; World of Warcraft directory, though it also occurs with Windows XP users. Blizzard believe it could be conflicting background applications, though its advice on closing background services requires more technical knowledge of Windows XP or Vista to carry out safely than most non-expert PC people have. The advice on updating Windows is relatively sound. Or it could be a problem with security software conflicts, or the downloader itself. One option to try is to backup the entire directory to a removable hard drive, delete the original and create a new c:\\users\\public\\games\\World of Warcraft directory from the administrator account. There are other issues and solutions scattered through the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.blizzard.com/support\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.blizzard.com/support/index.xml%3FgameId%3D11%26amp%3BrootCategoryId%3D2088\"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; support pages and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wow-europe.com/board.html%3FforumId%3D11079%26amp%3Bamp%3Bsid%3D1%26amp%3BST%3DEU-2340670-cS26EooEmpSGNsLFk2GaEURkLrwVnpJtFWU\"&gt;EU Technical Support Forum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you find you are still unable to download the patches, having followed all the forum advice, then the best option is to copy the WoW-n.n.n.nnnn-to-m.m.n.mmmm-enGB-downloader.exe file from a computer or user you trust to have a \"clean\" PC. Run your own virus checking software on the download media or email before your copy it across. Running this should download the patch direct. There are many mirror sites listed (including those on Wowpedia) but these have frequently been attacked by crackers, with the purpose of installing malware to capture account information. Use these only as a last resort, and check any listed URL by copying it and running a Who-Is query at a reputable site, such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//network-tools.com/\"&gt;Network Tools.com&lt;/a&gt;. Note that you may have to remove the \"http://\" part if the site requires it and leave just the first main part (up to and including, for example .com or .org or .co.uk). The second complication is obfuscated URLs. If the URL contains the \"@\" character or \"%40\" then it will redirect you to the site after those characters. In short, if you are not sure it is safe, do not use it and contact &lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml%3FarticleId%3D22330\"&gt;Blizzard Technical Support&lt;/a&gt; for help.\nNever share your account.\nBlizzard is very strict on this:\n\"Blizzard does not recognize the transfer of WoW Accounts or Blizzard Accounts (each an \"Account\"). You may not purchase, sell, gift or trade any Account, or offer to purchase, sell, gift or trade any Account, and any such attempt shall be null and void.\" and\n\"You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the Login Information, and you will be responsible for all uses of the Login Information, whether or not authorized by you.\"\nThis includes the use of \"power leveling\" services, sharing with a friend or spouse, etc due to the risk of the account being compromised, the contents sold and emptied (either to earn real-life money or for revenge). This costs Blizzard time and money to resolve and takes away time from legitimate users of the game who have to wait longer for legitimate issues to be resolved. The consequence of Blizzard finding you responsible for account sharing ranges from a temporary ban through to deletion and permanent closure of the account with no restitution. &lt;a href=\"Gold%20buying\"&gt;Gold buying&lt;/a&gt; may also result in account compromise, banning when discovered, or, worse, misuse of your credit card, or even identity theft.\nException for minors.\nThe ONLY exception allowed is if you are an adult, you are allowed to open account on behalf of a minor child (in the UK this is below age 18, may vary by country).\n\"You agree to these Terms of Use on behalf of yourself and, at your discretion, for one (1) minor child for whom you are a parent or guardian and whom you have authorized to use the account you create on the Service.\"\nBe wary of in-game whispers from Blizzard etc.\nScammers will try and direct you to sites with malware on them by promising free mounts or cheap gold or telling you your account will be banned.\n\"I was just contacted in-game by a Game Master for my password!\" Games Master whispers ALWAYS appear in a separate chat window, and you will see the Chat Request flashing in the top right of your screen. \nIf anyone whispers you more than once claiming to be a GM, or offering paid-for services, right click on their name and report them for spam. \nAlso be wary of:\nThey often copy the site, such as the battlenet login page, to make it look like one, then exploit any vulnerabilities in your browser to download malware, so ALWAYS check the site name carefully. If you \"must check it out\" then install McAffee site advisor and search for the site first.\nSurf the web safely.\nThe internet has been likened to the Wild West, travel at your own risk. So how do you protect yourself better?\nLook where you are going.\nNot all web page links point to where you think they are heading. Take for example &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha\"&gt;Th\u00eds Link to a joke&lt;/a&gt;.\nHands up if you clicked on it?\nAlways:\nFile extensions.\nInformation is held on computers in files. Under Windows, each of these will have three or more letters at the end after a dot such as file.htm or file.html. This file extension is used to tell the computer what to do with the file, and which program to use to open it. By default, Microsoft hides file extensions on files, but this can be . This default is dangerous, because if someone sends you a file called IKilledYou.jpg, you may think it is a picture, but if file extensions are hidden, and it is really IkilledYou.jpg.exe, it may contain malware which will be automatically run as soon as you open it.\nIn particular be careful of files sent to you, or links with, the following extensions:\nGet a Look-Out.\nConsider installing that warns you if a link may lead to a known \"dodgy\" page. Examples include:\nBeef up your browser.\nConsider changing to another that has a better record of preventing and fixing issues than Internet Explorer, the default browser supplied with your PC. Examples are Mozilla for Windows and Linux and for Mac.\nFor e-Mail and newsgroups, you may want to look at , or which will also integrate your instant messaging.\nInternet Explorer.\nIf you must use IE, make the following changes to IE to improve on the default security:\nFrom now on, you will be asked whether you want ActiveX objects to be executed and whether you want software to be installed.\nSites that you are sure are safe can be moved to the Trusted Zone in Internet Option &gt; Security. Though as servers can be hacked and defaced, it is better NOT to add any sites to this zone, but always prompt.\nIs that e-Mail REALLY from Blizz?\n\"You have been reported for spamming and your account is now on a three day ban. Please click on &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; if you wish to dispute this decision\"\nNow the message \"from\" says it comes from noreply@blizzard.com but the \"from\" can VERY easily be spoofed so how can you tell if the message is genuine ... or not?\nThere are several technical ways of doing it, but firstly, simply try logging in to your account. No ban? The message was not genuine. If you have been banned, then ignore the e-Mail and go DIRECTLY to the Blizzard Account Support pages &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.blizzard.com/support%7CUS\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.blizzard.com/support%7CEU\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http%3A//kr.blizzard.com/support%7CAsia\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you really must follow the link, then right click on it and COPY the link and paste it into your address bar. Does the link have funny characters or extra ones? Does it have a Tiny URL - in which case copy it and use the preview facility: instead of going to http://fat.ly/jdmf32 go to http://preview.fat.ly/jdmf32 for example. However, opinion is divided on the security and privacy of these shortened links , so use with care.\nIf the link is malware, and you want to take a step further report the spammer, then consider joining SpamCop &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.spamcop.net/%7Cspamcop.net\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.\nHackers use clever \"social engineering\" techniques to make you feel worried (\"account banned\") or clever (\"get ahead with this hack\") and do things in a panic that you would otherwise stop and think about. Other types of e-Mails (or in-game whispers) you may receive include:\nALL of these (even if not infested with malware) would break Blizzard's terms and conditions of fair play. They could (and have for other players) resulted in bans or out-right account termination (no more World of Warcraft, bye-bye Level 80 characters...).\nAlso be wary of \"girls\" who woo you in-game, or characters who brag about their achievements, and send you a link to their armory profile, only it isn't the armory, even if the site looks like it.\nMake your e-Mail client safer.\nIf you use Outlook, then turn off Mail Preview for your Inbox folder and right-click on genuine messages to set up Rules to automatically move them to Folders and on the address to add it to your address book. Treat all other e-Mails with caution.\nConsider using a different e-Mail client to Microsoft's.\nTurn off HTML viewing. This will depend on your e-Mail client. Read the Help file.\nCheck that Instant Message.\nApply the same caution when using instant messaging. \nHow do you know it is your friend on the other end, and not his spiteful kid brother who is using his logged in account whilst he is out, or your worst enemy who has found out the password, or even a hacker from Russia or China? One of the most successful social engineering hacks is being carried out by a \"Rasputin bot\" or \"SlutBot\", that pretends to be a lovelorn human male or female.\nWhen using software (IM, Yahoo! Messenger, IRC, mIRC, ICQ, AIM, WLM etc):\nYou may prefer to switch to a different multiple-access IM (readers are strongly advised to check for security issues and reviews before installation!) and change all your passwords regularly. These include:\nSafer websites.\nNote that some of these websites have also been known to have been hacked, and no website can ever be considered truly safe. However when they are, due to their popularity, news of the hack gets out sooner. This list should help you identify real versus spoof sites (check the history page to ensure this page has not been edited!):\nContacting Blizzard.\nIn-Game Game Master Department.\nIf you suspect your account has had a security breach, and are still able to log in, or suspect someone you know has been, then try contacting the in-game &lt;a href=\"GM\"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; by using the red \"?\" icon at the bottom of your screen to create a &lt;a href=\"Ticket\"&gt;Ticket&lt;/a&gt;. This is usually the fastest way to get an account investigated and locked outside of normal working hours.\nIf you are unable to log into your account, for example the hacker has added an authenticator, then you can contact them via the methods listed on the Game Master support pages or the Customer Service Forum.\nFor all other customer or technical support issues, see the appropriate battle.net forum.\nFurther reading.\nFor more information see:"}

He represents the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; tasked them with delivering his orders to his soldiers. Mevix, who was drilling a group of &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Vanguard\"&gt;Chosen vanguards&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Unfallen%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Unfallen's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, was ordered to march west to the &lt;a href=\"Spearhead%20%28Maldraxxus%29\"&gt;Spearhead&lt;/a&gt;, where the Chosen were mounting a defense against the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;' vanguard. Vyraz later moved to the Spearhead to personally command the defense and advocated for a reckless full-scale assault on the Constructs, although Mevix preferred to minimize casualties. The Maw Walker and Mevix managed to push back the Constructs and secure a forward position, from which they launched an attack on the Construct commander &lt;a href=\"General%20Alver\"&gt;General Alver&lt;/a&gt; and killed him. Afterward, Vyraz ordered Mevix and the Maw Walker to launch a direct assault on the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Constructs' stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring Mevix's protest that they needed more reinforcements.\nThe attack resulted in most of Mevix's soldiers being killed and the secutor being wounded. Mevix decided on a change of strategy and told the Maw Walker to play dead so that the Constructs would collect them for parts while he created a diversion and allowed himself to be captured by the Construct soldiers. Inside the House of Constructs, the Maw Walker encountered the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%20Thales\"&gt;Aspirant Thales&lt;/a&gt; and helped him rescue both his allies from &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and Secutor Mevix, who had been imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Chains\"&gt;Hall of Chains&lt;/a&gt;. The secutor noticed that the Constructs had started using new production methods for their &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s and tracked down the disciples of &lt;a href=\"Surgeon%20Stitchflesh\"&gt;Surgeon Stitchflesh&lt;/a&gt; responsible for these efforts while the Maw Walker distracted the Constructs. With the help of a &lt;a href=\"Salvaged%20Praetor\"&gt;salvaged praetor&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walker and their allies broke into the &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Stitchery\"&gt;Flesh Stitchery&lt;/a&gt; and killed &lt;a href=\"First%20Apprentice%20Malkrex\"&gt;First Apprentice Malkrex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sharrex%20the%20Fleshcrafter\"&gt;Sharrex the Fleshcrafter&lt;/a&gt; while they were working on a &lt;a href=\"Soulfused%20Construct\"&gt;soulfused construct&lt;/a&gt; made out of kyrian bodies. Mevix wanted to destroy the construct, but Thales protested that the souls of his brethren still existed within it. The group instead took control of the abomination and used it to wreak havoc on the Construct forces, including by killing &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Halis\"&gt;Baron Halis&lt;/a&gt;, before fighting their way out to &lt;a href=\"Spider%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Spider's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, where the Maw Walker's display of power awakened the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Might\"&gt;Rune of Might&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;the runeblade&lt;/a&gt; they carried. Mevix recognized the weapon as having been forged by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; and left to report back to Vyraz before joining up with the Maw Walker's allies at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he wanted to witness the hero's legend for himself.\nAfter Vyraz was revealed to be a traitor and sent his forces to attack the Seat, Mevix was among those who defended it. The secutor subsequently traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Enclave\"&gt;Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to represent the &lt;a href=\"necrolord\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt;s and point Maw Walkers who wished to join the covenant in the direction of the Seat of the Primus.\nMevix accompanied the covenant forces who invaded the realm of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;. On the orders of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, he led the covenant forces who defended the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Vault of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; while Maw Walkers worked with &lt;a href=\"Tal-Galan\"&gt;Tal-Galan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt; to uncover and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; that the Mawsworn were after.\nThe secutor, alongside &lt;a href=\"Emeni\"&gt;Emeni&lt;/a&gt;, led a detachment of necrolords to &lt;a href=\"Provis%20Esper\"&gt;Provis Esper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; and a Maw Walker recruited Mevix's soldiers and the other covenant forces to help fight through the Mawsworn in the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt; and breach the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; so they could create a new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Deserted%20Overlook\"&gt;Deserted Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, Mevix asked the Maw Walker and Emeni to kill two of the Mawsworn's &lt;a href=\"automa%23Oracle\"&gt;oracles&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from predicting the covenants' movements. After the Crypts were breached, the secutor and other covenant representatives stayed at the entrance to hold the line while the Maw Walker and their other allies explored the Crypts."}

Since &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, it can now only be triggered by damage done by the warlock, though if they have all three dots on the target, a couple of ticks is usually sufficient for detonation. Pet damage does not contribute. Furthermore, detonation also counts as damage that triggers other SoCs, leading to a cascade of explosions that contributes to massive burst AoE.\nTips and tactics.\nIn instances, Seed of Corruption is most effective on large groups of mobs with relatively high health. Detonation will occur more quickly on a mob with full DoTs. If they won't live long enough for a few SoC to detonate, multi-dotting is a better choice.\nWhile soloing, it is difficult to use SoC because of the amount of time required to set up a large cascade, especially when taking spell &lt;a href=\"pushback\"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt;. If the group of mobs is large enough to warrant the use of SoC, it is probably too large for a single warlock to handle."}

While regular battlegrounds randomly select players from numerous realms, premades join battlegrounds \"as a group\". This function can be used to simply allow friends to enjoy playing together, or to arrange for a devastating tour de force from a highly organised and well-equipped team. Premades are typically composed of players with top-end PvP gear, and are capable of overwhelming regular random teams with their communication and pre-arranged tactics.\nWhile technically the term could be used to refer to any group of players that joins a battleground together, in practice it tends to imply a high degree of preparation, organization, gearing and skill. Premades may be groups assembled in order to play &lt;a href=\"rated%20battleground\"&gt;rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, or for the purpose of farming honor or achievements (eg &lt;a href=\"250000%20Honorable%20Kills\"&gt;250000 Honorable Kills&lt;/a&gt;) in regular battlegrounds. Premades may comprise a full complement of players for the battleground, or a partial team, with the remainder comprising players randomly selected by the queuing process. Since participation in rated battlegrounds requires both sides to assemble teams in order to queue (both sides are always therefore technically premade teams, and almost always feature a similar level of coordination and teamwork) the term is mostly used to refer to these groups in regular battlegrounds, or other areas of play.\nSince most battleground teams are composed of random players picked from various servers, premades have a substantial advantage. Players may only realise they are playing against a premade after finding themselves up against a vastly superior team, that swiftly and smoothly counters their every move with coordinated attacks and manoeuvres. The response of many players when discovering they are playing a premade is to suggest that the team throw the match; preferring to intentionally lose the game, in the belief that there is no chance of success against a premade team. When the random and disorganised state of regular battleground teams is taken into account, premades can be considered to represent a substantially unfair advantage.\nWhile some may content themselves with a string of easy victories, many premades are made with the express intention of honor farming. In this type of play, the premade gathers at the other team's graveyard, repeatedly killing their players as soon as they resurrect. This can be a very effective way of accumulating honor and honorable kills, but can be frustrating and tedious for the other team. This play may continue for the duration of the battleground, with the dominant team choosing to delay an easily achievable victory until shortly before the timer expires.\nPremades are most commonly and easily assembled from players of a single realm, often comprising members of the same guild. Players can often spot a premade by checking in the roster for a large number of players from the same realm, although bear in mind that just because players are from the same realm does not mean they have joined as a group. Encountering multiple players belonging to the same guild is also often a giveaway.\nHowever, premades are not limited to single-realm groups. With &lt;a href=\"4.3.2\"&gt;4.3.2&lt;/a&gt;, players were enabled to use &lt;a href=\"Real%20ID\"&gt;Real ID&lt;/a&gt; grouping to join battlegrounds in large raid groups. This has led to the creation of a number of player-matching websites, performing the function of arranging cross-realm premades. This can be argued to have increased the prevalence of premades, especially for large battlegrounds like &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;. These premades often focus on honor farming or earning achievements such as &lt;a href=\"250000%20Honorable%20Kills\"&gt;250000 Honorable Kills&lt;/a&gt;, using tactics such as graveyard farming to trap and exploit the hapless players of the opposing team.\nThe sizeable advantage of premades has been the subject of numerous threads on the official forums, often concerning being trapped in graveyard honor farming. Some players express dissatisfaction that premades are allowed to queue for matches against random &lt;a href=\"pick%20up%20group\"&gt;pick up group&lt;/a&gt;s (PUGs), considering play against other PUGs to be much fairer and more enjoyable.\nAdvantages.\nPremade groups often come with the advantage of routine, and everyone knowing where to go and what to do. Sometimes the premade groups will be from PvP guilds and often come with their own online chat server (eg &lt;a href=\"Ventrilo\"&gt;Ventrilo&lt;/a&gt;) for faster communication and response. Unfortunately, this heavily takes the fairness out of playing the battlegrounds for the other team since they're most likely regular random players whose communication is limited to the chat box.\nAs well as being in constant verbal communication, premades may also pre-arrange tactics and manoeuvres before the game. Certain players may be dedicated flag-carriers or stealth-cappers, while others may split into small groups of ideal composition with specific objectives in mind. Such orchestrated play is in itself an aim of battleground participants, but premades have a sizeable advantage in this respect, achieving levels of coordination otherwise unseen in non-rated battlegrounds.\nDealing with premades.\nIf you are unlucky enough to find yourself playing in a random team against a premade and your group knows it, you'll most likely feel like you are playing as the sacrificial lambs. Players often do not realise they are playing against a premade until they suddenly find the opposite team in possession of all bases, rapidly capping flag after flag or having managed to trap the entire team at the graveyard.\nUltimately, there is little that can be done to directly combat the unfortunate disadvantage of playing on a random team against a coordinated and well-geared premade. Every battleground represents a different balance of players, some resulting in unmitigated disaster and others in ego-boosting victory. Premades simply represent one example of this range of possibilities, albeit one that is extremely difficult to succeed against.\nAlerting your team to the fact that you are playing against a premade can at least help people to understand why they are being so easily defeated, and to not blame themselves or others for the failure of the team. However, be aware that some may respond to this news with frustration, anger or by tirelessly compelling the team to lose on purpose.\nDealing with graveyard honor farming is a slightly different story. Ultimately, if you're enjoying trying to break free of the grip of the other team, by all means play on. If however you're tiring of being farmed unendingly, the best approach is simply to choose not to resurrect. Decline the resurrection invitation and move away from the graveyard. Politely encourage your teammates to do the same, if they wish to end the cycle of farming. Failing that, simply go and do something else for a few minutes. Read a book, or make a drink. All battlegrounds are time limited, and by moving away from the graveyard you are depriving them of your share of the honor. Before long the farming session will be over, and you can return to play.\nIn the end, dealing with premades is the same as dealing with any other team - do your best, communicate with your team, and remember: it's just a game! Do your best to enjoy the game even if your side is losing, and remember that it won't be long until the game is over, and you can queue for another battleground, which is unlikely to also be played against a premade."}

It was created by Lady in order to create a &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;new undead plague&lt;/a&gt; to wipe out the Scourge. Its members are all &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; or other types of undead beings who joined Sylvanas' cause. They are constantly brewing up new plagues and poisons to unleash upon Sylvanas' enemies. The other races of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; believe they are working on a remedy to cure their \"illness\". Members of the Apothecary society are called &lt;a href=\"Apothecary\"&gt;Apothecaries&lt;/a&gt; or Dark Apothecaries.\nNot even the noble steeds that succumbed to the Plague are allowed any rest in the hands of the Forsaken. Through an arcane mix of alchemy and necromancy - the Royal Apothecary Society has raised numerous &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20horse\"&gt;fallen steeds&lt;/a&gt; to serve as mounts for the vengeful dead.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nThe Royal Apothecary Society was created after &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt; impressed Sylvanas with his conviction and declaration to use the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; that had created the Forsaken and tame it as their own. She subsequently made him the Grand Apothecary and ordered for him to seek out &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; in order to receive whatever or whoever he required to craft this &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMost member &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s in-game will have the &lt;a href=\"title%23Mobs_and_NPCs\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; . The members of the society could be doing experimenting or requesting that adventurers gather supplies so that they could continue their work.\nMembers of the Society collected samples of &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt;s for study.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nA few Forsaken apothecaries are present in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt; force, and others accompanied the Horde forces on the shattered realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to determine how the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s both in order to understand their betrayal, and to ensure the orcs of the Horde would be safe from that corruption.\nArthas: Rise of the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; showed the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;'s effect as two prisoners, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; female and a &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt; male drank it and decomposed. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was pleased with this result, but warned Faranell that the blight should never fall into the wrong hands.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken dealt with curing the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Scourge's plague&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; pledged itself to destroy the Scourge's &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es.\nDuring the war against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; the Forsaken's own plague was refined and became lethal to both the living and the undead, being called the Blight or &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;. Although it could only kill and not yet raise the dead. In the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken apothecaries of &lt;a href=\"New%20Agamand\"&gt;New Agamand&lt;/a&gt; tested their New Plague and it turned the land around the town dead and brown in the otherwise verdant landscape. They also used the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; village named &lt;a href=\"Halgrind\"&gt;Halgrind&lt;/a&gt; as a testing ground. The remaining vrykul inside, while not dropping dead from exposure, found themselves trapped and slowly killed.\nBefore it could fully be perfected a faction of the Royal Apothecary Society led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; used the Blight against the Horde, Alliance, and Scourge forces during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. In the confusion the rebel Forsaken were able to capture Undercity with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. Both Alliance and Hordes separately fought their way into Undercity, the Alliance finally killing Putress while Horde forces managed to kill Varimathras and reclaim Undercity.\nAfter reclaiming Undercity &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron Guard&lt;/a&gt; were posted in the Undercity by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep an eye on the Forsaken and specifically the Royal Apothecary Society, and possibly limit the work done by the Royal Apothecary Society if they deem it to be dangerous. Alchemists are warned by the Kor'kron to beware and to not try anything suspicious. The use of the full strength Blight has also been outlawed by the Horde, although a weaker version of the Blight has still been utilized and research still seems to continue into perfecting the Blight. &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; holds that Putress and the rest of the rebels were an anomaly and hopes that the Royal Apothecary Society can regain the trust of the Horde in time.\nEdge of Night.\n&lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Lydon\"&gt;Master Apothecary Lydon&lt;/a&gt; oversaw the attack on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; during Sylvanas' absence. Lydon attempted to dissuade the warchief from using the Forsaken people to form a ramp of bodies for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s main advance and proposed to use the new blight instead. This merely served to agitate Garrosh. \nLater, as Sylvanas dreams of the Forsaken's defeat, she observes Lydon's futile attempt to arrange a last defense of the Forsaken at the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIt is unknown if the Blight will ever be completed, since there is little need to use it as anything more than a weapon now that Sylvanas has enlisted the aid of the val'kyr in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat in Northrend.\nSylvanas had the plague released upon &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Winna_Hazzard\"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt; of the Royal Apothecary Society at &lt;a href=\"Bloodvenom%20Post\"&gt;Bloodvenom Post&lt;/a&gt; sought to employ &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Ooze\"&gt;tainted ooze&lt;/a&gt; against the Alliance.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Furrows\"&gt;Apothecary Furrows&lt;/a&gt; allied with the satyr &lt;a href=\"Zenn%20Foulhoof\"&gt;Zenn Foulhoof&lt;/a&gt; and studied the demon's handiwork, seeking to weaponize his corruption. Furrows noted that Foulhoof's corruption embeds itself deep within living tissue and is extremely contagious when spread via food chain.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Society is likely no longer controlled as the Kor'kron guards are no longer in Undercity. For reasons unknown, the body of &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Kraggosh\"&gt;Overseer Kraggosh&lt;/a&gt; is in a cage in Society's Apothecarium.\nLegion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Kraggosh\"&gt;Overseer Kraggosh&lt;/a&gt; and his overseers moved into the Undercity, the Royal Apothecary Society was forced to do their real work in secret. Such an arrangement inevitably led to Faranell and his alchemists working in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; in the sewers of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. They seem to conduct experiments on an encaged &lt;a href=\"Stonevault%20Rockchewer%20%28Legion%29\"&gt;Stonevault Rockchewer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Leper\"&gt;Seething Leper&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Sheep\"&gt;Elwynn Sheep&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nFaranell's &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Eater\"&gt;plague eater&lt;/a&gt; was a key component in the liberation of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, with the master apothecary becoming a member of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt;. Several members of the Society then returned to Lordaeron.\nSpeculation.\nThe speech of &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Hummel\"&gt;Apothecary Hummel&lt;/a&gt; may indicate that the undead of &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Chemical%20Company\"&gt;Crown Chemical Company&lt;/a&gt; were formerly part of the Society.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nOriginally based in the Apothecarium in Undercity, the Royal Apothecary Society was active in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be found in Outland, and Northrend. Wherever there are Forsaken, there are Society members. Undead tinkers, rogues and wizards continued their studies of science to eradicate the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; from the area. When Lady Sylvanas shrugged off the control of &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the Scourge and began to free the Forsaken, they staked out an area of Lordaeron for their own and attempted to exist in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron City&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken burned with a desire to eradicate the Scourge, seeing it as the reason behind their undeath and misery. Attacks from humans forced them to realize they truly had no friends in this harsh post-war world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the Scourge were their greatest enemies; both refused to let the Forsaken exist as they are. When the Scourge began attempting to control Lady Sylvanas' subjects after she had freed them, she knew drastic measures were needed to protect the Forsaken's way of existence. The Scourge had a limitless supply of warriors: any mortal they killed could be raised as an undead to be controlled. The Forsaken do not have that level of necromantic power at their disposal, and the Lady realized she needed another way of dealing with the threats. Then she discovered that mortals, particularly the zealots of the Scarlet Crusade, did not believe that the Forsaken were not like the Scourge, and destroyed any undead they found regardless of affiliation. When her scouts didn't return from their missions around human territory, Lady Sylvanas correctly assumed the worst and began making plans for defenses against humans as well.\nThe Forsaken queen initially chose two brilliant minds to lead her new Apothecary Society. Faranell, a human wizard who excelled in magical potion creation, and Oni'jus, a half-elf infiltrator who was a master of mundane poison concoction (and whose idea it was to add \"Royal\" in front of their fledgling group's name). A dwarf tinker, , later rounded out her three leaders, with Faranell leading the three. They were set to build a society dedicated to researching ways to protect the Forsaken from both mortal and Scourge attacks using toxins and poisons. Lady Sylvanas has ordered her Master Apothecary to construct a plague to match the one Ner'zhul brought to Azeroth, only killing undead as well as mortals.\nThis impressive feat was initially inhibited in large part because of the lack of necromancers in the Royal Apothecary Society. Yet has the best minds under him working on the problem and they were slowly making progress. At first, their plague killed only mortals without giving them undeath, but Faranell promised results in the future. \nThe Royal Apothecary Society has grown to 3,500 members now. Its top minds are making deadlier and more destructive toxins as Lady Sylvanas works to free more beings from the Scourge's control. The Forsaken, and the Society, are alone in the world, liked by neither mortals nor their fellow undead, but they will fight to maintain their freedom from both.\nThe base of the Royal Apothecary Society is in Lady Sylvanas' Throne Room in the Undercity, where the three leaders can meet with their queen and discuss plans of attack and reported Scarlet Crusade and Scourge movements. The laboratories and testing rooms of the Society are also located in the Undercity.\nDue to repeated failures by the society to make a new plague of undeath, Sylvanas has recruited &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s to find other means of raising slain enemies to her cause. If the society cannot finish their master plague soon, they may find their society disbanded by Sylvanas.\nOrganization.\nThe Royal Apothecary Society is broken into three groups: Research and Development; Testing; and Implantation. R&amp;D is staffed by wizards and rogues with a talent for mixing poisons. They make a variety of toxins from run-of-the-mill nerve gas, delayed poison and flesh dissolving sprays, to more magical potions such as fire potion (which burns the drinker from the inside), and even one that makes the drinker insane, assuming the mannerisms of another race. They are also in charge of roaming the countryside to look for ingredients for their foul concoctions. This group resides solely in the Undercity and reports directly to Master Apothecary Faranell.\nTesting is comprised of the more daring undead, many who were fighters and rangers in their lives. Their job is to scout the area of Tirisfal Glades and Silverpine Forest for subjects on which to test what comes out of R&amp;D. Mortals or Scourge, it doesn't matter as long as they're not Forsaken. They must take these beings alive, and preferably as unharmed as possible, and return them to the Undercity. Here the Testing department applies the various potions the R&amp;D department has concocted, seeing if they have the desired effects. The desired effects are commonly horrific \u2014 the best mortals can hope for is that a potion merely kills them instead of having its intended effect. Quick death is rarely the goal of these vile brews. The Scourge have it a little easier, as potions may commonly have little to no effect, as there is no life to be taken away. However, if they survive a round of tests, they will be present for the next round. It is very unlikely these unwilling test subjects will return alive \u2014 or undead. Master Apothecary Oni-jus heads this area in addition to aiding the R&amp;D department.\nThe third group, Implantation, is dedicated to getting the finished toxins to their target, which is primarily the job of tinkers, rogues and other crafty types. Some devise mechanisms to deliver toxins or design and forge weapons for the job; others have the more dangerous job of administering the toxins personally, wielding the weapons or sneaking into the dwellings of the targets. This group reports to Master Apothecary Brightflame Masjenal.\nMembership.\nThe Royal Apothecary Society originally was created from those Forsaken with poison-concocting skills: wizards and rogues. The Forsaken had no claim to necromancers \u2014 they were all closely guarded by the Scourge \u2014 so Sylvanas freed as many mages and rogues as she could, although they were few and far between. She was best at freeing fighters and barbarians to follow her. Later, the Society became large enough to find places for anyone who felt qualified to join, as the brawnier undead were needed to catch test subjects and the more intellectual were needed to develop the toxins and the delivery mechanisms. As Sylvanas must free every undead she can (being picky isn't an option), the Society is not particular as to who joins. A willingness to work hard, a talent that can be utilized and a deep-seated hatred for the Scourge is all that is needed.\nLady Sylvanas does not prefer one race over another, despite her high elf roots. The Forsaken, and therefore the Society, are mostly human because the undead who existed around Lordaeron City were human. As it grows, dwarves, high elves, half-elves, and even some orcs and trolls have joined the Society. An undead who wishes to join the Royal Apothecary Society only has to inform an existing member, usually identified by an armband with a flask and crown embroidered on it, of their interest. The Society member will inform the leader, one of the Master Apothecaries, who sets up an interview with the interested party. If Sylvanas manages to free a wizard or sorcerer from the Lich King's control, she will invite him or her to the Society herself.\nStructure of the Royal Apothecary Society.\nThe society is led by , and is divided into three departments:"}

Your friend(s) must speak to or and buy multiples of any or all of the following: &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Banana\"&gt;Rotten Banana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Watermelon\"&gt;Rotten Watermelon&lt;/a&gt;, and/or &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Apple\"&gt;Rotten Apple&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou need to enter the queue to brawl an opponent. While in the arena, your friends should use the previously purchased items and throw them at you. You should watch your stacks and time the debuff such that you are at a full 10+ stacks before landing a kill on your brawler opponent. Your friends should be aware to keep throwing the rotten food at you, as the debuff it provides only lasts 20 seconds. Do not use any immunity abilities, as this can cause your debuff to be removed. It should also be noted that this achievement is much easier to earn at the lower ranks, especially since the rotten food can be difficult to aim properly if you are moving too much."}

On more than one occasion, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; led the armies of Stromgarde into battle against Hath.\nSecond War.\nWhile shocked by the traitorous actions of &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;his king&lt;/a&gt;, Hath nonetheless obeyed and stationed his forces so as to not obstruct the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s passage through the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Thoras Trollbane sent his forces to block the Horde from passing through, and after doing so spoke with Hath, convincing the general to ignore Perenolde's orders and remain loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is unknown what happened to him after the war."}

The location is one of the most important in the region for Stormheim's vrykul, and serves as the home of the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; cult. The site is located beside the &lt;a href=\"Runewood\"&gt;Runewood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Fallen%20Kings\"&gt;Field of Fallen Kings&lt;/a&gt;, carved as it is directly into a large cliff face.\nHaustvald serves as one of the very few access points to the realm of &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, the domain of the Sea-Witch &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, which can be reached through a portal in the heart of the complex.\nIn recent times, the Bonespeakers that inhabit the area have abandoned their ancient vows, now choosing instead to practice dark rites from the sacred site. As &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; monstrosities stalk the ruins, Haustvald would turn into a focal point of the conflict gripping Stormheim at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHaustvald has long served as an important site for the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; (and specifically the cult of the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt;) since their arrival on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; ages ago. Along with locations such as &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, it would become central to the locals' honoring of their dead and the worship of their &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;s. Here, an access point to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; could be found, as well as a powerful altar used by &lt;a href=\"mystic\"&gt;mystic&lt;/a&gt;s to reunite the spirit and body of fallen warriors.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the once-sacred complex and its surroundings had become tainted by the darkness which gripped the Bonespeakers. Abandoning their ancient duties and throwing their loyalty behind &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt;, the mystics began desecrating the remains of the fallen, often raising them as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. One such case was that of &lt;a href=\"Ashildir\"&gt;Ashildir&lt;/a&gt;, ancient queen of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt;, whose remains were stolen by the Bonespeakers.\nIn working against Skovald and seeking the aid of Ashildir, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would venture into Haustvald itself, battling the dark forces residing there. As part of this, the Bonespeakers and their perverse creations were targeted. These heroes would also restore Ashildir's remains and eventually journey through the great portal of Haustvald and into &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; itself to confront &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, when &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; dispatched his chosen champions to finally put an end to Helya in her own realm, this forces would once again pass through the ancient complex. Pushing through the forces of Helheim occupying Haustvald, they breached the gateway to Helya's domain."}

Some felt that the instant summoning effect of the spell removed most of the necessity for travel, with single players able to summon whole raids without those players even needing to know the way to the raid entrance. It was feared that this would lead to greater centralisation of players into cities, causing the rest of the game world to become even less populated and players to lose much of the remaining motivation to explore and experience the world outside of cities and instances. Some considered the perk to be yet another concession to 'casual' gamers, accusing &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; of over-simplifying the game and replacing the game world with an endless series of queues. Meanwhile, others welcomed it for its convenience, saving time and trouble spent travelling to locations and making it easier for friends to play together. Its effect upon &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt; was also remarked upon, enabling players to quickly summon several allies to join them in fighting others. This was considered to be useful both for those seeking to attack others, and those seeking to fight back against unexpected attackers, such as when greatly outnumbered or ambushed by higher level characters.\nWith the release of information regarding the upcoming \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, it was announced that Have Group, Will Travel would be removed, \"because the goal in MoP is to emphasize on going out into the world to do stuff.\". In the Mists of Pandaria Press Tour Interview, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Chilton\"&gt;Tom Chilton&lt;/a&gt; stated:\nThis announcement sparked numerous threads from those who felt angered and frustrated by this news, with many who had enjoyed the ease and convenience of the perk unhappy to be losing it. The debate regarding its removal mirrored that surrounding its introduction, with similar arguments presented by both sides. Some players proclaimed its removal to herald a return to world PvP and putting players back in touch with the game world, while others bemoaned the change, accusing Blizzard of attempting to deliberately upset or belabour players, either to increase the time it took them to reach max level, or simply to distract them from a perceived lack of end-game content. Both opinions were well-represented on the forums, but in patch &lt;a href=\"5.0.4\"&gt;5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; the perk was removed, replaced by &lt;a href=\"Ride%20Like%20the%20Wind\"&gt;Ride Like the Wind&lt;/a&gt;. With the removal of Have Group, Will Travel, other summoning options such as warlocks' &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;Ritual of Summoning&lt;/a&gt;, made mostly redundant during the perk's existence, once again became valuable tools."}

The removal of the upper area may have been done to fix the complication issues that prevented it from being playable on launch and given that the upper area was only accessible through a single bridge that spanned across the island, it would have been difficult to move back and forth from the upper and lower areas during an expedition.\nThe region originally had a different color palette that was similar to Gilneas. It included a marshy area, but a large portion of the island was clean and forested with green pine trees. The live version uses a more washed out brown palette to give the entire island a swamp-look, and the green pine trees have been replaced. The island looked far more maintained, with fewer ruined structures and a canal system running down the mountain. The final version does not include the canal system and most of the buildings and stone walls are ruined instead, or damaged. A graveyard was once present on the lower half of the island next to a small settlement. In the live version, the settlement has been expanded, and the graveyard was replaced with more ruins.\nSpeculation.\nDue to being overwhelmed by feral worgen and being a Gilnean settlement, Havenswood's island is probably located close to &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;."}

Havoc should be used on cooldown whenever there are 2 or more targets to attack. Havoc should ideally be used to copy a Chaos Bolt or, if one of the targets is below 20% health, &lt;a href=\"Shadowburn\"&gt;Shadowburn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the primary target of Shadowburn must be below 20% health, Havoc can duplicate Shadowburn's damage onto a target that is \"not\" below 20% health. This tactic, sometimes called \"Shadowburn cleaving\", is useful in raid encounters as it allows you to execute a dying add while also doing extra damage to the boss through Havoc and still gaining the benefit of the refunded and extra &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt;. In the encounters where it is possible, mastering Shadowburn cleaving is a very significant DPS gain.\nShadowburn cleaving can also be used in PvP to finish off a dying opponent while dealing damage to their ally and giving yourself an additional Soul Shard to use to damage the survivor."}

It is illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Cory%20Godbey\"&gt;Cory Godbey&lt;/a&gt;. The story tells of the relationship between the &lt;a href=\"mermaid\"&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Halia\"&gt;Halia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ery\"&gt;Ery&lt;/a&gt;, and of how their love ended up saving the city of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; from a fierce storm early in its history.\nSummary.\nThe first part of the story establishes the setting, describing the still-new town of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; in the oldest days of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and the difficulties faced by its citizens due to the frequent and devastating storms and the lack of a seawall to protect them. This is followed by a description of the &lt;a href=\"mermaid\"&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt;s dwelling near Boralus and of how they undeservedly come to be seen as bringers of bad luck by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOne young mermaid named &lt;a href=\"Halia\"&gt;Halia&lt;/a&gt; loves watching the human ships and becomes infatuated with &lt;a href=\"Ery\"&gt;Ery&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; serving aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Windward\"&gt;Windward&lt;/a&gt;\", who in turn forbids her crew from killing the mermaid. When the \"Windward\" is anchored, Halia starts leaving gifts for Ery in &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;Boralus Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Ery is touched by this and becomes attracted to Halia's beauty as well, and during one voyage sharpens a knife so she can give it as a gift in return. Ery and Halia greet each other in the harbor, kiss, and confirm their feelings for each other. Halia tries to convince Ery to come live with her, claiming that the &lt;a href=\"Mother%20%28mermaids%29\"&gt;Mother&lt;/a&gt; will turn her into a mermaid if she slits her feet and walks into the harbor, but Ery refuses, citing her duties as a tidesage. They agree to keep their love a secret, since Ery would be rejected by her crew if they knew about the relationship.\nThey continue meeting in secret until a great storm comes to Boralus. It does not let up even after several days and threatens to destroy the town. Ery and the other tidesages travel to the river's mouth to try to divert the water, but they falter one by one until only Ery is left. Halia vows to help her beloved, and together they hold back a massive wave coming for the town. Ery states that their job is not yet done, and Halia decides to build a wall while Ery continues holding back the water. Halia's fellow mermaids join her in raising a wall from the seabed with mud and stone. The \"Windward\" arrives and tries to rescue Ery, but she does not come to them, and the crew instead witnesses her rising higher and higher above the water as the seawall is built up beneath her. Many of the mermaids die in the process, their power spent, but Halia returns over and over to ask Ery if the job is done yet. The tidesage eventually collapses from exhaustion and falls into the harbor. The waves crash into the wall, which holds steady. The crew bring Halia and the seemingly-dead Ery aboard. The mermaid slits her beloved's feet and then jumps back into the harbor with her. After a long wait, Ery surfaces, transformed into a mermaid and finally united with her beloved.\nThe story ends with a statement that all of Kul Tiras knows Ery's story and that its people now swear on mermaids as symbols of honor and sacrifice, since they were never seen in the harbor again after the storm. During certain sunsets when the red is reflected in the surface of the harbor, old sailors call it \"Ery's blood\", \"in remembrance of the dutiful tidesage and the mermaid who loved her so faithfully\"."}
