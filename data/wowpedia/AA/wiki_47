{"id": "503109", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=503109", "title": "Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Classic)", "text": "Temple of Atal'Hakkar (also known as Sunken Temple and more rarely, Lost Temple) is a shrine erected by the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai trolls&lt;/a&gt;, led by their master &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, to the nefarious Blood God \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Believing that this was the intended site for Hakkar's reentry into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the great &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and her &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; sunk the temple into the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;...but the dragons did not realize that it was the wrong location until it was too late.\nMany of the bosses in the instance have some kind of prerequisite in order to encounter them. &lt;a href=\"Atal%27alarion\"&gt;Atal'alarion&lt;/a&gt; will appear after activation of statues, &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; can only be reached by killing the 6 &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; mini-bosses, &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Avatar of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; must be summoned and the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; will only be killable after the death of the Prophet.\nThe Temple may be entered by level 35. The mob level range is 45-49, with the final boss being 50.\nHistory.\nThe name Atal\u2019Hakkar can mean either \"Devoted to Hakkar\" or \"In Honor of Hakkar\" in &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;, the language of the trolls.\nGroup info.\nA good group to have for this instance would consist of a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, and three &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;s, preferably one with good &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;. AoE's are very helpful, as there are many packs with non-elites. The instance offers a lot of opportunity for &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; (specifically &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sap\"&gt;sap&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;shackle undeads&lt;/a&gt;, and magic dispels (from priests, paladins, and Resto shamans) make it a lot easier, as there a various negative effects (Fear and Sleep being the most dangerous). One of the three damage dealers should be able to tank, or have a pet that can tank, for the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; fight.\nEach class brings something useful to this instance, and as much depends on player skill and character levels as does group composition. That said, it's very nice to have reliable &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;, good healing from a suitably geared and/or spec'd &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some form of &lt;a href=\"out%20of%20combat\"&gt;out of combat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Resurrection\"&gt;Resurrection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wipe%20Recovery\"&gt;Wipe Recovery&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the most important things to bring to this instance is knowledge of the layout or a good guide/map, as it's very easy to get lost here!\nWalkthrough.\nThe temple is split up into two main sections, separated by staircases (or the deadly hole in the middle of the upper pit), the first is mandatory for completing the main run of the dungeon (where you defeat the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;), whereas the second section is the basement - a completely optional section, however there are two enemies there that have good drops (&lt;a href=\"Spawn%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Spawn of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atal%27alarion\"&gt;Atal'alarion&lt;/a&gt;). Each of these two main sections contains a few floors - the main section has a top floor, a middle section (balconies), and a bottom (the dragon pit area). The basement also has a top and a bottom.\nIf you don't have a lot of time to spare, stick with the main section and focus on the related quests or loot you are looking for (for experience, just explore wherever). However, if you do have time to take on the basement, you'll want to go there first.\nOptional: The Basement.\nFrom the start of the instance, head forward and to the left. Run down to the bottom of one of the stairwells (not the two spiral staircases available from the entrance of the instance). The hallway area you reach is a giant ring around the main floor of the basement; this hallway contains &lt;a href=\"Murk%20Worm\"&gt;Murk Worm&lt;/a&gt;s (aggressive) and &lt;a href=\"maggot\"&gt;maggot&lt;/a&gt;s (), however, the maggots will aggro if you get in a fight so if there are any you can pick off, it's better to be safe than sorry. Note that there is sometimes a rare spawn that patrols this hallway, &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Spawn of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; (it looks like a &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;).\nInside the circular hallway there are tunnels that lead to balconies in the inner chamber. Each balcony contains a serpent statue - by activating the statues in a specific pattern (south, north, south west, south east, north west, north east) you will summon &lt;a href=\"Atal%27alarion\"&gt;Atal'alarion&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to save time here, you'll have to try and minimize the number of groups you take on in the circular hallway (although the running distance to avoid mobs may be just as burdensome).\nAfter summoning &lt;a href=\"Atal%27alarion\"&gt;Atal'alarion&lt;/a&gt;, jump down to the left of the balcony you are standing on and clear the mob and any patrols around you. Heal up, and hop down into the shallow water. Wait for Atal'alarion to move away from the Murk Worms and try to pull them without aggroing him - fighting them together can be painful. He hits hard, so try to stun or CC him and keep your tank over healed (if you have someone with additional healing abilities you may want to use them; potions are also recommended).\nFrom the pit of water, head straight up the stairs, down the hall, and up the spiral staircase back to the entrance of the instance.\nMain area.\nThis is the primary section of the temple, and the place where the boss for the achievement is located. There are many bosses you have to go through before you reach the final one (&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Lor\"&gt;Zul'Lor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gasher\"&gt;Gasher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loro\"&gt;Loro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zolo\"&gt;Zolo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mijan\"&gt;Mijan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hukku\"&gt;Hukku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekkis\"&gt;Zekkis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veyzhak%20the%20Cannibal\"&gt;Veyzhak the Cannibal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazkaz%20the%20Unholy\"&gt;Kazkaz the Unholy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ogom%20the%20Wretched\"&gt;Ogom the Wretched&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreamscythe\"&gt;Dreamscythe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weaver\"&gt;Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hazzas\"&gt;Hazzas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morphaz\"&gt;Morphaz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, and the optional &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Avatar of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;), and trash mobs that vary in difficulty (some can CC you with sleep or fear, both magic debuffs that can be dispelled by priests, paladins, or Resto shamans).\nFrom the entrance to the instance there are two passageways (facing away from the portal, take either passage ahead of you), either one is fine as they both lead to the same place (just remember to go up the stairs first). Once up the stairs you can either go left or right, it doesn't matter, just stick to one direction. Along this circular hallway there will be several mobs, most commonly consisting of a large troll zombie (tank), a priest and/or bloodrinker (healer), and two imps (non-elites). Send an off-tank to attack the healer and the main tank to their tank (remember that you can probably CC one or more of the enemies in each group). At intervals you will see stone blocks with masks on them; these masks mean that if you go down it will lead you to a Protector (one of the six that protect the final bosses of the instance). Most of the protectors are very easy to kill, and will on occasion give some loot (BOP greens). When a mask leads you down stairs on the outside of the ring, clear the mobs at the landing, and then take the hallway on that floor (do not continue down the stairs). After defeating a protector in a location like that, head back up the way you came and continue around the circular hallway in the direct you previously were. Once you have cleared all six protectors, &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; will yell that the shield is broken. This begins the second part of the main instance.\nOnce you kill the final troll protector, jump off of the balcony as a group, preferably tank first. Be ready to fight a group of dragons immediately. Leaving ranged AOE and heals on top of the balcony while fighting is not a good idea, because if anyone pulls aggro, the mobs may rush off towards the stairs and pull additional enemies. Once down, you'll notice that in the center of the room there is a hole. This hole is directly above the shallow pool of water where &lt;a href=\"Atal%27alarion\"&gt;Atal'alarion&lt;/a&gt; appears. Do not fall into the hole. You will end up taking a lot of time trying to get back up, but you will probably die (especially if you are not a mage or priest with the ability to float). If you ever want to go through the hole, make sure you have a party member cast &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Slow Fall (ability)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; on you before you fall (note that you will probably float to one side of the ring, and potentially pull aggro from whatever mob is standing there).\nBefore seeking out &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, you should understand that if you do not kill every dragon whelp and dragonkin in the instance (the guys on this floor), they will attack you during the fight with &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to kill the boss before they arrive to help, however your group will definitely be killed when they arrive.\nJammal'an the Prophet.\nFrom this point, there are three major and four minor bosses left to be killed. One of the three majors, &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Avatar of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, is completely optional and requires a chain quest to be completed (starting with &lt;a href=\"Screecher%20Spirits\"&gt;Screecher Spirits&lt;/a&gt;). The boss order is pretty linear, with &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Avatar of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; available to be defeated at any time. Linearly, first you should start with &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. You can reach him by heading through the southeastern passage of the room (it curves northward into a room of pews). There are at least 7 groups of mobs in the area that you must eliminate. Each group primarily consists of a healer and two undead warriors (CC-able) that must be pulled back to the corner because they can fear you into other groups. This fear is a magic debuff and can be dispelled, and Undead can use &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Will of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to get out of it quickly. Each of these mobs, when killed, will create an aggressive spirit that is immune to all damage and abilities; however each will die automatically after about 30 seconds.\nAfter you have cleared the entire room of mobs, you can take on &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; (level 50) and &lt;a href=\"Ogom%20the%20Wretched\"&gt;Ogom the Wretched&lt;/a&gt; (level 49). Jammal'an is pretty simple to kill but will take a while. Melee DPS or an off-tank should pick off Ogom while the main tank keeps Jammal'an on them the entire time. Kill Jammal'an first, as he has the ability to turn one party member against the rest. After killing both of them, go back out to the center ring and you will see &lt;a href=\"Dreamscythe\"&gt;Dreamscythe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weaver\"&gt;Weaver&lt;/a&gt; flying around.\nThe Dreamer.\nTo awaken the final boss, you'll have to defeat his children, four large green dragons. (It is technically possible to attack the Shade without killing these four, but most normal groups will want to kill them first.) First, take out &lt;a href=\"Dreamscythe\"&gt;Dreamscythe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weaver\"&gt;Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, pulling them back to a spot away from other dragonkin and safely away from the center hole. Keep these drakes turned away from the group, as they have acid spit that can spread across all five members. If you off-tank one drake, keep it turned to one side, away from the main tank and the rest of the group. Kill Dreamscythe first, and then Weaver. These mobs only sometimes drop loot, but can be skinned 100% of the time.\n&lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; is located in the hallway to the south, protected by two more large drakes. Before you head that way, make sure you kill all of the mobs in the center area, and the ones hidden in the small tunnel in front of the staircase back to the entrance (located to the north). There are no dragonkin located in the western hallways, only wind serpents.\nHead to the southern tunnel, and clear out the mobs until you can see &lt;a href=\"Hazzas\"&gt;Hazzas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morphaz\"&gt;Morphaz&lt;/a&gt; flying around. Once ready, pull them back into the hallway, and once again split the dragons up and turn them. These two have the ability to knockback players, so tank them with your back to the wall.\nYou've finally made it to the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, who is sitting alone in a large room. If you didn't clear the entire floor of dragonkin, they will begin running to attack you once you pull Shade. Simply tank Shade like any other dragon, to one side so melee DPS is standing at his stomach and ranged is safely away from his face and tail. This is a long fight so have buffs and heals ready. A priest's Lightwell is extremely useful here. Once Eranikus dies he will give the Essence of Eranikus which begins and finishes a quest in the room, rewarding everyone with the &lt;a href=\"Chained%20Essence%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Chained Essence of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. After finishing Shade, unless you can face the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Avatar of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, your only choice is to go somewhere else. You can either run back to the center area and up the stairs to the north, fall down the pit in the center safely (with slow fall or levitate), or hearth.\nOptional: Avatar of Hakkar.\nIf someone in your group has completed the quest chain beginning with &lt;a href=\"Screecher%20Spirits\"&gt;Screecher Spirits&lt;/a&gt;, they will either have the egg of Hakkar or a special scroll that will allow them to summon him in the room to the west.\nResources.\nSkinning\nLoot.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar%20loot%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar loot (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;."}

It does not necessarily indicate the region of the realm that the player is logged into, but instead the region of the Battle.net portal used to contact the login servers and provide a realm list.\nThis function is mostly reliable except in the case where the user modifies the portal from the login screen after having launched the game client through the Battle.net desktop application. The game client will prefer to use the login server addresses specified by the desktop application over the portal, causing a mismatch between the logged in region and what this function will report.\nRealms located in Taiwan use the Korean Battle.net portal, meaning this function will typically always report the current region as being Korea rather than Taiwan when connected to these realms. Other functions like may however return region IDs that correctly identify Taiwanese realms."}

While the yaungol as a race are usually associated with fire, the Ordon base their entire culture around it. The Ordon worship and are led by &lt;a href=\"Ordos\"&gt;Ordos&lt;/a&gt;, a yaungol &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; who sacrificed himself to the flame to become a &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;. As a threat to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, they are opposed by the recently awoken &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao%20%28faction%29\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt;. They offer rewards such as the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Ashhide%20Mushan%20Beast\"&gt;Reins of the Ashhide Mushan Beast&lt;/a&gt; to those who would kill their enemies (AKA, everyone else).\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; monks of the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; once lived in peace with the Ordon, before the Isle vanished and was lost to the timeways.\nWhen the village of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Pi%27jiu\"&gt;Pi'jiu&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by the Ordon yaungol generations ago, the villagers bravely erected a keg in the center of the village. The following morning, after the celebration had died down, the still-drunken yaungol blearily agreed to a peace treaty.\nCulture.\nYaungol fire-keepers ritualistically set themselves ablaze to emulate the ascension of &lt;a href=\"Ordos\"&gt;Ordos&lt;/a&gt;, and cast enchantments and prayers to ease his pain. Before attacking, the Ordon yaungol will often summon a storm of ash to blind their foes. High-ranking Ordon chanters can control the weather, ensuring that snow and rain never fall on the eternal fires of the &lt;a href=\"Ordon%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Ordon Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Ritualistic sacrifice is a requirement to enter the ranks of the Ordon. Ordon Fire-Watchers carry the ashes of their victims in a special pouch that keeps them smouldering. Followers of Ordos carry small cauldrons of fire with them for long journeys into the wilderness.\nGaining Bloody Coins.\nThose who choose to join the burning ranks of the Ordon, the yaungol followers of Ordos, will have access to the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Censer%20of%20Eternal%20Agony\"&gt;Censer of Eternal Agony&lt;/a&gt;. Using the Censer will flag you for PvP to everyone-even your own faction. Your skin takes on a bright flame effect, showing all around that you've summoned the rage of Ordos and are out for blood. Using the Censer also immediately reduces your health to 10% of its maximum (which you can then heal back up over time), keeping it from becoming a quick ganking device. On PvE realms, the rules of flagging still apply; it won't become open warfare, but players can choose to engage these flagged players if they like. On PvP realms, though, this menacing new threat will certainly be a target for both factions. Finally, when you kill other players while you\u2019re under the effects of the Censer, you'll gain &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Coin\"&gt;Bloody Coin&lt;/a&gt;s, a currency that can be exchanged for exclusive rewards. Bloody Coins are also acquired via world pvp on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; after using a &lt;a href=\"Fire-Watcher%27s%20Oath\"&gt;Fire-Watcher's Oath&lt;/a&gt; to take the form of an Ordon yaungol. Using either item will flag the player for PvP and make them hostile to both factions."}

His flesh is eternally seared with fires, putting him in endless agony. Yaungol Fire-Keepers ritualistically set themselves ablaze to emulate the ascension of Ordos, and cast enchantments and prayers to ease his pain.\"\nStrategy.\nOrdos has a 5 minute enrage timer, in which he will start casting Eternal Agony. The raid as a whole must do at least 2,181,000 DPS to avoid the enrage timer. Tanks should pull him to a corner of the room to allow more room to avoid and reduce the area size of Pool of Fire. Melee stay behind Ordos. Everyone should stay within 20 yards of your tank so that Magma Crush's damage is distributed evenly among all players, as this can kill tanks and melee DPS quickly. Burning Soul will inflict a fire DoT on the target, and the target should move away from the raid, out of the range of Magma Crush if need be, as they will explode dealing fire damage to those around them and get knocked up in the air. This ability is functionally similar to &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt;'s Living Bomb. Pool of Fire is a large AOE fire ring that will deal fire damage to anyone standing in the ring. Pull Ordos to the opposite corner of the arena when this is cast, and don't stand in the fire. The main ability that needs coordination from raiders is Ancient Flame, which will deal fire damage to the nearest player and will place a stacking debuff which increases fire damage taken every 2 seconds. When you get 4 to 5 stacks, have another player step in and take stacks. With proper coordination, 2 people can handle the orb.\nHe has a quick respawn timer, so the raid should leave his area after he is looted.\nLoot.\nPlayers involved in a successful Ordos kill will have a chance of looting one of the following items, and can use a &lt;a href=\"Warforged%20Seal\"&gt;Warforged Seal&lt;/a&gt; for an additional chance. Should players not win loot, they will receive a &lt;a href=\"Flame-Scarred%20Cache%20of%20Offerings\"&gt;Flame-Scarred Cache of Offerings&lt;/a&gt; instead. Players can only receive loot or use a bonus roll for Ordos once a week."}

My partner and I were recently sent up to investigate strange happenings along one of our hunting trails. It was when we approached the graveyard known as &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Hill\"&gt;Shield Hill&lt;/a&gt; that we were attacked by the undead. I was lucky to make it to this camp, but I am uncertain as to what became of Orfus.\nWe parted ways at the Ancient Lift, southeast of here along the cliff edge. Will you go see if he is ok?\nCompletion.\nLunk-tusk lives? At least there is some good news to be had on this day..."}

It replaces the usual ground bases in other zones due to the large &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; presence on the ground. It sometimes engages in battle against the \"&lt;a href=\"Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; gunship. So far, neither have been severely damaged, but both are in constant danger of attack from the other and from the Scourge forces on the ground below them.

In order for engineers to service both balloons, and to prevent them from drifting apart, a large metal catwalk links the two together. While the balloons would appear rather delicate and vulnerable at first, a closer look reveals that solid steel hides beneath the crude fabric. Unlike most goblin Zeppelins, which are prone to malfunction, this gunship bolsters a better use of Goblin mechanics, keeping it from malfunctioning, such as the normal Zeppelins are prone to do.\nJust as the \"Skybreaker\" has a large bomb on board, \"Orgrim's Hammer\" has an enormous main cannon positioned at the front of the craft, beginning nearly halfway to the back of the ship and ending by poking out of the mouth of a large, stone wolf head, positioned at the ship's front. However, just like the Alliance's bomb, the cannon is not used in-game. There is an interesting glitch involving the cannon \u2014 if one flies into the opening and right to the back, they will find themselves stuck, presumably behind a one-way invisible wall \u2014 a spot from which the only way to escape is by &lt;a href=\"hearth\"&gt;hearth&lt;/a&gt;ing.\n\"Orgrim's Hammer\" is also a common sight in the air near the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;Argent Tournament Grounds&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, as its circuit around the frozen wastes takes it through and around the mountains to the southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, the final wing of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt; 5-mans, \"Orgrim's Hammer\" comes to the rescue of Horde players &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Arthas\"&gt;escaping the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; when they become trapped on a platform outside the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Passage\"&gt;Hidden Passage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Orgrim's Hammer\", under the command of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, later becomes involved in a &lt;a href=\"Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;Gunship Battle&lt;/a&gt; with the \"Skybreaker\" in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.

He was also known as the Backstabber by loyalists of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nOrgrim of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrocks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; originally met whilst secreting away as children from the sleeping tent during the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. The two troublesome youths escaped past their sleep time to spy on the clans' councils, only to be severely disappointed. Deciding instead to spend the rest of the night challenging each other, they soon formed a bond that, while technically not forbidden, was considered against tradition by the Blackrock and Frostwolf clans they belonged to. Orgrim and Durotan never stopped being friends. One day, both of these youths would become great leaders. One day, both would change the destiny of the orc race in their own ways. As the clan chieftains had discussed current events and trade agreements, Orgrim and Durotan had challenged each other in feats of strength and willpower. Their rivalry had blossomed into a friendship that would last for many years to come.\nOne summer, the youths met at the border between Frostfire Ridge and Gorgrond. They had been warned not to stray beyond this point, but Orgrim and Durotan were not orcs prone to following the rules. One day while racing each other through &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, Durotan and Orgrim were attacked by a rampaging &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;. Seemingly out of nowhere, a brigade of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; appeared and rescued the young orcs, who spent the rest of the day with &lt;a href=\"Restalaan\"&gt;Restalaan&lt;/a&gt;. Restalaan took the two orcs to &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;, and informed them that the draenei leader, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, was in the town and invited the two to dinner. Due to his lingering injuries, the old draenei was not sure whether his premonitions &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;of doom&lt;/a&gt; had any truth to them, but he was determined to find out. While meeting with Orgrim and Durotan, Velen observed the two orcs carefully. Yet he did not find any darkness stirring in their hearts. Much to the contrary, the youths seemed proud and honest. They discussed their people's histories, Durotan even commenting that he and Orgrim had learned more about the draenei in that period than their entire race had in over a century. They had never been inside a draenei settlement. Few orcs had. They were shocked by the draenei's hospitality, but even more so by the wondrous technology and craftsmanship of Telmor.\nBlackhand's second-in-command.\nSome years after &lt;a href=\"Telkar%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Telkar&lt;/a&gt; died and his &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; was passed onto his son. Orgrim became the wielder of the weapon and in time arose to second-in-command to &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen ogres attacked the Blackrock clan and they faced annihilation, Orgrim returned to the pool of lava where the Doomhammer was forged. Haunted by the prophecy that the last of his line would carry it to doom his people, he hoped to unmake its destiny and keep its power. The &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s were displeased with Orgrim's pride and took back the Doomhammer. Blackhand then somehow helped to retrieve the Doomhammer. The ogres were then defeated, after which he returned the hammer to Orgrim.\nRise of the Horde.\nHe accompanied Blackhand to a summit of the orcish clans near Oshu'gun, where &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; told them that draenei are their enemies and need to be killed. Though Orgrim was internally opposed to the war against the draenei, he followed Blackhand's orders, and even gave in to the blood lust &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; had cultivated. But, like Durotan, he began to wonder if the orcs had been &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;deceived&lt;/a&gt;. The Blackrock warrior had looked on with horror as the magic dried up Draenor's pristine rivers and killed its bountiful forests. Deep down, Orgrim knew that something was amiss with Gul'dan's &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;gift&lt;/a&gt;. Later during the conflict, atop the mountain that loomed near the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan addressed the gathered chieftains. He unveiled a pool of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;smoldering blood&lt;/a&gt;, but he did not reveal its true source. Only a few would hold back from drinking the felblood, including Orgrim and Durotan. To avoid drawing suspicion, Orgrim claimed that he was not worthy to drink from the same cup that Blackhand had; after all, he was but a servant of the Warchief. Orgrim's plan worked. Both Gul'dan and Blackhand saw this refusal to drink as a sign of servitude.\nWhen Blackhand instated &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; battles as a way to get resources during the &lt;a href=\"Dying%20Time\"&gt;Dying Time&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim became a regular victor in these champion battles.\nFirst War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; had been exiled for Durotan's refusal to follow Gul'dan's schemes. While the Horde waged its war, the exiled Frostwolves moved north. They avoided almost all contact with &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s thanks to the aid of the elements. Shortly after the Frostwolves arrived at their new home, the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; gave birth to a boy whom she would name &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt;. The baby's skin, however, turned out green, which made Durotan decide he could no longer stand by and do nothing about the Horde's corruption. &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; called on his shamanic powers to send word to Orgrim Doomhammer. The elemental spirits whispered in the Blackrock warrior's dreams, revealing to him that Durotan was coming south and that he wished to meet at the edge of a land known as &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrgrim did not tell Blackhand of the meeting. Like Durotan, Orgrim had become wary of fel magic, Gul'dan, and Warchief Blackhand. He deplored the banishment of the Frostwolf clan, seeing it as further proof that the Horde's leadership was corrupt. He had also learned of the Shadow Council's existence, and he considered the order dishonorable and manipulative. Orgrim pretended to set up a scouting mission and took only a few trusted guards to Loch Modan, where Durotan was waiting. The Frostwolf chieftain showed him Go'el and explained everything he had uncovered: the mysterious warning he had received before the orcs had gathered at the Throne of Kil'jaeden, his theory that Gul'dan was in league with some dark force that was bent on manipulating the Horde, all that he knew. Orgrim was shaken, but he was not entirely surprised. He told Durotan about something he had seen in recent weeks: the fel energies from Draenor were creeping out from the Dark Portal and into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, this &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; would be as dead as the one they had come &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;from&lt;/a&gt;. Durotan, Draka, and Orgrim agreed that Gul'dan and Blackhand needed to be dealt with at all costs. Orgrim would return to the Horde alone and play along with the leaderships plan for the moment He urged Durotan and Draka to take shelter in the north until he sent word to them. Orgrim commanded his guards to accompany the Frostwolves on their journey home and keep them safe. That was a mistake Orgrim would regret to his dying day. His guards were not loyal to him, but to the Shadow Council and took it upon themselves to kill Durotan and Draka. When a few days passed and Orgrim's guards hadn't returned, the orc grew suspicious. He sent other warriors north to find out what had happened. Orgrim's warriors returned, reporting back to their commander in secret about the traitors' assassination of the Frostwolves. Orgrim was determined to avenge his friends and his people, but he bided his time, waiting for an opportunity.\nOrgrim was also sent by Blackhand to ally with the forest trolls led by &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;. An effort which ended unsuccessfully. Blackhand assigned Orgrim Doomhammer to oversee the construction of an outpost in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. From the swamp, Orgrim then led his troops onward, while crushing any opposition that they encountered. His troops' first real opposition was &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;. With orders from Blackhand, Orgrim's troops razed the village to the ground and left no survivors standing. He was also tasked with leading the orcs into the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; and to kill the renegade band of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Turok\"&gt;Turok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Griselda%20Blackhand\"&gt;Griselda Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; he defended an outpost and dealt with the human attackers. He also led an attack on &lt;a href=\"Sunnyglade\"&gt;Sunnyglade&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the towns &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; were also destroyed.\nToward the end of the war, a surgical strike was launched by the humans to kill the treacherous Medivh. As &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; was assaulted, Gul'dan felt the psychic trauma waves that Medivh emanated and realized that his chance to obtain the power of Sargeras was about to slip out of his grasp. He entered Medivh's mind and attempted to steal the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; while Medivh was weakened and distracted. It was at this moment that Medivh died, and Gul'dan, having been in his mind at the time of death, was thrown into a coma.\nThe second Warchief and the second siege of Stormwind.\nOrgrim Doomhammer believed that his time had come. The Shadow Council was in disarray, and &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was still reeling from the recent failed attack on Stormwind City. Orgrim would have no better chance to attempt to erase the corruption that had damned the orcish people. He challenged Blackhand to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, a duel to the death, calling the Warchief a traitor who had sold his people into servitude to &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;dark forces&lt;/a&gt;. It was not a challenge Blackhand could refuse. No orc could, not without losing the Horde's respect. He could not even have Orgrim assassinated in secret, for Blackhand had relied on the Shadow Council for such tasks.\nPainted with &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; symbols and adorned in oil, the two orcs dueled for hours. Orgrim ended the contest when he crushed Blackhand's skull with his family's weapon, the Doomhammer. The watching orcs knelt before the victor, proclaiming their new leader Warchief Doomhammer. Orgrim spoke to the Horde, telling them that Gul'dan and his warlocks were not what they seemed. Their fel powers were what had killed Draenor. Orgrim declared that he would cleanse the Horde of the foul darkness that had poisoned it. His first step was to outlaw the practice of using fel magic, on pain of death. &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would not suffer &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s fate. Yet the full measure of Orgrim's vengeance would have to wait. After Blackhand's death, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; had fled. Orgrim did not know where they had run to. For now, Orgrim focused his attention on the war with Stormwind. He did not relish the way the orcs would survive was by conquering &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and making it their new home. If they did not defeat their enemies, they would be at the mercy of a strange world. Warchief Doomhammer ordered the clans to prepare for one final assault. They were moving before the sun had set. Stormwind City was conquered by the mighty Doomhammer. The First War was over. The Horde stood victorious. But its Warchief was anything but happy. Orgrim had no means nor the inclination to pursue Stormwind's refugees. The Horde had taken heavy losses to achieve victory, and he knew he needed to secure his conquered land before facing any new enemies. He sent messengers back to Draenor to call up the remaining clans.\nScouring of the Shadow Council.\nOrgrim used that time to consolidate his control of the Horde. His first priority was eradicating the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. Though it was a powerful force, it was the root of the Horde's corruption. Orgrim believed that the Shadow Council was in league with dark forces that were manipulating the orcs and that the warlocks' obsession with fel magic was what had killed Draenor. On a more personal level, Orgrim also wanted revenge. Members of the Shadow Council had murdered Durotan, Draka, and their infant &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;, as far as he was aware.\nThe Shadow Council's whereabouts were unknown. Luckily, there was someone to interrogate. &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was still unconscious, but the Horde had captured his puppet, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, as she tried to escape from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Orgrim had her tortured until she revealed where the Shadow Council had built its secret refuge: &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. A large force of Horde soldiers stormed the smoldering volcano. The Shadow Council warlocks could do little to save themselves. Their fel power could only delay Orgrim's wrath for so long. Orgrim then killed as many warlocks and members of the Shadow Council as he could manage, effectively crushing their power. One of the few council members to survive was &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; made a very convincing case for why he should be spared. Without Cho'gall, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; would succumb to madness again. Could Orgrim really afford to lose such a capable fighting force? Cho'gall swore his allegiance to the Warchief, claiming that he had been manipulated into Guldan's service.\nOrgrim accepted his surrender reluctantly. He wasn't sure whether the two-headed ogre was telling the truth, and he didn't particularly care. He needed fighting power to protect the Horde's new lands. The ogre also introduced Orgrim to the Dark Iron dwarves, who, under Ragnaros' secret command, allowed the Horde to use the spire as its base. The warchief felt it was a good omen that the place bore the same name as his own clan.\nThe Warchief also spared Garona's life. It was no secret that Gul'dan had been remarkably cruel to her, and her assassination of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;Llane&lt;/a&gt; had been very helpful. She, too, swore fealty to the Horde. Orgrim charged one of his most trusted lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, to act as her handler. In time, Orgrim's messengers returned from Draenor with bad news. The clans still on that world had descended deeper into bloodlust and had begun fighting with one another. Only a few skilled disciplined orcs and a handful of ogres would be able to bolster the Horde.\nArming the Horde.\nAs the dust of the First War settled, Orgrim Doomhammer mulled over the future of his people. He dreamed of a time when the orcs could return to their &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;old traditions and ways&lt;/a&gt;, free from fel magic and the other corruptive influences that &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; had introduced to the clans.\nYet that dream would be long in coming. First, Orgrim would have to secure a home for the orcs on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Conquering &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; was not enough. The other human nations would never make peace with the Horde. Not after Stormwind's destruction. Even now, Doomhammer's scouts reported that there was a gathering of human nations in a northern land called &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrgrim knew that the Horde could not sit idle. If he and his people simply tried to defend their conquered territory, the human nations would muster the full might of their armies, march south, and eventually overrun the orcs. The only way for Orgrim to secure his race's survival was to strike first before his enemies could fully prepare for war. After interrogating human prisoners taken from Stormwind, the orcs had learned that many powerful human nations existed in the north, but none compared to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It was the heart of human culture. If the Horde conquered its seat of power, &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, Doomhammer believed the other kingdoms would fall in turn.\nBut that was if the Horde conquered Lordaeron's capital. The war with Stormwind had depleted Doomhammer's army and sapped its resources. With only meager reinforcements coming from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Warchief sought other ways to strengthen the Horde. His followers scrambled to find new weapons. Blackrock orcs commandeered Stormwind's forges, but many of them were in ruins due to the fire that had raged through the city. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; worked on enslaving &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani trolls&lt;/a&gt; that previously refused to ally with the Horde rejoiced upon learning of Stormwind's destruction and now saw the orcs as potential allies. Some of them indicated that they would join the Horde in exchange for Doomhammer's aid, for Warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; had been captured by humans and shackled in a prison near the town of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;. If the orcs helped them liberate Zul'jin, these trolls would agree to fight for the Horde.\nThen there was &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after Stormwind's fall, the disgraced warlock had stirred from his coma. The Warchief had kept Gul'dan under watch, intending to execute him when he woke. Yet when the time came to shed his blood, Orgrim stayed his hand. Gul'dan had an offer for his new master, a means to ensure the Horde's victory over the humans.\nThe warlock's gambit.\n&lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; awakened from his coma to find that the world had changed. Before he had commanded immense power of the Horde. Now, he had none. His &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, and Doomhammer was the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan knew that if he did not win Orgrim's trust, he would meet the same grisly fate as his warlocks.\nGul'dan pleaded for his life, and he pledged his loyalty to the Horde. The warlock promised Doomhammer that he would no longer seek to manipulate the orcs. He disavowed his connection with the benefactors who had taught the orcs &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, claiming that they had betrayed and abandoned him. The warlock knew that his word was worth little more than dirt to Orgrim. Knowing the new Warchief was too intelligent, too honorable, too noble to be easily swayed or controlled, Gul'dan needed something more to win his trust. The warlock saw that the Horde was desperate for power. Without it, the orcs would fail in the coming war against the humans. He told Doomhammer that he could create new warriors, ones who could stand toe-to-toe with humanity's spellcasters. &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; had proved to be troublesome opponents in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. From what human prisoners had told the orcs, nations like &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; incorporated far more of these spellcasters into their armies than Stormwind had.\nDoomhammer didn't trust Gul'dan but the warlock was right. The Horde had no answer to human magic, especially after the warchief had outlawed the use of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy. Orgrim gave Gul'dan a chance to prove his worth. If he could produce something useful, he would live. If he could not the warchief himself would be the one to end his miserable existence. Orgrim knew that leaving Gul'dan alive was a risk, but he believed that he could control the warlock rather than become his accomplice and puppet as Blackhand had.\nGul'dan convinced Doomhammer to grant him permission to form his own clan, the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreavers&lt;/a&gt;. The warlock claimed that he would keep his activities visible to the entire Horde, unlike when he had ruled over the Shadow Council and shrouded himself in secrecy. He and his clan members would be forced to fight on the front lines alongside the rest of the army. In truth, Gul'dan planned to use the new clan as a means to expand his influence and power. Doomhammer suspected as much, but he was confident he could play one step ahead of Gul'dan. If the warlock wanted a clan of his own, so be it. Orgrim would plant spies among the clan to keep watch on Gul'dan and his activities.\nThe sight of Gul'dan's new &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; sickened Orgrim. They were unnatural abominations, and they had been created from the fallen members of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, the very organization that Orgrim saw as responsible for killing the orcs' &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;homeworld&lt;/a&gt;. Yet despite all of Warchief's misgivings, he could not deny their potential. After weighing his options, Doomhammer accepted these unholy warriors into the Horde. The longer he waited, the more he risked losing the element of surprise in attacking the human nations. Orgrim ordered members of the Blackrock clan to keep a close watch on the death knights. Secretly, the Warchief planned to destroy Gul'dan and his undead soldiers once the Horde had secured victory.\nDespite his suspicions and assassination plans toward the warlock, Orgrim disbanded the &lt;a href=\"Raider\"&gt;wolfriders&lt;/a&gt; after he was convinced by Gul'dan that they would join &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; to avenge Blackhand.\nInvasion of Khaz Modan.\nDuring the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; lands, Doomhammer sent &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; clan to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Yet it would not fall as the rest of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; had. Nearly all of the city's residents took up arms. The Horde smashed against the city like a battering ram, but to no avail. The cost in lives grew so great that Doomhammer called off the siege. Ironforge was not his main goal, and he saw no need to throw his soldiers' lives away to conquer the stronghold. Doomhammer had what he needed. Khaz Modan and its bountiful resources were his to exploit.\nTo keep the dwarves contained, Doomhammer stationed the Bleeding Hollows outside the gates of the dwarven and gnomish cities. He then ordered his Blackrock orcs to mine the surrounding mountains and commandeer the dwarves' forges. Before long, thick smoke blanketed the mountains. Blacksmiths distributed newly wrought armaments and siege weapons throughout the Horde.\nTides of Darkness.\nAfter conquering the bulk of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, Doomhammer plotted the next phase of his campaign. To reach the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms by land, the orcs would need to pass through the perilous &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; and the narrow &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;, a site the humans could easily defend. The Alliance would likely expect the Horde to cross north by this path, but Doomhammer would not do the expected, he was no fool. He would build a fleet of ships and launch a surprise attack in the heart of humanity's territories.\nMuch to Orgrim's surprise, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; clan proved to be instrumental in persuading the Horde to cross by sea. The warlock and his followers urged their allies that it was the best course of action and that the voyage would be safe. Orgrim welcomed the assistance, but he remained wary of Gul'dan's motivations.\nIn a bay tucked in the southwestern &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim oversaw the construction of a vast yet crude fleet. This is when he acquired aid from a completely new ally: the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. These ingenious and cunning creatures had witnessed the Horde's arrival and its conquest of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and were determined to profit from it. The Warchief would not force the bold goblin into servitude; that was something &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; might have done. Orgrim saw more benefit in treating them as equals. If it was gold they wanted, gold they could have. The orcs had recovered a fortune from Stormwind's coffers, but they had no need of coin. Doomhammer paid the goblins handsomely for their aid. When he learned that they were also accomplished shipwrights, he hired them to oversee the construction of the Horde's fleet.\nGrim Batol.\nDoomhammer claimed the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; as the Horde's base of operations, and allowed &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to pursue his research into the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. This led to the enslavement of the dragonqueen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and the breeding of dragons to help the Horde in the war. Word of the Dragonmaw's feats spread throughout the Horde. No one was more pleased by the news than Warchief Doomhammer. He now had another potent weapon in his arsenal. Yet it would take time to reliably control the dragons and use them in the heat of battle. Doomhammer commanded &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; and his clan to take control of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, a remote fortress in the mountains east of the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Hillsbrad Foothills.\nOrgrim planned to cross the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to reach &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. It would be a difficult journey, but it was the quickest way to strike at &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; started, the Warchief watched the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; with a mix of displeasure and satisfaction. He was still uneasy about them, but he saw just how effective they were in combat. The Horde and the Alliance were evenly matched, but Doomhammer knew that would not last forever. The longer the orcs stayed in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;, the more time the Alliance had to call in reinforcements from their far-flung territories. The &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; army was protecting the quickest routes to Lordaeron's capital. Doomhammer's only course of action was to go eastward to find another way to the city. For this, he called on the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani trolls&lt;/a&gt;. They knew the mountainous terrain well. The trolls agreed to guide the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, but they would not do so until Doomhammer made good on his promise to help them liberate their leader, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmani pact.\nDoomhammer had not forgotten his vow to free &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Orc scouts had discovered the troll's whereabouts in a prison camp near the human bastion known as &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. As battles continued across &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;, Doomhammer himself led a raiding party to rescue Zul'jin. The prison's defenders stood little chance against the Warchief and his battle-hardened soldiers. After freeing the troll, Doomhammer invited him and the rest of his people to join the Horde.\nAt first, Zul'jin balked at the proposal. He was warlord of the great &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;. He would answer to no one but himself. Doomhammer was quick to allay Zul'jin's fears about leadership. If the Amani pledged themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, they would not become servants. Zul'jin would retain full control over his people. He and Doomhammer would stand as equals against their enemies. Doomhammer finally won Zul'jin's support with an offer: if the Amani committed their forces to the Horde, the orcs would help them annihilate their rivals, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacking Quel'Thalas meant moving farther north from Lordaeron's capital than Doomhammer wanted. It was a risk, but a necessary one. The battles at Hillsbrad had taught Doomhammer many things about the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. For one, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s were a formidable force, equal to that of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;. To win, Doomhammer would need the Amani's support.\nDoomhammer ordered the Horde to turn east. His trusted lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; commanded a rearguard of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orcs to waylay the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. This gave the rest of the Horde precious time to cross Hillsbrad and funnel through a narrow mountain pass and into a region known as the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; From there, the Horde crossed the mountains and walked through Lordaeron to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder his command, the Horde was able to wreak havoc on the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt;. Orgrim also made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;. The treacherous human allowed Orgrim and the Horde to pass unimpeded through the mountain passes towards Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for the assurance that his nation would not be attacked by the Horde. Orgrim, though suspicious of the human's motives, agreed, and promised to him that if he were to successfully conquer Lordaeron, he would keep Alterac safe under his protection. Doomhammer then briefly pondered double-crossing the human king as he was leaving, but eventually chose not to - Perenolde had treated him in good faith, and he would not betray that if he were to change the Horde's brutish ways.\nHowever, Doomhammer was correct in his previous assessment of the perfidious Gul'dan. When the Horde was launching the final and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Capital%20City\"&gt;massive attack&lt;/a&gt; on Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan's &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and all others loyal to the warlock, abandoned the Horde and set sail to the south. Chasing him to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim sent part of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; to engage both the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer forces. Gul'dan and his warlocks entered the Tomb of Sargeras but were slain by the demons within. The rest of the clan members were annihilated by Orgrim's forces.\nWay back during the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim had been reluctant to accept &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s invitation of the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s into the Horde. He had been raised to hate them and had fought against them during most of his life after all, but during the Second War, the Warchief found himself gaining respect for some of them, to the point that he created his own elite guard of ogre warriors. These ogres were loyal to him and him alone, admiring Doomhammer's strength and courage, seeing him as a small ogre himself. He, in turn, had come to respect their strength and relied upon their support. He knew they would die for him if necessary, and was surprised to realize he would give his life for them as well.\nWeakened by losses caused by Gul'dan's treachery, Doomhammer was forced to fall back from the human capital of Lordaeron to his fortress at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. There he fought the final battle of the Second War against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, leading a charge from Blackrock Spire to clash with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and his paladin guard. Human and orc battled one another in a titanic conflict that left both warriors drained, but the Warchief was able to vanquish the Regent of Azeroth. Some believe that Doomhammer did not win fairly and that Lothar was killed after being ambushed by Horde warriors. Nevertheless, Lothar's death did not have the effect that Doomhammer intended. Rather than being demoralized, the Alliance - led by Lothar's lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; - rallied, whipped into a frenzy that shocked even the Warchief himself and all but destroyed Doomhammer's forces, chasing them back to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Orgrim himself was defeated and captured by Turalyon, soon after Lothar's death.\nMeeting with Thrall.\nAfter the defeat at Blackrock Spire, Doomhammer was captured and held as an oddity (by his own words) in the palace of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. On his side, Terenas fervently hoped that a treaty could be arranged with the former warchief. However, Doomhammer was able to escape easily from &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, and went into an &lt;a href=\"Internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;, where he saw what had become of his people. Rather than the bloodthirsty warriors he had led in battle, Doomhammer found only lethargic, wasted souls. Despairing, Doomhammer very nearly fell victim to the lethargy himself, but managed to retain enough of himself to escape from the internment camp. He lived as a hermit in the less-traveled areas of Lordaeron, until one day, he was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;elder shaman&lt;/a&gt; informed Doomhammer that there was a young orc staying with the Frostwolves high in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;mountains of Alterac&lt;/a&gt;. This orc, discovered to be the long-lost son of Durotan, had escaped after being raised a slave by humans and had begun searching for his people. Durotan's son, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, was determined to find a way to free the captive orcs and restore them to their former glory. Orgrim had heard of this Thrall before from &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, whom Thrall had met before he began searching for his clan. Hellscream had nothing but good things to say about the youth. \nIntrigued, Doomhammer paid a visit to the Frostwolves to see Thrall for himself but made it clear beforehand that he didn't want Thrall to know who he was. When Doomhammer arrived nobody referred to him by name or told Thrall about him. When Thrall met Doomhammer that night, he did not realize he was dealing with the former leader of the Horde of whom he had heard so many great things; he only saw a strange orc warming himself by the fire. As the night wore on, Thrall became increasingly annoyed by the secretive demeanor of the stranger, and by his talk of how there was no point in trying to fight the humans. When Thrall insisted that the freedom of the orcs was worth fighting for, the stranger asked him what he was doing hiding in the mountains with the other Frostwolves if he really believed that. Becoming angrier, Thrall argued that he would travel south in the spring to join Grom Hellscream and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, that together they would storm the camps and liberate all of the orc prisoners. The stranger scoffed at the notion and contemptuously dismissed Hellscream as a \"demon-ridden dreamer.\" Thrall had heard enough and challenged this stranger, who had repaid the hospitality of the Frostwolves with insults, to single battle. This was precisely what Doomhammer had hoped would happen. He had implied the Frostwolves were cowards and that the orcs as a race could not defeat the humans in order to see whether Thrall would stand up for his clan and people, and Thrall had not disappointed him. Now Doomhammer would see whether Thrall's fighting skill was equally impressive.\nLiberation of the orcs.\nLosing to the young shaman, and being shown mercy, he revealed himself as the Warchief of the Horde. At first Thrall was aghast at how he had treated such an important person as Orgrim Doomhammer, and began to apologize profusely. Orgrim stopped him and told him it was not necessary, explaining his reasons for staying anonymous. He went on to explain that he had a plan to break free the imprisoned orcs, and Thrall and Drek'thar agreed to help. \nAlong with Hellscream and the Warsong clan, they were able to easily storm four internment camps freeing the orcs held inside. At the fifth, however, the Alliance was prepared and held a force of mounted &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s. They ambushed the orcs and in the midst of their bloodlust the orcs fell victim to the knights' charge. In the midst of the chaos created by Thrall to cover their retreat, Orgrim was mortally wounded by a strike to the back \u2014 impaled by a charging knight's lance with enough force to pierce the back plate of his armor and his body, denting the breastplate from the inside. With his last breath, Orgrim gave the title of Warchief, along with his great warhammer and black armor, to Thrall. The former internment camp where he fell is now the Horde base of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nDoomhammer's legacy.\nOne of the things Doomhammer had hated about the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, about what the orcs had become, was their lack of honor. Before, on Draenor, they had been a noble race. But &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s treachery had changed all that, making them little more than bloodthirsty savages. Doomhammer was determined to restore his race's pride and purity, to have them act with honor again. Orgrim's values were supported and enforced by his successor &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and despite some difficulties the orcs eventually found their old ways back with time.\nAfter the orcs found a land of their own, which they called &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; after his father, Thrall established the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the venerable Warchief, his mentor and friend.\nDoomhammer's name also lives on in the \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" - a powerful flying warship that serves as the mobile Horde headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, in the frozen wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Doomhammer and the plate.\nOrgrim wore the plate until he was slain in Hammerfall. Since that moment the plate was worn and the hammer carried by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, fulfilling his weapon's ancient prophecy. He made sure to restore, but not replace, the back plate pierced by the lance that took Doomhammer's life. At the start of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall stopped wearing the plate (in favor of shamanic robes) but chose to have it delivered to Orgrimmar, since it is an important part of orcish culture. Since then, he has alternated between wearing the plate and choosing humbler clothing: he donned it during the campaign into the Draenor of yet another &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt;, discarded it in favor of traditional Frostwolf clothing after the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and donned it yet again during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpirit.\nDuring Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim briefly manifested alongside the spirits of other famous orcs in response to an offering prepared by an orc adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;. Before disappearing, the former warchief expressed his happiness and pride at how far the orcish people had come since his death. He also admitted that he was glad to see that Thrall had started wearing his armor again after years of struggle with balancing his warrior and shaman sides.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Orgrim first appeared as a hermit living alongside several &lt;a href=\"Hell%20hound\"&gt;hell-hounds&lt;/a&gt;. As he, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; were three blood brothers, he warmly greeted &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and explained him the story of his father and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After the scattered clans were united, Doomhammer supported Thrall's rise as the new &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike his canon counterpart, he was to survive the story and was to be played by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Cullen\"&gt;Peter Cullen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nPersonality.\nDoomhammer is a warrior born, his leadership ability forged in combat. He is unendingly loyal to those who prove their strength and service, but quick to avenge himself on those who attack him or his allies. Among the orcs, his gruff, curt manner is respected, but to others he can seem dismissive and contemptuous. Understanding the value of protecting an army's leadership, battles often found Doomhammer in a far-off command tent. Yet whenever possible, he is a howling, bloodthirsty presence on the front lines, personally leading his troops to victory. Though he is a towering figure in his black armor, Doomhammer can hide himself completely in as simple a disguise as a tattered cloak in order to move undetected among his enemies.\nOrgrim respected &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s and punished the orc captain &lt;a href=\"Narg%20Snarl\"&gt;Narg Snarl&lt;/a&gt; for disrespecting them.\nCombat.\nDoomhammer doesn't hesitate to strike the first blow in combat, usually striking from surprise using one of the Blackhand's fangs hanging from his belt. Wielding the Doomhammer, he leaps fearlessly into any number of enemies and becomes a whirlwind of destruction. Distrustful of spellcasters but confident in his armor, Doomhammer usually first attempts to kill any wizards among his enemies. On occasion, he will save the strongest among his enemies for last, relishing the chance to hone his martial skill against a worthy opponent.\nWeapons and armor.\nDoomhammer's Plate was, of course, once worn into battle by the mighty Doomhammer. The half-plate armor is a black iron and mithril alloy, giving the armor an overall dull black appearance. Aside from the plate, he wielded &lt;a href=\"Blackhand%27s%20Fang\"&gt;Blackhand's Fang&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlternate timelines.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; where died as an infant, Orgrim Doomhammer was killed in a single combat by during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Battle of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. His weapon, the Doomhammer was shattered and his black armor reforged and worn by his slayer. The rest of the orcs weren't placed in the internment camps but were taken by Blackmoore who then conquered Lordaeron and became its King.\nOrgrim from yet another timeway appeared before the main-unverse Thrall entered the King Blackmoore's world. Thrall, disguised as a warlock Thra'kash, witnessed the discussion of Doomhammer and his parents, Draka and Durotan. Orgrim sent them to the safety and assigned &lt;a href=\"Grukar\"&gt;Grukar&lt;/a&gt; and Thra'kash to accompany them.\nAnother &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Orgim&lt;/a&gt; is briefly encountered in the alternate in the past during the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war on Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\n from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;."}

Despite receiving help from the Alliance and Horde forces, Blackhand was able to kill Orgrim with his warhammer, claiming that he was too weak to ever truly be one of them. His body was taken by Durotan following the end of the Battle for Shattrath. "}

As he grew Doomhammer would prove himself to be a mighty warrior and thus the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; knew that he would be chosen to serve as Durotan's second in command when &lt;a href=\"Garad%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; passed away.\nDoomhammer would bare witness to the parlay between &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and Garad, where the later refused to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.

Orgrim would help organize the retreat from the Frostwolves home after the eruption of the dormant volcano took the clan, with the weakened spirits and the shaman being unable to hear them, by surprise. Doomhammer would later witness the parlay between Gul'dan and Durotan, when the warlock once again offered the Frostwolves a place in the Horde. While others in the clan such as &lt;a href=\"Nokrar\"&gt;Nokrar&lt;/a&gt; were outraged at Durotan's refusal to join, Doomhammer would praise his friend and chieftain. \nSometime later the spirits would be able to get a message of sorts to Drek'Thar and Durotan decided to lead a party north to aid the spirits, while leaving Draka and Doomhammer in charge. With Durotan and his war party gone the opportunistic Red Walkers decided to strike out against the Frostwolves in order to wound them and use them as a food supply. Unknown to the Redwalkers the weakened spirits still had enough energy to give one final gift to the Frostwolves and Durotan and his party rushed south and the Frostwolves under the command of Draka and Orgrim Doomhammer fought to kill their enemies. During this battle Doomhammer would become locked in combat against the Red Walker chieftain who successfully knocked out after hearing Durotan's orders to keep him alive. Doomhammer would later hear, along with Durotan, how the noble Red Walker clan had fallen so low and then witness Durotan swiftly kill its chieftain, thus putting end to the Red Walkers. \nIn light of the war with Redwalkers and hardships had taken a toll on the Frostwolves, Doomhammer would support Durotan's order to join the Horde.\nWarcraft.\nDoomhammer would join the Horde in attacking the humans but like his Chieftain Durotan, would refuse to raid the defenseless towns seeing no honor in attacking those who could not defend themselves.

However Doomhammer would remain alive and Durotan's corpse would be placed as a warning to the other orcs. \nDoomhammer would later take it down and take one of Durotan's tusks from his corpse in order to bring it to his son, Go'el.

Nestled into a system of valleys on the northern edge of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the imposing warrior city is the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; that governs the entire faction. It is the primary hub for player characters of the Horde and, as with all capital cities, has &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Professions\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;s. The equivalent hub for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter the Third War.\nOrgrimmar has been the central hub of the orc community since the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The city was founded by Thrall and named after his friend and mentor, the former Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. It is a fortified complex guarded by stout walls, massive gates, and tall towers. The mountainous ranges of northern Durotar form a natural barrier to the rear of the fortress, and parts of the complex are carved into the mountain itself.\nThrall led the orcs to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where they founded a new homeland with the help of their tauren brethren. Naming their new land Durotar after Thrall's &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;murdered father&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs settled down to rebuild their once-glorious society. The &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic curse on their kind ended, the Horde changed from a bloodthirsty, warlike juggernaut into more of a loose coalition, dedicated to survival and prosperity rather than conquest. Aided by the noble tauren and the cunning trolls of the Darkspear tribe, Thrall and his orcs looked forward to a new era of peace in their own land.\nFrom there, they began the creation of the great warrior city, Orgrimmar. Named after the former Warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, the new city was constructed in a short amount of time, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, tauren, trolls, and the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having some problems with the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, enraged &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, evil orcish warlocks and &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrimmar prospered in the end and became home to the orcs and Darkspear Trolls.\nAlthough Rexxar decided not to go back to Orgrimmar right after the death of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, but instead chose to wander again, he returned to the city when he brought the injured fisherman &lt;a href=\"Byrok\"&gt;Byrok&lt;/a&gt; to the city.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nNamed in honor of the legendary Orgrim Doomhammer, Orgrimmar was founded as the capital city of the orcs' new homeland. Built within a huge, winding canyon in the harsh land of Durotar, Orgrimmar stands as one of the mightiest warrior cities in the world. Behind Orgrimmar's immense walls, elderly shaman pass their knowledge on to the Horde's newest generation of leaders, while warriors spar in the gladiatorial arena, honing their skills in preparation for the trials that await them in this dangerous land.\nToday, Orgrimmar lies at the base of a mountain between Durotar and Azshara. A warrior city indeed, it is home to countless amounts of orcs, trolls, tauren, and an increasing amount of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; are now joining the city, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s who have more recently been accepted into the Horde.\nDuring the first &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the city was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the gates of Orgrimmar were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe city was once again attacked by the Scourge during the duel between Thrall and Garrosh. The duel was interrupted as orcs and some other leaders of the Horde went to defend the city.\nDuring the War against the Lich King, Putress betrayed the Forsaken. Sylvanas and her loyal Forsaken took refuge in Orgrimmar. From there, Sylvanas, Thrall and horde adventurers returned and liberated Undercity. During that time, all merchants and services were shut down as the Warchief prepared for an unavoidable conflict.\nStormrage.\nAs the whole of Azeroth fell into the mists of the Emerald Nightmare, so too did Orgrimmar and its citizens.\nElemental Unrest.\nOrgrimmar was attacked by raging elements but the attack was successfully repelled.\nShattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; were over, a great celebration was held in honor of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; and those who died and survived on &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, raging fire elements burned plenty of buildings in Orgrimmar and the city needed to repair. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; asked &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; to do so and determined to set off to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; in order to help raging elements. Before leaving, in &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; Thrall appointed Garrosh to lead the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. \nCataclysm.\nWhen Garrosh assumed leadership of the Horde, he instituted an enormous redesign of Orgrimmar, opening up new areas to settlement and moving or repurposing existing buildings. The redesign was done with fortification and safety in mind, with new iron and stone buildings built to be far less susceptible to fire and enemy attacks. The orc capital became a more militant and martial city, with an increasingly aggressive attitude toward the world. Orgrimmar's fortresses now rank among the most imposing on Azeroth. Spiked metal towers line the city's streets and the red-and-black banners of the Horde wave from every post. Most of the various races have separated into their own districts, from the tauren in the Valley of Wisdom to the trolls in the Valley of Spirits. Grommash Hold towers over all else, allowing Garrosh Hellscream to keep a close watch on his people. There is also a district known as the \"Goblin Slums\" near the Valley of Spirits. There is also a rear gate leading to Azshara. The Valley of Honor has also become the second trade district, with its own bank, auction house and inn.\nAreas affected:\nTides of War.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; over and the threat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; subsided, a summit of the Horde's leaders was held in Orgrimmar. Here, Garrosh informed his allies about his desire to forcibly expel the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; from Kalimdor, and claim the continent for the good of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh intended to scour &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; from the continent and stunt the Alliance's military presence. With that done, he then aims to take the night elves' land.\nAfter the successful destruction of Theramore, the battle force returned to Orgrimmar to celebrate their victory. Many cheers rose to Garrosh's victory.\nMists of Pandaria.\nOver the course of Mists of Pandaria, Garrosh becomes increasingly crazed and tyrannical, turning the Horde against him and Orgrimmar changes to reflect this.\nEscalation.\nOrgrimmar is effectively put under martial law, as Garrosh continues to oppress the non-orc members of the city. All non-orc districts of the city lose most of their supplies and are heavily guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, under suspicion that they might be working with the rebels. The supply lines to Orgrimmar from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; are and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; has taken the strategic settlement of &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; from Garrosh's loyalists, essentially putting the city under threat of siege from the rebellion to the south as well as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; armada amassing to the east.\nSiege.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the city is put under siege by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Horde rebels&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Kor'kron barricades block access to most of the city's districts. Vol'jin's revolutionary forces have entrenched themselves along the main road, launching a frontal assault on the city's gates to break into the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance frigates storm the Bladefist Bay and landing parties attempt to capture the docks around Orgrimmar. Invading forces discover a massive underground compound constructed by Garrosh's forces for his own purposes. Skirmishes at the gates occurred before a full-scale battle erupted between the forces led by Vol'jin and the defenders still loyal to Garrosh. Despite Vol'jin's attempts to ram the gate and attack the walls with siege engines, the walls could not be breached. The arrival of a combined rebel and Alliance armada under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; disabled Orgrimmar's naval defenses. Eventually, the Kor'kron were pushed back into the gates and the arrival of Night Elf reinforcements under &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Night Elf glaive throwers brought the gate down, and the allied forces charged into Orgrimmar. The Valley of Strength was quickly liberated, and the death of &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; brought the upper city under Alliance/rebel control. The Underhold eventually fell when adventurers defeated and imprisoned the Warchief Garrosh. Vol'jin was quickly nominated and initiated as the new Warchief by Thrall and the other Horde leaders. Alliance forces left the city, and the rebels began rebuilding the damage that was done during the siege.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nFollowing the deposition of Garrosh, rebel forces began rebuilding the damage done to Orgrimmar during the siege and members of the Horde of all races began moving back to the city. The trade routes previously blockaded during the siege have been restored and all areas of Orgrimmar were freed from Kor'kron control. As such Orgrimmar is now fully operational and can be considered to have returned to normalcy. \nThe newly elected Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; has also taken up residence in Orgrimmar, ruling the Horde from Grommash Hold, while members of all races have formed a &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Grunt\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff%20Protector\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Headhunter\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the arsenal hidden within the Underhold was destroyed, the exact status of the Underhold and whether or not is it still being used under the Horde's new management is unknown.\nLegion.\nBefore and after the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;first battle&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, many of Orgrimmar's citizens were seen in the streets worrying. In response, Vol'jin opened the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; to provide the shelter for the citizens. After being mortally wounded on the Broken Shore the dying Vol'jin was returned to Orgrimmar. After receiving a vision by the loa he declared that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; would succeed him as Warchief of the Horde. Following Vol'jin's funeral, a group of &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; were granted permission to establish a camp within the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Skyway\"&gt;Orgrimmar Skyway&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; now leads Orgrimmar as leader of the orcs.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; was opened replacing the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Slums\"&gt;Goblin Slums&lt;/a&gt;. The city also hosted a parade led by Warchief Sylvanas.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhile the civil war against Garrosh Hellscream had proved that Orgrimmar could be cracked, High Overlord Saurfang spent a considerable time in beefing up Orgrimmar's defenses. Despite this, however, spies, in response to the end result &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, were able to sneak into the city. While the sheer numbers and sightings of the Alliance spies forced the guards of Orgrimmar into a state of paranoia, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; used their presence to her advantage by tricking the Alliance into believing that the Horde intended to conquer &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Believing the information to be genuine, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; sent the Sentinels to prevent this from occurring and with the bulk of the night elf military away the Horde focused on their true target - the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;conquest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nAfter the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner would come to reside within &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; and Forsaken refugees would set up home within the city with the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; becoming home to a sizable group of them.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde was constructing &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; doomsday weapons in the city. Several Horde's &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;Island Expedition&lt;/a&gt;s made transits from Orgrimmar. One portal was maintained between Orgrimmar and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Coast\"&gt;Blood Coast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Honorbound\"&gt;Honorbound&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Nazmir\"&gt;Assault on Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Thrall, Varok, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s infiltrated the city and entered the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; to free &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the course of the war, the Horde split between &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; loyalists and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries. Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;her loyalists&lt;/a&gt; were quick to seize Orgrimmar as their base of operations to the point of arresting &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; for siding with Saurfang and burning anti-propaganda that dissidents within the city were spreading. To further strengthen Sylvanas's strength, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; called for the citizens of Orgrimmar to be rallied to their army. While Sylvanas was seizing Orgrimmar, Saurfang's revolutionaries had allied with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and sought to strike at Orgrimmar from &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, before the battle could commence, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and her abandonment of the Horde. In the aftermath, the Horde reunited once more with her former loyalists defecting to his revolution. Saurfang's funeral was subsequently held in front of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where many heroes of the Horde and even a few of the Alliance attended. Sometime following Saurfang's funeral, those who &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to renounce Sylvanas were placed in chains, while others would be looked down upon causing people like &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; to defend them by stating that they were now loyal to the Horde, and if they asked for forgiveness, it should be given, as the Horde needed to be united now more than ever. The streets of Orgrimmar were also patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and their troops to maintain order among the citizens.\nShortly after the end of the war, the &lt;a href=\"Voldunai\"&gt;Voldunai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Orgrimmar where, after they aided the Horde in solving some of their problems, formally joined the Horde.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the Horde gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; and forewent selecting a new warchief in favor of a council-style leadership. Thus the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, a conglomerate of leaders who would represent their people's interests, was created to lead the Horde.\nShadows Rising.\nThe Horde Council held a meeting within Orgrimmar that was derailed by a failed assassination attempt on &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; queen and a key ally, which forced the council to act. They empowered the young &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, still grieving the loss of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; sent word that they were aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council, another meeting was held in the city. This meeting ended with a unanimous vote for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; meeting with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes that this meeting would lead to the capture of Sylvanas.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; later teleported the armies of the Horde from Orgrimmar to Zandalar in order to unite with the Zandalari and fight against the Widow's Bite and the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;'s abduction by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; took up residence within &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where he took up leadership of Orgrimmar.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; sent their troops to patrol the city and protect its inhabitants in case of attack by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, the council convened atop of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; where they informed Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the return of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the abduction of Thrall and Baine. These champions were subsequently sent to unite with the Ebon Blade and the Argent Crusade in order to combat the returning enemy. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;, they returned to Orgrimmar to inform the council about the events that occurred in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;dark powers&lt;/a&gt; that Sylvanas had allied with.\nIn order for allies from Azeroth to come in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade%20Acolyte\"&gt;acolytes&lt;/a&gt; of the Ebon Blade were ordered to establish portals to access Oribos from the &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; in Orgrimmar.\nGeography.\nOrgrimmar is periodically wracked by the fierce \"razor-winds\", powerful enough to tear off the roofs of improperly constructed buildings.\nValleys.\nThe city is divided into natural valleys and shaped around the curving terrain of northern Durotar. The central valley is usually considered the economic heart of the region. This area is teeming with all sorts of activity, due to the proximity of both the auction house, bank, city inn and flight master.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; there is also a massive underground compound named the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, which is located deep within Ragefire Chasm, used by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron Guard&lt;/a&gt; as their headquarters. Garrosh Hellscream has his own &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;inner sanctum&lt;/a&gt; there.\nNotable characters.\nWarchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; used to rule from &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash hold&lt;/a&gt;, within the Valley of Wisdom, prior to the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; as Warchief and the subsequent movement of the hold to the Valley of Strength. &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, then chieftain of the Darkspear tribe, also spent much time within Grommash hold during Thrall's reign, before leading his people from the city after Garrosh took control.\nFrom his throne in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief Garrosh used to rule with the continuing support of his advisors the blood knight &lt;a href=\"Master%20Pyreanor\"&gt;Master Pyreanor&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, and formerly the wise shaman &lt;a href=\"Sauranok%20the%20Mystic\"&gt;Sauranok the Mystic&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he planned on how to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces. Consequently, Garrosh declared an all-out war with the humans and other Alliance races, and with the help of the goblins of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and the prominent &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt;, he reshaped Orgrimmar into a city of war, bringing in various goblin machinery to be used in both attack and defense of the city.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and the displacement of Garrosh, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the newly appointed Warchief of the Horde, returned to live within Grommash Hold.\nVol'jin succumbed to a mortal wound received upon the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; within Grommash hold, and his body was carried out by the other Horde leaders. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was then appointed Warchief. While the newly christened Warchief ruled from the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, High Overlord &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; presided as representative of the orcs within the hold. Following the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas officially ruled the Horde from Grommash Hold up until the Horde split between her loyalists and Varok Saurfang's revolutionaries. In the ensuing conflict, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde.\nSometime after, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; was created, and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; took up residence and leadership of Orgrimmar from within Grommash hold.\nIn the RPG.\nOrgrimmar is located in the far north of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, at the foothills of the mountain range that separates Durotar from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Several valleys have been dug out from the mountain and provide a way of naturally dissecting the city into various zones, including the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Valley of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt;. Several specialty shops are found in the &lt;a href=\"Drag\"&gt;Drag&lt;/a&gt;, a dark pathway that leads from the Valley of Strength to the Valley of Honor. Those searching for potions or training in the darker arts of the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; find a tunnel leading down to the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; from the Drag. Orgrimmar is openly hospitable to all members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and is an important center of commerce. Visitors may fly into the city by way of &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;, or simply walk through the fortress's &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;main gates&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogrik%20Wolfclaw\"&gt;Ogrik Wolfclaw&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Wolfclaw\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; live in Orgrimmar.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Acquiring these will require two or three stacks of .\nBuff.\nCreating this item grants the character a +30 &lt;a href=\"Agility\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Gift%20of%20Friendship\"&gt;Orgrimmar Gift of Friendship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; for 60 minutes. The buff persists if the Gift Collection item is consumed as an ingredient. The Gift Collection buffs do not &lt;a href=\"stack\"&gt;stack&lt;/a&gt;, and any new buff from creating a city Gift Collection will overwrite an existing one.\nIngredient.\nAn Orgrimmar Gift Collection is one of three &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; city Gift Collections which are ingredients of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Gift%20Collection\"&gt;Horde Gift Collection&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item. It cannot be sold at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;ed nor put in a &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt; tab, but it can be given, sold, or traded with other &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window. Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nThis item is primarily useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year. \nThe item can be created from the ingredient items after the event is over. By combining each hierarchical layer of gifts and pledges near its expiration, it should be possible to extend the overall duration to around 21 days for the city gift collections; so anywhere within that timeframe, a city gift could be created. It is unknown whether or not the buff will proc based on the item creation or if a separate check requires the event to be in progress, but the response time for the buff to proc during the event suggests that no separate check is used. \nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article. "}

However, they mined directly to a &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt; den, which put a halt to the operation. The kobolds were later routed by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and his companions, and the breaches into the dens were closed off, after which &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; and his employees could finish their task. Rexxar also encountered an isolated group of &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; within the earthen passageways.\nLoading screen.\nWithin the tunnels below Orgrimmar, the goblins have dug deep into the ground in search of water for the orcs' new home. Though the goblins are master diggers, they have little regard for the repercussions of turning so much soil.\nSpeculation.\nThe Tunnels were likely dug closer to Orgrimmar than the &lt;a href=\"Southfury%20River\"&gt;Southfury River&lt;/a&gt;, the closest external water source. The entrance to the Tunnels may even be within the city proper, as Orgrimmar was still under construction when digging began. Orgrimmar currently has three bodies of water within its limits; a waterfall in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt;. and with the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", a spring erupting from the cliffs above the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Valley of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; and another in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt;. None of these sources drain out of the city, which most likely indicates the underground water source sought by Gazlowe does indeed run under the city proper. The Tunnels may connect to the underground ruins of &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe%27s%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Gazlowe's Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt;, or to other caves in Durotar (even the volcanic &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; beneath Orgrimmar)."}

As he had done some legwork already, he believed that &lt;a href=\"Gorvold%20Ironbrow\"&gt;Gorvold&lt;/a&gt; was buried at &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Hill\"&gt;Shield Hill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. There with the help of Tahu, they located the grave of the vrykul and with a short ritual bring his spirit back, they spoke with Gorvold who told them his story as well as the position of the shield in a tomb of warrior kings in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrik enlisted the help of the paladin and healer &lt;a href=\"Cato\"&gt;Cato&lt;/a&gt; to accompany them to Stormheim after Tahu returned to &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in order to inform the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; of their success. On the island, they enter the tomb where they overcome any defenses in order to find the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Truthguard\"&gt;Shrine of the Truthguard&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying the champion paladin through all trials, until they eventually defeated &lt;a href=\"Yrgrim%20the%20Truthseeker\"&gt;Yrgrim the Truthseeker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Runeshaper%20Griselda\"&gt;Runeshaper Griselda&lt;/a&gt;, getting his respect and &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing their success, Orik and Cato returned to Dalaran to report to Tyrosus. Later, he was present during the reformation of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, joining their ranks to serve the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nThe Argent Crusade is here in force, friend.

The camps were guarded by &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; troops to ensure that no one escaped, and the prisoners spent their time drinking &lt;a href=\"black%20ale\"&gt;black ale&lt;/a&gt; which was given out every day along with a share of meat. Interestingly, in this version of the story it was not only the orcs that were kept in the camps, but at least their &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; allies as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; first arrived at the reservation while looking for &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; who was trying to rebuild the Horde after its defeat and lead it once again into battle against the Alliance. The Alliance placed a bounty on Hellscream's head, and Thrall came across a few wanted posters showing a picture of Grom around &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe residents of the reservation were not too friendly towards Thrall initially and it took some time for him to find the Warsong chieftain, the clan's hideout being protected by &lt;a href=\"Mugg%27roth\"&gt;Mugg'roth&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt;.

The Twilight Terror is a course will send you hurtling down from the absurd height and careening through the spikes and protrusions of the mad constructions of this spire.\nThe Twilight Hammer cultists permanently scarred this beautiful land in their quest to awaken the old gods. It does make for some heart-pumping racing though. Are you brave enough to try?\nJust breathe in that cold mountain air, dragonrider! Do you find it invigorating? The mountains of Dun Morogh are the highest in the Eastern Kingdom. The snowpack glaciers are what feeds the rivers and streams that creates the verdant fields across this land. This is the home of the Dwarven Bronzebeard Clan as well as the gnomes of Gnomeregan.\nToo bad cold air is terrible for racing. We summoned in some fire elementals to warm the Ironforge Interceptor course. They are a bit aggressive, but that is all part of the fun, right? Would you like to give it a go?\nArrrgh, matey! Welcome to Booty Bay!\nApologies. I find this town fun and charming. The ramshackle construction, the pirate ships, the wanton lawlessness of the place. I cannot help but get into character.\nNow as for the Booty Bay Blast, take care, there are a lot of tight spaces you need to fly through, from jungle trees to oil derricks. I'm telling you this because I may have placed a friendly wager with a goblin on your success. Can you help me out?\nHello, dragonrider. The Eastweald province of Lordaeron used to be beautiful before the Blight. Now, it is filled with toxic mushrooms, the strange architecture of the Nerubians, and death walks the land.\nHowever, the Plaguelands Plunge course is rather exciting. Evil architecture often has fun tower toppers to fly through. The mushrooms are spongy, so you won't get injured when you fly into it. You may not want to breathe in too deeply during the Plunge though, there are still a few plague cauldrons left bubbling. Do you want to try it?"}

{"id": "20710", "revid": "40350614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20710", "title": "Bronze dragon", "text": "Bronze dragons are dragons who have yellow-bronze scales and can breathe superheated sand. The &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; blessed the wise &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and his brood with the ability to time travel and mastery of temporal magic. Generally stoic and detached from 'current' events, they are rare to interact with mortals unless they require help in safeguarding the one true timeline. They are the leading members of the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Their nemeses are the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of bronze dragons corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s who wish to rewrite the timeline. While the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; are the flight's home, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20Desert\"&gt;Tanaris Desert&lt;/a&gt; is their province.\nThey could once see the past and future with perfect clarity, and all the countless tributaries of alternate universes and timelines. They can still travel the timeways, but don't have that perfect knowledge anymore since &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat. They've also lost the ability to control the flow of time. A growing faction of discontent within the bronze dragons believes they should change history to make a better future. &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be a part of this faction.\nLife cycle and appearance.\nBronze dragons, as with all other dragons, go through various life stages before they are fully grown. These stages are divided into &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Whelps are the children of their kind, while drakes are adolescents and young adults. The oldest of their kind become dragons, though they appear to still grow in some capacity as far older dragons are usually larger than their younger kindred. Traditional dragons look largely the same, akin to an immense lizard with four legs and wings sprouting along their spine. In their youthful stages, whelps seem to exclusively travel by way of flight, with older dragons flying or walking depending on their whims.\nSeveral of these dragons also take unorthodox forms to those traditionally found; such as the &lt;a href=\"wylderdrake\"&gt;wylderdrake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"velocidrake\"&gt;velocidrake&lt;/a&gt;. As these are specified as drakes, it is unknown what their 'dragon' forms or whelp forms would look like; though they are presumably just smaller and larger variations of these appearances. With the advent of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s being discovered; &lt;a href=\"slitherdrake\"&gt;slitherdrake&lt;/a&gt;s have also been found baring bronze scales.\nHistory.\nCharge of the Dragonflights.\nThe titan keepers charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over it. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, yet five flights, one of which was the bronze, held dominion over their brethren and were chosen to shepherd the budding world. Through the keepers, the members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, the Highfather of the Pantheon, bestowed a portion of his cosmic power upon the massive bronze dragon, Nozdormu. The Highfather empowered Nozdormu to guard time itself and police the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny. The stoic, honorable Nozdormu became known as the Timeless One.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons, when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently called the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to the world, the Aspect of the Earth, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the demons. Nozdormu was strangely absent at the time, unable to be located even by his own flight, and so his Prime consort &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, using an Hourglass holding a portion of the Bronze Aspect's power, gave much of her mate's essence toward the creation of this object, called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The bronzes joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion retreated, leaving the blue dragonflight broken in his wake.\nWounded and shocked, Soridormi and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion, but at great cost. Azeroth was sundered.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing's betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, and the bronzes were no exception. They would never again be seen in the same numbers as before. The age of Dragons had passed.\nTo ensure Deathwing would never hold power over dragonkind again, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu placed an enchantment upon the Demon Soul, so that no dragon could wield it, and hid the foul disc deep beneath the earth. The trio later visited the night elven survivors to present the devastated race a gift. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; had planted a colossal tree that scraped the heavens, within the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;new Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; that would come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Both Nozdormu and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; placed their blessings upon it. Through the World Tree, Nozdormu gave the Kaldorei the gift of immortality, telling them as long as it stood, they would never age or fall prey to sickness or disease.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nA millennia ago the bronze flight was approached by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; to assist in defeating the Qiraji during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The bronze flight initially refused but reconsidered when the insectoids attacked the fabled &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, home of Nozdormu and the bronze dragons. The bronzes joined the fight but when the combined power of the kaldorei and the bronze flight was still not enough to push back the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters, &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, heir of Nozdormu, called upon the other flights for assistance. Finally, they managed to seal the insectoids away in their city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; behind the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons suffered few casualties but the great bronze wyrm, &lt;a href=\"Grakkarond\"&gt;Grakkarond&lt;/a&gt;, was lost during one of the battles. After the war Anachronos entrusted the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; to members of the other flights, &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, keeping a shard for himself.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nIn the events leading up to the Second War, Deathwing led a powerful orc warlock named &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragon Soul \u2014 now renamed the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros used the Demon Soul to force the red Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, into submission and forced the rest of the red dragonflight to serve him or risk the death of their queen. Korialstrasz, who escaped by faking his death sought the assistance of the other Aspects to free his queen. While well aware of this, Nozdormu was nonetheless content to let the events in the mortal world unfold as they would. Korialstrasz invoked a powerful spell to transport himself to Nozdormu's lair, but the Lord of Time was less than pleased to have his peace disturbed. After listening to the red consort's plea, Nozdormu declined and decided to erase the visit from the timeline altogether. It wasn't until some coaxing from &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; that he finally agreed.\nWith the Aspects convinced, Korialstrasz waited until Nekros brought Alexstrasza and her eggs out of the fortress, just as Deathwing had desired. When Deathwing made his appearance, Nozdormu and the others arrived and proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter having the power they lost ten thousand years ago returned to them, the bronzes came out of hiding and resumed their watch of the mortal realm. Bronze dragons were once again spotted across southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and bronze agents secretly infiltrated mortal societies.\nThird War.\nLike the other dragonflights, the Bronze dragonflight did not play any significant role in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; did however encounter a group of hostile bronze whelps upon making landfall in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nTime Anomaly.\nIn the aftermath of the Third War Nozdormu mysteriously went missing yet again. The red dragon Korialstrasz received the faintest of messages from the Bronze Aspect: visions of him trapped in the time stream, a helpless prisoner of a powerful &lt;a href=\"time%20anomaly\"&gt;time anomaly&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. The red consort, along with his former apprentice &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to investigate this anomaly and were themselves caught within it along with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;. The trio was saved by Nozdormu and cast back into Azeroth, but they found themselves ten thousand years in the past during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe time travelers became entangled in the conflict themselves before another vision by Korialstrasz showed Nozdormu, fighting back against his captors by having called multiple instances of himself from different time periods to assist him. The Old Gods had been manipulating Deathwing and needed his precious Demon Soul for the Legion to succeed in opening their portal to Azeroth, in turn allowing the monstrous Old Gods to follow in their wake. The time-travelers assisted the other Aspects and Soridormi in the battle over the Well of Eternity and just managed to close the great portal, thwarting the Old Gods from escaping. Nozdormu was then able to break free from their anomaly, rejoining the other dragons, and returned Krasus and Rhonin to their proper time.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n1000 years later, Anachronos was still guarding the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, and seeked to finish the war with the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. Little did he know back then that all three scepter guardians, whether by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s or betrayal by those that would call them friend, would fall to tragedy. His agent, &lt;a href=\"Baristolth%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Baristolth of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, whom he blessed with immortality, sought a mortal champion to recombine the scepter and open the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. A transcript of the final events of the war as shown to Anachronos' chosen champion can be found in the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Pawn%20on%20the%20Eternal%20Board\"&gt;A Pawn on the Eternal Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDeep within the Caverns of Time, the brooding dragon Nozdormu awakened. Since the world was young, the bronze dragonflight has safeguarded the winding labyrinth, monitoring the shifting timeways to ensure that the delicate balance of &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; is upheld.\nThe Timeless One sensed a threat to his beloved timeways. Shadowy agents have infiltrated the Caverns of Time, attempting to sabotage three key historical events: &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s escape from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, the monumental battle of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. In the face of this overwhelming threat, Nozdormu enlisted heroes to help him prevent the fabric of time from unraveling forever. These heroes worked alongside the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; inside of the now open &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;; delving into the past to stop these attackers.\nThe attackers were revealed to be the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, a strange set of dragons that also held powers over time with unknown, at the time, goals.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the infinite dragonflight could be seen fighting the bronze dragons \"through time\" for control of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. The bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to the shrine in order to identify the leader of the infinites using a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Hourglass of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of their mission, the hourglass finished its search, revealing the long-lost &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Chronormu stated that this makes no sense, then brushed it off and said that she was glad that the Bronze Aspect is alive and well, as he had left without telling the rest of the flight \"where or when\" he was going.\nAnother timeway was attacked, this time &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Once more the bronze dragons enlisted the aid of mortals to stop the infinite dragonflight from meddling with the timeways, unsure of their intentions.\nThe bronze dragons, represented by Chromie, join as part of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, they continue to aid mortals as they battle against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s instructions Thrall and a green dragon named &lt;a href=\"Desharin\"&gt;Desharin&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; and became aware that even the bronze dragonflight did not know where Nozdormu was. Thrall, however, becomes aware of the Infinite dragonflight, and is told that his escape from Durnholde Keep was one such example of the Infinite dragonflight's attack. So Thrall and Desharin attempted to mediate on helping the Bronze dragons to find Nozdormu when an assassin - later to be revealed as from an alternate timeline - decapitates the green dragon. Thrall was rescued by a Bronze and hurled into one of the Caverns of Time portals. After a few adventures in different timelines, Thrall asked the elements to help him find Nozdormu. In that moment, an image of the Timeless One appeared before him, beckoning Thrall forward. He appeared in different times of his life, and each time, an image of Nozdormu was present in that specific \"timeline.\" Finally, he found himself into an alternate timeline. After a spirited conversation, Thrall came to the realization that there are not multiple timelines, but only one. One past, one present, and one future. He realized that Nozdormu must be trapped in all moments of time at once, and that he now knew where to find him. He closed his eyes and found himself outside of the Timeline, floating in space but not-space, with infinite portals to the timeline around him. He found himself back in the Caverns of Time with Nozdormu, and on each one of the Timeless One's scales was a portal to a moment in Thrall's past, present, and future. Nozdormu came to the realization that he became lost in time after Thrall's alternating between various events of his life, some that have happened, some that should have never happened. Nozdormu then told Thrall that every single event in Azeroth's history, all the harm that came to the Aspects, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the madness of Neltharion and Malygos, are all intertwined, orchestrated by the same dark hand. Nozdormu became stuck in time while trying to figure out who was responsible for it and to prevent it. And he realized, that the one responsible for sending Blackmoore after Thrall was himself. Nozdormu explained that in one of the potential futures, he will become the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight. He further explained that he had not yet figured out how to stop himself from becoming the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight, but made it abundantly clear that he did not wish to become it. So Nozdormu told Thrall that his next task must be to rouse Alexstrasza from her grief of losing &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;. She couldn't get over the fact that Korialstrasz would have destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater during the Aspects' fight against &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; the Bronze dragons, with Nozdormu at their front, joined the battle. However, the first thing the Timeless One urged was they all had to retreat, stating that if they had persisted, they all would have died as he had seen this in the timelines. As they fled, Nozdormu explained that they were all born as a part of something whole. And they realized that they were only four parts out of five, and as long as the fifth part remained empty, they would not be able to defeat Chromatus. So Thrall offered to give his spirit of Earth in the battle with Chromatus, so that all five spirits of the Aspects were whole once more. The four Aspects renewed their attack upon Chromatus after the ritual, but this time with a much more unified power. With their combined power, Chromatus fell, lifeless, to the ground. The Aspects attempted to destroy the husk of Chromatus but were unable to do so. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; stated that Malygos created a number of Arcane Prisons during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, and Alexstrasza decided that representatives from all the flights will watch over him, as he is not dead.\nAfter the battle, Nozdormu took the time to explain that in one of the future timeways, he becomes the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight. Stunned, the three other Aspect listened as Nozdormu explained why he was late to the final battle: He was following another thread of information. He discovered who was behind the vast and dreadful conspiracy: The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu confirmed that they caused all of the horrible events against the Dragonflights and Azeroth. He stated that he believes even himself becoming the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; leader in one timeline is caused by the Old Gods. Ysera told them all that they need to continue to fight as one, in order to avoid the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Before Thrall left, each of the Aspects gave him a scale from their hides, representing what he had done for each of them. The Bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt; told Thrall that whenever he needs the aid of the Dragonflights, he can use the scales.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Occulus\"&gt;Occulus&lt;/a&gt;, one of the bronze drakes guarding the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, became corrupted and turned into an infinite drake.\nNozdormu, now freed, aid his fellow aspects against the mad &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. He is present during the marriage of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharge of the Aspects.\nNozdormu arrives at Mount Hyjal to find &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt; and a dying &lt;a href=\"Zirion\"&gt;Zirion&lt;/a&gt;. Zirion is leaking the &lt;a href=\"%3ASands%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; which Nozdormu attempts to reverse to no effect. He is shocked to discover that his powers had been predicted and countered by equally powerful spellwork. Tick then says Zirion came from the future, the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu realized that he would descend into madness with the Hour of Twilight. He asks how Zirion was injured, and Tick answers saying that it was the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu then pleads for forgiveness from Zirion before he passes away. Zirion uses the last of his strength to look away from the Timeless One with a look of terror in his eyes. Nozdormu then ventures to Nordrassil to have a meeting with the other aspects when he explains that he killed Zirion and will become the Infinite leader. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; ponders the thought of an aspect being charged to protect their flight but then killing one of their own before Nozdormu departed.\nShortly afterwards, Ysera and Kalecgos come up with an idea of retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; from the past to vanquish Deathwing. After telling Alexstrasza, the Dragonqueen departs to tell Nozdormu. The two aspects eventually meet and discuss the plan. Nozdormu admitting that he once pondered on whether he should go back in time and save the dragonflights and Malygos. They debate on Alexstrasza's intentions but eventually agree that sometimes life must be taken in order to preserve it. Nozdormu then returns, and the aspects work out a plan which involves going to the future to defeat Murozond and open the timeways to allow them to retrieve the Dragon Soul during the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The aspects then ask &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to wield the Dragon Soul for no dragon can use it without causing themselves harm. Thrall agrees but asks if the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;short-lived races&lt;/a&gt; can assist him. Alexstrasza agrees. Not long afterwards, Kalecgos brings up the fact that the Titans blessed the aspects for a reason, to stop the Hour of Twilight, but what would become of them afterwards. The aspects establish that they are intended to preserve the gifts they were given, for time, life, nature and magic last forever.\nHour of Twilight and the End Time.\nIn order to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the only thing capable of stopping &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 from the distant past, Nozdormu and a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;, a vision of what Azeroth in a distant future if Deathwing wasn't stopped. There, the anomaly preventing Nozdormu from accessing the past is revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Nozdormu's corrupted future self. After Murozond was killed by the adventurers, Nozdormu told his mortal allies:\nThe adventurers then head through the caverns during the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;kaldorei empire&lt;/a&gt;. There, they bear witness to the betrayal of the flights by Deathwing, with Nozdormu grabbing the Dragon Soul before it falls into the Well as it begins to collapse.\nAfter the Dragon Soul was brought to the present, it had to be transported by Thrall and mortal heroes to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a place of great power connected to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, where the artifact was originally imbued. Since Deathwing learned of their intent, he and his minions converged on the temple to waylay them at all costs. At Wyrmrest the Aspects infused it with their essences once again, making it more potent than it ever was. Kalecgos altered the Dragon Soul's properties so that it would affect Deathwing. But the artifact was imbued with the essences of the four Aspects and Deathwing never imparted his into it. To use the weapon to defeat him, they had to infuse it with the power of the Earth-Warder. Thrall possessed a portion - however small - of that exact thing: the essence of Azeroth itself. After the death of the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall unleashed the Dragon Soul upon its creator. Wounded, Deathwing fled, attempting to return to the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, through the Maelstrom. Thrall, the Aspects, and the Adventurers gave chase, riding a gunship after the Aspect of Death, battling his personal escort along the way.\nAfter catching up, the adventurers leaped onto &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing's back&lt;/a&gt; and began prying the elementium plates from his back, eventually making an opening big enough for Thrall to blast a hole into Deathwing's chest with the Dragon Soul, causing Deathwing to crash into the Maelstrom. The defenders of Azeroth briefly rejoiced at having rid themselves of the Destroyer, but Deathwing rose from the Maelstrom.\nWithout his armor, Deathwing's molten form began to mutate, granting him a form far more terrifying than before. The &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;final battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; began in earnest, until one final surge of power from the Dragon Soul, infused with the complete essence of each Aspect, completely obliterated Deathwing, with Nozdormu using all his power to bind the moment in time and prevent the killing blow from ever being undone. After Deathwing's death, the remaining Aspects, having fulfilled their duty and expending all that remained of their ancient powers, became mortal. The glow in the Aspects eyes faded and the &lt;a href=\"%3ASands%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; from Nozdormu's broken spaulder pour into his hand. With the loss of Nozdormu's powers, the Dragon Soul was returned back in time to the point where it was taken.\nDawn of the Aspects (present).\nAdhering to their tradition to meet when the two moons of Azeroth were at a particular cycle, Nozdormu and the other former Aspects gathered together. When &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; reports that the timeways appear to be a state of flux, possibly due to the moment of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;'s taking from the ancient past, Nozdormu states resolutely that the timeways are no longer the bronze dragonflight's concern, beyond his current ability to control, and thus fall now to the responsibility of the mortal races to protect. At the end of the brief meeting Nozdormu, along with Alexstrasza and Ysera, decided that they would officially end the Accord one month from now, to the shock of Kalecgos.\nLater on, Nozdormu and the others responded Kalecgos's request for a meeting, where using an artifact from Watcher Tyr reminded them about their past battle against Galakrond and that they didn't need to be aspects to help safeguard the world. Agreeing with him, the other three decided to continue their affairs in protecting Azeroth and that the Accord would continue. They also swore Kalecgos to secrecy about the nature of Galakrond, as they did not want anyone to follow in his dark path.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe Bronze dragons play relatively no role in the story of the expansion towards the end. Chromie, as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt;, refers adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; and gives them a pocket watch to take them there.\nThey meet with &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt;; where he and a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt; were carrying out an investigation on the mysterious properties of the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;. As it was a place where both the flow of time and causality have halted, it was within their realm of inspection. There he befriended &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and tasked the player with helping him empower and refine an artifact of his own creation: the hourglass known as the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the following weeks, the player used the hourglass to witness visions of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and two potential futures: one in which Kairoz observed the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat from afar, and another in which Garrosh has destroyed &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and murdered those who opposed his reign.\nKairoz then directed the player to use the hourglass at a crux of intersecting timeways in the cellar of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Tiger%20Temple\"&gt;White Tiger Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where it showed a vision of Anduin visiting an imprisoned Garrosh. With the artifact nearly complete, Kairoz hesitantly asked the player to take the hourglass to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. There, the player experienced a final vision in which Kairoz stood over the slain body of &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, the prime consort of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Kairoz bid the player to tell no one of these potential futures lest they alter the course of time, and vowed to complete the Vision of Time to learn what the future truly holds.\nWar Crimes.\nDuring the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Chromie works with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; while her companion &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; works with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them use an hourglass created by Kairoz, the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, to show the court points in history without relying solely on the possibly faulty memories of witnesses.\nUnbeknownst to Chromie, after the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Kairoz secretly sent a message to &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and tasked her with gathering up &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt;. He later provided her and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragon&lt;/a&gt; mounts.\nDuring the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, Kairoz and his fellow bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; introduced the Vision of Time as a means of providing hard facts about past events without relying on possibly incorrect memories. Kairoz worked with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; throughout the trial, while Chromie worked with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Near the end of the trial, however, Kairoz tinkers with the Vision of Time, and Chromie begins to grow suspicious. After confronting him about it, Chromie is locked inside a prison cell and unable to prevent Kairoz from freeing Garrosh and escaping to thirty-five years in the past.\nAfter Chromie is freed from her prison cell, she gathers up the pieces of the now-shattered Vision of Time, destroyed during Kairoz's time travel. After aiding in the fight of several alternate timeline counterparts to heroes of Azeroth, an angry and defeated Chromie explains to the assembled leaders at the trial that a growing faction of discontent within the Bronze dragons believes they should change history to make a better future, though Chromie isn't sure herself what a better future even is now that they can no longer see history with clarity following Deathwing's defeat. Kairoz appears to be a part of this faction.\nAs the trial reached its end, Kairoz summoned multiple alternate timeline versions of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s heroes that fight their original counterparts, causing chaos in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; and distracting everyone while he activated the Vision of Time and escaped with Garrosh through a time portal. This action broke the Vision of Time, and Kairoz was only able to take a small fragment through the portal with him.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nKairoz brought Garrosh to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, thirty-five years in the past, where they watched from a hilltop as led a band of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s through .\nKairoz revealed that he had brought Garrosh to a timeway similar to the past of their own, but \"not a perfect mirror image.\" In order to blend in, he transformed himself into an orc. Believing that Azeroth isn't strong enough to take on the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; alone, he explained that his plan was for Garrosh to help him gather the orcs into a &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to Azeroth to fight against the Legion. However, Kairoz was not satisfied with just one Horde free of demonic taint: he wanted to cultivate an infinite number of Hordes drawn from all the timeways. His fatal error came when he turned his back on Garrosh, who immediately stabbed Kairoz to death with the shard of the Vision of Time.\nChromie travels to the &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate&lt;/a&gt; to help hunt down Kairoz. She apparently feels guilty she did not see Kairoz's betrayal coming. She helps &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s follow Kairoz's trail to the &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Glade\"&gt;Time-Lost Glade&lt;/a&gt; in , only to find that he has already been slain by Garrosh. Kairoz's spirit, thinking that he is still facing Garrosh, attacks her and her companions in &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20Bronze\"&gt;Tarnished Bronze&lt;/a&gt;. Chromie attempts to understand Kairoz's actions and he claims that if he were to gain unlimited access to all alternate timelines, he and the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; could truly achieve infinite power, both for themselves and for the coming battle with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Kairoz's spirit is defeated and laid to rest. Chromie tells Khadgar she wishes to help mend the damage Kairoz caused.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion%23Tanaris\"&gt;Legion invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Tanaris, the entrance to the cavern was sealed by a protective barrier and defended with the help of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon the invasion being successfully pushed back, the barrier was lifted.\nChromie called for help from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to come to Wyrmrest Temple, where she revealed to an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; that she would die in the near future (though some time before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;). In order to figure out the circumstances of her death, she had asked the adventurer for help. It's not that she did not want to die, it's that this wasn't how she was supposed to die. She had seen her death and knew it happened much later than this attack. Meddling with the timeways for personal reasons goes against everything the bronze dragonflight stands for.\nThe two traveled to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; right before her time of death and approached Chromie's future self, but just as they did so the assassination was carried out, and future Chromie died in the magical assault. Chromie and the adventurer thus traveled this time to several minutes before the attack, and asked &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Itharius\"&gt;Lord Itharius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and future Chromie if they had seen anything odd. They each pointed out a particular issue they were encountering in regard to the various dragonshrines across &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Before they could set out for the shrines, the attack came and her future self died, again.\nUnfortunately for whoever was fixated on Chromie's death, she was \"a fairly skilled master of the timeways\" with the advantage of trying again and again. As Chromie attempted to travel to four hours before the attack for ample time to investigate, she found something blocking her from accessing that particular moment. An hour before her death was likewise blocked, prompting Chromie to comment that whoever was behind the attack had done their homework. The best she could manage was fifteen minutes before the attack.\nChromie and the adventurer faced &lt;a href=\"Zorathides\"&gt;Zorathides&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talar%20Icechill\"&gt;Talar Icechill&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalas%20Vylethorn\"&gt;Thalas Vylethorn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Gargantuan\"&gt;Void Gargantuan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, all four of which dropped chronoshards. The chronoshards all led to various points that Chromie had been to in her past or future: &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Andorhal, they arrived in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;a battle&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with both sides also trying to kill her. The Chromie of that time was trapped in a building due to a cannon aimed directly at her, and so the adventurer and present Chromie took it out, allowing the past Chromie to leave. At &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt; on Mount Hyjal, they found Chromie's past self nearly dead and fended off attacking &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s until she could recover and leave. At the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, demons of the Legion attempted to strike Chromie and the adventurer down as soon as they arrived. The two fought their way to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt; and defeated a &lt;a href=\"terrorguard\"&gt;terrorguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Grolethax\"&gt;Grolethax&lt;/a&gt;. In Stratholme they arrived shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;culling&lt;/a&gt; and helped townsfolk out until &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; arrived and began his attack. At &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Square\"&gt;Crusaders' Square&lt;/a&gt; they battled &lt;a href=\"Nezar%27Azret\"&gt;Nezar'Azret&lt;/a&gt;, who had captured the past Chromie in webbing. She was freed after the battle.\nIn the end, they never learn who was behind the attacks, though the timelines are restored to normal.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; sought to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mag'har orc clans&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; saved from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. However, the shard of &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; in his possession was depleted of its energy and thus the Horde turned to the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to see if they would help them in their quest. Upon being approached by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde champion&lt;/a&gt;, Anachronos merely remarked that the time had come for their visit. Agreeing to aid the Horde in their quest, Anachronos had the shard of the Vision of Time empowered by defeating the echoes of &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the defeat of Hellscream's echo, Anachronos revealed that he sensed the threads of fate upon the Horde champion and proclaimed that they were worthy of what is to come next and that had there been any doubt he would have never allowed the shard to fall into the &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;wrong hands again&lt;/a&gt;.\nChromie later visited &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the island and allied with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Chromie revealed to adventurers that during her travels to possible futures, she had discovered a place much like &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt;, but different. In this other time and place, very little was left alive, everything was machines. She then ordered them to travel to this other place and scan the memory banks of the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Giant\"&gt;Clockwork Giant&lt;/a&gt;s, in order to use their data to ensure that their Rustbolt never becomes like the other place.\nChromie later journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; where she joined with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; in empowering the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nChromie can be found near the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Timewalking%20Campaigns\"&gt;Timewalking Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;'s quest for information on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, he turned to Nozdormu for aid. However, Nozdormu refused to even grant him an audience. After the Dragon Isles were awakening, he and the bronze dragons joined the other dragons at the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nForbidden Reach.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Dragon Aspects' ancient enemies called the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, breaks free of her prison, Nozdormu travels to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; to confront her. Though she escapes, Nozdormu tells the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; that had been slumbering on the island to go and warn the kingdoms of the world of her threat.\nLegacies.\nNozdormu encounters the dracthyr &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; and helps her with her amnesia by informing her of the history of dragonkind. He also enabled her help in order to discover a moment in history blocked from him, which turned out to be the exact moment &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; fell to the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; as he used their power to defeat and seal Raszageth.\nDragon Isles.\nNozdormu later convened with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to discuss Raszageth's return. Though concerned about her freeing the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu was most concerned about the potential release of &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; and his hunger. Thus the decision was made that the Aspects would seek to reclaim their lost powers.\nSometime later, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; would inform him and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; of his battle against &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;. In the subsequent meeting, Kalecgos revealed that while &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; was fended off her storms still persisted around the &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt;' tower. In return, Alexstrasza voiced her confusion on the matter as the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; were not imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; and wondered what else she could be after, turning to Nozdormu for insight. However, he revealed that his vision was still clouded and remarked that for all he knew, the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; could be within &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the aspects decided that they had to protect their home and search out any Primalists within the city. A wise precaution as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Drine\"&gt;Captain Drine&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer discovered that Primalists had infiltrated into the city and were seeking to create discontent against the Aspects.\nAt the bronze flight's base in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Conflux\"&gt;Temporal Conflux&lt;/a&gt;, the infinite dragonflight attacked and attempted to corrupt Nozdormu into Murozond. During the fighting, &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; and the infinite dragon &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; were lost in time. Nozdormu, &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andantenormu\"&gt;Andantenormu&lt;/a&gt;, and an adventurer chased them across time to save them. Soridormi led the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Tomorrow\"&gt;possible future where the Primalists won&lt;/a&gt; to find her. After returning to the present, Nozdormu allowed Eternus to leave for now because she had helped Chromie get home. Eternus did leave, but promised that she would corrupt Nozdormu eventually.\nNozdormu agreed with her conclusion, and resigned to his fate, knew that the day in which he would become Murozond was coming soon. He asked Chromie when the time came to do what had to be done, and Chromie said that she would find another way. Despite Nozdormu insisting that his fate was inevitable, Chromie said that she would search every timeline for a way to save him. With a smile and his confidence restored, Nozdormu told her how proud he had always been of her.\nIn a titan sanctum decorated with runes mentioning &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, an adventurer found a &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Duty\"&gt;swirling sphere&lt;/a&gt; which seemed to whisper Nozdormu's name. Upon delivering it to the Aspect, Nozdormu recognized the sphere and thought it had been lost. He recounted how after he had been empowered by Aman'Thul, great secrets had been revealed to him. He captured that knowledge within the sphere: an echo of what is, what has been, and what must always be. He hid the sphere away in a corner of every timeline so that he would always remember those words, even after he reached his fate.\nWith the Bronze Oathstone restored, Nozdormu and the adventurer returned to Valdrakken and informed Alexstrasza that all the oathstones were now active.\nSometime later Alexstrasza decided to show their mortal allies the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; had left in their possession long ago, which served as a symbol of unity and friendship to the dragonflights. However as she revealed to it, Kalechos noted that it pulsed with magic, which was a surprise to her and Nozdormu, who thought it was an example of the scale simple changing in their absence. However, Alexstrasza believed that their return to the Dragon Isles had awakened the scale, that Tyr had left them on last enigma for them to investigate. Thus she directed &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers with venturing to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; for answers.\nAs the pair investigated, they ultimately awaken the magic within Tyrhold by placing the scale within and subsequently used the scale to draw out the secrets about the place. They ultimately created a spark, whose creation was felt by Kalecgos, who shared it with his fellow aspects, and the trio departed from Valdrakken to join the pair at Tyrhold. After witnessing a memory of Tyr's departure from the original five aspects, Nozdormu reflected on how the bronze dragonflight tended to forget it can be pleasant to linger on certain moments and admitted that he missed Tyr. After Alexstrasza expressed her hope that Tyr would be proud of their accomplishments and that \"dragonkind thrives\", they were group were would be stunned when the spark reacted to that statement and revealed a message from Tyr directing them to reactivate the forge within Tyrhold, while revealing that the Silver Scale was the key. Following this deed being done, the silver scale was placed within the forge, where to the shock of all present it had forged a new lifeless body of Tyr, himself. Though noting that the body didn't have the spark of life, Alexstrasza couldn't help but be overcome with gratitude that a long-lost friend had been returned to them, and expressed that they must do what they could to restore his true self.\nAfter sensing Alexstrasza's attempt at using the Mother Oathstone to restore their aspectral powers, Nozdormu quickly returned to Tyrhold. However, upon his arrival she was nowhere to be informed, having rushed off in an attempt to stop Raszageth from breaking into the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; to free her fellow &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; from their prison. Fearing that the timeways will bend to a dark future for all of Azeroth should Raszageth succeed, he sent adventurers to regroup with Alexstrasza, who revealed that she was unable to stop Raszageth from breaking into the vault. While he and the Dragon-Queen planned for whatever is to come, Kalecgos, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers were into the vault to stop her.\nIn time he was informed that while Raszageth was slain, she had successfully freed her siblings. Upon hearing this news Nozdormu found that his vision was still clouded but sensed a dark future was coming, which causes Alexstrasza to reflect that Raszageth's reckless haste had caused her death and that the other Incarnates would not make the same mistake. Khadgar noticed that they were particularly concerned with &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;'s release over the others, causing the pair to reveal that while &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; were loyal to the Primalists ideals, it was Iridikron who had truly devoted himself to the war, striking dark bargains to do so. However, Kalecgos rallied them together by reminding them that only together do they have a chance at victory. Thus the group vowed to move forward together as one against the Incarnates and were determined to protect Azeroth.\nIn the RPG.\nA mature bronze dragon is the adult phase of a bronze &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s lifecycle, between &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20drake\"&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt; and becoming a &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20wyrm\"&gt;wyrm&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nBronze dragons are smaller and more agile than dragons of the other flights, and they appear to be built for speed rather than stamina. Their bodies are thin and dexterous, with scales almost metallic in appearance. The quality of their scales is such that they are sometimes mistaken for constructs or detailed statuary. Bronze dragons are fastidious, keeping their mesh-like scales clean and shining at all times. The dragon is long and slender, its scales glinting with a metallic sheen. A spiky bone ridge runs down its back and forms a wicked point at the end of its tail. Its forms shimmers from golden yellow to rich orange in the sunlight as it darts through the air. \nBronze dragons prefer to use their spell-like abilities and breath weapon to confuse and scatter enemies. Afterward, they approach foes singly, swooping from the air or fighting on the ground depending on which approach offers the best tactical advantage. Bronzes can also be very patient, watching from afar until a target lets down its guard.\nAge Cycle.\nBronze whelps are the small, intelligent children of the bronze dragonflight. Just a shade smaller than the children of the other flights, they learn to compensate with extreme speed \u2014 but this fact isn\u2019t immediately apparent from looking at them. Bronze whelps are among the most patient of all living creatures, and on an initial encounter, they aren\u2019t likely to move for several minutes unless threatened. At first, the dragon seems almost like a statue; its metallic scales gleam in the sunlight as if freshly polished. However, the strange, statuesque creature clearly watches, almost perfectly still except for its faintly glowing eyes. They are highly curious, observing anything they find interesting from a distance at first, and then from closer if necessary. They are friendly to humanoid races, but they may seem a bit distant or egotistical.\nA bronze whelp attempts to maneuver around its opponent to use its breath, staying as far away as possible. If seriously threatened, it uses defensive magic and retreats.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;brood of Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; has traditionally been one of the closest to mortal societies, although few realize this fact. Though many &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;s went into hiding when &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; once again began capturing the eggs of other &lt;a href=\"Dragonflight\"&gt;flights&lt;/a&gt;, some bronzes remain near human cities, often in the guise of a human or elf. Bronze dragons are concerned with making sure the flow of time is properly maintained, but some also lend a hand to mortal society and help maintain the safety of the world at large. Generally, bronze dragons are aloof and introspective, constantly thinking and debating options in their minds. The dragon watches from a distance, little emotion showing on its features. Its scales are pristine and beautiful, but as one stares into them, they seem almost to shift on the dragon\u2019s form. After a few moments of disorientation, one may turn their gaze back to the dragon\u2019s eyes: The magnificent creature seems to smile slightly.\nBronze drakes are extremely swift to strike in combat, seeking to catch their opponents off guard. They initiate combat with spell-like abilities or breath weapon, depending on the situation, moving into melee only if necessary. If outnumbered or severely wounded, they retreat as quickly as they were attacked, preferably with the aid of magic.\nBronze dragons speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;, and many speak other languages as well.\nBronze whelps speak Common and Draconic.\nCulture.\nBronze dragons are often solitary creatures. They can best be described as aloof and introspective, constantly thinking and debating options in their mind. Bronze dragons are often seen near humanoid civilization. They disguise themselves and join mortal societies for extended periods of time, often without ever revealing their true identities, possibly for the reason of research or simply because they enjoy doing so. Bronzes will sometimes become actively involved with the communities they have joined and will lend a hand in order to maintain the safety of the present world at large. They keep watch over occupied regions to watch the development of other races and monitor how events impact the progress of fate.\nHistory.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; the bronze dragons were numerous and co-existed peacefully with the other dragonflights, working together to safeguard their world. But this age would not last forever.\nIn the early years following the sundering, is said that Deathwing's black flight attempted to subjugate the bronze dragons. The assault was unsuccessful, primarily because the bronze dragons did not stay and fight as expected. His command of time offering insight into the blacks' plans, Nozdormu alerted his flight of the danger. The bronze dragonflight scattered to the four corners of the globe, where they continued to monitor events and maintain watch over the mortal realm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, bronze dragons were stationed at &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where they, along with the reds, blues, and greens, guarded the World Tree from another attack by the remnants of the Burning Legion in &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; blessed the wise &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and his brood with the ability to time travel and mastery of temporal magic. Generally stoic and detached from 'current' events, they are rare to interact with mortals unless they require help in safeguarding the one true timeline. Their nemeses are the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of bronze dragons corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s who wish to rewrite the timeline. While the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; are the flight's home, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20Desert\"&gt;Tanaris Desert&lt;/a&gt; is their province.\nThey could once see the past and future with perfect clarity, and all the countless tributaries of alternate universes and timelines. They can still travel the timeways, but don't have that perfect knowledge anymore since &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat. They've also lost the ability to control the flow of time. A growing faction of discontent within the bronze dragons believes they should change history to make a better future.\nAfter the loss of their aspectral powers, the bronze dragonflight reformed the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt;, a group that incorporated mortals. This group aids in upholding the timeways in the name of the bronze dragonflight.\nCulture.\nBronze dragons exist to keep the time stream inviolate and the order of events progressing as the fates intended. Considered to be protectors, the bronze dragonflight find themselves greatly attracted to areas of civilization. They display great cunning in all things and are very patient by nature, always relying on observation and acting with a plan before being hasty. Bronze dragons are very sensitive to the flow and ebb of the time stream, especially Nozdormu and his prime consort &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;. From within their home, The Caverns of Time, located underneath the vast sands of the Tanaris desert, the wardens of time can often be found disguising themselves in mortal guises and entering the timestreams, which they constantly attempt to maintain and repair.\nBronze dragons are very cunning, much like blues, and value wisdom and patience over all else. Nozdormu, their patron Aspect of Time, is patience incarnate. In their duties, bronze dragons on occasion turn to mortals. A few individuals in service of the bronze flight, possibly &lt;a href=\"dragonsworn\"&gt;dragonsworn&lt;/a&gt;, refer to themselves as &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Baristolth%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Baristolth of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was dying when &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; breathed upon him and he was bound as a Watcher. &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20the%20Revelator\"&gt;Jonathan the Revelator&lt;/a&gt; was empowered by the Timeless One himself and became keeper of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;sacred gong&lt;/a&gt; and eternal watcher of the bronze flight. &lt;a href=\"Ralo%27shan%20the%20Eternal%20Watcher\"&gt;Ralo'shan the Eternal Watcher&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf forever tied to &lt;a href=\"Staghelm%20Point\"&gt;Staghelm Point&lt;/a&gt; also appears to be a Watcher. &lt;a href=\"Xarantaur\"&gt;Xarantaur&lt;/a&gt;, , a tauren druid historian was made a Watcher by &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; in order to continue his studies of mortal civilizations. These individuals have been granted immortality in order to serve the needs of their draconic patrons.\nThe bronze dragonflight's control over time is a power many would like to abuse; the infinite dragonflight has fought them often for this reason, while the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; tried to take control of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; during their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, though they were stopped before.\nBronze dragonkin are sometimes referred to as Amber. When taking a humanoid form, most bronze dragons prefer to transform into &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, though &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; guises are also common.\nMost bronzes dragons know how they eventually die. Trying to prevent this for personal reasons would be an abuse of their powers and goes against everything the flight stands for.\nNomenclature.\nMembers of the bronze dragonflight occasionally have names ending in \"dormu\" for males, or \"dormi\" for females, though &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt; exist. Sometimes terms relating to time find their way into their names as well.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Timewalking\"&gt;Timewalking&lt;/a&gt; vendors also have names differing from the usual nomenclature, such as &lt;a href=\"Mistweaver%20Xia\"&gt;Xia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kiatke\"&gt;Kiatke&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembership.\nThe bronze dragonflight is primarily made up of, as the name implies, bronze dragonkin. These include the bronze dragons themselves, but also bronze-scaled variants of &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;. Dracthyr were ultimately recruited into the flight as well from &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt;, with some also joining the Timewalkers.\nMortals serve extensively as part of the bronze dragonflight, almost more than any other. Many dragonsworn have been seen, such as the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20%28bronze%20dragonflight%29\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, after losing their aspectral powers, one of the main arms of the dragonflight, the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt;, reformed into the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt;. This group is extensively made up of both dragonkin and mortals, patrolling the timeways to keep them safe.\nHistory.\nCharge of the Dragonflights.\nThe titan keepers charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over it. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, yet five flights, one of which was the bronze, held dominion over their brethren and were chosen to shepherd the budding world. Through the keepers, the members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, the Highfather of the Pantheon, bestowed a portion of his cosmic power upon the massive bronze dragon, Nozdormu. The Highfather empowered Nozdormu to guard time itself and police the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny. The stoic, honorable Nozdormu became known as the Timeless One.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons, when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently called the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to the world, the Aspect of the Earth, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the demons. Nozdormu was strangely absent at the time, unable to be located even by his own flight, and so his Prime consort &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, using an Hourglass holding a portion of the Bronze Aspect's power, gave much of her mate's essence toward the creation of this object, called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The bronzes joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion retreated, leaving the blue dragonflight broken in his wake.\nWounded and shocked, Soridormi and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion, but at great cost. Azeroth was sundered.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing's betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, and the bronzes were no exception. They would never again be seen in the same numbers as before. The age of Dragons had passed.\nTo ensure Deathwing would never hold power over dragonkind again, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu placed an enchantment upon the Demon Soul, so that no dragon could wield it, and hid the foul disc deep beneath the earth. The trio later visited the night elven survivors to present the devastated race a gift. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; had planted a colossal tree that scraped the heavens, within the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;new Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; that would come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Both Nozdormu and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; placed their blessings upon it. Through the World Tree, Nozdormu gave the Kaldorei the gift of immortality, telling them as long as it stood, they would never age or fall prey to sickness or disease.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nA millennia ago the bronze flight was approached by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; to assist in defeating the Qiraji during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The bronze flight initially refused but reconsidered when the insectoids attacked the fabled &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, home of Nozdormu and the bronze dragons. The bronzes joined the fight but when the combined power of the kaldorei and the bronze flight was still not enough to push back the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters, &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, heir of Nozdormu, called upon the other flights for assistance. Finally, they managed to seal the insectoids away in their city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; behind the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons suffered few casualties but the great bronze wyrm, &lt;a href=\"Grakkarond\"&gt;Grakkarond&lt;/a&gt;, was lost during one of the battles. After the war Anachronos entrusted the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; to members of the other flights, &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, keeping a shard for himself.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nIn the events leading up to the Second War, Deathwing led a powerful orc warlock named &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragon Soul \u2014 now renamed the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros used the Demon Soul to force the red Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, into submission and forced the rest of the red dragonflight to serve him or risk the death of their queen. Korialstrasz, who escaped by faking his death sought the assistance of the other Aspects to free his queen. While well aware of this, Nozdormu was nonetheless content to let the events in the mortal world unfold as they would. Korialstrasz invoked a powerful spell to transport himself to Nozdormu's lair, but the Lord of Time was less than pleased to have his peace disturbed. After listening to the red consort's plea, Nozdormu declined and decided to erase the visit from the timeline altogether. It wasn't until some coaxing from &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; that he finally agreed.\nWith the Aspects convinced, Korialstrasz waited until Nekros brought Alexstrasza and her eggs out of the fortress, just as Deathwing had desired. When Deathwing made his appearance, Nozdormu and the others arrived and proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter having the power they lost ten thousand years ago returned to them, the bronzes came out of hiding and resumed their watch of the mortal realm. Bronze dragons were once again spotted across southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and bronze agents secretly infiltrated mortal societies.\nThird War.\nLike the other dragonflights, the Bronze dragonflight did not play any significant role in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; did however encounter a group of hostile bronze whelps upon making landfall in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nTime Anomaly.\nIn the aftermath of the Third War Nozdormu mysteriously went missing yet again. The red dragon Korialstrasz received the faintest of messages from the Bronze Aspect: visions of him trapped in the time stream, a helpless prisoner of a powerful &lt;a href=\"time%20anomaly\"&gt;time anomaly&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. The red consort, along with his former apprentice &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to investigate this anomaly and were themselves caught within it along with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;. The trio was saved by Nozdormu and cast back into Azeroth, but they found themselves ten thousand years in the past during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe time travelers became entangled in the conflict themselves before another vision by Korialstrasz showed Nozdormu, fighting back against his captors by having called multiple instances of himself from different time periods to assist him. The Old Gods had been manipulating Deathwing and needed his precious Demon Soul for the Legion to succeed in opening their portal to Azeroth, in turn allowing the monstrous Old Gods to follow in their wake. The time-travelers assisted the other Aspects and Soridormi in the battle over the Well of Eternity and just managed to close the great portal, thwarting the Old Gods from escaping. Nozdormu was then able to break free from their anomaly, rejoining the other dragons, and returned Krasus and Rhonin to their proper time.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n1000 years later, Anachronos was still guarding the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, and seeked to finish the war with the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. Little did he know back then that all three scepter guardians, whether by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s or betrayal by those that would call them friend, would fall to tragedy. His agent, &lt;a href=\"Baristolth%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Baristolth of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, whom he blessed with immortality, sought a mortal champion to recombine the scepter and open the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. A transcript of the final events of the war as shown to Anachronos' chosen champion can be found in the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Pawn%20on%20the%20Eternal%20Board\"&gt;A Pawn on the Eternal Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDeep within the Caverns of Time, the brooding dragon Nozdormu awakened. Since the world was young, the bronze dragonflight has safeguarded the winding labyrinth, monitoring the shifting timeways to ensure that the delicate balance of &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; is upheld.\nThe Timeless One sensed a threat to his beloved timeways. Shadowy agents have infiltrated the Caverns of Time, attempting to sabotage three key historical events: &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s escape from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, the monumental battle of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. In the face of this overwhelming threat, Nozdormu enlisted heroes to help him prevent the fabric of time from unraveling forever. These heroes worked alongside the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; inside of the now open &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;; delving into the past to stop these attackers.\nThe attackers were revealed to be the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, a strange set of dragons that also held powers over time with unknown, at the time, goals.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the infinite dragonflight could be seen fighting the bronze dragons \"through time\" for control of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. The bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to the shrine in order to identify the leader of the infinites using a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Hourglass of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of their mission, the hourglass finished its search, revealing the long-lost &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Chronormu stated that this makes no sense, then brushed it off and said that she was glad that the Bronze Aspect is alive and well, as he had left without telling the rest of the flight \"where or when\" he was going.\nAnother timeway was attacked, this time &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Once more the bronze dragons enlisted the aid of mortals to stop the infinite dragonflight from meddling with the timeways, unsure of their intentions.\nThe bronze dragons, represented by Chromie, join as part of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, they continue to aid mortals as they battle against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s instructions Thrall and a green dragon named &lt;a href=\"Desharin\"&gt;Desharin&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; and became aware that even the bronze dragonflight did not know where Nozdormu was. Thrall, however, becomes aware of the Infinite dragonflight, and is told that his escape from Durnholde Keep was one such example of the Infinite dragonflight's attack. So Thrall and Desharin attempted to mediate on helping the Bronze dragons to find Nozdormu when an assassin - later to be revealed as from an alternate timeline - decapitates the green dragon. Thrall was rescued by a Bronze and hurled into one of the Caverns of Time portals. After a few adventures in different timelines, Thrall asked the elements to help him find Nozdormu. In that moment, an image of the Timeless One appeared before him, beckoning Thrall forward. He appeared in different times of his life, and each time, an image of Nozdormu was present in that specific \"timeline.\" Finally, he found himself into an alternate timeline. After a spirited conversation, Thrall came to the realization that there are not multiple timelines, but only one. One past, one present, and one future. He realized that Nozdormu must be trapped in all moments of time at once, and that he now knew where to find him. He closed his eyes and found himself outside of the Timeline, floating in space but not-space, with infinite portals to the timeline around him. He found himself back in the Caverns of Time with Nozdormu, and on each one of the Timeless One's scales was a portal to a moment in Thrall's past, present, and future. Nozdormu came to the realization that he became lost in time after Thrall's alternating between various events of his life, some that have happened, some that should have never happened. Nozdormu then told Thrall that every single event in Azeroth's history, all the harm that came to the Aspects, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the madness of Neltharion and Malygos, are all intertwined, orchestrated by the same dark hand. Nozdormu became stuck in time while trying to figure out who was responsible for it and to prevent it. And he realized, that the one responsible for sending Blackmoore after Thrall was himself. Nozdormu explained that in one of the potential futures, he will become the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight. He further explained that he had not yet figured out how to stop himself from becoming the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight, but made it abundantly clear that he did not wish to become it. So Nozdormu told Thrall that his next task must be to rouse Alexstrasza from her grief of losing &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;. She couldn't get over the fact that Korialstrasz would have destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater during the Aspects' fight against &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; the Bronze dragons, with Nozdormu at their front, joined the battle. However, the first thing the Timeless One urged was they all had to retreat, stating that if they had persisted, they all would have died as he had seen this in the timelines. As they fled, Nozdormu explained that they were all born as a part of something whole. And they realized that they were only four parts out of five, and as long as the fifth part remained empty, they would not be able to defeat Chromatus. So Thrall offered to give his spirit of Earth in the battle with Chromatus, so that all five spirits of the Aspects were whole once more. The four Aspects renewed their attack upon Chromatus after the ritual, but this time with a much more unified power. With their combined power, Chromatus fell, lifeless, to the ground. The Aspects attempted to destroy the husk of Chromatus but were unable to do so. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; stated that Malygos created a number of Arcane Prisons during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, and Alexstrasza decided that representatives from all the flights will watch over him, as he is not dead.\nAfter the battle, Nozdormu took the time to explain that in one of the future timeways, he becomes the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight. Stunned, the three other Aspect listened as Nozdormu explained why he was late to the final battle: He was following another thread of information. He discovered who was behind the vast and dreadful conspiracy: The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu confirmed that they caused all of the horrible events against the Dragonflights and Azeroth. He stated that he believes even himself becoming the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; leader in one timeline is caused by the Old Gods. Ysera told them all that they need to continue to fight as one, in order to avoid the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Before Thrall left, each of the Aspects gave him a scale from their hides, representing what he had done for each of them. The Bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt; told Thrall that whenever he needs the aid of the Dragonflights, he can use the scales.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Occulus\"&gt;Occulus&lt;/a&gt;, one of the bronze drakes guarding the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, became corrupted and turned into an infinite drake.\nNozdormu, now freed, aid his fellow aspects against the mad &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. He is present during the marriage of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharge of the Aspects.\nNozdormu arrives at Mount Hyjal to find &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt; and a dying &lt;a href=\"Zirion\"&gt;Zirion&lt;/a&gt;. Zirion is leaking the &lt;a href=\"%3ASands%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; which Nozdormu attempts to reverse to no effect. He is shocked to discover that his powers had been predicted and countered by equally powerful spellwork. Tick then says Zirion came from the future, the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu realized that he would descend into madness with the Hour of Twilight. He asks how Zirion was injured, and Tick answers saying that it was the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu then pleads for forgiveness from Zirion before he passes away. Zirion uses the last of his strength to look away from the Timeless One with a look of terror in his eyes. Nozdormu then ventures to Nordrassil to have a meeting with the other aspects when he explains that he killed Zirion and will become the Infinite leader. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; ponders the thought of an aspect being charged to protect their flight but then killing one of their own before Nozdormu departed.\nShortly afterwards, Ysera and Kalecgos come up with an idea of retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; from the past to vanquish Deathwing. After telling Alexstrasza, the Dragonqueen departs to tell Nozdormu. The two aspects eventually meet and discuss the plan. Nozdormu admitting that he once pondered on whether he should go back in time and save the dragonflights and Malygos. They debate on Alexstrasza's intentions but eventually agree that sometimes life must be taken in order to preserve it. Nozdormu then returns, and the aspects work out a plan which involves going to the future to defeat Murozond and open the timeways to allow them to retrieve the Dragon Soul during the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The aspects then ask &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to wield the Dragon Soul for no dragon can use it without causing themselves harm. Thrall agrees but asks if the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;short-lived races&lt;/a&gt; can assist him. Alexstrasza agrees. Not long afterwards, Kalecgos brings up the fact that the Titans blessed the aspects for a reason, to stop the Hour of Twilight, but what would become of them afterwards. The aspects establish that they are intended to preserve the gifts they were given, for time, life, nature and magic last forever.\nHour of Twilight and the End Time.\nIn order to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the only thing capable of stopping &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 from the distant past, Nozdormu and a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;, a vision of what Azeroth in a distant future if Deathwing wasn't stopped. There, the anomaly preventing Nozdormu from accessing the past is revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Nozdormu's corrupted future self. After Murozond was killed by the adventurers, Nozdormu told his mortal allies:\nThe adventurers then head through the caverns during the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;kaldorei empire&lt;/a&gt;. There, they bear witness to the betrayal of the flights by Deathwing, with Nozdormu grabbing the Dragon Soul before it falls into the Well as it begins to collapse.\nAfter the Dragon Soul was brought to the present, it had to be transported by Thrall and mortal heroes to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a place of great power connected to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, where the artifact was originally imbued. Since Deathwing learned of their intent, he and his minions converged on the temple to waylay them at all costs. At Wyrmrest the Aspects infused it with their essences once again, making it more potent than it ever was. Kalecgos altered the Dragon Soul's properties so that it would affect Deathwing. But the artifact was imbued with the essences of the four Aspects and Deathwing never imparted his into it. To use the weapon to defeat him, they had to infuse it with the power of the Earth-Warder. Thrall possessed a portion - however small - of that exact thing: the essence of Azeroth itself. After the death of the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall unleashed the Dragon Soul upon its creator. Wounded, Deathwing fled, attempting to return to the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, through the Maelstrom. Thrall, the Aspects, and the Adventurers gave chase, riding a gunship after the Aspect of Death, battling his personal escort along the way.\nAfter catching up, the adventurers leaped onto &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing's back&lt;/a&gt; and began prying the elementium plates from his back, eventually making an opening big enough for Thrall to blast a hole into Deathwing's chest with the Dragon Soul, causing Deathwing to crash into the Maelstrom. The defenders of Azeroth briefly rejoiced at having rid themselves of the Destroyer, but Deathwing rose from the Maelstrom.\nWithout his armor, Deathwing's molten form began to mutate, granting him a form far more terrifying than before. The &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;final battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; began in earnest, until one final surge of power from the Dragon Soul, infused with the complete essence of each Aspect, completely obliterated Deathwing, with Nozdormu using all his power to bind the moment in time and prevent the killing blow from ever being undone. After Deathwing's death, the remaining Aspects, having fulfilled their duty and expending all that remained of their ancient powers, became mortal. The glow in the Aspects eyes faded and the &lt;a href=\"%3ASands%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; from Nozdormu's broken spaulder pour into his hand. With the loss of Nozdormu's powers, the Dragon Soul was returned back in time to the point where it was taken.\nDawn of the Aspects (present).\nAdhering to their tradition to meet when the two moons of Azeroth were at a particular cycle, Nozdormu and the other former Aspects gathered together. When &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; reports that the timeways appear to be a state of flux, possibly due to the moment of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;'s taking from the ancient past, Nozdormu states resolutely that the timeways are no longer the bronze dragonflight's concern, beyond his current ability to control, and thus fall now to the responsibility of the mortal races to protect. At the end of the brief meeting Nozdormu, along with Alexstrasza and Ysera, decided that they would officially end the Accord one month from now, to the shock of Kalecgos.\nLater on, Nozdormu and the others responded Kalecgos's request for a meeting, where using an artifact from Watcher Tyr reminded them about their past battle against Galakrond and that they didn't need to be aspects to help safeguard the world. Agreeing with him, the other three decided to continue their affairs in protecting Azeroth and that the Accord would continue. They also swore Kalecgos to secrecy about the nature of Galakrond, as they did not want anyone to follow in his dark path.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe Bronze dragons play relatively no role in the story of the expansion towards the end. Chromie, as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt;, refers adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; and gives them a pocket watch to take them there.\nThey meet with &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt;; where he and a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt; were carrying out an investigation on the mysterious properties of the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;. As it was a place where both the flow of time and causality have halted, it was within their realm of inspection. There he befriended &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and tasked the player with helping him empower and refine an artifact of his own creation: the hourglass known as the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the following weeks, the player used the hourglass to witness visions of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and two potential futures: one in which Kairoz observed the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat from afar, and another in which Garrosh has destroyed &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and murdered those who opposed his reign.\nKairoz then directed the player to use the hourglass at a crux of intersecting timeways in the cellar of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Tiger%20Temple\"&gt;White Tiger Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where it showed a vision of Anduin visiting an imprisoned Garrosh. With the artifact nearly complete, Kairoz hesitantly asked the player to take the hourglass to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. There, the player experienced a final vision in which Kairoz stood over the slain body of &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, the prime consort of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Kairoz bid the player to tell no one of these potential futures lest they alter the course of time, and vowed to complete the Vision of Time to learn what the future truly holds.\nWar Crimes.\nDuring the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Chromie works with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; while her companion &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; works with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them use an hourglass created by Kairoz, the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, to show the court points in history without relying solely on the possibly faulty memories of witnesses.\nUnbeknownst to Chromie, after the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Kairoz secretly sent a message to &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and tasked her with gathering up &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt;. He later provided her and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragon&lt;/a&gt; mounts.\nDuring the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, Kairoz and his fellow bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; introduced the Vision of Time as a means of providing hard facts about past events without relying on possibly incorrect memories. Kairoz worked with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; throughout the trial, while Chromie worked with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Near the end of the trial, however, Kairoz tinkers with the Vision of Time, and Chromie begins to grow suspicious. After confronting him about it, Chromie is locked inside a prison cell and unable to prevent Kairoz from freeing Garrosh and escaping to thirty-five years in the past.\nAfter Chromie is freed from her prison cell, she gathers up the pieces of the now-shattered Vision of Time, destroyed during Kairoz's time travel. After aiding in the fight of several alternate timeline counterparts to heroes of Azeroth, an angry and defeated Chromie explains to the assembled leaders at the trial that a growing faction of discontent within the Bronze dragons believes they should change history to make a better future, though Chromie isn't sure herself what a better future even is now that they can no longer see history with clarity following Deathwing's defeat. Kairoz appears to be a part of this faction.\nAs the trial reached its end, Kairoz summoned multiple alternate timeline versions of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s heroes that fight their original counterparts, causing chaos in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; and distracting everyone while he activated the Vision of Time and escaped with Garrosh through a time portal. This action broke the Vision of Time, and Kairoz was only able to take a small fragment through the portal with him.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nKairoz brought Garrosh to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, thirty-five years in the past, where they watched from a hilltop as led a band of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s through .\nKairoz revealed that he had brought Garrosh to a timeway similar to the past of their own, but \"not a perfect mirror image.\" In order to blend in, he transformed himself into an orc. Believing that Azeroth isn't strong enough to take on the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; alone, he explained that his plan was for Garrosh to help him gather the orcs into a &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to Azeroth to fight against the Legion. However, Kairoz was not satisfied with just one Horde free of demonic taint: he wanted to cultivate an infinite number of Hordes drawn from all the timeways. His fatal error came when he turned his back on Garrosh, who immediately stabbed Kairoz to death with the shard of the Vision of Time.\nChromie travels to the &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate&lt;/a&gt; to help hunt down Kairoz. She apparently feels guilty she did not see Kairoz's betrayal coming. She helps &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s follow Kairoz's trail to the &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Glade\"&gt;Time-Lost Glade&lt;/a&gt; in , only to find that he has already been slain by Garrosh. Kairoz's spirit, thinking that he is still facing Garrosh, attacks her and her companions in &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20Bronze\"&gt;Tarnished Bronze&lt;/a&gt;. Chromie attempts to understand Kairoz's actions and he claims that if he were to gain unlimited access to all alternate timelines, he and the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; could truly achieve infinite power, both for themselves and for the coming battle with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Kairoz's spirit is defeated and laid to rest. Chromie tells Khadgar she wishes to help mend the damage Kairoz caused.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion%23Tanaris\"&gt;Legion invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Tanaris, the entrance to the cavern was sealed by a protective barrier and defended with the help of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon the invasion being successfully pushed back, the barrier was lifted.\nChromie called for help from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to come to Wyrmrest Temple, where she revealed to an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; that she would die in the near future (though some time before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;). In order to figure out the circumstances of her death, she had asked the adventurer for help. It's not that she did not want to die, it's that this wasn't how she was supposed to die. She had seen her death and knew it happened much later than this attack. Meddling with the timeways for personal reasons goes against everything the bronze dragonflight stands for.\nThe two traveled to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; right before her time of death and approached Chromie's future self, but just as they did so the assassination was carried out, and future Chromie died in the magical assault. Chromie and the adventurer thus traveled this time to several minutes before the attack, and asked &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Itharius\"&gt;Lord Itharius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and future Chromie if they had seen anything odd. They each pointed out a particular issue they were encountering in regard to the various dragonshrines across &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Before they could set out for the shrines, the attack came and her future self died, again.\nUnfortunately for whoever was fixated on Chromie's death, she was \"a fairly skilled master of the timeways\" with the advantage of trying again and again. As Chromie attempted to travel to four hours before the attack for ample time to investigate, she found something blocking her from accessing that particular moment. An hour before her death was likewise blocked, prompting Chromie to comment that whoever was behind the attack had done their homework. The best she could manage was fifteen minutes before the attack.\nChromie and the adventurer faced &lt;a href=\"Zorathides\"&gt;Zorathides&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talar%20Icechill\"&gt;Talar Icechill&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalas%20Vylethorn\"&gt;Thalas Vylethorn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Gargantuan\"&gt;Void Gargantuan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, all four of which dropped chronoshards. The chronoshards all led to various points that Chromie had been to in her past or future: &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Andorhal, they arrived in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;a battle&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with both sides also trying to kill her. The Chromie of that time was trapped in a building due to a cannon aimed directly at her, and so the adventurer and present Chromie took it out, allowing the past Chromie to leave. At &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt; on Mount Hyjal, they found Chromie's past self nearly dead and fended off attacking &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s until she could recover and leave. At the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, demons of the Legion attempted to strike Chromie and the adventurer down as soon as they arrived. The two fought their way to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt; and defeated a &lt;a href=\"terrorguard\"&gt;terrorguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Grolethax\"&gt;Grolethax&lt;/a&gt;. In Stratholme they arrived shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;culling&lt;/a&gt; and helped townsfolk out until &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; arrived and began his attack. At &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Square\"&gt;Crusaders' Square&lt;/a&gt; they battled &lt;a href=\"Nezar%27Azret\"&gt;Nezar'Azret&lt;/a&gt;, who had captured the past Chromie in webbing. She was freed after the battle.\nIn the end, they never learn who was behind the attacks, though the timelines are restored to normal.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; sought to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mag'har orc clans&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; saved from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. However, the shard of &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; in his possession was depleted of its energy and thus the Horde turned to the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to see if they would help them in their quest. Upon being approached by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde champion&lt;/a&gt;, Anachronos merely remarked that the time had come for their visit. Agreeing to aid the Horde in their quest, Anachronos had the shard of the Vision of Time empowered by defeating the echoes of &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the defeat of Hellscream's echo, Anachronos revealed that he sensed the threads of fate upon the Horde champion and proclaimed that they were worthy of what is to come next and that had there been any doubt he would have never allowed the shard to fall into the &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;wrong hands again&lt;/a&gt;.\nChromie later visited &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the island and allied with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Chromie revealed to adventurers that during her travels to possible futures, she had discovered a place much like &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt;, but different. In this other time and place, very little was left alive, everything was machines. She then ordered them to travel to this other place and scan the memory banks of the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Giant\"&gt;Clockwork Giant&lt;/a&gt;s, in order to use their data to ensure that their Rustbolt never becomes like the other place.\nChromie later journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; where she joined with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; in empowering the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nChromie can be found near the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Timewalking%20Campaigns\"&gt;Timewalking Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;'s quest for information on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, he turned to Nozdormu for aid. However, Nozdormu refused to even grant him an audience. After the Dragon Isles were awakening, he and the bronze dragons joined the other dragons at the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nForbidden Reach.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Dragon Aspects' ancient enemies called the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, breaks free of her prison, Nozdormu travels to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; to confront her. Though she escapes, Nozdormu tells the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; that had been slumbering on the island to go and warn the kingdoms of the world of her threat.\nLegacies.\nNozdormu encounters the dracthyr &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; and helps her with her amnesia by informing her of the history of dragonkind. He also enabled her help in order to discover a moment in history blocked from him, which turned out to be the exact moment &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; fell to the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; as he used their power to defeat and seal Raszageth.\nDragon Isles.\nNozdormu later convened with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to discuss Raszageth's return. Though concerned about her freeing the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu was most concerned about the potential release of &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; and his hunger. Thus the decision was made that the Aspects would seek to reclaim their lost powers.\nSometime later, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; would inform him and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; of his battle against &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;. In the subsequent meeting, Kalecgos revealed that while &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; was fended off her storms still persisted around the &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt;' tower. In return, Alexstrasza voiced her confusion on the matter as the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; were not imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; and wondered what else she could be after, turning to Nozdormu for insight. However, he revealed that his vision was still clouded and remarked that for all he knew, the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; could be within &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the aspects decided that they had to protect their home and search out any Primalists within the city. A wise precaution as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Drine\"&gt;Captain Drine&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer discovered that Primalists had infiltrated into the city and were seeking to create discontent against the Aspects.\nAt the bronze flight's base in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Conflux\"&gt;Temporal Conflux&lt;/a&gt;, the infinite dragonflight attacked and attempted to corrupt Nozdormu into Murozond. During the fighting, &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; and the infinite dragon &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; were lost in time. Nozdormu, &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andantenormu\"&gt;Andantenormu&lt;/a&gt;, and an adventurer chased them across time to save them. Soridormi led the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Tomorrow\"&gt;possible future where the Primalists won&lt;/a&gt; to find her. After returning to the present, Nozdormu allowed Eternus to leave for now because she had helped Chromie get home. Eternus did leave, but promised that she would corrupt Nozdormu eventually.\nNozdormu agreed with her conclusion, and resigned to his fate, knew that the day in which he would become Murozond was coming soon. He asked Chromie when the time came to do what had to be done, and Chromie said that she would find another way. Despite Nozdormu insisting that his fate was inevitable, Chromie said that she would search every timeline for a way to save him. With a smile and his confidence restored, Nozdormu told her how proud he had always been of her.\nIn a titan sanctum decorated with runes mentioning &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, an adventurer found a &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Duty\"&gt;swirling sphere&lt;/a&gt; which seemed to whisper Nozdormu's name. Upon delivering it to the Aspect, Nozdormu recognized the sphere and thought it had been lost. He recounted how after he had been empowered by Aman'Thul, great secrets had been revealed to him. He captured that knowledge within the sphere: an echo of what is, what has been, and what must always be. He hid the sphere away in a corner of every timeline so that he would always remember those words, even after he reached his fate.\nWith the Bronze Oathstone restored, Nozdormu and the adventurer returned to Valdrakken and informed Alexstrasza that all the oathstones were now active.\nSometime later Alexstrasza decided to show their mortal allies the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; had left in their possession long ago, which served as a symbol of unity and friendship to the dragonflights. However as she revealed to it, Kalechos noted that it pulsed with magic, which was a surprise to her and Nozdormu, who thought it was an example of the scale simple changing in their absence. However, Alexstrasza believed that their return to the Dragon Isles had awakened the scale, that Tyr had left them on last enigma for them to investigate. Thus she directed &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers with venturing to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; for answers.\nAs the pair investigated, they ultimately awaken the magic within Tyrhold by placing the scale within and subsequently used the scale to draw out the secrets about the place. They ultimately created a spark, whose creation was felt by Kalecgos, who shared it with his fellow aspects, and the trio departed from Valdrakken to join the pair at Tyrhold. After witnessing a memory of Tyr's departure from the original five aspects, Nozdormu reflected on how the bronze dragonflight tended to forget it can be pleasant to linger on certain moments and admitted that he missed Tyr. After Alexstrasza expressed her hope that Tyr would be proud of their accomplishments and that \"dragonkind thrives\", they were group were would be stunned when the spark reacted to that statement and revealed a message from Tyr directing them to reactivate the forge within Tyrhold, while revealing that the Silver Scale was the key. Following this deed being done, the silver scale was placed within the forge, where to the shock of all present it had forged a new lifeless body of Tyr, himself. Though noting that the body didn't have the spark of life, Alexstrasza couldn't help but be overcome with gratitude that a long-lost friend had been returned to them, and expressed that they must do what they could to restore his true self.\nAfter sensing Alexstrasza's attempt at using the Mother Oathstone to restore their aspectral powers, Nozdormu quickly returned to Tyrhold. However, upon his arrival she was nowhere to be informed, having rushed off in an attempt to stop Raszageth from breaking into the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; to free her fellow &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; from their prison. Fearing that the timeways will bend to a dark future for all of Azeroth should Raszageth succeed, he sent adventurers to regroup with Alexstrasza, who revealed that she was unable to stop Raszageth from breaking into the vault. While he and the Dragon-Queen planned for whatever is to come, Kalecgos, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers were into the vault to stop her.\nIn time he was informed that while Raszageth was slain, she had successfully freed her siblings. Upon hearing this news Nozdormu found that his vision was still clouded but sensed a dark future was coming, which causes Alexstrasza to reflect that Raszageth's reckless haste had caused her death and that the other Incarnates would not make the same mistake. Khadgar noticed that they were particularly concerned with &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;'s release over the others, causing the pair to reveal that while &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; were loyal to the Primalists ideals, it was Iridikron who had truly devoted himself to the war, striking dark bargains to do so. However, Kalecgos rallied them together by reminding them that only together do they have a chance at victory. Thus the group vowed to move forward together as one against the Incarnates and were determined to protect Azeroth."}

Long ago, the Bronzebeard clan was small. It was under &lt;a href=\"Aegrim%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Aegrim Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; that the clan began to flourish and command respect.\nRoughly 230 years ago dwarven society grew too large within the confines of their mountain cities. Though the mighty High King, &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, ruled over all dwarves with justice and wisdom, three powerful factions had arisen amongst the dwarven society. The Bronzebeard clan, ruled by &lt;a href=\"Thane\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, held close ties to the High King and stood as the traditional defenders of Ironforge Mountain. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by Thane &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited the foothills and crags around the base of the mountain and sought to gain more control within the city. The third faction, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Irons hid within the deepest shadows under the mountain and plotted against both their Bronzebeard and the Wildhammer cousins. The mountain was shared by all three factions. Tensions were held to a reasonable amount until the high king of the dwarves, &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, died. After his death and before his eldest son could be officially crowned, &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; broke out between the three clans. None know who struck the first blow\u2014Bronzebeard and Wildhammer dwarves blame the Dark Irons, while the Dark Irons blame the Wildhammers.\nAll three factions fought for supremacy, embroiling the dwarves in a civil war. The civil war raged on for many years all over &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, until one day the Bronzebeard appeared to be victorious. In their victory, the Bronzebeard banished their Dark Iron and Wildhammer brethren from the mountain. As a token of reconciliation, &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, now Lord of Ironforge, offered the now-deposed prince of the &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar%20family\"&gt;Anvilmar family&lt;/a&gt; and his descendants a permanent seat on &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge's senate&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, Madoran had the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; bridges built to maintain links with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; dwarves in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since then, the Bronzebeard dynasty's reign has in general, been prosperous. They've managed to maintain peaceful relations with the Wildhammer clan and extended diplomatic relations with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s. Their alliance with humanity would eventually be formalized in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; when Ironforge\u2019s dwarves offered to join the Grand &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; aided them in wresting control of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; from the vile &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Led by King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the city\u2019s resilient inhabitants proved to be the backbone of the Alliance forces, helping to secure victory after victory against the orcs. Ever since that time, Ironforge\u2019s dwarves have remained an invaluable part of the Alliance.\nOther members of the Bronzebeard line have branched off and made a name for themselves in their own right. &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; was believed to have perished in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; when the young &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; claimed the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. However, recent events have indicated he survived and became King of the &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;Frostborn&lt;/a&gt; under the name of &lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Stormheart\"&gt;Yorg Stormheart&lt;/a&gt;. He later went on to become an Alliance war hero in the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; is an active member of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;. He became one of the greatest explorers to ever wander the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Recognized and welcomed across the known world, Brann is one of the first dwarves to tread the unknown paths of the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s. His exploits into the long forgotten ruins and lands of ancient civilizations have made him renowned in the field of &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Magni's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;, married &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;: emperor of the Dark Iron clan and clan Bronzebeard's archenemy. Believing that she was captured and seduced via magical means by &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, King Magni sent a team to assassinate Emperor Thaurissan and rescue her. To Magni's disbelief, Moira revealed that she was truly in love with Dagran and is pregnant with his child. Their baby: half Bronzebeard by his mother and half Dark Iron by his father, makes him the heir to both the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the wake of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni&lt;/a&gt;'s petrification, Moira returned to Ironforge with her infant son &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt; to claim the throne. Backed by the Dark Iron clan, Moira ruled Ironforge arrogantly and with an iron fist. She held all the people of Ironforge hostage, which led the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to intervene. But despite Moira being a tyrant, she was still the legitimate heir to the throne and killing her would only put the succession of Ironforge into question, thus leading to more chaos and conflict. Whereas if she lived; through her and her son all dwarven clans could unite. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; agreed to spare Moira's life but stipulated that if Moira was to be a leader and unite the dwarves, then she'd have to earn her crown by earning her people's respect. In order to take into account the opinions of all dwarves, Varian called for the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, to which both both Moira and her uncle Muradin will rule alongside &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; as representatives of the three original dwarven clans of Ironforge. Despite their varying backgrounds and ideological differences, the three representatives have pledged to rule united for the good of Ironforge."}

During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, they led the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;. Today, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; heads and represents the clan, following the petrification of his elder brother, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bronzebeard clan of dwarves rules over the various clans in Ironforge and the surrounding mountains of Khaz Modan after &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; took control following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stoic dwarves of Ironforge are an ancient race of robust humanoids who live beneath the snow-capped mountains of Khaz Modan. The dwarves under their command have always been fast allies with the Humans, and they revel in the prospects of battle and storytelling alike.\nHistory.\nThe hardy dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; lived in peace for many long centuries. Long ago, the Bronzebeard clan was small. It was under &lt;a href=\"Aegrim%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Aegrim Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; that the clan began to flourish and command respect.\nRoughly 230 years ago dwarven society grew too large within the confines of their mountain cities. Though the mighty High King, &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, ruled over all dwarves with justice and wisdom, three powerful factions had arisen amongst the dwarven society. The Bronzebeard clan, ruled by &lt;a href=\"Thane\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, held close ties to the High King and stood as the traditional defenders of Ironforge Mountain. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by Thane &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited the foothills and crags around the base of the mountain and sought to gain more control within the city. The third faction, the Dark Iron clan, was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Irons hid within the deepest shadows under the mountain and plotted against both their Bronzebeard and the Wildhammer cousins.\nFor a time the three factions kept a tenuous peace, but tensions erupted when High King Anvilmar passed away from old age. The three ruling clans went to war for control of Ironforge itself. The dwarf civil war raged under the earth for many years. Eventually, the Bronzebeards, who had the largest standing army, banished the Dark Irons and Wildhammers from under the mountain.\nHumiliated and enraged by their defeat, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Clan\"&gt;Dark Iron Clan&lt;/a&gt; vowed revenge against Ironforge. Leading his people far to the south, Thaurissan founded a city (which he named after himself) within the beautiful &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Prosperity and the passing of years did little to ease the Dark Iron's rancor toward their cousins. Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and the Wildhammer capital of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Irons were intent on claiming all of Khaz Modan for their own.\nThe Dark Iron armies smashed against their cousins' strongholds and very nearly took both kingdoms. However, Madoran Bronzebeard ultimately led his clan to a decisive victory over Thaurissan's sorcerous army. Thaurissan and his servants fled back to the safety of their city, unaware of the events transpiring at Grim Batol, where Modgud's army would fare no better against Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors.\nThe Bronzebeards have ruled the dwarves of Khaz Modan since the conclusion of the War of the Three Hammers some two centuries ago. They encountered the humans, perhaps their most important allies, ca. 1800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and at the same time the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; as the elves and humans were already allies. &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, strong supporters of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor Empire&lt;/a&gt;, had developed mighty armies that explored the mountainous southern lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this period that humans first met the ancient race of dwarves and traveled to their cavernous subterranean city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The humans and dwarves shared many secrets of metal-smithing and engineering and discovered a common love for battle and storytelling. In general the Bronzebeard reign has been prosperous: they reestablished friendly relations with the Wildhammer, restored the ancient city of Ironforge, oversaw the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; bridges, and became allies with the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s dwarves offered to join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Led by King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves of Ironforge endured years of a &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;bloody siege&lt;/a&gt;, while those that fought directly in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; offered their smithing and engineering skills to their allies, providing &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sapper%23Demolition%20Squad\"&gt;demolition experts&lt;/a&gt; and skilled &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since that time, Ironforge's dwarves have remained an invaluable part of the Alliance.\nApart from reveling in the prospect of battle, the dwarves have long been interested in uncovering the truth of their enchanted past. Due to the efforts of dwarven archeologists scattered throughout the world, much has been learned about the race's origins and the curse of flesh that afflicted the earthen. Many mysteries still remain, however, and the dwarves have continued excavating Azeroth\u2019s ancient sites for answers.\nYet these are troubled times, and since the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, even the Bronzebeards have been beset by their own share of tragedy. Near the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, King Magni's younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, was presumed dead after Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; claimed &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and Muradin returned to his homeland as a veteran of the war. A new obstacle arrives, however, when it's discovered that their king, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, was cursed with petrification during the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;. Moira Bronzebeard, the estranged daughter of Magni and wife of &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, takes over Ironforge and establishes a tyrannical reign. Her reign was short-lived, however, as she was later subdued by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and agents. After sparing the daughter of Magni, Varian proclaims that Moira and Muradin will rule with &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent further political turmoil.\nCustoms.\nThe kings of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seat\"&gt;High Seat&lt;/a&gt; have gone through many &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;scepters&lt;/a&gt; during their reigns. By tradition, the king would let certain of his top advisors and allies bear the scepter for a single day. These were rough days for the scepters, which saw the insides of taverns, were dropped off mountaintops, were used to smite &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s and so on.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Bronzebeard dwarves (a.k.a. Clan Bronzbeard) are described as &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20dwarf\"&gt;mountain dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; evolved from the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; and inhabited &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. It was ruled by High King &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; whose ties were closest to the Bronzebeard clan by blood and history.\nIronforge dwarves, Wildhammer dwarves and Dark Iron dwarves were once the same people. The problems arose when the grand city of Ironforge became overpopulated. King Anvilmar, tried to keep the peace. Eventually, of their own volition, the clans ended up living in different areas. The Bronzebeard clan remained within Ironforge, while the Wildhammer clan lived outside the city and the Dark Iron clan to dwelt beneath it. However, all the clans desired control of Ironforge. Once King Anvilmar died, the peace broke apart and the War of the Three Hammers was fought. Although tensions between the Ironforge and Wildhammer clans had been palpable since the civil war, the aid of Ironforge during the battle at Grim Batol did much to heal the relationship between the two clans.\nA short civil war erupted, and the Bronzebeard clan trumped. Intolerant of the other clans' indiscretions, they exiled them. The Bronzebeard clan took up their new home under the mountain of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, while the Dark Iron clan moved south to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the dwarves left to join the other two clans and changed their names, such as &lt;a href=\"Rumholt%20Thunderaxe\"&gt;Rumholt Thunderaxe&lt;/a&gt;'s two ancestors who joined the Dark Iron clan and took on the surname \"Pikesplitter\".\nThe Dark Iron clan eventually turned on the other two, invading their cities simultaneously. Repelled strongly in Ironforge and just barely in Grim Batol, the Dark Iron army retreated back into the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Much of all three of the clans' armies were destroyed when the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Fire Lord&lt;/a&gt;.

It attacks land and air units, and because it is the only 'hero type' unit for the race, it comes free of charge but will cost the player five food, With the description \"Capable of remaining motionless for years at a time, once roused the fury of the Brood Queen is unmatched\". Its seen as a huge sized, Agility based &lt;a href=\"Brood%20Mother\"&gt;Brood Mother&lt;/a&gt;, with a tint of purple in the skin. It is able to learn Impale, Carrion Swarm, Siphon Mana and Starfall. The Brood Queen also comes with Web, although it is unavailable due to it needs researched in the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. \nHero names.\nAkasha, Maharet, Mekare, Pandora.\nSpells and abilities.\nImpal.\nNotes: Airborne units can take damage and be attacked. Airborne units are untargeteable by spells.\nImpale is a powerful move - while it doesn't do a lot of damage, it temporarily stuns every ground unit it hits on its path. Try to position the Brood Queen in a position where he can impale the most units to make the most of this spell.\nTry to avoid lining up your units in a way the Brood Queen can incapacitate all of them at once. You should watch out for your Heroes though as most players tend to Impale them and finish them off while they're stunned.\narrion Swarm.\n \nCarrion Swarm can cause great damage to enemy units, especially low hit point units such as ranged units and casters. Although having its fair share of advantages over Sleep, Carrion Swarm is less effective against clusters of units and costs more mana than Sleep.\nCarrion Swarm is also useful if another allied Brood Queen in the game is using Vampiric Aura. That frees up some points you can place in Carrion Swarm since they already have Vampiric Aura covered.\nAlthough Carrion Swarm cannot damage wards, it can damage both mechanical and aerial units.\nSipho Mana.\n \nThis spell is useful at taking mana from the enemy for your own purposes. Try to cast the spell against an enemy with high mana pool; to check mana pools, hold on the Alt button - this shows all units health and mana on the visible screen. The blue bar indicates how much mana the units have. Try to use it on creeps or enemy melee heroes, as creeps will not move and enemy melee heroes tend to get stuck and have trouble getting out of the Siphon Mana's range.\nSiphon Mana also works on your own Heroes (though not in the Campaign); simply have the Brood Queen target your desired Hero and he will immediately start siphoning mana to them. Use this on heroes like &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to keep their mana pool replenished so they can cast Holy Light.\nAs a channeled ability, forcing the Brood Queen to move or stunning him stops the Siphon Mana immediately. Running the targeted unit out of range also ends the spell prematurely.\nStarall (Ultimate).\nStarfall is great at killing units. If you use potions it will interrupt the Starfall.\nStarfall damage vs. buildings is reduced to 35%.\nStarfall hits units automatically without the caster having to aim. This means it's not really possible to avoid the Starfall unless you run away from the area.\nThe most common defense against Starfall is to run away from the Brood Queen until she is done casting Starfall.\nThis spell must be \"maintained\" to get the full effect. This functionality is applied to mainly mass damage area of effect spells. For example, if you cast an Earthquake spell on an enemy town, your Far Seer must stay casting the spell until the Earthquake is finished. If you give him a new order during the spell, the Far Seer will stop casting the Earthquake. The same is the case for the Brood Queen and Starfall. Therefore, force the Brood Queen to run away by attacking her which will end the Starfall.\nYou can interrupt this spell with spells such as:\n Humans: Mountain King - Storm Bolt\n Humans: Mountain King - Bash (uncastable on air units)\n Orcs: Raider - Ensnare\n Orcs: Tauren Chieftain - War Stomp (uncastable on air units)\n Orcs: Witch Doctor - Stasis Trap (uncastable on air units)\n Orcs: Shadow Hunter - Hex\n Night Elves: Druid of the Talon - Cyclone (uncastable on air units)\n Night Elves: Keeper of the Grove - Entangling Roots (uncastable on air units)\n Undead: Dread Lord - Sleep\n Undead: Dread Lord - Inferno (uncastable on air units)\n Undead: Crypt Lord - Impale (uncastable on air units)\n Neutral: Dark Ranger - Silence\n Neutral: Goblin Tinker - Cluster Rockets\n Neutral: Fire Lord - Soul Burn\n Neutral: Fire Lord - Volcano"}

Though more straight forward than Razorgore and less touchy than Vael, Broodlord is still a very chaotic and engaging encounter. Though the actual fight with the Broodlord can and should be relatively free of adds, the entire encounter begins long before you ever lay eyes on him.\nThe suppression rooms.\nThe first room contains two groups of dragonkin, which we call a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Talon%20pack\"&gt;Death Talon pack&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Death Talon packs have been cleared, your path leads up some stairs and to a pair of interconnected Suppression Rooms.\nMuch of the challenge in the Broodlord encounter is embodied by the two mob-infested \"suppression\" rooms that must be traversed before the fight actually begins. Each room is littered with suppression traps, which must be disarmed. Guarding the traps are a colorful galaxy of non-elite dragon whelps that must be AoE'd down by mages and warlocks, which respawn after 30 seconds. Both rooms also have their own sets of patrolling elite humanoids and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Talon%20Hatchers\"&gt;Death Talon Hatchers&lt;/a&gt;, which respawn on a 20 minute timer. When the suppression traps are up, they radiate an aura that reduces movement speed, attack speed, and casting speed, to 20%.\nRogues in this portion of the encounter should be doing nothing but disarming traps. Their job is to remain in stealth and move around disarming traps so that the raid can pass through unhindered. Distract should be used as much as possible to prevent the mobs from detecting the rogues' stealth. Disarmed traps pop back up after what seems to be a random amount of time. If this is the case with a trap that the raid is near, it must be guarded and disarmed again until it is safe to leave. Please note also that from the moment a trap pops back up, it takes a second until it may be disarmed again. This process takes just long enough that the trap can release a suppression aura before it is disarmed.\nAlso important is keeping mages and warlocks alive to keep the dragon whelps under control. Hunters will be the main source of DPS against elites as caster mana must focused on killing whelps. Mages should have &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Armor\"&gt;Mage Armor&lt;/a&gt; active to allow some regeneration of mana during their AoEs, and should drop to wandshots when their mana is low. It is also a good idea to make sure mages have different types of wand damage as each color whelp is resistant to different types of magic.\nThe first suppression room is naturally the easiest, as elites can be pulled out of the suppression traps and effectively tanked in a spot that isn't being hit with periodic suppression auras. Packs should be pulled so that there is only one dragonkin left. At this point, the raid must move itself to the far southwest corner of the room, with everyone positioned so that only the nearby pack of whelps aggroes when they respawn. The time between respawns is when mages and healers can stop to regen their mana/health as well as res any fallen players who would otherwise simply be left behind.\nAfter the last dragonkin is pulled and killed, the raid moves into the hallway that connects the two suppression rooms. From this spot, the raid must destroy more groups of elites until it is safe to move into the southeast corner of the final suppression room. From here, the remaining elites are cleared and the raid moves into one of the cubby holes to prepare to pull Broodlord. Casters should drink whenever possible and healers should attempt to resurrect anyone that dies whenever they have time.\nStrategy.\nThe encounter with Broodlord, like all encounters in the instance, seems to have several ways it can be accomplished. Positioning is key, as is how fast your groups elects to dish out the punishment. Broodlord has four main attacks that you are going to need to deal with. Where your party decides to tank him and where your \"camp\" is positioned is very important due to his abilities and due to the rigors of the environment (unavoidable suppression traps and repopping dragonlings.)\nSolo strategy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Suppression%20Device\"&gt;Suppression Device&lt;/a&gt;s no longer require a rogue's &lt;a href=\"Disarm%20Trap\"&gt;Disarm Trap&lt;/a&gt; to deactivate (even though the tooltip still suggests otherwise), so players of all classes can work their way through the gauntlet. Stick to one side of the room (likely the left side) and start walking (slowly) to the far end of the room and the stairs. Click on suppression devices if they're close, but it's mostly not worth the effort as they'll reactivate soon enough. Use whatever instant attacks are available to ignore the &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"casting%20speed\"&gt;casting speed&lt;/a&gt; debuffs.\nUpstairs, again stick to one side of the room, careful to not fall off the ledge to the lower room, and get to the Broodlord. Fight him next to the gate away from the suppression devices.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It's a branch of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the cause of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor decades, the Holy Order of Northshire Clerics supported the citizens of the kingdom and ensured the protection of the realm alongside the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the clerics were slaughtered by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, their sacrifice for the kingdom would later inspired &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; to create the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the victory of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Alonsus Faol restored the clerical order as the \"Brotherhood of Northshire\". Since, its members continue to support the Church of the Light and the people of Stormwind, notably by recruiting &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to deal with threats to the kingdom, and by ensuring the training of the young paladins of the Silver Hand and the priests of the clergy.\nHistory.\nThe Holy Order of Northshire Clerics traced its roots to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago, devout clerics from the emergent Church had ventured south from Lordaeron to spread their faith in the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;continent of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reaching &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, these pious established the Northshire Abbey and become a critical component of the kingdom. The kingdom looked to these clerics as a source of wisdom and comfort in hard times, while the devout clerics used the powers of the Light to soothe the hearts and minds of Stormwind's citizens, and even helped the army of their kingdom fight through its life. The clerics had also been present on the battlefields of various conflicts, including the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, their compassion had even been granted them safety on the battlefield, as they were known to heal &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s in the past.\nOn the eve of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Age of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, a backlash of energies poured from the child, and only the combined powers of a hundred clerics and the &lt;a href=\"Court%20Conjurer\"&gt;Court Conjurer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt; were able to properly contain him, before he succumbed to a coma. Medivh was then taken to &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt; to be tended by the clerics, until he awoke a decade later, assuring them that he was fine.\nFirst War.\nBefore the events of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the mission of the Holy Order of Northshire Clerics of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; was to spread the message of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; to people of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Stormwind citizen described them as:\n\"These are the holy men of our &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Their spiritual leadership keeps both the people and the troops of Azeroth focused upon our mission of everlasting peace. Their ability to channel the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;spirit of humanity&lt;/a&gt; through their bodies makes them truly wondrous, and stories of their ability to heal the sick and injured, as well as being able to affect the perceptions of others, are miraculous in nature. The transgressions against Humanity by the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s have forced them to devise ways to defend themselves, but their true path remains the healing of men's souls.\"\nTheir pious clerics were recognized as warrior priests.\nOnce the First war had begun, led by &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20of%20Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbot of Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, the clerics joined the battle and risked their lives to heal soldiers wounded in combat. In the past, they were known to heal wounded &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, which had even granted them safety on the battlefield in some cases. This was not the case with the orcs, who ruthlessly targetted every cleric they found after learning of their abilities, as the &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s could return a wounded human to battle. Many clerics died without armor or weapons, but they never hesitated from joining battle, making their bravery legendary among Stormwind's forces who considered them as one of the great sources of hope on the battlefield.\nOutside of Northshire Abbey, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;churches&lt;/a&gt; in the kingdom were the places that housed the &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;clerics&lt;/a&gt;, as they provided a place for them to commune with the people of the land. It was the only place where clerics would come together for their ceremonies, and many could be recruited there to help rid the land of orcs. They also continued to train there to increase their understandings of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;spiritual forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the war, the &lt;a href=\"%3ATome%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;:Tome of Divinity&lt;/a&gt;, a book of great value to the Clerics of Northshire, was stolen by a rogue band of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s led by the ogre lord &lt;a href=\"Turok\"&gt;Turok&lt;/a&gt;. As the clerics asked for the retrieval of the sacred texts, Lothar undertook the quest and led an expedition into the ogres' hideout, the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to recover the tome, but were completely overrun and held captive to be killed slowly. Lothar remained imprisoned until he and his few surviving men were saved by the troops led by the &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Crown\"&gt;Defender of the Crown&lt;/a&gt; sent by the &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20of%20Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbot of Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Llane\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt;. He retrieved the Tome of Divinity and returned to Stormwind, safeguarding the book at &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. Reintroduced to the conflict, Lothar led the armies of Stormwind into battle against the orcs.\nAt some point, Northshire Abbey was besieged by a band of &lt;a href=\"brigand\"&gt;brigand&lt;/a&gt;s that had been convinced by the Old Horde to fight against the crown. The &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Crown\"&gt;Defender of the Crown&lt;/a&gt; was sent with Stormwind troops and managed to save the abbey. However, when the &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; was discovered by the clerics of Northshire Abbey and imprisoned there, she was soon rescued by the Old Horde and the abbey was destroyed.\nHowever, although brave and adept in both the healing and the destructive powers of the Light, the clerics were unprepared for the dangers of war and suffered heavy losses as time goes. After the orcs decimated the kingdom, the surviving clerics fled with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, while the High Clerist of Stormwind, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Mara%20Fordragon\"&gt;Lady Mara Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, became the patron of the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; of the war who chose to flee to the northern lands of Lordaeron, untouched by the fighting.\nLater, the site of the abbey became the headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, allied to the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nFollowing the end of the First War in orcish victory, the Archbishop of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently learned everything that had transpired in Stormwind, including how the clerics had fared, met the Supreme Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance forces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, and offered him to create a new order that would suffer less attrition in battle. Along with his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, Alonsus Faol founded the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Several clerics of the Northshire were present for the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand%23Formation\"&gt;induction ceremony&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly for the others' as well. The paladins, while still possessing spirit of the clerics who preceded them, were also mighty &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s talented in the arts of war. During the months following the start of the war, Alonsus Faol recruited knights willing to learn how to wield the Light and clerics ready to take up arms for their noble cause in order to become members of the Silver Hand.\nTo counter humanity's potent &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; and clerics, and to save his own life, Gul'dan created new types of incredibly powerful warriors for the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAftermath.\nAfter the end of the Second War, where the Order of the Silver Hand greatly helped the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to overcome the Horde's might, Archbishop Faol aided in rebuilding Northshire Abbey and helped in the creation of a new clerical order, comprised of &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and paladins, which was dubbed the Brotherhood of Northshire.\nAnother legacy of the Holy Order was the &lt;a href=\"%3AInvisibility\"&gt;:Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spell, as sacred tomes rescued from the debris of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; were later used by the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to learn it.\nYears later, the clerics of the Brotherhood were present for the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand%23Formation\"&gt;induction ceremony&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;corrupted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the surviving priests escaped to Stormwind and attempted to salvage their holy order: combining their forces with those of the clerics of Northshire, the weathered healers founded a new priesthood to guide their people in trouble times. Under the Church of Light's leadership, the Knights of the Silver Hand and the Church's clergy were reformed, while &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;, a student of Alonsus Faol, took charge of the Church as its new Archbishop and swore to continue the work his mentor had begun so many years ago.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn recent years, the clerics began to use Northshire Abbey as a recruitment and training center for any &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; brave enough to help keep the kingdom's peace, notably after &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt; has been suffering a &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt; infestation, increasing numbers of &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and the growing presence of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in the region. They also allowed &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s inside the abbey.\nAmong the members of the Brotherhood, some act as the Abbey's caretakers, while others may be copying books to add to the Abbey's library. Some take care of the formation of the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey also make sure to secure dark and dangerous books in a protected wing of their &lt;a href=\"Library%20Wing%20%28Northshire%29\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;, notably the &lt;a href=\"Powers%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Powers of the Void&lt;/a&gt; tome, which was later stolen by a novice who joined the Defias.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the clerics of Northshire helped to repel the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; invasion in the &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Vineyards\"&gt;Northshire Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;. They notably healed the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Infantry\"&gt;Stormwind Infantry&lt;/a&gt; who fought against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s, and sent adventurers to support the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20army\"&gt;Stormwind army&lt;/a&gt;. They also continue to train apprentice priests and paladins, including how to use their &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; powers.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, while not directly stated, the Brotherhood of Northshire was represented by &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Sammuel\"&gt;Brother Sammuel&lt;/a&gt; during the union ceremony of every paladin order on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into a restored Order of the Silver Hand, pledging allegiance to the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; following the death of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. \nDragonflight.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and the forces of &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Sammuel\"&gt;Brother Sammuel&lt;/a&gt; could be seen defending &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20McBride\"&gt;Marshal McBride&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining Stormwind soldiers, while &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Paxton\"&gt;Brother Paxton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Neals\"&gt;Brother Neals&lt;/a&gt; were tending to the &lt;a href=\"Injured%20Soldier%20%28Elwynn%20Forest%29\"&gt;Injured Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Injured%20Recruit\"&gt;Injured Recruits&lt;/a&gt; near the entrance to the valley.\nCulture.\nThe Clerics of Northshire once claimed their mission was to achieve \"everlasting peace\".\nThe invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish hordes&lt;/a&gt; has necessitated the clerics to change their method, in order to not protect only themselves, but the whole of the people of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The use of physical violence is not the calling of their order, but for the clerics, each force must be met with an equal force for the balance of good and evil to be preserved, so they take up holy arms to defend their lands.\nThe aiding of their people in times of sorrow, grief, and illness is the primary concern of the clerics of Northshire Abbey. This has required them to devise a way to ease the burdens of those about them, without causing another an equal burden. This has led them to use the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;spirit of humanity&lt;/a&gt; itself to heal all forms of injury or disease. They believed that the pain and injury of the one afflicted are divided amongst all humanity, making the burden easier to bear.\nThe clerics of Northshire had many specific magical spells. The &lt;a href=\"%3AInvisibility\"&gt;:Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; power was originally employed as a tool to make the confessing of secrets that weighed heavily upon the souls of worshipers easier to speak. The clerics had also developed &lt;a href=\"farseeing\"&gt;farseeing&lt;/a&gt; spells, using this divination to keep a clear perspective and see things in an all-encompassing fashion even from faraway locations. These specific incantations were transcribed to books and spread over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, with the Invisibility magic eventually taken by the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, while Farseeing ended up in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, built by the clerics of Northshire, were made with a rare wood known as &lt;a href=\"Holyoak\"&gt;Holyoak&lt;/a&gt;. Inside them, tithes had to be made for their services in order that new clerics may be trained, and other sites made sacred.\nBelief.\nIn ', they were described as worshippers of \"&lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;\", though whether or not this referred to a specific deity within a pantheon or a single deity is not known, and believed in \"&lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s\", \"&lt;a href=\"daemon\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt;s\", \"Hell\", and \"Heaven\". This is continued through into \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", with references to \"God\", \"angels\", and \"heaven\".\nSince \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\", they are shown as followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, a philosophy that does not follow any particular theology and which boils down to the three teachings called the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light%23The%20Three%20Virtues\"&gt;Three Virtues&lt;/a&gt;. As this &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; is more philosophical than theistic, its practitioners do believe their devotion connects them to a greater and mysterious force in the universe. The general ideology of the Light is to strive to be good in all actions, but also seek to be the best of oneself, and thus continue to make the world a better place.\nIn the RPG.\nThe leader of the Holy Order of Northshire Clerics during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, and his apprentice was a devout lad named &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese holy folk maintain an outpost of the grand &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; sits in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s northeastern corner, in the middle of the woods. Beyond their holy duties, the priests hunt the dangerous animals in the forest and will lead any lost traveler back to the monastery for a hot meal, a bed, flawless directions out of the woods and healing, if necessary.\nDire wolves inhabit the forest near northern &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, although the clerics and paladins of the Holy Light attempt to keep their numbers down."}

Most of the knights were killed fighting in the last battles of the war but took many &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s with them.\nA human knight deprived the orc &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; of half a leg during the conflict.\nSecond War.\nThe dark fate of the Brotherhood was a grim news to the knights of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, who during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; sworn to both avenge their fallen brethren and free their homelands from the grip of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Hordes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bodies of many of the knights of Stormwind who fell to the orcs during the First War were transformed into &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nStormwind proved an overwhelming shock to the Horde. The footmen guarding the city's entrance put up the first fight the orcs had seen, but they still managed to push their way through the gates. By the time they realized that this minimal resistance was a trap, it was far too late. Armored warriors riding beasts of pure muscle and sinew \u2014 creatures we know as &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 flanked the Horde's disorganized group, crushing warriors under the hooves of their mounts and striking down even the mightiest of orcs with their lances and blades. The orcs learned to call these mounted warriors knights and cursed the world that had cost them victory for the first time. Shamed, the orcs retreated, hounded by the leaders of the Brotherhood of the Horse every step of the way. Gul'dan concealed the final steps of the orc retreat with a wall of impenetrable fog; this simple spell may have saved the Horde from complete destruction.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Gavinrad\"&gt;Gavinrad&lt;/a&gt; was a Stormwindian knight before becoming a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; and as such he was also probably a member of the Brotherhood."}

The Brotherhood of the Light is a compromise between the Argent Dawn's more scholarly approach to fighting the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;'s fanaticism. Talking to several members of this group reveals that they have a clearly different code of ethics and morals than their brethren of the Argent Dawn \u2014 while maintaining an objective view which the Scarlet Crusade loses with their zealotry. According to Korfax, the Brotherhood existed even before the Argent Dawn.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Brotherhood of the Light's representatives, Commander &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korfax%2C%20Champion%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Korfax, Champion of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Dosantos\"&gt;Angela Dosantos&lt;/a&gt;, were originally present in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. As they were able to bridge a gap between the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn, Eligor managed to keep relations between them from turning violent, heading a meeting with Scarlet envoys led by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Marjhan\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Marjhan&lt;/a&gt; to counter an imminent attack from the Scourge. To prevent this attack, the Brotherhood sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; to slay some of the Scourge's minions.\nUpon the fall of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Inigo%20Montoy\"&gt;false member&lt;/a&gt; of the Brotherhood collected &lt;a href=\"The%20Phylactery%20of%20Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;The Phylactery of Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. Later the Argent Dawn reported that they never received the phylactery, as the traitor fled with Kel'Thuzad's cursed remains to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where the fallen lich could be reanimated.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Brotherhood of the Light was present during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, defending the chapel alongside the Argent Dawn against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;. Following the withdrawal of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, they witnessed the merger of the Argent Dawn and the Order of the Silver Hand as the Argent Crusade, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome members of the Brotherhood were among the first to plunge into the &lt;a href=\"Northrend%20campaign\"&gt;Northrend campaign&lt;/a&gt;, among them was Commander Eligor Dawnbringer who appeared at &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, instructing various &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; troops about the inhabitants of Naxxramas, and Korfax who appeared as the Crusade Commander of the Argent Crusade's troops at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Stand\"&gt;Argent Stand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite Inigo Montoy's treachery in the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who became the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thel%27zan%20the%20Duskbringer\"&gt;Thel'zan the Duskbringer&lt;/a&gt; for serving the Lich King as the traitor, the Brotherhood eventually triumphed over the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and returned to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the fall of the Lich King, the Brotherhood began their own campaign against the remaining &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with an assault force of one hundred men; attempting to reclaim the cities of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Brotherhood and the Crusade are still allied with one another, the Argent Crusade is concerned with the Brotherhood's recklessness, and their dislike to the Crusade's rigid code of ethics.\nTheir campaign concludes with the capture of Tyr's Hand from the undead, but also with the capture of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; now under the control of the Argent Crusade after the death of &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Lord Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, while not directly stated, the Brotherhood of Light was represented by Eligor Dawnbringer during the union ceremony of every paladin order on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into a restored &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Brotherhood of the Light, a smaller group within the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, has recently formed."}

They came across a &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, the same one whom Tyrande had helped &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20at%20the%20Gate%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. The other furblogs informed them that their shaman had been bitten by a spider and had become gravely ill. There was a healing well nearby, but the shaman was too sick to make the journey. They gave them an empty vial, telling them to fill it with waters from the nearby well. After dispatching several lizards around the well, they filled the vial and returned to the furblogs. The shaman was healed by the water and thanked Tyrande with a Talisman of the Wild.\nSoon the party reached the gate of the prison of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande believed that they should free Illidan as he would prove useful against the Burning Legion, but Furion thought otherwise. The two argued briefly, but Tyrande took her Sentinels with her into the prison.\nFurion was unable to open the gate, forcing him to continue his search for the Druids of the Claw. Along the way, he encountered more hostile creatures, including remnants of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s Black Dragonflight. After dispatching the Black Dragonflight, they found the druids. However, they had become feral. Not wanting to kill their brethren, Furion and his soldiers safely dispatched them with little or no harm. They eventually managed to reach the center and awaken the Druids from their &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Slumber&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader apologizes for their aggression, but nonetheless insists that they are ready for their fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile Tyrande and her Sentinels managed to rescue some Night Elf prisoners to bolster their forces and open a main gate. Maiev, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; and her lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Naisha\"&gt;Naisha&lt;/a&gt; were not present during Tyrande's assault on the prison. After almost reaching Illidans prison, she encounterd &lt;a href=\"Treants\"&gt;Treants&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that a powerful &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keeper of the Grove&lt;/a&gt; was nearby. Tyrande then managed to slay the Keeper of the Grove, &lt;a href=\"Califax\"&gt;Califax&lt;/a&gt; and free Illidan who is overjoyed to hear her voice for the first time in ten thousand years.\nFurion was not happy that Illidan is free, but Illidan pledges to help destroy the Burning Legion because of love for Tyrande.

{"id": "117302", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=117302", "title": "Shockadin", "text": "Shockadin is a sub-optimal talent spec for a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; which focuses on a more offensive Holy gameplay. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; the spec has been made more solid with plenty of offensive talents being added to the Holy tree and quirks such as the removal of cooldown on &lt;a href=\"Exorcism\"&gt;Exorcism&lt;/a&gt;. Although not optimized for raiding, both healing and dps can be done fairly well in 5-man dungeons, even if PvP is where the spec truly shines.\nMechanics.\nShockadins deal very little &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; damage, although they are capable of inflicting a high amount of spell damage in a short period of time. The most important spells for a Shockadin are &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exorcism\"&gt;Exorcism&lt;/a&gt;. As of 4.0.1, &lt;a href=\"Judgment\"&gt;Judgment&lt;/a&gt; no longer deals respectable damage and should be only used to refresh &lt;a href=\"Judgements%20of%20the%20Pure\"&gt;Judgements of the Pure&lt;/a&gt; and regenerate mana from &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Seal of Insight&lt;/a&gt;. Shockadins may also use &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt; to do surprisingly dangerous &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage, although this highly compromises mana efficiency. Preferably, &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Seal of Insight&lt;/a&gt; should be used to maximize this same efficiency, as &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;Seal of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; deals little damage. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Wrath\"&gt;Avenging Wrath&lt;/a&gt; can be combined with &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Favor%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Divine Favor (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; for a splendid burst of damage. &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Wrath\"&gt;Holy Wrath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; may be used as fillers when &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Denounce%20%28paladin%20talent%29\"&gt;Denounce (paladin talent)&lt;/a&gt; are unusable.\nThe build provides great survivability and the recent improvements to &lt;a href=\"Exorcism\"&gt;Exorcism&lt;/a&gt; allow this to be a viable leveling spec. Although having the majority of its talent points spent in the Holy tree, it's not advised to raid as a Shockadin, although 5-man content should be fairly easy in these conditions.\nGlyphs.\nThere are relatively few choices for Shockadins. All viable options are listed below:\nPrime Glyphs:\nMajor Glyphs:\nMinor Glyphs have incredibly little use for Shockadins, as all Seals and Blessings have a relatively short mana cost now. If absolutely necessary, &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Lay%20on%20Hands\"&gt;Glyph of Lay on Hands&lt;/a&gt; can be used outside arenas. The other two glyphs are optional and left to your own criteria.\nTalents.\nAs of 4.0.1, a player must spend at least 31 points in one tree before placing points in another. Protection is not currently viable for extra points usage, so Retribution will be the secondary tree you will be spending them on. &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt; is also made available at level 10, which proves a fantastic boost to Shockadins in leveling and low level PvP. The list below enumerates the talents a Shockadin may choose to spend his points on:\nKey Talents:\nOptional Talents:\nSample Builds:\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//cata.wowhead.com/talent%23schrdrduu0dZf%3AMacakocMz\"&gt;31/0/5&lt;/a&gt; - PvP-focused Shockadin spec with &lt;a href=\"Enlightened%20Judgements\"&gt;Enlightened Judgements&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaknesses.\nWhile Shockadin is a fun spec to play, it is a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none.\nIn PvP, a Shockadin is unable to provide the same level of support and healing that a true Holy Paladin would and unable to provide the same amount of damage and control that a Retribution Paladin can. Being a jack-of-all-trades can be useful in battlegrounds, where being able to respond to different situations can come in handy, but when working as part of a small team in arena, the hybrid spec simply doesn't fill any role adequately.\nThe Shockadin has no place in serious PvE. While they are perfectly capable of clearing 5-man content, they are simply not capable of performing as well as Holy or as Retribution in legitimate raids.\nDamage-wise, the Shockadin lacks several key ingredients: the most important of which is the ability to deal a respectable amount of sustained damage. The Shockadin was originally designed as a burst-damage spec in PvP, frontloading several attacks in a very short period of time to catch an opponent off guard. In PvE, the sustained damage of &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exorcism\"&gt;Exorcism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Wrath\"&gt;Holy Wrath&lt;/a&gt; simply cannot compete with anything that a real DPS class has to offer.\nGear.\nShockadins should focus primarily on reaching their &lt;a href=\"hit%20cap\"&gt;hit cap&lt;/a&gt; first, which corresponds to 6% in a PvP environment (considering your opponent is the same level as you) and 17% in a PvE enviroment (boss fights). For this effect a Shockadin must first gear for &lt;a href=\"Hit%20rating\"&gt;Hit rating&lt;/a&gt;, or, &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; if they are talented for &lt;a href=\"Enlightened%20Judgements\"&gt;Enlightened Judgements&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second most important stat for a Shockadin is &lt;a href=\"Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does Intellect provide mana, it now also boosts your &lt;a href=\"Spell%20power\"&gt;Spell power&lt;/a&gt;, improving your overall damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Resilience\"&gt;Resilience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; come up next on the stat ladder, strictly for PvP and soloing purposes, having no effect in a PvE context. However, since Shockadins are mainly meant for PvP, these stats occupy a high ranking on the priority ladders. Ignore them if you're speccing solely for PvE content.\nAs always, &lt;a href=\"Critical%20strike%20rating\"&gt;Critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt; is a nice buff, wether to PvE or to PvP. However, it remains a minor stat in comparison to the ones mentioned above.\nLastly, &lt;a href=\"Mastery\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haste%20rating\"&gt;Haste rating&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for this is simple. Most of the Shockadin's spells are extremely fast or instant, due to talent procs, which highly reduces the efficiency of Haste. Your Mastery wards you for 8% of healing done for 6 seconds, increasing by 1% for each point of Mastery. However, the ward amount continues to be minor over improving your overall healing, which places Mastery low in the stat rankings. If you must absolutely reforge, do so to gain &lt;a href=\"Critical%20strike%20rating\"&gt;Critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt;."}

They were described as mighty &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; warriors that oversee the armies of their &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; and serve as feudal lords to the general population. Shodo-Pans have the ability to wield &lt;a href=\"Geomancer\"&gt;geomantic&lt;/a&gt; powers as well as the &lt;a href=\"wardancer\"&gt;wardancer&lt;/a&gt;s' shaktani blades. The stoic Shodo-Pans' greatest enemies are the cruel &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s of southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The Pans ceaselessly work to hunt down the khans and their centaur marauders whenever they encroach upon the lands of the pandaren empire.\nIn the RPG.\nOnce, there was only one shodo-pan at any one time. Hailed as the mightiest scion of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; people and emperor of the empire, the shodo-pan was the blessed of the very spirits of the pandaren people. With the fall of the old empire, the term \"shodo-pan\" has come to reflect not a single ruler, but the heads of the various pandaren clans.\nA shodo-pan is unique, in that he straddles the two worlds - the physical and the spiritual. Though he is a capable wardancer, the shodo-pan must also understand and practice the arts of the geomancers, for there are times when the two forms of practice must overlap. In the rare times when the spirits of a place cannot be appeased, the shodo-pan must dance war against them. And, just as the geomancers minister to the needs of the spirits of the land, the shodo-pan ministers to the needs of the spirit of the pandaren people.\nThe pandaren honor and revere their shodo-pans as the living embodiment of their people's spirit. Indeed, it is said that the ancestors of the pandaren whisper in the ears of the geomancers who will be a clan's next shodo-pan. There is no nobility among the pandaren, for any of the wardancers or geomancers might be chosen as the next shodo-pan.\nWhen that happens, the prospective shodo-pan is taken away from his first discipline and taught the other. &lt;a href=\"Geomancer\"&gt;Geomancer&lt;/a&gt;s are forbidden to use their spirit-arts until they have mastered the &lt;a href=\"wardance\"&gt;wardance&lt;/a&gt;; likewise, young &lt;a href=\"wardancer\"&gt;wardancer&lt;/a&gt;s must put away their armor and shaktani warblades to learn the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Spirit%20Songs\"&gt;Hundred Spirit Songs&lt;/a&gt; of the geomancers.\nIn combat, shodo-pan are capable of bringing great force to bear, for they dance war as well as any wardancer. Yet their power is augmented by their geomantic knowledge - instead of a troop of pikemen, the shodo-pan may be aided by a gathering of rock elementals and other spirits. He may summon spirits to possess his blade, so that it strikes faster, surer, and with more deadly accuracy. The &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s are right to fear the coming of the shodo-pan."}

She is also seen on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Crimes.\nShokia, being in a deep cover, moved to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; after the Siege of Orgrimmar and was awaiting new orders from an &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;ally&lt;/a&gt; who wanted the return to the glory of the Horde. After receiving a letter asking her to go to &lt;a href=\"Drywhisker%20Gorge\"&gt;Drywhisker Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, she met &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, who was traveling the world gathering loyalists to the True Horde. The two of them moved to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; on wolfback, where they recruited &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;. From there the trio traveled to &lt;a href=\"Westguard%20Keep\"&gt;Westguard Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; and freed the goblin &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt; from his imprisonment. With Harrowmeiser's zeppelin, the \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Lug\"&gt;Lady Lug&lt;/a&gt;\", the reassembled True Horde hired &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt; and met up with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to attack the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. During the chaos, Shokia scored a near-fatal shot on &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who would have died if not for the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;, though it was not clearly stated it was her, but considering only she was known/stated to be using a gun with bullets, it's highly likely it was her. Following Garrosh's escape courtesy of &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, Zaela ordered Shokia and the others to retreat.\nDragonflight.\nYears after the downfall of the Iron Horde and Garrosh's death, Shokia finally reappeared at the reinvigorated &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, initially standing next to &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;. Having wandered alone and served as both a &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; in the near decade since, she wished to return to the home and people she missed. When asked if she regretted serving Hellscream, she denied such and lamented how she thought she was doing the right thing, and Hellscream did too, though admitted it came at the cost of the other members of the Horde. Nonetheless, she believed the past was over, and defended her desire to be present at the Kosh'harg.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWe should stay here for only as long as it is necessary, &lt;class&gt;.\nWho would have thought these creatures could be reasoned with?\nI never would have thought that these grunts could be trained.\nI would have died in the Jade Forest had it not been for a pandaren mistweaver who healed my wounds after the battle.\nThese pandaren are good people and deserve our protection from the domination of the Alliance.\nI swear by my ancestors, these Kor'kron will not pass.

It is found between &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. The region's climate and safety from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; is maintained by pylons, erected by the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s. The whole history of Sholazar is that of a cradle of life, with at least some of the titan &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s taking an interest in the development of creatures great and small.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lifeblood%20Pillar\"&gt;one pylon in the east&lt;/a&gt; has fallen and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; took this opportunity to invade from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to the north.\nIn Sholazar Basin, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s can take part in a faction war between the &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt;s, arctic cousins of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. The various gorloc tribes have gathered together to form the group called the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt;. Adventurers are only able to choose one side at a time, but are allowed to easily change to whichever faction they wish to be allied with.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s shaped &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; designed Sholazar Basin to be an area for experimentation along with &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. All three locations were places where the power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; had coalesced. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s emerged from these cradles of life.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; met the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Freya\"&gt;Avatar of Freya&lt;/a&gt; who told them that the situation about the &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Lands\"&gt;Lost Lands&lt;/a&gt; was better than they were during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and healing slowly.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; wondered why Sholazar Basin and &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; were shaped so similarly, his brother &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; theorized that it could be to see how two similar setups diverge over time, like a science experiment. Or that there was one thing the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s were trying to accomplish, and making two different places to work on it was better than one. However, these theories led Brann to wonder what they were trying to learn.\nGeography.\nAfter the bitter cold of the rest of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Sholazar Basin is like stepping onto an entirely different plane. It's a beautiful place, tropical, hot, and beard-curlingly humid. This is all the doing of the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s and the magical artifacts they left to protect the basin from both ill weather and foul creatures like the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. All of this for the benign love of the life they've created.\nA dense jungle, named the &lt;a href=\"Wildgrowth%20Mangal\"&gt;Wildgrowth Mangal&lt;/a&gt;, shot through with small streams spreads across the basin's central area. Around the basin, spaced out to make a rough ring if you were to connect them like dots, are the so called pillars, though they look far more natural to the topography than the name conjures. They're tall, narrow buttes that rise up from the relatively flat basin floor, each with a thin, elongated device hovering over it, swirling with magic.\nNotable characters.\nSholazar Basin is home to several characters of note. At &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Hill\"&gt;Frenzyheart Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High-Shaman%20Rakjak\"&gt;High-Shaman Rakjak&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against local fauna and their hated enemies, &lt;a href=\"the%20Oracles\"&gt;the Oracles&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"High-Oracle%20Soo-say\"&gt;High-Oracle Soo-say&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt; are not the only new arrivals to the basin, as &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt; leads his band of hunters in search of new game, targeting &lt;a href=\"Broodmother%20Slivina\"&gt;Broodmother Slivina&lt;/a&gt; as the ultimate challenge to a hunter. &lt;a href=\"Artruis%20the%20Heartless\"&gt;Artruis the Heartless&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attack on the region, but is continually held at bay by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Freya\"&gt;Avatar of Freya&lt;/a&gt;.\nWild creatures.\nMany fearsome and exotic beasts dwell in the steamy jungle of Sholazar Basin. Goretalon rocs glide through the Basin and Sapphire Hive wasps buzz and go about the business of protecting their hive. The gigantic and bad-tempered shardhorn rhinos graze while hardknuckle gorillas forage nearby. Sinuous emperor cobras and massive &lt;a href=\"dreadsaber\"&gt;dreadsaber&lt;/a&gt;s stalk their prey through the undergrowth, both of which are deadly apex predators and more than a match for an unwary traveler in the Basin. Mangal crocolisks also make their home in the Basin's waters and should be treated with caution as well.\nThe Basin has more than a few unique beasts of such singularly impressive size, strength and or beauty as to earn them the distinction of being named. Some of these include:\nRare elite NPCs associated with the achievement:\nReputation.\nSholazar Basin is the home of both the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Both are constantly at war with eachother, and players will choose to align with one faction at a time through one of the main quest chains of the area. Players can switch their chosen faction by repeating the last quest in the starting chain and killing/saving the character of the opposite faction (&lt;a href=\"A%20Hero%27s%20Burden\"&gt;A Hero's Burden&lt;/a&gt;). Sholazar Basin also has its own hidden reputation, which is currently unused, that will increase as faction dailies are completed, and will not decrease if a player decides to switch factions.\nIn the RPG.\nSholazar Basin fills the northwest corner of the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and is difficult to believe it is part of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Like &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, the Sholazar Basin is an anomaly. To get there you will have to climb a nasty ridge to reach it. Once you top that ridge, however, you will be looking down into a lush tropical jungle. Hot springs dot the basin and you will have to watch out for steam vents and geysers \u2014 they will cook the flesh from your bones in an instant if you get caught in one. Thick vegetation fills the basin, and birds and small animals are everywhere. So are insects. In the past, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; was the most fertile region in Northrend followed by Sholazar Basin. After it became a wasteland, the Basin took its place.\nA &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt; that once visited &lt;a href=\"Kaskala\"&gt;Kaskala&lt;/a&gt; believed the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s used the Sholazar Basin as a testing ground. Some of their experiments, or at least the remains of those experiments, may still exist. Thus, the basin is a potential treasure trove of knowledge and power."}

Shooting in WoW is not that much different from other &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt; games. A player with the ability to shoot in most cases moves to maximum range and then fires his &lt;a href=\"ranged%20weapon\"&gt;ranged weapon&lt;/a&gt;. Shooting is very useful for finishing off an opponent or dealing damage while avoiding the same. Some classes, most notably, the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, depend heavily on ranged weapons and dealing damage from afar with the same."}

Shotoa lived sometime after the era of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. He was blessed with a strong connection to the elements during his childhood.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and shattered the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the effects of the natural upheaval were felt as far as &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor was also suffering from natural disasters ranging from earthquakes to the land shattering apart. The &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; convened to discuss the effects of the natural upheaval and how to deal with the threat to their people. With the world being so chaotic, at times the elements had refused to answer the calls of the shaman, making the shaman's role in defending their people from the natural disasters difficult. While Shotoa advocated that they take a more commanding role with the elements and force the elements to do as they demand, &lt;a href=\"Oreg%20Earthfury\"&gt;Oreg Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; advocated for the Earthen Ring to follow their traditions of old and continue bargaining for and borrowing the powers of the elements.\nA tauren camp was moments later beginning to collapse from earthquakes. The Earthen Ring shaman pooled their strength to protect the civilians from the natural disaster but Shotoa's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Kiche\"&gt;Kiche&lt;/a&gt; fell into a crevice and was about to fall. Oreg tried to stop Shotoa from pursuing as they were unable to stop the land from tearing itself apart but Shotoa disregards his warnings and commands air elementals to carry him over to rescue his apprentice. The land tears itself apart and both are engulfed by the crevice and fall to their deaths.\nTwo hundred and fifty years later, Shotoa reappears saving &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt; from a fire and a centaur attack. He claims that the life force of Azeroth had saved his life and has been preserving him. He convinces many of the Earthen Ring shaman, including some members of the Elder Council, to abandon their traditional methods of asking elementals for their power and advocated a new method in which shaman domineer the elementals to do as they command.\n&lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; asked the Spirit of the Wilds for guidance and he received a vision of the cavern Shotoa fell into, where he learned that Shotoa wasn't preserved by the life force of Azeroth but by the energies of Ragnaros' release. Shotoa is in reality, a fire elemental wearing his shape.\nMuln gathered the rest of the shaman and followed Shotoa and his group to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. It is later revealed that Shotoa led his followers to a &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; ambush in the hope of weakening the Earthen Ring. Muln and his forces arrived but with the elements in disarray, they were at a disadvantage against the Grimtotem warriors and shaman who were using Shotoa's more reliable shamanistic methods.\nShotoa commented that a shaman as powerful as Muln could usurp authority from the weaker Grimtotem shaman controlling the elementals and save Kettara, (who was held captive at the hands of a giant earth elemental) if he imposed his will on them. Muln tried asking but was unable to break the earth elementals' control, so he helped in the main fight, destroying a number of fire elementals to try and get to the shaman commanding the earth elemental. He was too slow and the Grimtotem orders the elemental to crush Kettara. Muln promptly caused Shotoa to burst into flames before using a cyclone to fly at Shotoa in a rage.\nMuln told Shotoa he knew his secret, prompting him to burst into flames as he battled Muln. Shotoa told Muln that his master has forces all over the world working to bring its end. Muln opened a chasm under Shotoa trying to trap him but he was unable to get it to reclose, so he asked air, water, and earth elementals to aid him. At first they refused to work together but Muln motivated them to work together by telling them that they'd all be threatened with slavery under Shotoa and his fire elementals, which prompted them to work together.\nThe three elementals each counter part of Shotoa's powers allowing Muln to crush his head with his totem."}

They were located mostly around abandoned &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;s, forest deeps, and their main &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;, where they are led by &lt;a href=\"Thule%20Ravenclaw\"&gt;Thule Ravenclaw&lt;/a&gt;. He led the Rot Hide gnolls in their forays against the Forsaken, and crafted the &lt;a href=\"Rot%20Hide%20Ichor\"&gt;Rot Hide Ichor&lt;/a&gt; through warlock and necromantic magic that flows through their bodies.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the Cataclysm, they were driven out of Fenris Keep and many members have been killed, such as &lt;a href=\"Snarlmane\"&gt;Snarlmane&lt;/a&gt;. However, the group remained active in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Maggot%20Eye\"&gt;Maggot Eye&lt;/a&gt; and his undead gnolls in &lt;a href=\"Garren%27s%20Haunt\"&gt;Garren's Haunt&lt;/a&gt;, while their leader &lt;a href=\"Thule%20Ravenclaw\"&gt;Thule Ravenclaw&lt;/a&gt; was still alive in a small camp in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. To end their threat to the Forsaken, &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Jerrod\"&gt;Apothecary Jerrod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Crispin\"&gt;Apprentice Crispin&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to perform various tasks, notably to kill &lt;a href=\"Maggot%20Eye\"&gt;Maggot Eye&lt;/a&gt; and his undead &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garren%27s%20Haunt\"&gt;Garren's Haunt&lt;/a&gt; was abandoned by the Rot Hide gnolls and damaged by the advance of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces. Following the end of the conflict, Garren's Haunt remained abandoned. It is unknown what happened to &lt;a href=\"Maggot%20Eye\"&gt;Maggot Eye&lt;/a&gt; and the Rot Hide gnolls, but they were possibly killed by either the Forsaken or the Alliance.\nIn the RPG.\nAt first glance, this creature seems to be a common &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;, but further inspection reveals that its withered skin stretches tightly over prominent bones, rotted flesh shows beneath its patchy fur, and its eyes glow dark red or yellow, and are rheumy and sick-looking. Rot Hide gnolls combine the strength and aggression of regular gnolls, amplified by their undead status, with a lack of the cowardice that gnolls often exhibit. Rot Hide gnolls possess little intelligence and even less subtlety. They charge into battle, using their powerful attack to its fullest degree, and change targets at random. No one seems to know where they came from. The Rothides and the Forsaken wage a constant guerilla war against each other.\nSpeculation.\nThe Rot Hide gnolls may have been an already existing tribe before the Plague, or &lt;a href=\"Mudsnout\"&gt;Mudsnout&lt;/a&gt;s that have fallen to the Plague. The Mudsnouts seem to be the only tribe of gnolls native to Lordaeron, and the Plague would account for their low numbers."}

{"id": "29119", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=29119", "title": "Rotation", "text": "Rotation refers to a defined sequence of &lt;a href=\"abilities\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to achieve a certain role in a group or &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, it can refer to the order in which a certain class will cast its spells or use its abilities in a &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; setting. Rarely, if ever, is there a defined rotation for a &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; situation.\nSince \"\", the term has been something of a misnomer. Almost every class has some combination of abilities that unpredictably &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s of varying duration, and temporary &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;-increasing abilities that alter &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; length. Consequently, almost no class has a list of abilities that should be followed blindly. It's more common for classes to have a priority list of abilities to be used, with some abilities taking precedent over others depending on particular criteria. These lists may still informally be deemed \"rotations.\"\nClass guides with current rotation information can be found across the web. Prominent sites for these types of guides include &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides\"&gt;Icy Veins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.noxxic.com/wow/\"&gt;Noxxic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/class-guides\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;.\nDPS rotation.\nThis is the most commonly mentioned rotation. A &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; rotation tends to be somewhat calculated, be it either by time (duration of &lt;a href=\"Debuff\"&gt;debuffs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cast%20time\"&gt;cast time&lt;/a&gt; of spells) or availability of a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; (using specific abilities that have particular cooldowns in a certain priority). Many people of the same class and &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; tend to use the same DPS rotation because rotations are more often than not geared toward dealing the most &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; in the most efficient way. A solid DPS rotation will have little, if any, &lt;a href=\"downtime\"&gt;downtime&lt;/a&gt; between casts or use of abilities. It will generally yield more &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; than other rotations because of the order in which the spells and abilities are to be used. Rotations can be centered around one specific &lt;a href=\"ability\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Slam_Rotation\"&gt;Slam&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.\nTank rotation.\nMentioned perhaps less often than DPS rotations, tanking rotations are geared toward generating &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; quickly and efficiently. There are other rotations that are used in different situations, such as generating a lot of &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; or even dealing damage. There are &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; rotations, for gaining threat on many &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; at once. \nHealing rotation.\nA healing rotation can refer to one of two things:\nExamples.\nA druid that is main tank healing may place his &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;HoTs&lt;/a&gt; on the main tank in a specific order so that they are all present on the tank at once, and may allow some time in between casts for large ticks of regen."}

The fight is a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;Battle for survival&lt;/a&gt; and requires good raid awareness, repositioning and some kiting.\nThis boss has been available since January 5, 2010 on US servers and January 6 on EU servers.\nAbilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Ooze\"&gt;Little Ooze&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn ooze spawns when Mutated Infection is removed from a player (either by being dispelled or expiring). These merge into a Big Ooze and eventually explode.\n&lt;a href=\"Big%20Ooze\"&gt;Big Ooze&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese result when any two Oozes merge.\nSetup.\nThis fight has only one phase. One tank should keep Rotface in the center of the room. A second tank (or other seasoned kiter) needs to kite the big Oozes in a wide circle along the outer wall. The raid stands behind Rotface.\nIt's a good idea to mark the kiting tank, but raidmarks may be moved at random by some boss mods. If possible, use an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Gruntling\"&gt;Argent Gruntling&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Banner\"&gt;Orgrimmar Banner&lt;/a&gt;, or some other non-combat pet that follows its owner closely (usually a floating/flying pet, &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Rabbit\"&gt;Spring Rabbit&lt;/a&gt; for example wouldn't be particularly useful for that purpose).\nCooldowns.\nIt's frequently recommended to use the &lt;a href=\"DPS%20cooldowns\"&gt;DPS cooldowns&lt;/a&gt; at 30%. This is not a useful recommendation, since the encounter mechanics remain the same over the whole fight - there is no special enrage at low boss health. The only thing which changes is the Mutated Infection rate, the time between Infections slowly decreases. For this reason, it's best to use all cooldowns just a few seconds after the pull, as soon as everybody is in position. At that point, all damage dealers can maximize their output undisturbed from Infections or small Oozes. It's even possible to have the kiting tank help DPSing until the second Infection.\nSlime Spray.\nIn regular intervals, Rotface uses Slime Spray. He turns in a random direction (this ability is not targeted on specific players) and sprays slime in a frontal cone, all raiders must quickly move behind him. It's easier to dodge this ability if everyone stands rather close to him (including ranged). Slime spray has a long range, so it can hit a Mutated Infection victims while they are dealing with their Ooze, in which case they need quick healing.\nSome groups do not move for the Slime Sprays. This increases DPS time and makes it easier to track the off tank's position.\nMutated Infection and Oozes.\nDealing with these two elements is the key to this fight. In decreasing intervals, a random raid member gets Mutated Infection. This debuff ticks for some damage for 12 seconds, and then spawns a small Ooze with 500k aggro on the formerly infected player. Whenever any two Oozes get within 10 yards of each other, they automatically combine. The result of such a combine is as follos:\nBig Oozes deal high melee damage, move at half speed and have a normal aggro table\u2014thus they can be kited.\nAll players should follow these tips:\nBecause the intervals between Mutated Infections decrease, over time the number of oozes and slime patches increases, to the point where they get out of control and the raid wipes (= soft enrage). Kiting and merging Oozes is complicated by Professer Putricide randomly flooding a quarter of the room with poison slime. It's possible to run through short distances of poison slime by jumping, but it's a better idea to keep an eye on the pipes leading into the room and avoid the quarter which gets flooded next.\nWhenever a Big Ooze has absorbed five other Oozes, Rotface emotes, and four seconds later the Big Ooze explodes. This deals heavy AoE damage around the Ooze, and additionally rains small globules of slime at random raiders. The targeting of these small globules takes place once the casting of Unstable Ooze Explosion completes, so everyone must wait to move until the cast is complete.\nProblems.\nA major problem in this encounter are accidental merges of Small Oozes while another Big Ooze is already up. This leads to a \"loose\" Big Ooze, which usually aggros a healer, heads straight into the raid and kills everyone with its aura. Players trailed by Small Oozes must take care to avoid this. In the later stages of the fight, when Mutated Infections happen faster, accidental merges may happen nonetheless. The Ooze kiter must be aware of this possibility and quickly taunt surplus Big Oozes. Some raids pre-designate a second kiter who takes care of extra Big Oozes.\nThe healers' focus should be on the raid and on Mutated Infection targets in particular. 1/2 (10/25 player) healers are enough to keep the tank up. All other healers must watch over the raid. Mutated Infection targets may be unable to avoid Slime Spray and/or may be forced to run through poison slime.\nIt may help to have one person call out what is happening. DPS/Healers can be told when to switch sides, and people with the slime debuff can be alerted. Situational awareness is required from every raid member.\nHeroic Mode.\nDuring the heroic version of Rotface, Professor Putricide comes to the balcony and casts Vile Gas on random players. If enough players stand away from Rotface, Vile Gas is never cast on the melee group. Analogous to Rotgut, 8 players at range seem to be enough (in 25 player). It's important that Vile Gas soakers don't move into melee range when avoiding the ooze flood.\nMutated Infection \u2014 The Mutated Infection inflicts 3,900 to 4,100 shadow damage every second and reduces healing received by 75% instead of 50%. This increases the healing required by infection victims by a lot.\nOoze Flood - The Ooze Flood inflicts 5363 to 5637 damage every 1 sec and reduces move speed by 10%, stacking up to 10 times, for 5 sec. This means players (including the ooze kiter) cannot spend too much time in Ooze Floods or they eventually get rooted.\nQuotes.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Icecrown%20Citadel%23.C2.A0Rotface\"&gt;Sound Files of Icecrown Citadel: Rotface&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}
