He is one of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron's&lt;/a&gt; personal advisors, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Ranger General Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; being another. Rommath also holds the title of &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt;, and long served the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; before cutting ties with the conclave after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nRommath was a close companion of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, to whom Rommath was fiercely devoted. After the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and the prince's exodus to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Rommath was sent back home to Quel'Thalas to retake the land; Rommath was responsible for reclaiming much of it from the Scourge, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; included. As the prince's voice in Quel'Thalas, Rommath spread &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s teachings\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;siphoning&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to help sate the elves' addiction to magic that had become apparent in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction.\nRommath was shattered by the prince's betrayal and eventual death, though remained loyal to Silvermoon throughout the ordeal. Rommath's true loyalty is to his people, and he does not wish to see Regent Lord Theron follow in Kael's footsteps.\nBiography.\nA skilled magister, Rommath was once the apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Belo%27vir%20Salonar\"&gt;Belo'vir Salonar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath frequently attended his mentor on matters of both state and ceremony, and sat on some of Silvermoon's highest councils alongside Belo'vir, &lt;a href=\"Lireesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Ranger General Lireesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Verath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Chief Adviser Verath Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; himself. He was in attendance when &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; escorted the human courier &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt;, with the kingdom's first news of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival to Azeroth.\nRommath spent a portion of his life living in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. His power was formidable enough to earn him the rank of &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt;, a title shared by even some of the city's &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;ruling council&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath once considered Dalaran as much a home as he did &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath had returned to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to attend the grand magister by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Third War and aftermath.\nRommath was present in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, presiding over the city's defenses with his mentor and predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; prepared for a siege of Silvermoon, Rommath was put in charge of evacuating as many elves from the city as possible, preparing the children of Silvermoon to escape aboard ships, and teleporting as many elves as he could to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attack, the death of the &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;elven monarch&lt;/a&gt;, the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and the near-destruction of Quel'Thalas, Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider rushed home to rally the survivors. Belo'vir had also fallen during the battle, and Rommath was named his successor. Rommath, reunited with his prince to whom he acted as an advisor, teleported to &lt;a href=\"Falconwing%20Square\"&gt;Falconwing Square&lt;/a&gt; and fought his way through hordes of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to rescue elven survivors in the wreckage of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath found &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, and informed him that the prince would arrive shortly.\nRommath's cold demeanor proved alienating to some of the populace, who were disillusioned with Kael's absence and faced with starvation and continued Scourge attacks. Rommath took part in the attempt to destroy the tainted Sunwell, where the elves fought a dangerous battle against both the Scourge and the Amani. He soon after became part of Kael's company of powerful sin'dorei magisters who traveled to serve the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, though came under the scrutiny of the human commander &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. The elves were eventually sentenced to death on the grounds of treason within the &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, though the imprisoned blood elves were freed by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;.\nRommath was personally disgusted by the apparent indifference the elves received from the surviving members of the Kirin Tor, who had allowed the likes of Garithos to unjustly slate the blood elves for an execution beneath the very city many of them had served as faithfully as they had &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath's bitterness towards them would not be softened, even several years later.\nAfter Prince Kael'thas joined with Vashj's new master, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Rommath travelled with the prince and his new allies into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, part of a contingent that included some of Quel'Thalas' most powerful individuals. While Kael'thas sought to secure a new homeland for his people, the majority of them had remained behind on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Under the tutelage of Illidan, Kael'thas acquired radical new methods by which to sate the elves' ever-present magical addiction\u2014including the siphoning of magic from external sources, including &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Heartened by their swift recovery, most of Kael'thas' group chose to stay in Outland and further their studies, but Rommath was sent back to Azeroth, bearing a message of hope for the blood elves still in Quel'Thalas. He relayed tales of a glorious promised land, spread the teachings of Illidan\u2014teachings that Rommath smoothly attributed to Prince Kael'thas\u2014and planted the notion that Kael'thas might one day return to lead his people to paradise. The majority of the blood elves quickly adapted to this efficient new method for draining magic from vermin only, and would be horrified if they discovered their Outland brethren's pact. The few who opposed it were banished from Quel'Thalas by the new regent. \nRommath assumed his mentor's role as grand magister of Quel'Thalas, and remained in the kingdom to help rebuild and await the prince's return. Thanks to Rommath, the blood elves on Azeroth learned how to drain arcane magic and feed their addiction. As they returned to health, they praised their absent prince and dedicated themselves to learning more. Rommath and the new order of elven magi made great progress in tutoring their brethren to manipulate arcane energies. Soon the spires of Silvermoon City rose skyward once again, powered by volatile magics. The blood elves have even begun retaking portions of Eversong Woods. Emboldened by the promise of Kael'thas' return, the prince's weary people began to focus on regaining their strength and forging a new path into an uncertain future.\nBlood of the Highborne.\nRommath devised and approved the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt;, which included the siphoning of the subdued &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, whom Kael'thas had sent back to Silvermoon for his peoples' use. This decision brought him into conflict with &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, who was deeply opposed to M'uru's exploitation.\nRommath gained a large amount of political power after his reclamation of Silvermoon and ascension to grand magister. Though Lor'themar did not condone some of Rommath's methods, Rommath spoke with Prince Kael'thas's full approval. Rommath strongly believed in the importance of balance, stating that the blood elves, with their unending hunger for magic, walk a fine line between deficiency and overindulgence, and must tread safely between the two extremes in order to be complete.\nRommath summoned Liadrin to the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;spire&lt;/a&gt;, where he revealed to the former high priestess his plans for a new order of Light-wielding warriors, who commanded their powers not through moral adherence or faith but through will and dominance. Rommath had Liadrin shown to &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and earned her support as the first Blood Knight.\nRommath learned of the murder of an elf named &lt;a href=\"Orovinn\"&gt;Orovinn&lt;/a&gt;, who had been brutally killed and hanged near the &lt;a href=\"Shepherd%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Shepherd's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Rumour abounded that one of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; was responsible, and Rommath ordered Liadrin to find whoever it was and deal with the situation accordingly. Rommath left for &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, where he was to meet with Kael'thas and inform him of the state of negotiations with the Horde, and expected the task to be done by the time he returned.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nGrand Magister Rommath remained in contact with his brethren in Outland, and gained knowledge of what was hinted to be &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;uncorrupted orcs&lt;/a&gt; still active around Draenor. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; used this connection as a bargaining chip during his negotiations with the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, which would ultimately lead to Quel'Thalas being accepted as an equal nation of its own. With their new alliance sealed, Rommath's magisters had any dissidents speaking out against the state quickly silenced. Rommath was also in touch with the forces stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, who held out hope that the grand magister would send &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;reinforcements&lt;/a&gt; to help hold the line against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; soon, and instructed his magisters to study the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; for the possibility of reversing its taint. However, the corrupted land was deemed irrecoverable, and word reached the grand magister of its dark fate. While Halduron was supportive of Lor'themar's decision to accept &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; aid, Rommath was more critical of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s motives in doing so, a suspicion that would later be somewhat vindicated.\nDespite the promising future that Kael'thas had planned for his people, the prince would later pledge his loyalties to &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Returning to Quel'Thalas in a mad bid to summon his new master, Kael'thas and his &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;felbloods&lt;/a&gt; briefly attacked Silvermoon to steal the imprisoned M'uru, and used the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; as a means to usher their new master into Azeroth.\nKael'thas was ultimately &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; for his treachery, and Rommath's unwavering loyalty to Silvermoon throughout the ordeal earned him the unlikely respect of Ranger-General Halduron. However, Rommath himself was left shattered by this turn of events, and resolved not to simply stand on the sidelines while decisions are made to damn his people further.\nIn the Shadow of the Sun.\nWith the betrayal of Prince Kael'thas, the fight had somewhat diminished from Grand Magister Rommath. Rommath, who had once fervently supported the prince in his plight, had been left the most shattered of all in the wake of his treachery. After &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; announced his intention to visit &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, Rommath flanked &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; to hear the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; archmage's plea.\nRommath was unmoved by Aethas' revelations regarding &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos the Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt;'s insanity and his war against mortal magic users, and instead criticized Aethas regarding more personal matters, such as his affiliation with the Kirin Tor. Rommath, who had spent a long time living in Dalaran himself, felt betrayed by the Kirin Tor's inaction during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, in which Kael, Rommath, and the other elves serving the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; had been sentenced to mass executions in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; while the Kirin Tor turned a blind eye. Aethas rebuked this, assuring Rommath that not only are the Kirin Tor under new leadership but that they had nothing to do with what had transpired, but Rommath remained unconvinced. Rommath assured Aethas none of his magisters would be assisting the Kirin Tor in their affairs, and that they can all rot in hell or &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' grasp for all he cares. &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; attempted to curb Rommath's anger, to little avail.\nLor'themar stepped in and reminded Rommath the decision would be his if action was to be taken, to which Rommath backed down. Despite his apparent neutrality in the matter, Lor'themar later found himself in agreement with Rommath's disdain, admitting as much to Halduron in private. Although Rommath and Halduron had clashed on many matters (particularly pertaining to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;), the ranger general had developed a trust and respect for Rommath after the events that transpired on the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nRommath saw Lor'themar's trip south to inform his &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien\"&gt;former comrades&lt;/a&gt; of the Sunwell's reignition as pointless, but nonetheless suggested the regent take a Blood Knight regiment for protection. Rommath was not the least bit surprised to see how poorly the trip went.\nLater, Rommath accompanied Lor'themar and Halduron to meet with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to demand the blood elves' support in the looming &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; war. Rommath was appalled when he witnessed Sylvanas essentially blackmail the regent lord into dedicating troops to the war, threatening to remove her troops from Quel'Thalas and thus abandon it to the Scourge if not satisfied. Outraged, Rommath interjected, and threw Sylvanas' prior offers of aid back at her, accusing her of blackmail and holding their lands to ransom; however, Sylvanas did not waver in her conviction and brushed Rommath off. Lor'themar quickly put an end to their discussion and agreed to Sylvanas's demands, infuriating Rommath.\nUnwilling to look the other way, Rommath confronted Lor'themar about his willingness to commit to such a war, especially in the wake of the battle on Quel'Danas. Lor'themar reasoned that they would lose both the Forsaken and the Horde's support if they did not move, and would likely lose much of Quel'Thalas too. Rommath did not relent, and even put forward the notion that the elves who had perished in order to protect Quel'Thalas would have preferred to die in vain, than to have given their lives to watch the regent lord become a pawn in the name of their sacrifice. This was the first Lor'themar had ever seen Rommath this close to desperation.\nLor'themar asserted his authority over the matter and noted that if being used was required to keep Quel'Thalas safe, then he would gladly allow it\u2014and so would Rommath. Rommath simply stated that &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;another leader of the sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one they had buried on Quel'Danas\u2014had once said the same thing to him, and that at the time, Rommath had not questioned him, and had even considered him right. The comparison was a blow to Lor'themar, who privately acknowledged how close his decision on this matter was to the mindset that had destroyed Kael'thas.\nRommath left to inform &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; of the regent lord's decision. Aethas was later sent to confer with Rommath, though neither Lor'themar nor Archmage Sunreaver hid how well they expected that notion to end.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nGrand Magister Rommath plays a part in the restoration of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, and is seen at the restored &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; after heroes are permitted to cleanse the mighty blade in its holy waters by &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Ranger General Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. Quel'Delar is submerged within the Sunwell as &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Captain Auric Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt;, and the grand magister himself observe it.\nThough Lor'themar is somewhat skeptical of its authenticity, Rommath is certain of it. For a non-blood elf player, Lor'themar attempts to take the blade himself, thanking the adventurer for returning Quel'Delar to \"its rightful owners.\" However, the blade knocks him across the room, slicing a large portion of his health off. Rommath holds the onlooking player in an ice tomb as the Sunwell guardians surround the player and Auric with weapons drawn, and Rommath demands to know the meaning behind this supposed treachery. Auric Sunchaser urges Rommath to call his guards off, informing him that Quel'Delar must decide on its own wielder, not the other way around. Rommath ultimately accepts his reasoning and has the guardians return to their posts. He also instructs Auric to watch his tongue in this sacred place, after the captain refers to the regent lord as a \"fool.\" Rommath then orders the player to take the restored Quel'Delar and begone, if it is truly not meant to be theirs.\nFor a blood elf player, things begin similarly, though Lor'themar merely observes the sword rather than make an attempt to claim it. Rommath gives words of support to the sin'dorei hero for their role in restoring the blade, referencing Quel'Delar's broken and abandoned state to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; following the betrayal of Kael'thas. He concurs with Lor'themar's own praise towards the player, and with Auric's deduction of why it had been returned to the children of Silvermoon at this hour\u2014to avenge the destruction of Quel'Thalas and the Sunwell.\nRommath instructs the player to return to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; with the restored blade and notes that the sin'dorei shall always rise up to face any foe.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLandfall.\nHaving learned of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s elevation to the head of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Rommath believes that the organization is now firmly in &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; hands. Recalling the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and the narrowly-averted massacre the sin'dorei faced at the hands of Garithos (much to the Kirin Tor's indifference), Rommath places little faith in the Kirin Tor's current neutrality.\nRommath is tasked with uncovering the secrets of a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; device found on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and joins forces with &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; to this end. Rommath discovers that it works on the same principle the &lt;a href=\"fel%20crystal\"&gt;fel crystal&lt;/a&gt;s once around &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; adhered to (that be it a demon, elemental or spirit energy, the substance is enslaved and stored within the device), and the device is activated. However, a rampant &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; pours out of it, compelling Rommath to great anger and having he and Aethas come to blows. Horde agents succeed in disposing of it, however, and Rommath notes that it had been an age of the world or more since he had felt anything of even a fraction of that. The outcome of this experiment strains the blood elves' relations with Garrosh, as Aethas concludes that the enslavement of these energies is the exact same path &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; had walked years before, nearly damning their people.\nEver distrustful of the Kirin Tor, Rommath was unsurprised when Jaina abandoned its neutrality and threw its support behind the Alliance.\nRommath rushed to Dalaran to rescue Aethas and help evacuate the Sunreavers during the ensuing the &lt;a href=\"purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning with the sewers, Rommath promptly warns the Sunreavers of the impending danger and fights his way through the Silver Covenant to save those under attack. In the chaos, Rommath takes over the center of the city, using it as his makeshift base to strike against the Alliance. Though he succeeds in saving a number of his people (as well as sending Horde heroes to attack the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and rescue the Sunreavers remaining in the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sunreaver's Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;), Aethas himself is nowhere to be found. After reviving several wounded Sunreavers and saving their &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s (thus giving the rescued elves a way out of the city), Rommath leaves for the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and succeeds in breaking Aethas out of his captivity. Rommath and Aethas escape the city atop the &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s rescued earlier, and return to Silvermoon.\nUpon their arrival, Rommath informs Lor'themar of the situation. Incensed, Lor'themar orders Rommath to add the Sunreavers' strength to his own, and for Halduron to assemble the rangers. Lor'themar vows that the next move will belong to him, and Rommath concludes that Theron would make a fine &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Thunder King.\nRommath accompanies Lor'themar, Halduron, and Aethas to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, taking up arms with the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath leads the Horde assault on the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones%20%28Isle%20of%20Thunder%29\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt;, overseeing the attacks on the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aerthas%20Firehawk\"&gt;Captain Aerthas Firehawk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryshelle%20Brightlock\"&gt;Ryshelle Brightlock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harlan%20Whitedawn\"&gt;Harlan Whitedawn&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath is of the opinion that whatever threat &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; poses, the sin'dorei have weathered more than enough storms to strike him an even greater blow.\nRommath and Halduron routinely return to the &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Promontory\"&gt;Dawnseeker Promontory&lt;/a&gt; as the construction of the camp progresses. Rommath also brought &lt;a href=\"Arcanis%20Mechanica\"&gt;Arcanis Mechanica&lt;/a&gt; with him, the grand magister's personal &lt;a href=\"arcane%20golem\"&gt;arcane golem&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nRommath, along with Liadrin, is present in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; during Vol'jin's funeral ceremony and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s inauguration as Warchief of the Horde.\nRommath named the magistrix &lt;a href=\"Esara%20Verrinde\"&gt;Esara Verrinde&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;' Seeker of Wisdom, a position held by an individual who travels beyond Quel'Thalas to seek out knowledge and power for the order. This appointment was a relief to both of them, as Esara is somewhat atypical for her kin and was not content to spend her days confined in Silvermoon. Rommath sent her to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt;, a group of renegade mages who have turned to fel magics.\nEsara is later invited to join the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, operating out of Dalaran. Rommath's opinion on the Horde's - particularly Aethas and the Sunreavers' - readmission into the Kirin Tor itself is not mentioned.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Rommath can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nInsurrection.\nRommath, accompanied by Lady Liadrin's Blood Knights, leads his &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to support the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebels in their attempt to seize the Burning Legion-aligned city. He ponders what might have become of the sin'dorei if it was the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; they had been bound to, but dismisses the notion and states that his people, no longer slaves to their arcane thirst, have achieved their own destiny with glory all their own. Rommath also drily comments on the Kirin Tor's presence in the elven camps and does not expect to receive fair treatment in the event that the kaldorei start trouble. Tensions run high between the two camps; &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; had to step in and stop &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; from shooting at Rommath, apparently not for the first time. Rommath and Liadrin meet with Khadgar and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; in their outpost. \nRommath is unimpressed with the Alliance's camp and considers their forces chaotic and unorderly, believing it fortunate that his Magisters and Liadrin's Blood Knights will comprise the core of their armies and strike true into Suramar. He sends Horde adventurers to confer with the Alliance and Horde scouts dispatched into the city. Rommath states that this alliance between the sin'dorei and their &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;long-lost kin&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 their enemies \u2013 is a momentous occasion and that this battle will determine the fate of all elf-kind.\nRommath is later present during the raid on the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying Lady Liadrin and her forces.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nRommath is present in &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;'s negotiations with the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; leaders and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. He counsels against allowing Alleria to visit the Sunwell, suspicious of her intentions and consumption of the void, but Lor'themar overrules him; Rommath then conjures a portal to the heart of the Sunwell and accompanies the regent lord and his retinue of guests to its holy waters.\nDuring the pilgrimage, Alleria's presence attracts a horde of void beasts led by &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt;, who had stalked Alleria's steps and summoned forth a &lt;a href=\"Aruun%20the%20Darkener\"&gt;powerful void horror&lt;/a&gt; intent on corrupting the Sunwell. Rommath fought the void's agents back and added his strength to Alleria and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;'s to close Durzaan's rift portal, saving the Sunwell. After the battle, Rommath attempts to have Alleria taken prisoner as a saboteur, but Lor'themar again intercedes and has her banished, reasoning that her presence poses a threat to the Sunwell and Quel'Thalas itself.\nRommath had previously clashed with &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; and his disciples, who had pursued research into the void against the grand magister's wishes. Rommath eventually demanded their exile, on the grounds that the void poses a direct threat the Sunwell. Umbric, after uncovering research into the void undertaken by &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, later conceded that Rommath was right to be concerned.\nRommath was present in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Court of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Sin%27dorei\"&gt;Heritage of the Sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; ended, Rommath was enthusiastic about Lor'themar's visit to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, stating if the Regent were to put up a fuss, he would have teleported him to the Nighthold himself.\nA Moment in Verse.\nRommath and Halduron took charge of Silvermoon and Quel'Thalas during Lor'themar's visit to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar noted that both of them had taken an unusual interest in his journey. Rommath was noted to have possibly uttered \"Go, you love-addled buffoon, or I will strangle you myself\" as Lor'themar departed.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the resurgence of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Rommath met with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; where they learned that &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt; was in danger of falling to the Scourge, with Aethas noting that the Scourge was too focused for it be a random attack, and voiced calling upon the Horde for aid. However, Rommath countered that they couldn't wait and had to deal with the Scourge immediately. Liadrin agreed with Rommath's assessment and was able to convince Lor'themar that it would be best to call upon those still in training to hold the line and keep Quel'Thalas safe. Rommath and Aethas then immediately ported to Tranquillien. Within the town they established themselves within the main building, with Aethas placing a protective barrier to keep the Scourge at bay. While Liadrin ordered for the Scourge numbers to be thinned, Aethas requested that &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;blood elf champions&lt;/a&gt; aid him and Rommath as they set up defenses in Tranquillien. As the trio went about this task, Aethas was stunned to be confronted with the &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt; and quickly realized that Vorath was leading the Scourge against them. The trio also discovered that Vorath had found a way to cheat death and informed Liadrin of the situation.\nThe group then determined that the best way forward would be to imbue a weapon with the proper power in order to send Vorath to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; for good. After the champion was able to empower the &lt;a href=\"Forged%20Ranseur\"&gt;Forged Ranseur&lt;/a&gt; with the magics of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, they returned to the group. Rommath then joined the rest of his companions in striking back at the Scourge, where the champion with the ranseur cut a swath of destruction through the Scourge, which successfully trapped Vorath within Deathholme. Determined to put an end to the invasion once and for all, the blood elves stormed Deatholme, and killed Vorath. With Vorath's death, Liadrin noticed how the Scourge began to scatter and declared that the remnants could be taken care of in time. Rommath then joined his companions in returning to Silvermoon to celebrate their victory.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nRommath was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nTactics.\nThe battle with Lor'themar, Rommath, and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; can be intimidating for a small raid, and is somewhat comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; encounter. Rommath and Halduron can prove a serious threat to the raid, and killing all three may seem daunting at first. However, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28blood%20elf%29\"&gt;Royal Guards&lt;/a&gt; have not been updated since WotLK, so they are dispatched quite easily. It is vital that the raid keep in mind that their respawn timers, like Garrosh Hellscream, are only 10 minutes, unlike other city leaders.\nRaids should devote a few players to keeping an eye out for players teleporting in from behind Lor'themar's chamber as well as the mage trainer's room so as to be ready to quickly dispatch horde players who come to Lor'themar's aid from the Undercity and Pandaria respectively. Your tank should hold Lor'themar to one side of the room to give healers adequate distance to avoid Lor'themar's Mana Burn ability. PVP trinkets are a must for this fight in order to deal with Lor'themar's Mass Charm spell.\nThe combined HP levels of the three Silvermoon leaders can make this a long boss fight, their total HP pool nearly being 1.85B and with several mechanics to take into account for each boss. This is countered by players only needing to kill Lor'themar and the relatively low chance of a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; defense force gaining swift knowledge of a Silvermoon raid. Thus, player interference is much less likely than in some of the more populated cities.\nHalduron strikes swiftly when in melee range, and will periodically use a &lt;a href=\"Multi-shot\"&gt;Multi-shot&lt;/a&gt; ability similar to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;', hitting up to ten members of the raid and will also hit random raid members with a regular &lt;a href=\"Shoot\"&gt;Shoot&lt;/a&gt; ability. Rommath will rely on fire-based attacks - &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; on his current target and &lt;a href=\"Flamestrike\"&gt;Flamestrike&lt;/a&gt; on a certain location, but is immune to any interrupts. Rommath's &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Armor\"&gt;Molten Armor&lt;/a&gt; can be dispelled, but he will immediately recast it. Focussing on Halduron, Rommath and Lor'themar respectively will allow more breathing space, as without Halduron and Rommath's abilities to consider, the battle drops in difficulty.\nLike Halduron, Lor'themar strikes swiftly in melee range, and generally alternates between his &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shock\"&gt;Arcane Shock&lt;/a&gt; abilities. His &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; has increased in potency, though he will only infrequently cast his &lt;a href=\"Mass%20charm\"&gt;Mass charm&lt;/a&gt;. With luck, subtlety, and enough concentrated DPS, Lor'themar will fall.\nPersonality.\nRommath has an aloof, brusque, and often blunt manner. He is generally a practitioner of pragmatism and is both a master-mage and a gifted politician. Though still commanding and authoritative, Rommath's haughty disposition took a hit after Kael'thas' betrayal, which took its greatest toll on the prince's most loyal advocate. Though seen as cold and disconcerting by some, Rommath does have good intentions, and his true loyalty is reserved for the good of his people.\nRommath was one of Kael's most staunchly loyal supporters. Upon traveling back to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Rommath quickly advocated the teachings spread by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, attributing it to Kael'thas. As such, when Kael'thas' true loyalties were unveiled, Rommath was shattered - perhaps more so than anyone in Quel'Thalas. Rommath has since undergone subtle changes, most notably being in regards to the future of the blood elven people. Having lost much of his composure, Rommath was strongly against committing the weathered sin'dorei to the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; war, to the point where he vocally condemned Lor'themar's decision to fight in it. Rommath has learned from Kael's downfall, and does not wish to see those events repeated.\nRommath holds a strong grudge against the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, stemming from his opinion that they had simply watched and waited as the sin'dorei were slated for execution at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;. As such, he is often at odds with &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, formerly one of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;ruling council&lt;/a&gt; members, to the point where he flatly denied the aid of his &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; in anything pertaining to the Kirin Tor's welfare. Despite his misgivings for what the Sunreavers stood for, Rommath personally rescued them during the purge of Dalaran, including Aethas himself."}

Each clone will cast spells from each Mage Tree: \nThe clones can be polymorphed (but not mind controlled). If you have no CC, kill the Frost wielding clone first to reduce AoE damage or the Arcane Magus to limit the number of Time Stops and Critters cast.\nIf you have Mages a good trick is to have them use this macro:\n /target Frost Magus (or Fire Magus)\n /cast polymorph\n /target Arcane Magus\nAll ranged dps can use a targeting macro (or macros) to quickly pick up the correct target.\nPhase 3.\nOnce the clones are destroyed she will reappear with 50% health, and will use the same attacks as in phase one. When she reaches 25% health, she will Freeze everyone and cast Fireball Volley (AoE fireball spell) that will hit everyone in a 30 yard radius. \nAt the start of this phase, the following macro is useful for all players:\n /target Grand Magus Telestra\nHeroic.\nPhase 1.\nLittle difference from non heroic, with the exception that spells hit much harder. Fire and frost resistance effects are useful (totem, aura, etc.) to reduce damage taken in all phases.\nPhase 2.\nWith the increase in damage that the clones deal, the arcane time stop clone can seriously hinder healing efforts and can occasionally polymorph the healer.\nClones are able to be CC'd in all forms. CS, fear, stuns, and sheep are effective.\nShe has been observed to clone at least twice if not taken down quickly.\nIt is possible to take her down to nearly 0% before this phase with a well geared group, so that she dies as soon as the clones are all destroyed.\nPhase 3.\nLittle to no difference from non heroic phase. Possibility for her to clone herself again.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The conflict seeped into the original timeline's &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in 31 ADP because of &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling with timeways. The bronze dragon has sent &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; 35 years ago to the past of an alternate , some time prior the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;Blood Pact&lt;/a&gt;, with a mission to prevent the orcs from drinking &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood and create an uncorrupted Horde for Kairoz's own purposes. However, Garrosh betrayed Kairoz, with no intentions to serve another \"puppet master\" and stole his fragment of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, which he used to convince Grommash of the cruel fate of the orcish race, should he drink the demon blood. With the information gained through the artifact and Garrosh's knowledge, the orcish clans have united into the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, a militaristic and technologically advanced union under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Grommash&lt;/a&gt;, supplied by the goblin &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt;, bent on the path of total conquest and dominion over the universe. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, enraged by the turn of events began their own campaign against Draenor as well, aiming to salvage as much of the original plan as possible, including the destruction of Draenor.\nDuring the war, the Alliance and Horde were technically under a peace treaty, but the Horde broke it at &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nGarrosh's trial.\nAfter the defeat of Garrosh Hellscream, the Alliance and Darkspear Rebellion have agreed to hand the overthrown warchief to the hands of &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, who were going to move him to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; where he could be tried for his war crimes committed during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. However, before the verdict could be announced, Garrosh was able to escape through a time-space gateway with the help of a &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe portal has brought him to the alternate Draenor, decades before the current events, where he was able to set up a chain of events convincing &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Grommash&lt;/a&gt; to distrust , in order to prevent a crucial moment in the universe's history: the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s through the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;Blood Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point the &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Draenor with their brand siege weapons to reinforce the orcish clans.\nMessage to Gul'dan.\n&lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; sent a message to the orcs promising them untold power. Already warned by the younger Hellscream about the dark plot, Grommash sent him in reply, disguised as a messenger, to Gul'dan wishing to know more about his plans. Gul'dan told Garrosh that he had seen a vision, and a &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; wanted the orcs as their vanguard. Much to Gul'dan's surprise, Garrosh knew serving this Legion meant entering the Blood Pact by drinking the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, which would bind the orcish race to serve the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Angered at Garrosh's accusations of slavery, and proclaiming himself to be a god, Gul'dan had his guards remove the messenger from the premises. In response, Garrosh slew the guards. Gul'dan told Garrosh that in three days the orcs would drink from Mannoroth's blood on a mountaintop in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; and from there march to victory. Garrosh lowered his hood, revealing his identity, and told Gul'dan that in three days Grommash will stand on the mountain as well and lead the orcs to embrace their true fate.\nThe clans assemble.\nGarrosh and Grommash set about gathering the clans and building their own Dark Portal in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. The led by took to the new technology Garrosh brought with great interest, building larger and more powerful war machines including the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Worldbreaker\"&gt;Iron Worldbreaker&lt;/a&gt;. of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the of the , with &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Dharl%20of%20the%20Thrice-Bloodied%20Blade\"&gt;Dharl&lt;/a&gt;, and of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; also joined the Iron Horde. Two clans however, the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf Orcs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull Orcs&lt;/a&gt; refused, with the latter not wanting to submit to anyone's rules, and the former not wishing to participate in pointless conquest. 's eventually joined as well, giving the Iron Horde the &lt;a href=\"K%27ara%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Dark Star's&lt;/a&gt; power of the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after the Iron Horde's formation, Grommash ordered an attack on &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, seat of &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt;. The emperor had no other option than to negotiate with the warchief. Upon agreeing to train orcs the magic immunity, the attack ceased and the ogres became Iron Horde's allies.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Iron March.\nUsing the dark power of the members including , the new red Dark Portal successfully opened into Azeroth. Garrosh's invasion force led by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Tharbek\"&gt;Commander Tharbek&lt;/a&gt; stormed through the portal and began the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;Iron Horde Incursion&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;. The unexpected invasion quickly destroyed all Alliance and Horde resistance in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Zaela took a battalion of warriors and quickly flew to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to begin construction of a super &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt; that would destroy &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; quickly warned both sides of this massive threat. The Alliance and Horde united to destroy the Iron March and push the invaders back through the portal. A number of Azeroth's great heroes joined the battle, including Khadgar, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkirmish in Tanaan.\nThe united front succeeded in pushing through the portal, but once on the other side, it was apparent that the numbers and power of the Iron Horde were utterly overwhelming. After encountering each of the Iron Horde's warlords (with the exception of the and &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Dharl%20of%20the%20Thrice-Bloodied%20Blade\"&gt;Dharl&lt;/a&gt;), the Draenor expedition used hit-and-run tactics against the orcs to stay alive. In addition, they saved several important figures including &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Farseer Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; the priestess. The expedition came to the conclusion that if Azeroth was to be safe from the overwhelming power of the Iron Horde, the must be destroyed and the threat must be ended in Draenor. Using the Blackrock's Iron Worldbreaker, &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the portal and Khadgar led the remaining Alliance and Horde forces to safety on the Iron Horde's battleships. The expedition then split, with the Horde heading north to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance going south to request the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowmoon Valley: the Prophet and the Dark Star.\nThe Alliance expedition, led by &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, landed in , where most of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; of Draenor call home. From &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance struck out against the Shadowmoon clan. The Shadowmoon showed they are using the power of the \"Dark Star\" to harness the power of the void to summon void creatures and cast powerful magic at the cost of the corruption of their own souls. Draenor's versions of and &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; aid the Alliance in their endeavors to settle in Shadowmoon and combating their enemies. The Council of Exarchs, however, suffers betrayal from within, openly from &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Othaar\"&gt;Exarch Othaar&lt;/a&gt; and more subtly from &lt;a href=\"Soulbinder%20Nyami\"&gt;Soulbinder Nyami&lt;/a&gt;. Both believe Velen has led them to ruin and allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and their minions, the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt;. Velen eventually learns that Ner'zhul plans to summon his ultimate weapon, the Dark Star, directly to Draenor and use its dark power to utterly end the draenei once and for all. Despite Velen and the now-paladin Yrel's best efforts, the Dark Star descends, forcing Velen to make the ultimate sacrifice to purify the dark entity in, revealing it's true form: &lt;a href=\"K%27ara%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. With the power of the naaru flowing through them, Yrel and Maraad decimated the Iron Horde forces as they &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;marched on&lt;/a&gt; the draenei capital of &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. Ner'zhul retreats to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Shadowmoon Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt; where he meets his death, ending the threat of the Shadowmoon clan.\nFrostfire Ridge: the Frostwolf brothers.\nThe Horde expedition, led by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, landed in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. Drek'Thar vouched for the strangers who saved both his and &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ga'nar's&lt;/a&gt; lives to the Frostwolf chieftain and his mate . Vol'jin's Horde proved themselves in Durotan's eyes when they helped the Frostwolves &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bladespire%20Citadel\"&gt;take&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Citadel\"&gt;Bladespire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, a massive ogre castle which would serve as the Frostwolves new fortification against the oncoming Iron Horde. The Thunderlord clan, led by the orc known as the Iron Wolf, began making raids against the Frostwolves using powerful subjugated &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s. Durotan's brother Ga'nar led the charges against the Thunderlord aggressors, their allies proving to be more than a match for the Thunderlord beast masters. Finally, the Iron Wolf fought Ga'nar and Durotan face to face, revealing that he was in fact their oldest brother, Fenris Wolfbrother, who broke away from the Frostwolves, believing they should not be equal to beasts or other orcs, but that they should subjugate all others to their will. The wayward Frostwolf met his end at the hands of his younger brothers as Grommash's forces began to invade Frostfire Ride through Thunder Pass. The Horde and Frostwolves clashed with the invaders in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt;, with Ga'nar heroically sacrificing himself to buy Drek'Thar time to seal the pass. With the Thunderlord pacified and the Iron Tide stemmed, Frostfire was secured.\nGorgrond: gaining allies in the savage land.\nAfter securing Shadowmoon and Frostfire, both sides sent their heroes to secure a foothold in Blackrock clan territory: &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. Yrel leads the Alliance in gaining the help of additional &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s while Durotan and Draka make an alliance of convenience with the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kaz%20the%20Shrieker\"&gt;Kaz the Shrieker&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the choices made by the player, the expeditions endeavors will provide additional resources from Gorgrond's jungles or several warriors of Gorgrond's wastes including &lt;a href=\"Rexxar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;. If the players battle the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;, they kill the &lt;a href=\"Genesaur\"&gt;Genesaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt; and take an artifact that lets them control genesaurs, or fight the subjugated gronn forces of the Iron Horde and gain an artifact that controls &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;. The Iron Horde wished to use these artifacts for their own conquest, but Yrel/Draka suggest using this power against them. The Alliance/Horde assault the Blackrock fortress, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Approach\"&gt;Iron Approach&lt;/a&gt;. With the power of the artifact, the Iron Horde forces under &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gar\"&gt;Commander Gar&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed by the very power they hoped to control. With a serious, though not fatal, blow dealt to the Blackrock clan, the Alliance/Horde forces receive requests for aid from their forces in Talador.\nTalador: The Burning Legion and the Iron Horde.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; forest, a massive Iron Horde fleet led by and sails toward the draenei capital of . After dealing with some &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt;s and establishing their outpost, as well as receiving aid from Khadgar and his &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; forces, the Draenor expedition deals with the Iron Horde. Yrel and Maraad halt the Iron Horde's advance through the forest, while Durotan heads north to try to reason with Orgrim, the orc he once considered his sworn brother. Despite the Frostwolf Chieftain's best efforts, Orgrim stands firmly loyal to the Iron Horde. Using a prototype &lt;a href=\"goblin%20shredder\"&gt;goblin shredder&lt;/a&gt;, the expedition destroys the remainder of Orgrim's ground forces, leaving only Blackhand's battleships and warriors. As Blackhand's fleet arrives at Shattrath, Khadgar leads a united attack against the Blackrock warlord's army in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Shattrath\"&gt;Battle for Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;. As Blackhand readied his battleships massive cannons to destroy the city and all it's inhabitants, Doomhammer objects, claiming he will not stand by while the innocent of the city are slaughtered. Khadgar and Thaelin Darkanvil take Blackhand's ships while the remaining heroes battle Blackhand. Blackhand easily defeats them all in a massive explosion, killing Orgrim and Maraad. Luckily, Yrel and Durotan are able to pummel Blackhand long enough for Khadgar to destroy their ships and teleport his allies to safety. Blackhand gets away and Shattrath is saved, for now.\nMeanwhile, under &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; had succeeded in summoning a small army of demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As commanded by Gul'dan, Teron'gor set his sights on , a sacred graveyard whose powerful souls could be used to strengthen the Shadow Council and their demon masters. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, having &lt;a href=\"Fury%20of%20the%20Sunwell\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; fighting demons, aids the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; in battling the legion and council forces with her &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; force. The united army of the Auchenai and the Blood Knights receive further aid from &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"Blood%20golem\"&gt;Blood golem&lt;/a&gt;s as well as from ancient gorian &lt;a href=\"Ango%27rosh%20ogres%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;ogre spirits&lt;/a&gt;. As Teron'gor's army is defeated in &lt;a href=\"Gul%27var\"&gt;Gul'var&lt;/a&gt;, he retreats to &lt;a href=\"Xandros\"&gt;Xandros&lt;/a&gt;. Liadrin and Maladaar accompany the adventurer and slay the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Mongrethod\"&gt;Mongrethod&lt;/a&gt;. However, Teron'gor had one last plan in place: the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt; who had infiltrated the Auchenai within Auchindoun. With their treacherous aid, he broke his way into the heart of Auchindoun, his demonic servants killing numerous priests and paladins. Teron'gor and his forces were thwarted, but the status of the mad warlock remained unknown. The remaining Sargerei and Shadow Council forces then went to Shattrath and served Socrethar who managed to summon more demons and they controlled the city for some time. The city was presumably retaken following Socrethar's death. The remainder of the Iron Horde forces in Talador retreated to &lt;a href=\"Bladefury%27s%20Command\"&gt;Bladefury's Command&lt;/a&gt; to guard the path to Hellscream's fortress in Tanaan.\nSpires of Arak: the arakkoa schism.\nWith the Legion and Iron Horde forces defeated in Talador, the Draenor expedition looked south to gain the aid of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor\"&gt;Admiral Taylor&lt;/a&gt;'s forces were the first to establish a &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; in Arak. As Taylor's forces set out to create their garrison, Taylor noticed that his follower &lt;a href=\"Ephial\"&gt;Ephial&lt;/a&gt; was obsessed with &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s. When a group of lumberjacks disappeared, Ephial, &lt;a href=\"Nas%20Dunberlin\"&gt;Nas Dunberlin&lt;/a&gt;, and a few of Taylor's men went to clear the area of &lt;a href=\"wasp\"&gt;wasp&lt;/a&gt;s. A few days later, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; attacked their garrison. Although they fended off the incursion, Ephial went missing after the fighting but subsequently returned. &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; later sought asylum at Taylor's garrison. Taylor agreed to protect Wrathion from the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s he offended so long as Wrathion remained under house arrest and full-time guard. Wrathion would continue to provide resources to Taylor's garrison and cryptically told Taylor to keep an eye on Ephial. When Taylor left to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt; arena battles, Ephial and his cultists took control of the garrison. After Taylor returned, he found the garrison overrun by the traitors and Wrathion gone with some of his best followers. While Taylor told his loyalists to save who they could from the defectors, Taylor went to face Ephial personally. Sometime later, the Alliance and Horde commanders soon came to the Spires of Arak to establish &lt;a href=\"Southport\"&gt;Southport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Axefall\"&gt;Axefall&lt;/a&gt; respectively. While the Alliance went to re-establish contact with Taylor's garrison and create a supply line between the two bases, the Horde sought to plunder it when they saw it was seemingly unguarded. The heroes soon discovered that Ephial was a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; and his death cult infiltrated Taylor's forces and turned Taylor's entire garrison into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s. The adventurers went on to dispatch Ephial's cultists and undead, and met up to rescue Admiral Taylor at his &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;. Ephial however, had transformed Taylor into the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20wraith\"&gt;Bone wraith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soulscythe\"&gt;Soulscythe&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers destroyed Soulscythe and slew Ephial, freeing Taylor and his loyalists from the dark magic that haunted the garrison. The commander's companion guided Taylor's spirit back to Southport but rather than retire to his due rest, Taylor decided to continue fighting at the Alliance commander's side as their follower.\nAfter witnessing the brutality of the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; and their hatred of any who are not of their cult of &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, the expedition allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt; and protected by their patron raven-god , summoned thanks to Iskar's mission in Talador to get &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;The Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, the outcasts were being persecuted and slaughtered by the fanatical adherents. To make matters worse, and his Shattered Hand clan began encroaching on the Spires as well. Using stealth, guerilla tactics and sabotage as their greatest weapons, the outcasts and their new allies made significant strikes against the adherent forces. One among the outcasts, &lt;a href=\"Reshad\"&gt;Reshad&lt;/a&gt; the storyteller, was able to complete the ritual to summon the weakened spirit of the ancient hero-king of the arakkoa: &lt;a href=\"Terokk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Talon King Terokk&lt;/a&gt;. The power of the Talon King was used to decimate the Shattered Hand forces, though Kargath himself managed to defeat Terokk and escape. Afterwards, Anzu sent the adventurers to the Ravenspeaker cult, a small group of outcasts, and they managed to summon Anzu's consort &lt;a href=\"Ka%27alu\"&gt;Ka'alu&lt;/a&gt;, gaining the aid of a large flock of &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt;s. With their new numbers and powerful allies, the outcast forces assault the remaining adherents at the spires near &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;. The battle for the spires ended when the adherent leader &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;High Sage Viryx&lt;/a&gt; was killed in Skyreach.\nNagrand: Garrosh's last stand.\nWith the victory against the mad arakkoa behind them and the Iron Horde's power diminishing across Draenor, the Alliance/Horde expedition set their sights on the one responsible for the war: &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The expedition receives word that Grommash had promoted Garrosh to Warlord of the Warsong clan while Grommash is in Tanaan, in addition to giving him his personal weapon, Gorehowl. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; personally lead the expedition forces into Nagrand. After establishing bases for cavalry and &lt;a href=\"Steam%20tank\"&gt;Steam tank&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"Demolisher\"&gt;Demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s, the expedition first decided to weaken the Warsong clan's allies, the and the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt;s, before going after Garrosh. The disgraced &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt; allied himself with the expedition adventurers and together they battled the Burning Blade. The clan's warlord was slain, only for his position and blade &lt;a href=\"Sanketsu\"&gt;Sanketsu&lt;/a&gt; to be taken up by his daughter: &lt;a href=\"Azuka%20Bladefury\"&gt;Azuka Bladefury&lt;/a&gt;. Azuka banishes Lantresor before retreating for now. The ogres at &lt;a href=\"Mar%27gok%27s%20Overwatch\"&gt;Mar'gok's Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, researching and creating a new breed of ogre mages known as \"breakers,\" were also dispatched, some of them retreating to the ogre capital of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;. The fallen draenei town of &lt;a href=\"Telaar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt; was liberated from Warsong raiders with the help of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Kajassa\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Kajassa&lt;/a&gt; and the forces from &lt;a href=\"Telaari%20Station\"&gt;Telaari Station&lt;/a&gt;. Durotan then leads an attack on the Warsong stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Lok-rath\"&gt;Lok-rath&lt;/a&gt;. At first it appears to be a decisive victory, with &lt;a href=\"Uruk%20Foecleaver\"&gt;Uruk Foecleaver&lt;/a&gt; declaring that he surrenders. However, this was a ruse and the deceptive Warsong attack when the expedition forces have their guard down. After a bloody battle, Lok-rath's orcs were dealt with.\nIn the meantime, and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Nobundo\"&gt;Vindicator Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; worked with &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Throne of the Element&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt; to calm the elements on the north and discover the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"Gordawg%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Gordawg&lt;/a&gt;. It was discovered that 's lackey - - had gained control of the pale orcs, Gordawg and the naaru &lt;a href=\"K%27ure%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;. Though the two fought their way to , they were unable to safe any of them with Cho'gall taking K'ure's power to himself, betraying Gul'dan and leaving for an unknown destination with the rest of the pale orcs. While Gordawg was killed, his ghost returned to the Throne. During this time, Warsong shamans also pulled the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; creatures from the Twisting Nether. The shamans were stopped before they could cause any further chaos.\nWith the Warsong's allies subdued and their forces routed, the expedition set their eyes on Garrosh's seat of power in Nagrand: &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall, Yrel, Durotan, Draka, &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20D%27kaan\"&gt;Rangari D'kaan&lt;/a&gt; destroy the gates and charge within. The Warsong prove difficult opponents, retaliating with packs of &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20shaman\"&gt;Dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;, and even the subjugated &lt;a href=\"Durn%20the%20Hungerer\"&gt;Durn the Hungerer&lt;/a&gt;. As the Iron Horde forces continued to fall, Durotan/Rangari D'kaan and the commander break into Garrosh's hold and engage him directly. Garrosh shows that time had not dulled his edge and uses Grommash's weapon &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with chain-weapons to subdue his enemies, but they are saved when Thrall arrives and challenges Garrosh to one last &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh, proud as ever, agrees and claims the sight will be the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Stones of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, the future sight of &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; where Garrosh's journey with Thrall began. A fierce duel ensues, with Garrosh claiming Thrall made him what he is. Thrall denies this, claiming Garrosh chose his own destiny before using his shaman powers to electrocute Garrosh to death. The Warsong were defeated and the war criminal Garrosh was finally brought to justice. But despite his death, the war was far from over.\nHighmaul.\nAfter the commander was promoted to general, the expedition planned to finish off Grommash's ogre allies at &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;. Having proved their worth in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Trials%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ring of Trials&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance/Horde forces fought in the Highmaul Arena's \"Battle of Red Spires,\" where Grommash and Kargath were in attendance. After dispatching &lt;a href=\"Vul%27gor\"&gt;Vul'gor&lt;/a&gt;, himself sought to pay back the adventurers who had insulted him back in Tanaan. Using the arena's traps against him, the Shattered Hand warlord was slain. used this opportunity to break into the city and use his new army of &lt;a href=\"Pale%20orc\"&gt;Pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s to assault Highmaul, wishing to gain &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt;'s magic runes for himself. Both the pale orcs and ogres suffered heavy losses as the adventurers fought their way through the city and into Mar'gok's sanctum. In normal difficulty, Mar'gok simply uses the runes to empower himself and dies despite all his power and guards. In mythic difficulty, Cho'gall is able to breach the sanctum and successfully absorbs Mar'gok's power, killing him. The mad ogre mage attacks the party with the void magic gained from &lt;a href=\"K%27ure%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;, shouting rhetoric of the \"infinite night\" strikingly similar to his &lt;a href=\"Old%20god\"&gt;Old god&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;counterpart&lt;/a&gt;. Cho'gall falls and delivers an ominous warning that \"He comes... you can never escape...\"\nThe Garrison Campaign.\n&lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin's chief scout, and &lt;a href=\"Bodrick%20Grey\"&gt;Bodrick Grey&lt;/a&gt; receive word that Azuka Bladefury has joined the Iron Horde and will be meeting with Grommash at a council. The general clashes with the Burning Blade warlord, the duel ending in a draw. The expedition and the Burning Blade then race to gain the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Gorgorek\"&gt;Heart of Gorgorek&lt;/a&gt;, a titan artifact that can control the mightiest and oldest magnaronn, &lt;a href=\"Gorgorek\"&gt;Gorgorek&lt;/a&gt;. Azuka eventually succeeded in gaining the artifact and awakening Gorgorek, planning to use the magnaronn to spearhead an Iron Horde assault on Talador from the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Tanaan\"&gt;Gates of Tanaan&lt;/a&gt;. The expedition's garrison forces and &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20followers\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; intercept the Iron Horde before they can launch their attack. Using &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt; riders, the commander felled the mighty magnaronn and fought Azuka one last time. Azuka showed the true power of her sword Sanketsu, the ability to grow stronger with every life it takes, by killing her own Burning Blade initiates. The Burning Blade warlord finally met her end as her clan watched in disbelief. As expedition forces finished mopping up, they saw the gates to Tanaan were far too fortified to take at that moment. Despite Grommash's taunts, Durotan/Yrel back off to fight another day, vowing to take Grommash's life when the time is right.\nBlackrock Foundry.\nKeeping up the momentum of their victories against the Iron Horde, the expedition forces assaulted &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, the place where the clans received most of their weapons, armor and siege weapons. The foundry was protected by champions of the different orc clans, such as &lt;a href=\"Flamebender%20Ka%27graz\"&gt;Flamebender Ka'graz&lt;/a&gt; of the Burning Blade, and &lt;a href=\"Beastlord%20Darmac\"&gt;Beastlord Darmac&lt;/a&gt; of the Thunderlord. As the raid found their way to &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Blackrock%20Foundry%29\"&gt;Blackhand's Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackhand%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; used all his remaining strength, weapons and mastery of fire, but was overwhelmed. Without the Blackrock Clan's weapons, Grommash's Horde was greatly weakened. \nGul'dan Ascendant.\nAs Grommash's Horde continues to fall apart around him, of the was one of the few who remained at his side, though the Bleeding Hollow began to show signs of discontent. It was at this time that Gul'dan made his reappearance at the gates of Tanaan Jungle. The warlock attempts to break Grommash's spirit by reviewing his Horde's failure, revealing Garrosh is both dead and was his son. He offers the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; once more, claiming it is the only thing that can save the orcs now. After refusing, Grommash is restrained by Gul'dan's powers. Kilrogg however, knowing his own eventual fate, was indeed willing to drink the fel blood, transforming him into a demonic monstrosity. With Grommash captured and the remaining orcs under his command, Gul'dan prepares for the arrival of his demon masters.\nTanaan: Fury of Hellfire.\nGul'dan uses the corpse and blood of Mannoroth to channel a spell that corrupts Tanaan and shares the blood with those loyal to him, creating the Felblood orcs, as well as rallying several arakkoa from of the Adherents, Outcasts and Sethekk with the promise of flight including &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Lord%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Lord Iskar&lt;/a&gt;, and the remaining &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt;. He travels to and creates a demon portal called the Black Gate to bring forth the full force of the Burning Legion. While Durotan and Maladaar lead a frontal charge through Talador, Draka and Yrel use the newly constructed shipyards to establish a foothold on the eastern side of Tanaan. They organize various attacks to weaken the enemy forces. \nIn the meantime, the enemy launched several attacks, such as Sargerei's final attack on Auchindoun, this time to locate Teron'gor.\nWith the help of Drek'Thar, Yrel and the recently defected &lt;a href=\"Oronok%20Torn-heart%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Oronok Torn-heart&lt;/a&gt;, they stop Gul'dan from using the &lt;a href=\"Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Cyrukh\"&gt;Cyrukh&lt;/a&gt;, preventing the tragedy that happened in the prime-timeline's Shadowmoon Valley. \nThe united forces, led by Khadgar, charge into Hellfire Citadel, destroying all the powerful demons, corrupted orcs, and aberrations the Legion laid before them, including the now-corrupted Iskar, &lt;a href=\"Gorefiend\"&gt;Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and the resurrected &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers also free the captured former Warchief, Grommash Hellscream. In the end, the heroes of Draenor and the expedition, Yrel, Durotan, Khadgar, and even the defected Grommash, came together to slay &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. With his dying breath, Archimonde, stating they had a pact, sends a fel blast to Gul'dan, sending him through the Black Gate as the eyes of Archimonde dims. Grommash concluded that now Draenor is free. While Khadgar acknowledges that the war with the Burning Legion itself is far from over and that they must return to their own timeline, Yrel assures him that if they ever have need of Draenor's heroes, they will be there. Khadgar flies off as Yrel, Grommash, and Durotan vow to rebuild Draenor.\nOther battles.\nKhadgar's campaign.\nWhile the Alliance-Horde expedition was mostly busy dealing with the Iron Horde, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, feeling responsible for the release of Gul'dan after the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, leads agents of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; to track down the mad warlock. While &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; opposes the Horde, the pragmatic Khadgar accepts their aid. He forges a powerful magic ring to aid the commander against the Iron Horde and Gul'dan's forces. While besieging Highmaul, the adventurers brought back &lt;a href=\"Abrogator%20Stone\"&gt;Abrogator Stone&lt;/a&gt;s to help track down Gul'dan, but his help is requested by &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; to help track &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, the cause of entire war. It is revealed that Kairoz was killed by Garrosh shortly after arriving on Draenor and his spirit is fought. Gul'dan was not blind to Khadgar's plans, however, and sent his best assassin: . Nearly successful in killing him, Garona is captured by the adventurer and Khadgar's bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Tablet\"&gt;Elemental Tablet&lt;/a&gt;s from Blackrock Foundry and a Shadow Council &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Orb of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar frees Garona from Gul'dan's mind control. Eternally grateful, Garona swears her life to the commander. Together, they witness Gul'dan's meeting with Grommash and Kilrogg. With Gul'dan now in command of the Iron Horde, the trio retreats to regroup and strategize. After the general builds the shipyard, Khadgar requests that they bring down Gul'dan's flagship and confiscate Gul'dan's library of chaos magic. After finishing these, it is revealed that Cordana was corrupted by Gul'dan from afar by the Orb of Domination, seduced by his power. The general is forced to put Cordana down, but she was able to stun the general and create a demonic portal to escape. Obtaining more knowledge for Khadgar has gained helps him increase the magic ring he gave the general to it's maximum potential. He later proceeds to aid in the final battle with &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; before returning to Azeroth.\nPrimals versus Breakers.\nIn Gorgrond, the forces of &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; are locked in an eternal battle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; wanted to maintain their own link between &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and Draenor, building a portal in the &lt;a href=\"Everbloom\"&gt;Everbloom&lt;/a&gt; and drawing attention of the primal forces. The botani and the genesaur &lt;a href=\"Yalnu\"&gt;Yalnu&lt;/a&gt; attacked and corrupted &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Bluff\"&gt;Violet Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and turned on to the portal. Once the genesaur entered Azeroth, he was put down by the remaining mages and the adventurers of the Alliance and Horde.\nAshran.\nThe forces of the Alliance and Horde camped in the &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warspear\"&gt;north&lt;/a&gt; respectively of &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;. The Iron Horde has no presence on the island but the ghost of ogres control several locations.\nThe Alliance is seeking a specific, large artifact, theorized by &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt; to have powers rivaling that of &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; technology. The artifact appears to have military applications, with the possibility of using it or the knowledge gained from it against the Horde. The Horde are aware of the Alliance's search, and are attempting to find it first in order to defend themselves, breaking their treaty with the other faction and attacking it in the process.\nSpeculation.\nWhile not directly stated, although previously hinted to be the only way, Garrosh likely used the final shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; to link the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth.\nWhen and how exactly the &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt; entered the alternate Draenor is unclear. It could be during the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; invasion when the orcs controlled the Portal.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

After escaping from the &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt; with the help of Horde heroes and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, Talanji sailed to her homeland of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, pursued by a fleet of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As the humans were about to get to her, the princess summoned the help of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt; to clear a path for them. The timely arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt; then finally destroyed the human ships, leaving a single boat to escape to report to the Alliance leadership what happened there.\nThe human survivors, led by &lt;a href=\"Brigadier%20Thom\"&gt;Brigadier Thom&lt;/a&gt;, washed upon &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;'s coast at &lt;a href=\"Talanji%27s%20Rebuke\"&gt;Talanji's Rebuke&lt;/a&gt; and built up a camp at &lt;a href=\"Castaway%20Encampment\"&gt;Castaway Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. Zandalari infantry tracked them down, helped by freshly-arrived &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; soldiers. The \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" was sent by the Alliance to evacuate the survivors, having to destroy a Horde blockade led by &lt;a href=\"Major%20Alan%20Hawkins\"&gt;a Forsaken officer&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Wind's Redemption\" also carried a joint &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; expedition led by &lt;a href=\"Anvil-Thane%20Thurgaden\"&gt;Anvil-Thane Thurgaden&lt;/a&gt; that was sent to mine &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the Horde arrived soon after and chased them out. After the Dark Iron &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; were saved from the &lt;a href=\"mole%20machine\"&gt;mole machine&lt;/a&gt;s they were trapped in, they summoned a great &lt;a href=\"magma%20giant\"&gt;magma giant&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; and razed down the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Cartel&lt;/a&gt; army occupying &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Bonanza\"&gt;Bilgewater Bonanza&lt;/a&gt;, which didn't stop the goblins from eventually coming back.\nUninterested in Azerite, the dwarves of the Explorers' League engaged themselves in an archeological competition over the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Xibala\"&gt;Breath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Xibala\"&gt;Eye of Xibala&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;. The Explorers themselves were supported by their Dark Iron brethren while the blood elves were with the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Magma%20Victim\"&gt;bodies&lt;/a&gt; of the Bilgewater goblins were still smoking when conflict resumed between their reinforcements and freshly-arrived &lt;a href=\"void%20elf\"&gt;void elf&lt;/a&gt; invaders. The elves were not here for the Azerite the goblins sought, however, for they were truly interested in finding and murdering &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, a financial supporter of the Horde's war campaign. The goblin himself was busy looting the gold of &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt; with his thieves, escaping through a teleporter to his &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;pleasure palace&lt;/a&gt; when found by Umbric. Even then, Gallywix got away through the use of an &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Impersonator\"&gt;impersonator&lt;/a&gt;.\nVol'dun.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" later sailed to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to establish a beachhead. The boat sent its &lt;a href=\"marine\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt;s down to capture &lt;a href=\"Shatterstone%20Harbor\"&gt;Shatterstone Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently taken from the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the losses, the marines managed to take the area thanks to their naval artillery support. When a reckless &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Ermey\"&gt;Sergeant Ermey&lt;/a&gt; went on a mission to save a captured soldier, he made acquaintance with &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt; sethrak, leading to the two factions helping each other. At the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Terrace of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance learned about the story of Vol'dun and the current whereabouts of the sethrak civil war. After that, the \"Wind's Redemption\" returned to Boralus, leaving &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; in charge of the area.\nWhen the Alliance later came back, they came for High Examiner &lt;a href=\"Arlethal%20Sunwatcher\"&gt;Arlethal Sunwatcher&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance troops bombed several archeological dig sites and murdered the expedition leader, also making the grim discovery that a &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; Blood Prince seemed to now be serving the Horde.\nNazmir.\nThe Alliance had sent &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Conrad\"&gt;Captain Conrad&lt;/a&gt; and her troops in advance in order to create &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Victory\"&gt;Fort Victory&lt;/a&gt; and try to make allies of the local &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s, unsavory friends but still opponents to the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; associates. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt; were then sent later to check on them. Surprisingly the blood trolls had agreed to a trade agreement, asking for people to be sent to them with offerings through giant bats to &lt;a href=\"Zalamar\"&gt;Zalamar&lt;/a&gt;. \nBrann was dubious about the deal; and for the right reasons: it quickly turned out that the Alliance representatives were actually the offerings themselves, sacrificed through blood rituals. The dwarf explorer managed to escape &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Hir'eek's Lair&lt;/a&gt; on a stolen bat. An investigation at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Nazman\"&gt;Zul'Nazman&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the blood trolls thought Conrad was a messenger from &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;their blood god&lt;/a&gt;, and the captain, at first only willing to enforce the Alliance's goals, became enticed by their offer of unholy power and had joined them. Brann went on to investigate the events of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, and Keeshan was made new commander of Fort Victory.\nSome times later, another expedition was sent to take down &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt; under the order of &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, despite the two of them having worked together before. The Alliance adventurers saved &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s captured by the blood trolls in order to find out the location of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;. Areiel was to participate in a meeting alongside &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Prince%20Dreven\"&gt;Blood Prince Dreven&lt;/a&gt;, which sought to join the Horde with his vampiric brethren.

One of the largest and most costly wars in Azeroth's history, the War of the Ancients influenced the fate of all life on the planet for millennia to come. The conflict ultimately led to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, a cataclysmic event which tore the planet's landmass apart, thus altering its history permanently. It was the first time one of the Legion's invasions of a world had ever been stopped.\nAs part of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;its relentless crusade&lt;/a&gt; to extinguish all life in the universe, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' desire to access the planet's &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, the Burning Legion set its sights on remote Azeroth. Seducing the highest caste of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; (which dominated the planet) with promises of paradise and power, the Legion gradually, but successfully, began to enter the planet through a trans-dimensional portal. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, the demons launched a campaign to wipe out the major group resisting the Legion's coming - the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nComposed of powerful characters such as &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and others, the resistance fought many vicious battles \u2014 often with mixed results \u2014 against Sargeras' forces. Their ultimate goal was to repel the Legion's invasion and prevent the demon lord from entering their world. After much sacrifice and dedication, an alliance of the mortal races and others succeeded in defeating the Burning Legion's invasion, though it came at the terrible cost of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; which, being used as a massive portal by the demons, violently imploded shortly after.\nHistory.\nMany thousands of years ago &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest champion of &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt; resolved to destroy all life in the universe to prevent the sinister &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;rulers of the Void&lt;/a&gt; from being able to spread their destructive influence. Above all else, he sought to destroy the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s, as they were what the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s desired most. To this end, Sargeras rallied an army of demons from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. When his brethren tried to stop him, he executed them all, but not before he learned from them of what was perhaps the most powerful world-soul in the universe; a planet called &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nMillennia after that event (10,000 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;), the upper classes of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, a magocratic nation built around the magical lake called the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, sought to further increase their magical powers. This motion was instigated by their selfish monarch, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her closest advisor, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. Their reckless experiments with the powerful font sent ripples through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and into the Twisting Nether itself. This caught the attention of Sargeras, who knew that he'd found his greatest target. Rallying his vast Burning Legion he made his way towards the unsuspecting world of Azeroth, but to claim it, he and his armies would have to emerge from the Nether, and to do this, they would need help from the other side.\nSargeras and the Highborne.\nXavius was the first of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; to hear Sargeras' whispers. His dark might so impressed the night elf, that Xavius was convinced he'd been contacted by a god. He alerted his queen to his discovery, and soon Azshara and almost all of the Highborne had turned to worshiping of the Dark Titan, believing him to be a great being who would remake their world into a paradise for them alone. Azshara, in particular, considered a being of Sargeras' power to be the only one worthy to be her mate and king, ruling \"her\" new world together. With these thoughts, Azshara had Xavius drew on the Well's power to construct within its depths an immense portal that would allow the Burning Legion entrance into Azeroth.\nWith these preparations made, Sargeras began to send his agents through the budding portal. First came packs of vampiric &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s and their retainer &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;. These demonic canines stealthily spread across the world's single continent, &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and attacked any &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s who were not of the Highborne. With their tentacles, they'd drain every drop of mana from these wielders of the arcane, then devour whatever flesh was left. Their work impressed Xavius and Azshara, reaffirming their loyalty to the Legion's incredible power.\nSoon the Legion's main troops emerged; the staunch &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt; who formed the primary infantry of the Legion, the &lt;a href=\"wrathguard\"&gt;wrathguard&lt;/a&gt; who struck skillfully with magic and blade, and the menacing &lt;a href=\"terrorguard\"&gt;terrorguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; who oversaw the efforts of the soldiers and summoned terrifying &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s like meteors from the sky. Slowly but surely the demonic armies marched out from the night elf capital, &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, killing and destroying everything in their path. However, it wasn't long before they were met with resistance.\nKaldorei Resistance.\nThe night elf people, aware of the attacks from these strange creatures, were rallied by a noble who had not joined with Azshara, due to not being a Highborne, a brave and skillful general and politician named &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;. Lord Ravencrest, believing that the Queen had been taken captive by Xavius, rallied his people into a &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;powerful resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Among this resistance were three particularly skilled young night elves: &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; who wielded the holy powers of the goddess with skill surpassing her age; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, a young, though reckless, mage who wielded the arcane as well as any Highborne; and finally Illidan's brother &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, an eccentric young night elf who'd forsaken the opulence and arcane abilities of his people in favor of '&lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism', the power of the forests. Though Malfurion and Illidan shared a love for the idealistic priestess, Tyrande's heart belonged to Malfurion alone. Illidan resented his brother's budding romance with Tyrande but knew that his heartache was nothing compared to the pain of his magical addiction. The trio all proved to be vital members of the resistance, with Illidan being placed in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;, a peacekeeping order of mages under the empire.\nTogether this resistance fought against the Burning Legion, and though they were successful at slowing the demon army's advance, they were unable to overcome them completely and, slowly but surely, found themselves being pushed back. The younger elves, including Malfurion and a young soldier named &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, implored Kur'talos to seek the aid of the other races of Azeroth. The elder night elf, however, was victim to old prejudices of his people and would hear none of it. Nonetheless, it soon became clear that the night elves needed aid, or they would fail.\nBy this time the Legion's greater members and commanders had arrived on Azeroth; the brutal and savage &lt;a href=\"Annihilan\"&gt;pit lords&lt;/a&gt;, led by their cruel king &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;; and the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;, wielders of incredible demonic magic led by the analytical and tactical genius &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. Under the guidance of the latter, the Legion's portal grew stronger than ever. Furthermore, Azshara had Xavius woven a spell that blocked all but the demons and Highborne from drawing power from the Well of Eternity. As the Well was the source of all arcane magic on Azeroth, it fell to Malfurion to find help for his beleaguered people.\nThe young druid resolved to use the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, an ethereal realm formed from the dreams of Azeroth itself, to infiltrate the palace and find a way to stop the Highborne. While he was unable to completely stop the Highborne's plans, he was able to interfere with them by destroying the spell matrix sustaining both the block on the Well of Eternity, and the Highborne's portal. During this mission, he fought Xavius, whose enchanted false eyes could see even those in the Dream, and their battle resulted in a great explosion that destroyed the tower where the matrix was held, killing Xavius.\nNew allies.\nAround the same time, Azshara had instructed her personal bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then\"&gt;Captain Varo'then&lt;/a&gt;, to eliminate Lord Ravencrest, with the hopes of quelling the rebellion that slowed the arrival of her god. Varo'then sent an assassin, &lt;a href=\"Kelorn%20Nightblade\"&gt;Kelorn Nightblade&lt;/a&gt;, to do the deed, and Ravencrest was successfully killed in the middle of the battlefield. Kelorn himself was killed shortly afterwards.\nWithout Ravencrest, command of the resistance army fell to &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt;, Ravencrest's second-in-command. Though arrogant and incompetent, Stareye agreed to allow Jarod Shadowsong's alliance with the other races of Azeroth; primarily the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;mountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;. However Stareye was completely useless tactically and in combat and it wasn't long before the Legion made short work of him, leaving Jarod to assume command of the resistance.\nMeanwhile, Illidan, who had grown dependent on magic's empowering energies, struggled to keep control of his nearly overwhelming hunger to tap the Well's energies once again. However, with Tyrande's patient support, he was able to restrain himself. Malfurion, who'd recovered from his battle with Xavius with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, sought the aid of the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s in fighting the Legion. While on this adventure he encountered and defeated Hakkar, banishing the demon back to the Nether. His mission was a success, with the aid of the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Jarod led the resistance with great skill, including the use of the tauren and the earthen, he was shocked when the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s themselves, including Cenarius, emerged from the forests and attacked the Legion. He was further surprised when they submitted to his leadership, and he used them to their utmost efficiency. However even they suffered great casualties at the hands of the demons. The bear gods &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;, the Mistress of birds &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, and several others were killed by the demons. Cenarius, enraged at their loss, attacked the Legion recklessly, only to be nearly brought down himself. He was saved by the intervention of his father, &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; the White Stag. The great demigod defended his son while the night elves got him to safety, and Malorne nearly turned the tide of battle... until Archimonde appeared. The great demon lord used magic to grow in size, and brought the full force of his &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; might against the great stag. Their battle drew on, but ultimately Archimonde was the victor, breaking Malorne's neck and casting him aside. Malfurion, who returned by now, retaliated with a great mass of vines that drove Archimonde to retreat.\nRoughly during this stage of the conflict, the tauren leader &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, rescued Cenarius' favored stag &lt;a href=\"Eche%27ro\"&gt;Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt; and the four united tauren tribes were granted the &lt;a href=\"Horns%20of%20Eche%27ro\"&gt;Horns of Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt; as a reward. Shortly afterwards, Huln attacked and banished &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, the nathrezim commander in the area.\nMeanwhile at Zin-Azshari, some of the Highborne were approached in the night by a demon shaped like a goat-man who was none other than Xavius, now reborn as the first &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;. He offered select Highborne the gift of becoming satyrs themselves, and many agreed.\nThe Dragon Soul.\nThe dragonflights arrived, led by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, the red &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, the black Dragon Aspect. Though their arrival initially proved a monumental aid, things turned dark when Neltharion unleashed his secret weapon: the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. This small golden disk, infused with the powers of the Dragon Aspects, was capable of channeling great amounts of power. And Neltharion wielded this power, in the form of golden beams of energy, against the Legion... and the defenders of Kalimdor. When the other dragons confronted him over his apparent recklessness, he revealed to them that he'd fallen victim to &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;dark voices&lt;/a&gt; from within the very earth he protected. These voices had driven him to madness, convincing him that the other dragons were plotting against him, and fueling a growing resentment of the titans for placing the weight of the earth on him. He planned to create a world ruled by the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, believing ultimate power would relieve him of his burden.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspect of the blue dragons, and his flight attempted to stop his crazed brother, Neltharion made an example of him by using the Dragon Soul to destroy the majority of Malygos' flight, and hurling the survivors to the far corners of the world. Many of the dragons, including Malygos's consort &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;, fell to ground that later became covered by the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion was about to turn the Dragon Soul on the other flights, but the use of its immense energies began to affect his body, causing great cracks and wounds to tear open on his body, forcing him to retreat.\nThough all sides were shaken, the war would soon resume, though many dragons retreated out of shock and sorrow. Malfurion, convinced that the Well of Eternity was the demons' umbilical link to the physical world, insisted that it should be destroyed. His companions, knowing that the Well was the source of their immortality and powers, were horrified by the rash notion. Yet Tyrande saw the wisdom of Malfurion's theory, so she convinced Cenarius and their comrades to storm Azshara's temple and find a way to shut the Well down for good.\nPossibly around this time, the Highborne of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; who had watched as their city was used by the cunning &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; as an experiment in the creation of an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army, responded to an attempt by the Legion to create a second portal in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the court of the &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; sealed the tomb, and proceeded to create a massive barrier surrounding the still intact sections of the city, sealing themselves off from the conflict.\nIllidan's betrayal.\nKnowing that the Well's destruction would prevent him from ever wielding magic again, Illidan seemingly betrayed the resistance and joined the Highborne to warn them of Malfurion's plan. There, at Azshara's palace, he had his eyes pierced out by Sargeras, and was granted both enhanced mystical eyesight, and a vision of the true might of the Legion; armies beyond the one that marched on Azeroth, and demons that had already been killed had merely been banished back to the Nether where they would be reborn. Shaken by this vision, but undeterred, Illidan continued his own plans, for despite his magical addiction what he really wanted was to sabotage the Highborne from within.\nMeanwhile, Tyrande found herself taken captive by Xavius. When Malfurion discovered the satyr, he and the young archer &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; fought and killed Xavius once again. Malfurion transformed a wooden arrow into a tree that devoured the demon as it grew. However, this did not prevent Tyrande's capture by the satyrs.\nShortly after, Malfurion was charged with stealing the Dragon Soul from Neltharion, with the goal of keeping it away from both the black dragon and the Legion. While Malfurion was successful, Captain Varo'then and Illidan accosted him as he returned to the resistance army and stole the relic. The Highborne and Azshara had learned of it and decided it was just what was needed to strengthen the portal for Sargeras.\nWith Tyrande and the Dragon Soul in her grasp, and Sargeras' titanic shadow looming ever closer, it became more important than ever to reach the palace. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion and a group of allies infiltrated Zin-Azshari and met with Illidan. Malfurion, though angry at his brother's betrayal, soon learned the truth of his intentions. Illidan had concocted a plan to expel the Legion from Azeroth by using the Dragon Soul to reverse the portal, dragging all who'd come through back into the Nether. Malfurion agreed to aid him with this plan and, with the rescued Tyrande, followed Mannoroth to the shores of the Well, where the Dragon Soul had been taken to prepare the final portal.\nIllidan snuck into the palace, where he met with a group of five mysterious night elves, in fact &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s from the far future. With their aid, he shut down the minor portals and fought &lt;a href=\"Peroth%27arn\"&gt;Peroth'arn&lt;/a&gt;, the satyr overseeing them. The time travelers then split off from Illidan and proceeded to eliminate Azshara's &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Keepers of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, but were unable to even scratch the Queen herself who was taken to safety by Varo'then.\nThe dragons returned to the fray at this time, hoping to retrieve the Dragon Soul as they'd learned that the malevolent Old Gods sought to turn the massive portal's energies towards their prisons, shattering them and allowing their black armies to claim Azeroth for themselves. Neltharion re-appeared at this time as well, now bearing &lt;a href=\"adamantine\"&gt;adamantine&lt;/a&gt; plates bolted into his skin to hold him together. Now calling himself Deathwing, the black dragon obsessively tried to reclaim the Dragon Soul but was cast aside by the Old Gods.\nThe sundering of the world.\nOn the shores of the Well, the time travelers and Illidan rejoined with Malfurion who needed them to distract Mannoroth long enough for him to complete the reversal of the portal. Illidan, Tyrande, and the time travelers agreed and fought through the Legion's minions and killed Varo'then, before attacking Mannoroth. Though the pit lord attempted to stop them with all his might, Illidan briefly used fel magic to enhance himself and the time travelers enough to hold out for a few more crucial seconds. The group's efforts succeeded and the portal within the Well of Eternity reversed, pulling demons from all corners of Kalimdor back through it, even mighty Mannoroth. The Dragon Soul fell from the spell matrix, but was stopped from being lost by the surprise appearance of the one dragon Aspect who'd been absent until now; &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, the bronze dragon. He quickly vanished with the artifact as the portal began to destabilize. Unwilling to accept his first ever defeat, Sargeras angrily tried to force himself through the collapsing portal but was unable to do so and forcibly ejected back into the Nether.\nThis was not the end of things, however. Fearing for the Well, Illidan slipped away to the very edge and filled five small vials with its water. His fear soon proved to be well-founded, as the stresses placed on the Well of Eternity had reached a breaking point with the collapsing portal. As a result, the earth quaked, and the entire Well began collapsing into the portal as well. As the races of Azeroth sought shelter with the aid of the dragons, the very land itself collapsed and broke, being dragged into the angry torrent the collapsing Well had become. The sky darkened around the Well's remains as massive amounts of the landmass were ripped apart and swallowed by its implosion.\nAs the portal finally closed completely, and the implosion ended, the seas came rushing in to fill the massive wound in the earth. When at last this great event, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;the Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, came to an end, nearly eighty percent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor's landmass&lt;/a&gt; had been blasted apart. All that was left was a handful of separate continents surrounding a vast new ocean. At the center of the new sea, where the Well of Eternity once stood, was a tumultuous storm of tidal fury and chaotic energies. This terrible scar, known as the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, would never cease its furious spinning. It would remain a constant reminder of the terrible catastrophe... and the Utopian era that had been lost forever.\nAs for Queen Azshara and her Highborne, the entire city of Zin-Azshari was protected from the Sundering by the Queen's magic and remained as one single landmass as the ocean rushed in around her. Even she could not hold out for long, and her spell began to fail as she began to tire. But it was not the end for them. The Old Gods spoke to them, their dark whispers filling the minds of Azshara and her servitors. They promised survival in exchange for loyalty, and Azshara, devastated by her previous god's failure, agreed. When her spell failed and water flowed into the palace, it filled the lungs of the Queen and her Highborne, but they did not drown. Instead, the Highborne twisted and changed, transforming into the serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara's form changed too, twisting and growing into a great monstrosity that reflected the wickedness she'd always held in her heart. \nThere, at the bottom of the Maelstrom, the naga built for themselves a new city, &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, from which they would rebuild their power. It would take over ten thousand years before the naga would reveal their existence to the surface world.\nTime travelers.\nTime travelers were not originally present in the War of the Ancients, but due to two different incidents, they became involved. The first group of time travelers were a human mage named &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, his friend and teacher &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, and an orc warrior named &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu sent them back in time shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; when he sensed the Old Gods attempting to tamper with the timeways. Their presence caused minor alterations.\nThe second incident was several years later when Deathwing returned to Azeroth and caused &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;. As the resulting conflict against him and his masters drew on, Nozdormu deduced that the only way of stopping him was the Dragon Soul. A group of adventurers were tasked with going back to the War of the Ancients' final moments to recover the disk. In the end, as mentioned above, Nozdormu himself intervened and saved the Dragon Soul from falling into the collapsing Well. A short time later, after the Aspects used all their power to utterly annihilate Deathwing with the Dragon Soul, the relic returned to its proper place in time. Once again, the alterations were fairly minor.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nIn an interview on June 8th, 2010, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Chilton\"&gt;Tom Chilton&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the War of the Ancients would be a &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; raid instance released some time in the \"\" patch cycle. It was later revealed to be a 5-man heroic dungeon instead of a raid, the raid being the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , portions of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah%20storyline\"&gt;Val'sharah storyline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20storyline\"&gt;Highmountain storyline&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20Campaign\"&gt;Druid Campaign&lt;/a&gt; offer flashback quests of the War of the Ancients.\nVideos.\n&lt;evlplayer&gt;\n&lt;/evlplayer&gt;\nSpeculation.\nThere are legends among &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Days\"&gt;First Days&lt;/a&gt;, time when &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s roamed the land. Great &lt;a href=\"hero\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;es had to drive them out of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. These could be surviving tales of the War of the Ancients."}

That land mass, known as &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, was home to a number of disparate races and creatures, all vying for survival amongst the savage elements of the waking world. At the dark continent\u2019s center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies. The lake, which would later be called the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, was the true heart of the world\u2019s magic and natural power. Drawing its energies from the infinite &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark beyond&lt;/a&gt; the world, the Well acted as a mystical fount, sending its potent energies out across the world to nourish life in all its wondrous forms.\nIn time, a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids cautiously made their way to the edges of the mesmerizing, enchanted lake. The feral, nomadic humanoids, drawn by the Well\u2019s strange energies, built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well\u2019s cosmic power affected the strange tribe, making them strong, wise and virtually immortal. The tribe adopted\nthe name &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, which meant \u201cchildren of the stars\u201d in their native tongue. To celebrate their budding society, they constructed great structures and temples around the lake\u2019s periphery.\nThe Kaldorei, or &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; as they would later be known, worshipped the moon goddess, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and believed that she slept within the Well\u2019s shimmering depths during the daylight hours. The early night elf &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and seers studied the Well with an insatiable curiosity, driven to plumb its untold secrets and power. As their society grew, the night elves explored the breadth of Kalimdor and encountered its myriad denizens. The only creatures that gave them pause were the ancient and powerful &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Though the great serpentine beasts were often reclusive, they did much to safeguard the known lands from potential threats. The night elves believed that the dragons held themselves to be the protectors of the world, and that they and their secrets were best left alone. \nIn time, the night elves\u2019 curiosity led them to meet and befriend a number of powerful entities, not the least of which was &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty demi-god of the primordial forestlands. The great-hearted Cenarius grew fond of the inquisitive night elves and spent a great deal of time teaching them about the natural world. The tranquil Kaldorei developed a strong empathy for the living forests of Kalimdor and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature.\nYet, as the seemingly endless ages passed, the night elves\u2019 civilization expanded both territorially and culturally. Their temples, roads, and dwelling places stretched across the breadth of the dark continent. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves\u2019 beautiful and gifted Queen, built an immense, wondrous palace on the Well\u2019s shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls. Her servitors, whom she called the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Quel\u2019dorei&lt;/a&gt; or \u201chigh-borne,\u201d doted on her every command and believed themselves to be greater than the rest of their lower-caste brethren. Though Queen Azshara was loved equally by all of her people, the high-borne were secretly hated by the jealous masses.\nSharing the priests\u2019 curiosity towards the Well of Eternity, Azshara ordered the educated high-borne to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world. The high-borne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly. In time they developed the ability to manipulate and control the Well\u2019s cosmic energies. As their reckless experiments progressed, the high-borne found that they could use their newfound powers to either create or destroy at their leisure. The hapless high-borne had stumbled upon primitive &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and were now resolved to devote themselves to its mastery. Although they agreed that magic was inherently dangerous if handled irresponsibly, Azshara and her highborne began to practice their spellcraft with reckless abandon. Cenarius and many of the wizened night elf scholars warned that only calamity would result from toying with the clearly volatile arts of magic. But, Azshara and her followers stubbornly continued to expand their burgeoning powers.\nAs their powers grew, a distinct change came over Azshara and the high-borne. The haughty, aloof upper class became increasingly callous and cruel towards their fellow night elves. A dark, brooding pall veiled Azshara\u2019s once entrancing beauty. She began to withdraw from her loving subjects and refused to interact with any but her trusted high-borne priests.\nA young, brazen scholar named &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Furion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who had spent much of his time studying the Well\u2019s effects, began to suspect that a terrible power was corrupting the high-borne and his beloved Queen. Though he could not conceive the evil that was to come, he knew that the night elves\u2019 lives would soon be changed forever\u2026\nThe War of the Ancients.\nThe highborne\u2019s reckless use of magic sent ripples of energy spiraling out from the Well of Eternity and into the Great Dark Beyond. The ripples of energy streamed out into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and were felt by terrible alien minds. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Enemy of all life, the Ravager of Worlds, felt the potent ripples and was drawn to their distant point of origin. Spying the primordial world of Azeroth and sensing the limitless energies of the Well of Eternity, Sargeras was consumed by an insatiable hunger. The great, dark god of the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Void\"&gt;Nameless Void&lt;/a&gt; resolved to destroy the fledgling world and claim its energies as his own.\nSargeras gathered his vast, demonic army, known as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and made his way towards the unsuspecting world of Azeroth. The Legion, comprised of a million screaming demons, all ripped from the far corners of the universe, roiled and burned at the thought of conquest. Sargeras\u2019 lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;, prepared their infernal minions to strike. \nQueen Azshara, overwhelmed by the terrible ecstasy of her magic, fell victim to Sargeras\u2019 undeniable power, and agreed to grant him entrance to her world. Even her high-borne servitors gave themselves over to magic\u2019s inevitable corruption and began to worship Sargeras as their god. To show their allegiance to the Legion, the high-borne aided their Queen in opening a great, swirling portal within the depths of the Well of Eternity.\nOnce all his preparations had been made, Sargeras began his catastrophic invasion of Azeroth. The warrior-demons of the Burning Legion stormed into the world through the Well of Eternity and laid siege to the night elves\u2019 sleeping cities. Led by Archimonde and Mannoroth, the Legion swarmed over the lands of Kalimdor leaving only ash and sorrow in its wake. The demon &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s called down the searing &lt;a href=\"Infernal\"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt;s that crashed, like hellish meteors, into the graceful spires of Kalimdor\u2019s temples. The &lt;a href=\"Doomguard\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt;, a band of burning, bloodletting killers, marched across Kalimdor\u2019s fields slaughtering everyone in their path. Even packs of wild, demonic &lt;a href=\"Felhound\"&gt;Felhound&lt;/a&gt;s ravaged the countryside, unopposed. Though the brave Kaldorei warriors rushed to defend their ancient homeland, they were forced to give ground, inch by inch, before the fury of the Legion\u2019s onslaught.\nThe Sundering of the World.\nIt fell to the young scholar, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Furion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, to find help for his beleaguered people. Stormrage, whose own brother, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, practiced the highborne\u2019s magics, was incensed by the growing corruption amongst the upper class. Convincing Illidan to forsake his dangerous obsession, Furion set out to find &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and muster a resistance force. The young, beautiful priestess, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to accompany the brothers in the name of Elune. Though both Furion and Illidan shared a secret love for the idealistic priestess, Tyrande\u2019s heart belonged to Furion alone. Illidan resented his brother\u2019s budding romance with Tyrande, but knew that his heartache was nothing compared to the pain of his magical addiction\u2026\nIllidan, who had grown dependent on magic\u2019s empowering energies, struggled to keep control of himself and his overwhelming\nhunger to tap the Well\u2019s energies once again. However, with Tyrande\u2019s patient support, he was able to contain himself and help\nhis brother find the reclusive demi-god, Cenarius. Cenarius, who dwelt within the sacred &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;s of the distant &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to help the night elves by finding the ancient dragons and enlisting their aid. The dragons, led by the great, red leviathan, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to send their mighty flights to engage the demons and their infernal masters.\nCenarius, calling on the spirits of the enchanted forests, rallied an army of ancient tree-men and led them against the Legion in a daring ground assault. As the night elves\u2019 allies converged upon Azshara\u2019s temple and the Well of Eternity, all-out warfare erupted. Despite the strength of their newfound allies, Furion and his colleagues realized that the Legion could not be defeated by martial strength alone.\nAs the titanic battle raged around Azshara\u2019s capital city, the delusional Queen waited in anticipation for Sargeras\u2019 arrival. The Lord of the Legion was preparing to pass through the Well of Eternity and enter the ravaged world. As his impossibly huge shadow drew ever closer to the Well\u2019s raging surface, Azshara gathered the most powerful of her high-borne followers. Only by linking their magics together, in one focused spell, would they be able to create a gateway large enough for Sargeras to enter.\nFurion, convinced that the Well of Eternity was the demons\u2019 umbilical link to the physical world, insisted that it should be\ndestroyed. His companions, knowing that the Well was the source of their immortality and powers, were shocked by the rash notion. Yet Tyrande, seeing the wisdom of Furion\u2019s theory, convinced Cenarius and their dragon comrades to storm Azshara\u2019s temple and find a way to shut the Well down for good.\nKnowing that the Well\u2019s destruction would prevent him from ever wielding magic again, Illidan selfishly abandoned the group and set out to warn the high-borne of Furion\u2019s plan. Due to the madness brought on by his addiction and the stinging resentment towards his brother\u2019s affair with Tyrande, Illidan felt no remorse at betraying Furion and siding with Azshara and her ilk. Above all else, Illidan vowed to protect the Well\u2019s power by any means necessary.\nHeartbroken by his brother\u2019s departure, Furion led his companions into the heart of Azshara\u2019s temple. Yet, as they stormed into the main audience chamber, they found the high-borne in the midst of their final dark incantation. The raging communal spell created an unstable vortex of power within the Well\u2019s raging depths. As Sargeras\u2019 ominous shadow drew ever closer\nto the surface, Furion and his allies rushed to attack.\nAzshara, having received Illidan\u2019s warning, was more than prepared for them. Nearly all of Furion\u2019s followers fell before the mad Queen\u2019s raging powers. Tyrande, attempting to attack Azshara from behind, was caught off guard by the Queen\u2019s high-borne guardsmen. Though she vanquished the guardsmen, Tyrande suffered grievous wounds at their hands. At seeing his love fall, Furion went into a murderous rage and resolved to end Azshara\u2019s life. \nAs the battle raged inside and outside of the temple, Illidan appeared from the shadows near the shores of the great Well. Producing a set of specially crafted vials, Illidan knelt and filled each with the Well\u2019s shimmering waters. Convinced that the demons would crush the night elves\u2019 civilization, he planned to steal the sacred waters and keep their energies for himself. \nThe ensuing battle between Furion and Azshara threw the highborne\u2019s carefully crafted spellwork into chaos. The unstable vortex within the Well\u2019s depths finally exploded and ignited a catastrophic chain of events that would sunder the world forever. The massive explosion rocked the temple to its foundations and sent massive quakes ripping through the tortured earth. As the horrific battle between the Legion and the night elves\u2019 allies raged around and above the ruined capital city, the surging Well of Eternity buckled in upon itself and collapsed.\nThe resultant catastrophic explosion shattered the earth and blotted out the skies...\nAftermath.\nAs the aftershocks from the Well\u2019s implosion rattled the bones of the world, the seas rushed in to fill the gaping wound left in the earth. Nearly eighty percent of Kalimdor\u2019s landmass had been blasted apart, leaving only a handful of separate continents surrounding the new, raging sea. At the center of the new sea, where the Well of Eternity once stood, was a tumultuous storm of tidal fury and chaotic energies. This terrible scar, known as the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, would never cease its furious spinning. It would remain a constant reminder of the terrible catastrophe and the Utopian era that had been lost forever\u2026 The few night elves that survived the horrific explosion rallied together on crudely made rafts and slowly made their way to the only landmass in sight.\nSomehow, by the graces of Elune, Furion, Tyrande and Cenarius had survived the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. The weary heroes agreed to lead their fellow survivors and establish a new home for their people. As they journeyed in silence, they surveyed the wreckage of their world and realized that their passions had wrought the destruction all around them. Though Sargeras and his Legion had been ripped from the world by the Well\u2019s destruction, Furion and his companions were left to ponder the terrible cost of victory.\nIt was clear that Azshara and her elite high-borne followers had been smashed to the bottom of the raging sea. Still, there were many high-borne amongst the survivors who made their way to the shores of the new land. Though Furion mistrusted the highbornes\u2019 motivations, he was satisfied that they could cause no real mischief without the Well\u2019s energies...\nOther Accounts.\nAn expanded version of the War of the Ancients was given on the Official Site as part of its &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/chapter1.html%235\"&gt;History of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, and scattered throughout the World of Warcraft as in-game books.

It expanded on the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20%28WC3%20account%29\"&gt;War of the Ancients (WC3 account)&lt;/a&gt;, although the wording was altered in a few places.\nEvents leading up to the war.\nAs the seemingly endless ages passed, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' civilization expanded both territorially and culturally. Their temples, roads, and dwelling places stretched across the breadth of the dark continent. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves' beautiful and gifted queen, built an immense, wondrous palace on the Well's shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls. Her servitors, whom she called the &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; or \"&lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\", doted on her every command and believed themselves to be greater than the rest of their brethren. Though Queen Azshara was loved equally by all of her people, the Highborne were secretly envied and disliked by the rest of the night elves.\nSharing the priests' curiosity towards the Well of Eternity, Azshara ordered the Highborne to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world. The Highborne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly. In time they developed the ability to manipulate and control the Well's cosmic energies. As their experiments progressed, the Highborne found that they could use their newfound powers to either create or destroy at their leisure. The heedless Highborne had stumbled upon primitive magic and were now resolved to devote themselves to its mastery. Although they agreed that magic was inherently dangerous if handled irresponsibly, Azshara and her Highborne began to practice their spellcraft with reckless abandon. &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and many wizened night elf scholars warned that only calamity would result from toying with the clearly volatile arts of magic. Even so, Azshara and her followers stubbornly continued to expand their burgeoning powers.\nAs their powers grew, a distinct change came over Azshara and the Highborne. The haughty, aloof upper class became increasingly callous and cruel towards their fellow night elves. A dark, brooding pall veiled Azshara's once-entrancing beauty. She began to withdraw from her loving subjects and refused to interact with any but her trusted Highborne priests.\nA young scholar named &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who had spent much of his time studying the primitive arts of &lt;a href=\"Druids\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;, began to suspect that a terrible power was corrupting the Highborne and his beloved queen. Though he could not conceive of the evil that was to come, he knew that the night elves' lives would soon be changed forever...\nThe War of the Ancients.\nThe Highborne's reckless use of magic sent ripples of energy spiraling out from the Well of Eternity and into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. The streaming ripples of energy were felt by terrible alien minds. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; - the Great Enemy of all life, the Destroyer of Worlds - felt the potent ripples and was drawn to their distant point of origin. Spying the primordial world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and sensing the limitless energies of the Well of Eternity, Sargeras was consumed by an insatiable hunger. The great dark god of the Nameless Void resolved to destroy the fledgling world and claim its energies as his own.\nSargeras gathered his vast Burning Legion and made his way towards the unsuspecting world of Azeroth. The Legion was comprised of a million screaming demons, all ripped from the far corners of the universe, and the demons hungered for conquest. Sargeras' lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Archimonde the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20the%20Destructor\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;, prepared their infernal minions to strike.\n&lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, overwhelmed by the terrible ecstasy of her magic, fell victim to Sargeras' undeniable power and agreed to grant him entrance to her world. Even her Highborne servitors gave themselves over to magic's inevitable corruption and began to worship Sargeras as their god. To show their allegiance to the Legion, the Highborne aided their queen in opening a vast, swirling portal within the depths of the Well of Eternity.\nOnce all his preparations had been made, Sargeras began his catastrophic invasion of Azeroth. The warrior-demons of the Burning Legion stormed into the world through the Well of Eternity and laid siege to the night elves' sleeping cities. Led by Archimonde and Mannoroth, the Legion swarmed over the lands of Kalimdor, leaving only ash and sorrow in its wake. The demon warlocks called down searing &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s that crashed like hellish meteors into the graceful spires of Kalimdor's temples. A band of burning, bloodletting killers known as the &lt;a href=\"Doomguard\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt; marched across Kalimdor's fields, slaughtering everyone in their path. Packs of wild, demonic &lt;a href=\"felhounds\"&gt;felhounds&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the countryside unopposed. Though the brave Kaldorei warriors rushed to defend their ancient homeland, they were forced to give ground, inch by inch, before the fury of the Legion's onslaught.\nIt fell to Malfurion Stormrage to find help for his beleaguered people. Stormrage, whose own brother, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, practiced the Highborne's magics, was incensed by the growing corruption amongst the upper class. Convincing Illidan to forsake his dangerous obsession, Malfurion set out to find Cenarius and muster a resistance force. The beautiful young priestess, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to accompany the brothers in the name of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Though Malfurion and Illidan shared a love for the idealistic priestess, Tyrande's heart belonged to Malfurion alone. Illidan resented his brother's budding romance with Tyrande, but knew that his heartache was nothing compared to the pain of his magical addiction.\nIllidan, who had grown dependent on magic's empowering energies, struggled to keep control of his nearly overwhelming hunger to tap the Well's energies once again. However, with Tyrande's patient support, he was able to restrain himself and help his brother find the reclusive demigod, Cenarius. Cenarius, who dwelt within the sacred Moonglades of the distant Mount Hyjal, agreed to help the night elves by finding the ancient &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and enlisting their aid. The dragons, led by the great red leviathan, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to send their mighty flights to engage the demons and their infernal masters.\nCenarius, calling on the spirits of the enchanted forests, rallied an army of ancient tree-men and led them against the Legion in a daring ground assault. As the night elves' allies converged upon Azshara's temple and the Well of Eternity, all-out warfare erupted. Despite the strength of their newfound allies, Malfurion and his colleagues realized that the Legion could not be defeated by martial strength alone.\nAs the titanic battle raged around Azshara's capital city, the delusional queen waited in anticipation for Sargeras' arrival. The lord of the Legion was preparing to pass through the Well of Eternity and enter the ravaged world. As his impossibly huge shadow drew ever closer to the Well's raging surface, Azshara gathered the most powerful of her Highborne followers. Only by linking their magics together in one focused spell would they be able to create a gateway large enough for Sargeras to enter.\nAs the battle raged across the burning fields of Kalimdor, a terrible turn of events unfolded. The details of the event have been lost to time, but it is known that &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon Aspect of the Earth, went mad during a critical engagement against the Burning Legion. He began to split apart as flame and rage erupted from his dark hide. Renaming himself &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the burning dragon turned on his brethren and drove the five dragonflights from the field of battle.\nDeathwing's sudden betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. Wounded and shocked, Alexstrasza and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. Malfurion and his companions, now hopelessly outnumbered, barely survived the ensuing onslaught.\nMalfurion, convinced that the Well of Eternity was the demons' umbilical link to the physical world, insisted that it should be destroyed. His companions, knowing that the Well was the source of their immortality and powers, were horrified by the rash notion. Yet Tyrande saw the wisdom of Malfurion's theory, so she convinced Cenarius and their comrades to storm Azshara's temple and find a way to shut the Well down for good.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Sundering%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;The Sundering of the World&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnowing that the Well's destruction would prevent him from ever wielding magic again, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; selfishly abandoned the group and set out to warn the Highborne of Malfurion's plan. Due to the insanity brought on by his addiction and the stinging resentment towards his brother's affair with Tyrande, Illidan felt no remorse at betraying Malfurion and siding with Azshara and her ilk. Above all else, Illidan vowed to protect the Well's power by any means necessary.\nHeartbroken by his brother's departure, Malfurion led his companions into the heart of Azshara's temple. Yet as they stormed into the main audience chamber, they found the Highborne in the midst of their final dark incantation. The communal spell created an unstable vortex of power within the Well's turbulent depths. As Sargeras' ominous shadow drew ever closer to the surface, Malfurion and his allies rushed to attack.\nAzshara, having received Illidan's warning, was more than prepared for them. Nearly all of Malfurion's followers fell before the mad queen's powers. Tyrande, attempting to attack Azshara from behind, was caught off-guard by the queen's Highborne guardsmen. Though she vanquished the guardsmen, Tyrande suffered grievous wounds at their hands. When Malfurion saw his love fall, he went into a murderous rage and resolved to end Azshara's life.\nAs the battle raged inside and outside of the temple, Illidan appeared from the shadows near the shores of the great Well. Producing a set of specially crafted vials, Illidan knelt and filled each with the Well's shimmering waters. Convinced that the demons would crush the night elves' civilization, he planned to steal the sacred waters and keep their energies for himself.\nThe ensuing battle between Malfurion and Azshara threw the Highborne's carefully crafted spellwork into chaos. The unstable vortex within the Well's depths exploded and ignited a catastrophic chain of events that would sunder the world forever. The massive explosion rocked the temple to its foundations and sent massive quakes ripping through the tortured earth. As the horrific battle between the Legion and the night elves' allies raged around and above the ruined capital city, the surging Well of Eternity buckled in upon itself and collapsed.\nThe resultant catastrophic explosion shattered the earth and blotted out the skies.\nOther Accounts.\nA brief account was covered in Warcraft III manual, it can be found &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20%28WC3%20account%29\"&gt;War of the Ancients (WC3 account)&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo more versions of the war were described in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20Trilogy\"&gt;War of the Ancients Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;, the 3 books by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20A.%20Knaak\"&gt;Richard A.

One is the account of a history created from the influence of three characters traveling back in time 10,000 years into the past at the time of The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. They witnessed firsthand the events of period, eventually becoming responsible for changing key aspects of the timeline. The novels also contains references to what occurred in their first timeline, before they influenced history. For ease of terminology pre-altered timeline is referred to as timeline (prime), and the second timeline is referred to as timeline (new).\nBlizzard considers the War of the Ancients Trilogy an official documentation of the history regarding the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/faq.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/index.html%231\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nA number of sources and aspects of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;'s current timeline corroborate this. The RPG Player Guide series for Horde and Alliance make references to material from these books (for example &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; and his death, and the Earthen involvement during the war, and the &lt;a href=\"time%20anomaly\"&gt;time anomaly&lt;/a&gt;). At the same time, other sources describe certain events similar to other accounts (perhaps suggesting that all accounts exist as knowledge to historians of Azeroth, see &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;flavor lore&lt;/a&gt;). The current official history seems to be a blending of various accounts of the War of the Ancients given in various sources.\nPlease see &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20%28WC3%20account%29\"&gt;War of the Ancients (WC3 account)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20%28WoW%20account%29\"&gt;War of the Ancients (WoW account)&lt;/a&gt; for other versions of the history, as described in Reign of Chaos manual, and the official World of Warcraft homepage. \nThis article is a summary of the two versions of history given in the trilogy, altered, and the unaltered, with special emphasis placed upon how they may differ from other versions.\nTimeline (original).\n\"Hakkar does not appear in any accounts of Third War history in other sources, including Warcraft III, and is said to have been killed during the War of the Ancients in other sources. This suggests that this part of Knaak's second timeline is based on the original accounts of War of the Ancients, while future events were based on other sources.\"\n\"Other accounts mention most \"dwarves\" locking their underground gates and hiding underground during the war and letting the night elves fight the demons alone. There are only a few references to any \"Earthen\" fighting demons during the war in other sources.\" \"Most dwarves fought an underground war in the shadows to prevent the return of the demons to the world of the living.\" \"Knaak may have based this part of the timeline (prime) after some of these earlier accounts.\"\n\"No other account of the war directly mentions the tauren (although some tauren legends mention the Sundering). No other source states specifically that they did not fight during the war. However, according to Lorewalker Cho, some tauren were in Pandaria, behind the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall, when the sundering began and Pandaria was separated from Kalimdor. These tauren would eventually become the &lt;a href=\"Yaungol\"&gt;Yaungol&lt;/a&gt;. Since no other account touches this subject, it could have gone either way; it is simply unknown. This idea appears to have been an invention by Knaak and doesn't seem to be based on any previous account, nor does it conflict with any previous content.\"\n\" establishes that the tauren originated from the yaungol, not the other way round.\"\nTimeline (new).\nThrown back in time.\nShortly after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; was looking forward to settling down with his wife, the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, until he was called away once again by his friend and mentor, the dragon-mage &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; the Timeless One, &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, had barely managed to contact Krasus and draw his attention to a strange anomaly in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Krasus convinced Rhonin to travel with him to Kalimdor to investigate. \nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, having caught wind of the strange events taking place nearby, sent the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaskal\"&gt;Gaskal&lt;/a&gt; on a similar mission.\nOnce there, Krasus, Rhonin, and Brox discovered a \"hole\" in time. They were pulled in and ended up 10,000 years in the past, just before the first invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;...\n&lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Brox&lt;/a&gt; was soon captured by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;, but later escaped. Meanwhile, Rhonin and Krasus fell into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, who wondered who they were and was determined to find the truth about them.\nKrasus found he was much weaker than normal, his magical abilities almost totally gone. Rhonin on the other hand had become far more powerful. They believed this was somehow tied to the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the fount of magic the night elves wielded as the center of their culture.\nNight Elf allies.\nMeanwhile, the young night elf &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was become more adept at the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic magics his &lt;a href=\"Shan%27do\"&gt;Shan'do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; was teaching him. But in the process, Malfurion became increasingly detached from the extravagant and arrogant ways of his fellow night elves.\nHis twin brother &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, wanted nothing more than to become a powerful caster of arcane magic and earn the respect of his peers and the powerful Moonguard.\nBoth Malfurion and Illidan were close friends with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, an apprentice to the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. It was Tyrande who discovered the captured orc Brox, who was unlike any creature she had ever seen. She treated him kindly and healed his wounds, gaining the orc's respect.\nMeanwhile, Malfurion encountered a troubling vision in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. In the vision, he saw the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, the powerful mages of night elf aristocracy, calling upon something evil in the tower of the palace. He could feel how the spell disturbed nature and the Well, and could not believe that their beloved queen would not know of this strange and dangerous spellcasting.\nBroxigar and Illidan.\nStill unaware of exactly where he was, Brox chose to cooperate with the Moonguard for the moment. Illidan was convinced to aid in the release of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; warrior, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;, by Tyrande. Most night elves, including Illidan, judged him by his appearance and believed he was a dangerous brute. Tyrande, on the other hand, pitied Brox and plotted his escape. However, the only other night elf to believe his story was Malfurion Stormrage, who felt the orc's tale was somehow tied in with the spellcraft he observed while in the Emerald Dream. Certain that Broxigar was a piece of the troubling puzzle, the young druid helped the warrior escape with intention to bring him before Cenarius. A patrol with several members of the Moonguard gave chase.\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, while the two were on their way to the Moonglade of Cenarius, two felhounds attacked them. Familiar with the threat, Brox quickly incapacitated one using only a piece of wood.\nAfter Brox had been freed and led to safety by Malfurion, Lord &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; made it his priority to recapture the orc. Ravencrest commanded Illidan to accompany his search party, being aware of Illidan's skill with magic and knowing that Illidan would follow orders better than the sorcerers of the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan obeyed Ravencrest, intending to ride with him and gain favor with the lord while not making any sincere effort to track down his brother and Brox.\nSomething unexpected occurred while Illidan was with the search party, however. The riders found the remains of a Moon Guard patrol. While investigating the scene, they were ambushed by the things that had slaughtered the Moon Guard sorcerers: &lt;a href=\"felhounds\"&gt;felhounds&lt;/a&gt;, creatures that devoured magic and were immune to conventional magical attacks. Illidan instinctively jumped out of the way of an attacking felbeast, inadvertently slamming into Ravencrest and knocking him out of harm's way as well. Illidan subsequently figured out a way around the felbeast's immunity to magic and killed it. After seeing Illidan do this and believing Illidan had intentionally saved his life moments earlier, an impressed Ravencrest took the young night elf on as his personal spellcaster. The ambitious Illidan was happy to accept such a prestigious position. Of course, if Brox had not been taken prisoner and escaped, none of this would have happened.\nCorruption of the Highborne.\nThe one responsible for the dark spellwork in the palace was Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, high councilor to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Xavius was convinced that more power could be drawn from the Well of Eternity with a properly focused spell. What he unlocked, however, was far greater than anything he had dreamed.\nAcross the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; stared back and Xavius and took control of him. Through Xavius, Sargeras gained influence over all of the &lt;a href=\"highborne\"&gt;highborne&lt;/a&gt;, including the queen herself. From that moment on, the highborne were focused on a single goal - bringing Sargeras into the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where he and the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; would cleanse the world of the unfit.\nXavius and the High-Borne summoned &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;, who came under the order of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The Houndmaster summoned forth many felbeasts to hunt down the unfit. All of his scouts but one, however, were reported missing, indicating that powerful resistance forces were in play against the Legion. \nInvasion of the Legion.\nMeanwhile, Lord Xavius was still trying to further strengthen the portal so as to prepare for the arrival of Sargeras. However, there was never enough energy from the Well of Eternity for the Highborne sorcerer's to harness. The only way to do this would be to prevent all other Night Elves from harnessing the power of the Well. Lord Xavius and Hakkar were unable to do this and thus Lord Xavius reached out for the help of Sargeras.\nSargeras then sent through the portal his Lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;. Where Hakkar failed, Mannoroth succeeded, and an effective shield spell was cast preventing all other Night Elves from harnessing the power of the Well of Eternity. As a result, all night elves outside the portal felt drained and weakened, particullary the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Thus emboldened, Lord Xavius managed to massively strengthen the portal, and where before very few Felguards would come through the portal every day, now dozens reached the world of Azeroth in mere hours, and thus the world was ready for the \"cleansing\" Sargeras promised.\nAlong with the Felguards came Eredar Warlocks, Infernals and Doomguards. Meanwhile, all the people of Zin-Azshari gathered around the Palace of Azshara seeking aid since their powers had waned along with the shielding of the Well of Eternity. When the gates finally opened and the populace expected some words of comfort from their Beloved queen, they were instead treated to the gathered army of the Burning Legion. The Legion quickly set about killing all the Night Elves outside the palace and completely decimating the city of Zin-Azshari.\nNeltharion's betrayal.\nNeltharion always believed that as the Earth Warder, it was his granted right by the creators to rule Azeroth as he saw fit. Slowly but surely the foul seed planted in his mind by the Old Gods ate at him like a parasite, making his mind ever more treacherous. He began to think that he could trust no one, not even his fellow Dragon Aspects. \"Malygos will take what is yours, Alexstrasza seeks dominion over you. They are no better than the Demons, they must be dealt with like the Demons.\" is all he comprehended, betrayal was all he predicted. So he decided to be the first to act, he forged the Dragon Soul's matrix with his own blood and power. Forging a weapon that would not only relinquish the threat of the Burning Legion but enslave all of Azeroth to his will alone. So began the betrayal of Neltharion.\nKrasus finds himself.\nKrasus noticed that his, and his companions' captivity, were being watched by one of his own kind. He managed to convince the dragon to take him to the queen of the red dragon flight, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, the aspect of life, and his long time companion.\nAlexstrasza, in her wisdom, quickly understood the situation, even though Krasus was hesitant to tell much of the future knowledge he had. Krasus met his younger self, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, and they both found they fare better in each other's presence. Apparently Krasus and Korialstrasz could not share a single time, as they are one and the same. This weakened them unless they were together. Alexstrasza brought Krasus to the Chamber of the Aspects, where a meeting between the dragons were to be held. There, Krasus met the other three great Aspect, including &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;). Neltharion proposed to create a mighty artifact, in which the dragons imbued their power to and used it as a weapon to drive back the Burning Legion. Unknown to the other dragons except Krasus, who traveled from the future and knew of Deathwing's betrayal, Neltharion actually tried to use that artifact (&lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Soul\"&gt;The Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;) to control the other dragon to achieve his ambition of godhood. \nKrasus tried to warn the other dragons, regardless to the damage of timeline due to his rash action. But as he accidentally met Neltharion's eyes, the Earth Warder's power easily penetrated the unaware Krasus's thoughts and was horrified to find out that Krasus was about to spill out his terrible secret. He secretly bewitched Krasus with one of his most cunning spells. When Krasus tried to tell the other dragons about Deathwing's play, he was bewitched and could only utter nonsense words before fainting. Hence Deathwing's betrayal by using the Dragon Soul (&lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;) was undiscovered until the day the Earth Warder decided to act.\nAfter Krasus fainted, his queen and Korialstrasz brought him back to the red's lair. During his unconsciousness, Krasus was again contacted by the Timeless One, who told him that the world was coming to an end and all would be eradicated unless one night elf could be found. Before Krasus could ask for the name of the night elf, the Timeless One was again gone. Krasus woke and told his brief encounter with the missing Aspect to his queen, who believed in his story and ordered Korialstrasz to take Krasus to find the night elf.\nUnwillingly, Krasus parted with his queen along with his younger self, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, who knew nothing about Krasus's identity. They flew back to Zin-Azshari under Krasus's guidance, and were horrified by the genocide of the night elves by the demons pouring out from the gates of the palace. Korialstrasz and Krasus killed a few demons and slowed down their hunt of the escaping night elves, but they were of no match to the endless ranks of demons. They retreated, and Krasus figured out a plan.\nBy wandering aimlessly in the forest, Krasus was soon arrested by the patrolling guards led by &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. Krasus was very willing to be arrested and had shown no resistance whatsoever. Korialstrasz, who remained unseen in the sky, followed his older self to the settlement of the night elves. There, Krasus met the priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and was quite surprised to see the orc &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; beside her. \nMalfurion, meanwhile, had managed to sneak into the palace by walking through the Emerald Dream to destroy the portal and the shield array over the Well of Eternity. However, he was trapped in a crystal prison belonging to Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. Under the joint efforts of Krasus, Brox, Korialstrasz and Tyrande, Malfurion managed to escape. He then used the elements to destroy the lord counselor, and shut down the portal and shield array. He also managed to shut down the Highborne's portal and destroyed the palace tower which housed the portal.\nSoon after, the Highborne started their work to rebuild the portal and resummon Sargeras. When the new portal was complete, Sargeras sent &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; to assist with the invasion. Archimonde used his magic to strengthen the magical barriers around the palace so that it was impossible to launch an assault on the demons' stronghold.\nDefense against the Legion.\nLord Kur'Talos Ravencrest along with his soldiers commanded the ebony fortress known as Black Rook Hold. Many decisions were held out here, most concerning actions against the onslaught of the Legion. The Night Elves under Lord Ravencrest managed to get the best of Mannoroth and the Legion earlier in the war. However, when Archimonde assumed the role of commander of the Legion's forces for the duration of the war, things started to look grim for the Night Elves. When Ravencrest replenished his forces at Black Rook Hold and prepared to capture the Night Elven Capital, Zin-Azshari and rescue their \"captive\" Queen Azshara, they were met by a more cunning force. Archimonde out smarted the resistance by keeping the sinister eredar warlocks hidden in the clouds and several other ranks of demons hiding over the hills to ambush the night elves on their flanks. This strategy worked effectively as the large resistance began crumbling under the Legion's merciless onslaught. So horrible were the losses that Ravencrest was forced to sound the retreat and run for their very lives. The Legion gave no pause as they pursued the resistance beyond Suramar all the way to distant Mt. Hyjal. Krasus(Korialstrasz)realizing that if they went any further that the whole cause would be lost, tried desperately to launch a counter assault. With the aid of Rhonin, Malfurion, Illidan and the Moon Guard Sorcerers, the Legion stalled and was temporarily pushed back.\nIllidan and the War.\nWhile in the original version of history Illidan betrayed his people to warn Azshara of a coming attack, in the altered version of history Malfurion never intentionally set out to destroy the Well of Eternity. After the war against the Legion commenced and the night elves fought alongside Brox, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin was also impressed by Illidan's skill with magic. The human mage from the future took it upon himself to teach Illidan all he knew. Unfortunately, Rhonin was unable to keep Illidan's recklessness in check. While Illidan led the sorcerers of the Moon Guard efficiently and killed countless demons with their aid, he was often unaware of the effect his spells had on his comrades. Illidan would often cast complex and powerful spells that involved the cooperation of every member of the Moon Guard, who would lend him their energies. Illidan used these energies effectively and wreaked havoc among the Legion's forces, but more often than not he drew on his fellow sorcerers too heavily, pushing them close to the breaking point.\nIllidan's behaviour may have been caused by the fact that he drew heavily on the addictive power of the Well of Eternity to fight the demons, a power which many (including Tyrande and Rhonin) had come to view as tainted.\nIn the middle of the war, Illidan discovered to his dismay and vexation that despite all of his efforts to impress Tyrande with his rise in power and in station, she was attracted more to Malfurion than she was to him. While he was brooding and wallowing in self-pity one day, thoughts began entering his mind, a voice that said Tyrande would be his if not for Malfurion...that if Malfurion was to fall in battle, Tyrande could still be his...that if Illidan allowed some tragedy to befall his brother, all his ambitions could be realized. Initially Illidan considered the idea but chastised himself angrily moments later for even thinking such things. Disgusted with himself, he stormed away, not seeing the figure of Xavius hiding in the trees nearby. Xavius was the one who had magically planted the thoughts in Illidan's head, in the hopes of causing dissension between the Stormrage brothers.\nFinally, in one battle, Illidan recklessly cast a spell that wiped out some of the night elf forces along with the demons they had been fighting. He did not appear to notice and Rhonin began to make his way to Illidan with the intention of reprimanding him, but the dragons arrived before he could do this. Later Ravencrest told Rhonin to take over command of the Moonguard, realizing that Illidan's methods were uncontrolled. Rhonin was happy to oblige, especially after seeing more night elves perish as a result of Illidan's spells. Illidan mistakenly believed that Rhonin had taken his place out of ambition and that Ravencrest had cast him aside permanently. He doubted that he would be allowed to lead the Moon Guard again and felt cheated and bitter. Ravencrest fell in battle later that day, eliminating any chance of the misunderstanding between the two being cleared up.\nThe Daemon Soul.\nAfter the battle ended, Illidan went to Zin-Azshari to pledge his loyalty to the Burning Legion. After winning an audience with Sargeras, Illidan told him that the artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; contained power enough to easily expand the interdimensional portal and allow him entrance to Azeroth. Sargeras was aware of how the dragon &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; had used the Demon Soul to effortlessly decimate the Legion's forces (before the insane &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; used it to also decimate the night elf forces and attack the other dragonflights), and agreed with Illidan. He ordered Illidan to go with Captain &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then\"&gt;Varo'then&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the artifact, but not before giving Illidan a \"gift\". Sargeras froze him in place and burned away Illidan's eyes. Illidan, in immense pain, had to magically induce a coma to recover from the ordeal, but when he awoke he found that the new vision Sargeras had granted him was vastly superior to what his old eyes allowed him to see. With his eyes gone and the flesh around the sockets charred, the bone being exposed in places, Illidan was given a blindfold to wear for the sake of appearances.\nUnbeknownst to the demons, Illidan intended to betray them. He had pretended to join them only to learn more of the magic the &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;Eredar&lt;/a&gt; practiced and to acquire the Demon Soul, which he planned to use to personally close the portal, eradicate the demons already on Azeroth and become the greatest hero Kalimdor had ever known.\nIllidan, Varo'then and a contingent of demons succeeded in acquiring the Demon Soul, ambushing Malfurion and Brox after they had stolen it from Neltharion. After bringing the artifact to Zin-Azshari, however, Illidan's plan hit a snag. He had hoped to convince everyone that he should be the one to wield the Demon Soul and bring Sargeras into Azeroth. Sargeras still did not fully trust him, however, and decided that he would wield the Demon Soul himself from the other side of the portal.\nThe Destruction of the Well of Eternity.\nWithout access to the Demon Soul, Illidan came up with another plan. He would wait until Sargeras began working to open the portal, at which time he would sneak away and cast a spell to reverse the effect of the portal, creating a maelstrom that would suck the demons back into the Twisting Nether from whence they came. To aid in the casting of this spell, Illidan took some of the Well's water.\nOn his way to cast the spell, Illidan encountered Tyrande, who had been taken prisoner by the Legion and was in the process of escaping. Eager to impress her with his cleverness and heroism, he took her with him to the location where he planned to work his magic. Tyrande was horrified by what had happened to Illidan's eyes and by how much he reveled in painfully killing a felbeast in their path. She also had doubts concerning whether his idea would work and was shocked when she learned that he intended to use a vial of the Well's water to cast his spell, which legend said was dangerous in the extreme. Illidan grew angry at her and forced her to stay quiet and watch him as he cast the spell that he thought would save the world.\nToo late, Tyrande sensed dark presences aiding Illidan's spellwork. These were, in fact, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; who hoped to enter Azeroth themselves after Sargeras and claim it for themselves. The spell Illidan was casting would actually bring them closer to their goal, a fact which Illidan was unaware of. Before Tyrande could tell him what was happening, Illidan's spell had already been cast.\nIllidan's spell had no obvious effect on the portal, and soon he and Tyrande were found by demons and surrounded. While fighting for their lives they were found by Malfurion, who was now wielding the Demon Soul. Illidan and Malfurion fought the demons together and sought to use Neltharion's creation to pull the demons back through the portal. Before they did so, the Old Gods tried to mentally control the Stormrage brothers as they had Deathwing, tempting them with visions of power if they would only allow the Old Gods into the world. Though it took a great deal of willpower, Malfurion was able to resist their efforts. He then saw that Illidan had fallen prey to the manipulation of the Old Gods. But when Malfurion cried out his brother's name, Illidan appeared to come to his senses. He ceased casting the spell and assured his brother that he was in control of himself once more.\nThe Stormrage brothers succeeded in ridding Azeroth of the demons. Finally, Malfurion was able to close the portal itself, but with unforeseen consequences. The destruction of the portal appeared to kill Sargeras, who was halfway through the portal at the time it closed. It also resulted in The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and the night elves, dragons, Earthen, furbolgs, and tauren found that they were all in danger of drowning. Their only hope of survival was to run to higher ground: Mount Hyjal. Many perished, but many others reached Hyjal safely.\nThe Aftermath.\nUnknown to the survivors, Illidan had taken seven vials of water from the Well before its destruction and planned to use them to create a new well, much as he had in the original timeline. He was certain that the Legion would somehow find its way back to Azeroth someday, and believed that the night elves would be lost without the magic of a Well to aid them in that inevitable war.\nAt this time, Illidan had been accepted back into the ranks of the Kaldorei, but with reservations. Many night elves still distrusted him, and were unnerved by his eyes. Malfurion, meanwhile, was being hailed as a hero. Illidan was even more jealous of his brother than before, this time jealous of the adulation being heaped upon Malfurion.\nA party of night elves led by Jarod Shadowsong caught him pouring the vials into a lake. They assumed the worst, and Jarod tried to take Illidan into custody. He told Illidan \"If not for your brother, I'd--\"\nThose were the words that caused Illidan to snap. To his thinking, the night elves were turning on him, were ungrateful for what he was doing, and the only reason they did not kill him on the spot was because of their worship of his brother. In his paranoid state, Illidan also believed that they wanted to keep him from his magic. Illidan flew into a rage and used his magic to brutally kill several of his would-be captors before he was subdued...by Malfurion. When Maiev Shadowsong walked onto the scene and saw her injured brother, she immediately tried to kill Illidan, but was stopped by the other night elves.\nAt Illidan's trial for the murders he had committed and the creation of another Well, he insisted that the Legion would return and that he had been saving the Kaldorei race. He proclaimed \"You'll all be praying to me as if I were a god when the demons return!\" Jarod Shadowsong began to decree that Illidan be put to death, but before the sentence could be handed down, Malfurion arrived to speak in Illidan's defense (Illidan, for his part, resented having to rely on his brother and was not appreciative). Malfurion told those in attendance that Illidan might be right, that the Legion might one day return. While he acknowledged that Illidan was dangerous, he asked that he be imprisoned rather than executed. Even, Malfurion told them, if it meant he stayed imprisoned for ten thousand years. In this timeline, as in the original, the decision was made to lock Illidan away underground indefinitely.\nOn the differences between the accounts.\nThe primary differences between the different accounts (aside from the presence of Krasus, Rhonin and Brox) are the role of Jarod Shadowsong and the experiences of Tyrande Whisperwind towards the conclusion of the war. The Warcraft III manual clearly describes the final battle against Azshara and hints at her death, but \"The Sundering\" establishes that Azshara was not present at the end of the war and that she survived as a Naga. The absence of Hakkar the Houndmaster from Warcraft III suggests that no visible differences occurred in the histories, though the question of Jarod Shadowsong's fate remains unknown. \nAs an addendum, the guide actually says, \"it was clear that Azshara and her elite high-borne followers had been smashed to the bottom of the sea.\" This seems to leave plenty of room for the idea that she became a Naga. This is, of course, stated directly on www.worldofwarcraft.com in the history section.\nIt should be noted that Metzen and his writing team support the information put forward in the novels as actual events, and the events in other Warcraft novels are proven to be the true lore. Since there is no difference in the timelines of Azeroth following the conclusion of the War, the point of which version is correct is not vital to a general understanding of the history. It is only in terms of a few specifics that it becomes problematic.\nThe Warcraft Encyclopedia &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; all but confirms that this history is genuine.\nTemporal mechanics.\nThat Blizzard has accepted this story as official lore, and because of the time travelling nature of the story, it is quite possible that there exist several causality loops in the story such as:\nSuch events are called causality loops, theoretical anomalies in time in which an individual goes to a different time period and brings about a change because of knowledge or actions in their own time period that eventually lead to that person gaining that specific knowledge or doing a specific action. If all this seems too complicated, think of it this way: Say \"Jane\" goes back in time and meets her ancestor \"John\" and they somehow end up birthing a child. Generations later, this event would directly lead to Jane herself being born and then going back in time to repeat the process. You can see here that these events would happen in an infinite time loop.\nA particular sentence of Rhonin shows that loop infinite theory : \"Did Brox pull back History on its way, or was he part of History since the begining ?\"\nOf course, this is all theoretical in the real world and, even in the Warcraft universe, is still technobabble that may or may not be true."}

The former two created the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; during the war in order to combat the satyrs, by enhancing the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;pack form&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral&lt;/a&gt; were present and agreed when Malfurion created the Cenarion Circle to prevent further misuse of druidism. &lt;a href=\"Mel%27Thandris%20Starsong\"&gt;Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt;, the aunt of &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificed her life to save her fellow night elves in the final battle.\nThe ensuing War of the Satyr exacted a heavy toll from the night elves, but ultimately they vanquished the forces that had set out to wreak havoc on their world. The war completely decimated any semblance of central leadership for the satyrs, forcing them to live in small sects to this day.\nHistory.\nReturn of the satyr.\nAfter the War of the Ancients, night elf society returned to nature, and many became druids. As changes to night elf society took shape, an old foe was gathering strength in Kalimdor. The remaining satyr stayed hidden in the dark corners of the world, waiting to strike back at the night elves. Eventually, one of the horned aberrations, &lt;a href=\"Xalan%20the%20Feared\"&gt;Xalan the Feared&lt;/a&gt;, gave his brethren this chance. He rallied the satyr and girded them for war. Xalan's rise also drew the attention of the Burning Legion remnants trapped on Azeroth after the Sundering.\nThe satyr drew upon mighty allies; other demons of the Burning Legion who had yet lingered years after the War of the Ancients, polluting Azeroth. Doomguard and other wicked beings, such as Felhounds and Felguard, emerged from the dark warrens, drawn to the satyr's call.\nAssault on Night Run.\nAs one, this demonic army launched its first brutal assault on the night elf stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Night%20Run\"&gt;Night Run&lt;/a&gt;, plunging the fragile society into another war. The night elves of Kalimdor faced, once again, the cruel reality of conflict; bloodshed, death, and deep, terrible loss. Armies of satyrs - calling themselves Soldiers of the Emerald Flame - burned with an unquenchable vengeance for their fallen father, the satyr lord, Xavius. Ashenvale was ablaze with their destructive fel magics as they struck with but one goal; the utter destruction of kaldorei civilization.\nRetreat to Raynewood.\nThe night elves suffered terrible losses from the satyr's assaults, and Tyrande's adopted daughter and captain of the Sentinels, Shandris Feathermoon, proposed a new strategy to fight the demons. She suggested that the druids be called from their sojourns in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; so they could be used as a fighting force. Upon seeing how Xalan had corrupted the night elves' forests, Malfurion agreed to Shandris's request and summoned the most powerful druids of Kalimdor to his side. As one, the druids and Sentinels struck into the heart of satyr territory. Shandris's brilliant guerrilla maneuvers led the night elves to overcome many of their enemies.\nThe satyr and kaldorei armies clashed again not far from &lt;a href=\"Raynewood%20Retreat\"&gt;Raynewood Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. The druids used a variety of magic and forms against the satyr. Malfurion brought the light of Elune down on a group of satyr, calling them traitors. The young druids Ralaar Fangfire and Arvell were close as brothers, and though they bickered over a Felguard, they then worked together to defeat it. Arvell called forth vines to entrap the demon, giving Ralaar the time needed to take bear form and slay the demon. As the battle ensued, the two rushed as well to save Arvell's lover, Belysra Starbreeze. As more felguard came from the high ground, it became clear the kaldorei had fallen for a trap and were forced to retreat. Those that survived retreated, bruised and beaten, to Raynewood.\nDebate at Raynewood.\nThe War of the Satyr had taken its toll on the kaldorei, still struggling to reshape their ancient culture after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, it was a time of innovation among druids, who had a passion to experiment and practice new forms. Thus, when Malfurion began to restrict which forms were to be used in battle, he was met with resistance from his students, including Ralaar Fangfire.\nAssassination at Xavian.\nAfter the retreat, the kaldorei planned retaliation. The plan was to strike at the heart of the satyrs in &lt;a href=\"Xavian\"&gt;Xavian&lt;/a&gt;; a covert assault to kill their most successful general - Xalan the Feared - and his elite guard. It was a two-pronged strike. Shandris Feathermoon spearheaded the sentinel assault to slay the felguard's commanders while Ralaar and Arvell lead their own effort. Ralaar killed the Satyr leader, Xalan the Feared.\nArvell and Belysra discovered the satyr stronghold and were ambushed, and Arvell died rather than protect himself with the Pack Form.\nDruids of the Scythe.\nLed by Ralaar Fangfire, these druids became known as worgen. Ralaar and his ferocious companions were slaves to their own rage, and they tore through friend and foe alike amid battle. Night elves bitten by the wolf-beasts contracted a virulent curse that transformed them into worgen as well. The worgen catastrophe forced Malfurion to reflect on the state of druidism. Without some form of regulation, he concluded that individuals like Ralaar would inevitably go too far in their application of druidic power. Malfurion and his followers, therefore, created the Cenarion Circle, a harmonious order that would guide and keep watch over the world's druids and their practices. The Cenarion Circle's first great task was to deal with the worgen threat. Seeing no other recourse, Malfurion reluctantly banished Ralaar and his worgen to the Emerald Dream. There, Malfurion believed that they would enter a peaceful eternal slumber beneath the enchanted tree known as &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the worgen's banishment, any hope the satyrs had of achieving victory was lost. The night elves cut deep into their enemy's domain until most of the forests had been cleansed of corruption. The few remaining satyrs retreated into the shadows. Never again would they pose so great a threat to night elf society.\nAftermath.\nAfter the war, some druids came to believe that at their core they were wild creatures, their humanoid forms merely a guise. They left night elf society for &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Wilds\"&gt;a forested island&lt;/a&gt; and were not seen for thousands of years.\nThousands of years later, the worgen - including Alpha Prime - would escape their imprisonment in a variety of ways. Firstly, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; to summon the worgen to defend the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane wall&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, unknowingly releasing Alpha Prime as well, who started a &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; in Gilneas. Secondly, &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt; of the Sentinels uncovered the Scythe of Elune in Ashenvale, and summoned more worgen to defeat the satyr in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. Thirdly, she traveled to and died in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; shortly after, where Jitters of the Defias Brotherhood found the scythe and inadvertently summoned worgen to Duskwood. In addition to these three packs - the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terrowulf%20pack\"&gt;Terrowulf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt; respectively - some worgen awoke from their slumber in the Dream and did battle with the satyr of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Worgen%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; wandered the dream as a pack, and split up when they arrived in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Keepers reached out to the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and each of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s blessed the proto-dragons with a portion of their vast power, channeled through the Keepers. Elevated into powerful, majestic beings known as &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s alongside many followers and multiple clutches of eggs, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; became known as the five &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s. Alexstrasza became Queen of the Dragons and each Aspect was charged with a different task, and the protection of Azeroth.\nThough many proto-dragons chose to become infused with &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; magic, there were some among their oldest kin that argued they should remain unchanged, and believed they should embrace their inherent &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; energies instead. These &lt;a href=\"Primalist\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; proto-dragons joined together to resist the influx of titanic influence and demanded that &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; be exiled from the dragons' &lt;a href=\"Broodlands\"&gt;new home&lt;/a&gt;. When the Aspects refused, it sowed the seeds of rebellion for the Primalists. Their four leaders, &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; were known as the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, giant proto-dragons infused with the power of the elements.\nOver the years, what began as a difference of opinion gradually grew into hard feelings, hard feelings grew into dissent, and dissent would one day divide dragonkind and ultimately lead to conflict. Despite all the work that the Aspects and their dragonflights had accomplished since their creation, the Incarnates still stood in opposition to the Aspects. &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; was concerned about this festering schism between Primalists and dragons, but the other Aspects dismissed his concerns, with Alexstrasza hoping to resolve the tensions through communication. Fearing conflict was coming, Neltharion experimented in &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt; to create the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, an army of perfect soldiers, and prepared for war.\nConflict.\nDespite the years spent experimenting, Neltharion never had enough time to perfect his creation. About 20,000 years ago, Raszageth, the Storm-Eater, struck first at dragonkind.\nAlexstrasza had failed to restore peace between the two groups. Leading the Primalists on a sneak attack on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, Raszageth clashed against Neltharion and his dracthyr army. Striking without warning, many dracthyr died that day. During the battle, the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt; was broken, causing Neltharion to lose control of the dracthyr. In his desperation, he finally submitted for the first time to the whispers he had been hearing from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, and used their power to banish Raszageth to the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;. Though he had won the battle, this event marked the start of Neltharion's gradual descent into &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. He never told the other Aspects about the exact details of the event, and also kept the dracthyr a secret from everyone except for &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; who helped him stash them away in their creches where they were put into stasis indefinitely.\nThis event was the first in a cataclysmic conflict between the Primalists and the dragonflights known as the War of the Scaleborn. Vyranoth and Fyrakk were ever loyal to the Incarnates' ideals, but Iridikron truly embraced the war. At the end, he struck terrible bargains to keep their cause alive. Alexstrasza believes the other incarnates never knew the true depths of his depravity. Despite the Primalists' alliance with the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; to end the dragons' reign, the remaining Primal Incarnates were ultimately defeated, but Alexstrasza still couldn't bear to kill them given they had once been as close as clutch-mates, and decided to imprison them instead, within the titanic &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;evlplayer&gt;\n&lt;/evlplayer&gt;"}

Having lain dormant in the ancient titanic fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; for centuries, the &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; qiraji, urged on by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, began pouring out of Ahn'Qiraj in vast numbers, and spreading across the surrounding desert of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. In response, a large night elf force led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Archdruid Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; attacked the qiraji and attempted to push them back to Ahn'Qiraj. The conflict went back-and-forth numerous times, often with the night elves pushing the qiraji back to the walls of the fortress only for a counter-attack to push them back in turn.\nAfter vicious fighting, the night elves began gaining the upper hand and eventually the qiraji had been pushed back deep into Silithus. Then, during a battle near the fortress, Fandral Staghelm's son, &lt;a href=\"Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;Valstann&lt;/a&gt;, was surrounded and cut to pieces right before his father's eyes. This shattered the archdruid's will and drastically reduced morale among the night elves. Seizing on the lull in the fighting, the qiraji attacked with renewed ferocity. The qiraji once more spread out through the desert and the neighboring regions, even reaching and assaulting the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, who joined the battle and enlisted the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt; flights as well.\nNow, the combined forces of dragons and night elves successfully pushed the qiraji back to and inside Ahn'Qiraj. Seeking to end the war once and for all, Fandral and his allies used their powers to create a massive and impenetrable wall around the fortress, the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to open this wall would be through the use of the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;Scarab Gong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; which, in a rage, Fandral shattered, scattering the pieces.\nHistory.\nThe awakening of Ahn'Qiraj.\nSince the events of their last war with the Troll Empire, the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and their descendants had remained hidden and secluded in their underground lairs. The dangerous potential of these &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; races had long since vanished from the memories of the majority of Azeroth's races. Only the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; on the hidden continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; remained active above ground. The qiraji themselves had taken over the ancient &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titanic&lt;/a&gt; fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, the vast prison complex of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. Here, within the Ahn'Qiraj's lifeless sandstone corridors, the qiraji had lain dormant for centuries. Although &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; had once been aware of the fortress' existence, its location had long been lost to time, largely due to the fact that no living thing dwelt near it, owing in turn to the vast and inhospitable surrounding desert of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround 975 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Archdruid Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, a leader of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; people and specifically its &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, initiated an ambitious quest to regrow the desolate land of Silithus. To this end, he sent his warrior son, &lt;a href=\"Valstann\"&gt;Valstann&lt;/a&gt;, along with a group of druids, to begin this project. As they trekked across the scalding dunes in search of fresh water reservoirs that they would use to transform the region into a lush forest, they came across a mysterious and ancient fortress deep in the desert's interior. Although some of the druids, sensing the darkness, advised against entering the dark halls, Valstann forged onward. His presence in the cold, shadowy halls of Ahn'Qiraj inadvertently roused the dormant qiraji back to life. From his prison beneath the fortress, the Old God became aware of the awakened qiraji.\nAs in times past, C'Thun urged the insectoids into a murderous frenzy. Those in the higher castes of qiraji society began organizing their minions, the most numerous of which were known as the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;. Coming in many different forms and species, the silithid were nonetheless totally loyal to the qiraji above them. The ranks of the qiraji also included numerous stone constructs, including the tenacious &lt;a href=\"Anubisath\"&gt;Anubisath&lt;/a&gt;. Horrified by their discovery, Valstann and his druids fled Ahn'Qiraj and established a small outpost in the desert to monitor the insectoids. Before their eyes, the fortress began to swell with greater and greater numbers of qiraji. Having sent for reinforcements, Valstann and his companions could do little else but watch the buildup within the complex.\nThe Qiraji swarm.\nWithout warning, an army of innumerable proportions burst forth from the fortress itself, as well as the tunnels beneath Ahn'Qiraj. The qiraji overlords directed their silithid minions to engulf the desert and then spread to all its neighboring regions as well. They began to sweep across Silithus, swarming over ever dune and canyon. By this time, however, Fandral Staghelm had successfully rallied a sizeable force of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;priestesses of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"keepers%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt;. He made haste to the south of the continent, where the night elf host clashed with their vicious foes.\nHaving now broken out of Silithus, the qiraji represented a major threat in the eyes of the night elves, who fought desperately to keep them contained within the south of the continent. While they had powerful forces at their disposal, they nonetheless found the sheer numbers of the qiraji host to be insurmountable.\nThus, a back-and-forth action ensued between the two forces. Occasionally, the kaldorei would gain the upper hand and manage to force the silithid qiraji back towards the dunes of Silithus, only for the insectoids to mount counterattacks with renewed strength and numbers and regain the initiative. The ebb and flow continued for months and many hundreds fell on both sides, the land littered with dead night elves and insectoids alike. The War of the Shifting Sands had begun.\nThe War of the Shifting Sands.\nIn a determined effort to defeat the qiraji, Fandral and the night elves established a number of outposts and bases across the south of Kalimdor, from which they could more effectively prosecute the war. These bases proved invaluable in allowing the kaldorei to gradually, but markedly push back the qiraji and gain the upper hand. Eventually, the night elves advanced into Silithus and drove the qiraji back into the very heart of the desert itself. Yet, just as final victory for the night elves seemed within reach, the war took a drastic and dire turn. Valstann had been ordered to hold and secure one of the night elves' outposts near the front, &lt;a href=\"Southwind%20Village\"&gt;Southwind Village&lt;/a&gt;, which was important to their continued advance against the silithid. During a feint orchestrated by the qiraji, however, the village and those inside were surrounded. Valstann himself was captured and ripped apart before Fandral's eyes.\nValstann's death shattered the will and confidence of the archdruid and sowed uncertainty and apprehension among the night elves' ranks. The qiraji seized on this opportunity and lull in the fighting and swept once more through Silithus. The weary and confused kaldorei forces subsequently fell back before this new onslaught. Having believed that they were on the verge of victory, this new turn of events severely dented the night elves' confidence and morale. Desperate after the war's recent events, Fandral contacted the reclusive &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; who resided in the region. He begged them to aid the now-failing war effort against the qiraji, but the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragons\"&gt;bronze dragons&lt;/a&gt; ultimately refused, declining to involve their flight in what they considered to be the affairs of the lesser creatures.\nAs the silithid once more spread out from Silithus, however, they began to push into the deserts of eastern &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. In their frenzy, they even assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, the sanctum of the Bronze dragonflight. The qiraji's reckless attack prompted the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to finally join the war against them, allying with the kaldorei and enlisting the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt; dragonflights as well. Led by &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, the bronze dragons, as well as those from the other flights, joined the fray and began to turn the tide against the qiraji once more. The night elves, heartened by this new, if unexpected, reinforcement, also began to increase their efforts to drive the qiraji swarm back permanently.\nThe sealing of Ahn'Qiraj.\nUnable to stand up to this new force, the qiraji were continually forced back. The dragons proved particularly effective against the qiraji, many of whom were unable to strike back at the dragons as they flew through the skies and decimated the qiraji ranks. One instance were this proved untrue, however, was during one of the many ensuing battles in Silithus.\nDuring this conflict, a particularly cunning Anubisath named &lt;a href=\"Ossirian\"&gt;Ossirian&lt;/a&gt; hurled his obsidian sword through the air to strike the bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Grakkarond\"&gt;Grakkarond&lt;/a&gt; as he flew, catching him in the wing. Wounded, the wyrm fell, crushing many qiraji as he did so. On the ground, the Grakkarond nearly mauled Ossirian to death, but the remaining qiraji now had a target on the ground to focus on, and they quickly converged upon and overwhelmed the dragon. The &lt;a href=\"Bones%20of%20Grakkarond\"&gt;site of his death&lt;/a&gt; subsequently came to be considered sacred by the Anubisath.\nDespite this instance, the qiraji ordinarily proved badly equipped to deal with this new onslaught and they eventually retreated to the very walls of Ahn'Qiraj. Soon, they were forced back inside its walls, where they lurked in its dark halls and their underground tunnels. Yet, even with the aid of the dragons, the qiraji could not be vanquished entirely; they were simply too numerous. Fandral feared that the war would never end, and could not stand the thought that so many had given their lives, only for more to have to do so again and again in the future. Ultimately, he and the dragons devised a way to end the war immediately and decisively. They would lock the insectoid horde away inside Ahn'Qiraj itself.\nBoth the night elves and dragons gathered before Ahn'Qiraj to complete this momentous task. Fandral called to his druids to focus their powers as one and, alongside Anachronos, they summoned a great barricade to close off Ahn'Qiraj. Outside the cursed city, the dry earth split wide, and a magical barrier of stone and colossal roots emerged. The impenetrable &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; towered high over the barren landscape, effectively sealing the qiraji within their city forever. The qiraji, now locked in their dark city, began to grow in numbers over the coming millennia, poised to one day make a second attempt to swarm the continent should the opportunity present itself.\nAs a final act, Anachronos created two mystical artifacts: the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;Scarab Gong&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon entrusted the scepter to Fandral; should the need ever arise again, he could use it to open the Scarab Wall, along with the gong. Fandral, however, received no closure in finally ending the qiraji threat, as Valstann's death still weighed heavily on him. In his rage, he shattered the Scepter of the Shifting Sands. The pieces of the scepter would become lost for the next thousand years.\nLegacy.\nWhile any immediate effects of the War of the Shifting Sands are unknown, it would have significant long-term effects on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. Thousands of years later, the qiraji, having recouped after their defeat and once more stirred into action by C'Thun, would eventually find ways past the barrier that imprisoned them. To combat this resurgent threat, the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was created, a temporary alliance of many of Kalimdor's races and some from beyond.\nWith this new conflict beginning, the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was reforged and used to open the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; once more. Having done this, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; entered the ancient city and, after a legendary battle, finally defeated the qiraji and put an end to C'Thun himself. This conflict came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;.\nFandral Staghelm's grief over the loss of his son would continue to haunt him and would eventually become an obsession to somehow have his son returned to him. This would, in turn, lead him down a dark path where he would ultimately enter the service of the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Lord\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Namuria%20Gladesong\"&gt;Namuria Gladesong&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; organization the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the many hunters lost during the war. Their sacrifice is honored on the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20of%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;Remembrance of the Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; was nearly wiped out during the War of the Shifting Sands, until Namuria's student, &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; re-established it in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; a thousand years later during the Legion's invasion."}

The attack was in response to the Lich King's attempts to lay claim to the entirety of the continent. Resistant to many of the Scourge's powers, and utilizing effective guerrilla tactics, the nerubians were able to momentarily gain the upper hand. Soon, however, the Lich King launched a massive assault on the insectoids' underground capital, Azjol-Nerub.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Kilix%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Kilix the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt;, it was during this invasion that the nerubians inadvertently unearthed the hostile &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt;s, minions of the &lt;a href=\"old%20god\"&gt;old god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, at the heart of their empire. Now caught between two powerful enemies, the Nerubian Empire was overwhelmed and destroyed.\nFollowing the nerubians' defeat, the Lich King used his necromantic powers to incorporate the vast majority of their dead into his ranks, and subsequently adopted their architectural style as his own. Chief among those risen was the former nerubian leader &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;. Now serving their conqueror, the raised insectoids became one of the Lich King's most potent and reliable weapons in the conflicts to come.\nHistory.\nRise of the Lich King.\nFollowing his death on the planet of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was sent as a spirit encased in ice to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. The orc's spirit was also granted immense psychic and necromantic powers and was charged with building an army which he would then use to invade the rest of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs his power and influence grew and spread across Northrend, Ner'zhul, now the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, began slaughtering and raising many of the continent's living inhabitants and incorporating them into his new army, known as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. His armies continued to grow by the day and the Lich King eventually had &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;a great citadel&lt;/a&gt; erected around him in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; which was manned by the undead. After 10 long years of consolidation, the Lich King's actions finally drew the attention of perhaps the Scourge's only equal on the continent: the &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20Empire\"&gt;Nerubian Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nSiege of Icecrown.\nIn an effort to end the Lich King's bid for dominance of the continent the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s, an &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; race descended from the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, dispatched a section of their most elite warriors to assault Ner'zhul's base in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. This force engaged the undead Scourge in the region, but the Lich King soon discovered, to his frustration, that the nerubians were virtually immune to both the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and his potent telepathic powers, which had proved so effective against Northrend's other denizens.\nThe insectoids possessed a vast network of underground tunnels and caverns which stretched the breadth of much of the continent, and which the nerubian leaders now used to their advantage against the undead. Deploying their vast forces in hit-and-run tactics as opposed to pitched battles allowed the Lich King's assailants to neutralize many of his strongholds, without running the risk of being rooted out. Despite these successes, however, the practically limitless numbers of undead at Ner'zhul's disposal proved impossible for the nerubians to overcome, and soon the Lich King struck back against the subterranean kingdom.\nThe fighting had grown intense that the Nerubian Empire's &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20spiderlord\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; would send messages requesting aid to &lt;a href=\"Azj-Kahet\"&gt;Azj-Kahet&lt;/a&gt;, a sister kingdom of the Nerubians located at &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Algar\"&gt;Khaz Algar&lt;/a&gt; that once was a colony of Azjol-Nerub before eventually growing into it's own separate Dynasty. However the ruler of Azj-Kahet at that time &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Neferess\"&gt;Queen Neferess&lt;/a&gt; would turn away the pleas and even go so far as to imprison Anub'araks' third emmisary bearing that same plea and seal off all tunnels that had once connected Azj-Kahet to Azjol-Nerub: stating that she wouldn't sacrifice any of her Kaheti and that their kingdom was far too remote to have been noticed by the Scourge along with believing that Anub'arak had \"asked for this war, and that he would finish it, alone.\"\nFall of Azjol-Nerub.\nEventually, the Scourge launched a large invasion of the nerubians' underground nation led by the Lich King's powerful &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s. The insectoids were forced back under the relentless assault, with many of their temples and structures being brought down on their heads. Although the nerubians had proven resilient to the Plague, the Lich King was still able to use his powers to raise them in undeath once they had been slain on the battlefield.\nDuring the fighting, Anub'arak was killed and subsequently raised by the Lord of the Scourge. As an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt;, Anub'arak, along with several of his lieutenants, crushed anything that posed a resistance to the Lich King's will and slaughtered many of his people. Anub'arak led the undead as they conquered the nerubian &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt;s and repurposed them for the Lich King's designs. For this, the living nerubians began to refer to him as the traitor king and lay the destruction of their kingdom at his feet.\nImpressed by the insectoids' tenacity and fearlessness, the Lich King even adopted many of their architectural designs for his own fortresses and structures.\nAt some point during the battle, the nerubian viziers released a single spider that would one day grow to challenge the Lich King's armies. Eventually growing to become the beast &lt;a href=\"Hadronox\"&gt;Hadronox&lt;/a&gt;, it was instilled with a desire to avenge the fallen of the kingdom and reclaim its home from any who would threaten it.\nDuring this dire battle in the nerubian capital, a new threat emerged from Azjol-Nerub's deepest reaches. In an effort to replace ground lost to the undead, the nerubians dug progressively deeper into the earth. In doing so, they inadvertently uncovered the &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt;s, minions of the ancient &lt;a href=\"old%20gods\"&gt;old gods&lt;/a&gt;. These monsters, in the service of their master &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, attacked the nerubians with immense ferocity. Now fighting a desperate war on two fronts, what was left of the Nerubian Empire collapsed and was overwhelmed by its enemies.\nThe fall of the spider kingdom marked the conclusion of the War of the Spider, as the Lich King, now fully unopposed to rule the entire continent, began making preparations for his assault on Azeroth's other inhabitants.\nAftermath.\nThe War of the Spider marked the conclusion of resistance to the Lich King on the continent of Northrend. In the period following the conflict, the Scourge made an effort to raise from the dead the many nerubians who had fallen in battle. Such was the size of their numbers that they significantly bolstered the undead ranks in the form of &lt;a href=\"crypt%20fiend\"&gt;crypt fiend&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt;s and played a major role in the Lich King's armies in the wars to come.\nAlthough the majority of nerubians had fallen in defense of their kingdom during the war, various small groups managed to survive the slaughter. One of these groups was the &lt;a href=\"Azjol-anak\"&gt;Azjol-anak&lt;/a&gt;, they promptly went into hiding but eventually reemerged with the commencement of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; years later. Their primary goal became the reclamation of their once-mighty kingdom and the ultimate rebirth of their race. During the events of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Adventurers who traveled to &lt;a href=\"Skittering%20Hollow\"&gt;Skittering Hollow&lt;/a&gt; found themselves in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Voru%27kar\"&gt;Voru'kar&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Nerubians led by the Spider Lord &lt;a href=\"Vorus%27arak\"&gt;Vorus'arak&lt;/a&gt; that had escaped from Azjol-Nerub when the Scourge was closing in on their city by tunneling beneath the earth; who would stumble across the island and setup a society there with a hidden cache of eggs to regrow their population with.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, as lord of the dreadlords at the time, is likely to have led them\u2014and possibly the Scourge\u2014in battle during the war."}

Most of the fighting occurred in the regions of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; territory. Survivors from Teldrassil were evacuated to both &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; as refugees, while overall night elven power on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was severely reduced. \nThis event caused the escalation of the conflict between the Horde and Alliance in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and directly led to immediate Alliance retaliation with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt; ordering the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;retaking of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game, the War of the Thorns served as the limited-time &lt;a href=\"%23Event\"&gt;pre-expansion event&lt;/a&gt; for \"\", with faction-specific questlines taking place in Ashenvale and Darkshore along with &lt;a href=\"world%20quest\"&gt;world quest&lt;/a&gt;s in the latter.\nPremise.\nWith the emergence of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; feared that the Alliance would use it to build powerful weapons, which they would sooner or later turn upon the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, before their gaze fell upon &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. She thus preemptively struck by launching a campaign to capture the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; which the Alliance used as a safe harbor to funnel &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; from Kalimdor to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy occupying &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde could control the flow of Azerite and ensure that it could not be used against them. The Alliance would also not dare attack the city for fear of hurting the civilians. Knowing the night elves would resist them at every step of the way, including during occupation, she also planned to kill &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Losing someone in whom they had absolute trust and faith, a living symbol of hope, would assuredly break their spirits.\nSummary.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;war with the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s navies were diminished. With both factions debilitated in their ability to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde came up with a plan to secure Kalimdor and elicit a political crisis in the Alliance that would lead to its downfall. After luring a majority of the night elven forces to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; through misinformation, the Horde would seek to hold &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; hostage and use the political crisis to sow division in the Alliance. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; wanted to kill &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in order to kill the kaldorei's spirit and end them as a nation.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; launched a sneak attack on Ashenvale, the majority of the night elf army was close to Silithus and couldn't get back to defend. It would take time for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; navy to arrive as well. The defense of northern Kalimdor thus relied on &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Captain Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20City%20Guard\"&gt;City Guard&lt;/a&gt; forces, and brave &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions of the Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing their chances of fending off the Horde army were slim to none, the Alliance have begun to evacuate &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; civilians to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde started by sending Horde rogues to attack night elf patrols and outposts in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Once the main Horde army arrived in Ashenvale, they faced fierce resistance at &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde overcame the night elf defenders but were still harried by the night elves' guerrilla warfare. The night elves had lured &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; into an ambush in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, but they failed to assassinate him. The Horde then progressed into &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, where Malfurion confronted Sylvanas. He raised an immense, magical wall of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s that blocked their way. Furthermore, the night elf fleet had returned to aid in the kaldorei's defense. The Horde thus fell back onto &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, with their intention to conquer the World Tree before &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s reinforcements arrive. Malfurion ordered Delaryn to find any defenders she could rally at &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas meanwhile ordered &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; to scale the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and attack from the north. After a quick aerial scouting mission, Sylvanas took the champion and a handful of her remaining forces to the wall and used her banshee abilities to open enough of a gap for the group to sneak through. The Horde forces immediately started attacking night elf defenders at the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;Master's Glaive&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Morka%20Bruggu\"&gt;Morka Bruggu&lt;/a&gt; led a group of Horde infiltrators and managed to covertly commandeer some of the night elven ships from the kaldorei fleet.\nThe night elf forces set up a front at &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt; and have drawn the battle into a stalemate. The leaders thus fell back to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Den\"&gt;Blackwood Den&lt;/a&gt; to prepare. As the last defenders rallied, the Horde warhorns sounded from the north. Saurfang's battalions finally arrived, trapping Lor'danel from both sides. While helping trapped citizens escape and assisting the fight at Lor'danel, Malfurion and Sylvanas locked in one-on-one combat once more.\nAs Sylvanas was losing the battle, Saurfang snuck up behind Malfurion and incapacitated him with a throw of his axe, gravely wounding him. Sylvanas praised Saurfang's effort, whereas he felt the blow dishonorable, then gave him the order to execute Malfurion. As &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the scene, she questioned why Saurfang would not kill Malfurion, to which he felt he did not deserve to due to his dishonorable actions. Tyrande then gave Saurfang a choice - attempt to stop her from taking him away and die, or remain there and live - to which Saurfang offered her one of his own: take Malfurion and flee or attempt to stop the Horde's capture of Teldrassil and die. Tyrande chose the former, hearthing both herself and Malfurion back to Stormwind with a hearthstone given to her by Anduin Wrynn, while Saurfang went to join Sylvanas on the beach of Darkshore. News of Malfurion's survival upset Sylvanas and she felt Darnassus' conquering would not be enough of a fatal wound for the Alliance.\nWhen Sylvanas gave Nathanos and Saurfang the orders to secure the beach and prepare to invade Teldrassil, she noticed a gravely wounded Delaryn Summermoon, who then explained that only innocents remained in Teldrassil and that Sylvanas's war was one of hatred and rage. She attempted to remind Sylvanas of her former life, to which Sylvanas experienced a flashback of her inability to stop the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas explained that life was pain and that hope fails, telling Delaryn not to grieve, for she would soon join her loved ones. Delaryn explained that she grieved for Sylvanas, for she had made life her enemy, and that was a war she could never win; that she could kill her people, but she could never kill hope. In response to this, Sylvanas turned Delaryn's head to gaze at Teldrassil in her final moments, then gave Nathanos the order to burn Teldrassil, to which he and the rest of the Horde present complied.\nAftermath.\nAfter the battle, Darnassus and Teldrassil are no longer available to players. In Teldrassil's place is a rendering of the burning tree, but players are prevented from accessing it by an invisible wall. &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; appears just outside &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; and offers to take player characters back in time to before the battle, just as she does in other locations like &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Should players try to &lt;a href=\"Teleport\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; or use a mage portal to reach Darnassus, they will instead land on a small rise on the beach just outside Lor'danel.\nTeldrassil's surviving population has moved to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile other surviving night elves ended up joining the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt level 120, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Sentinel%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;Bloodied Sentinel's Glaive&lt;/a&gt; can be found next to the body of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Captain Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mist%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Mist's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, and offers &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Sentinel%27s%20Glaive%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Bloodied Sentinel's Glaive (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, the souls of many night elves who died in the Burning were saved from torture in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and brought to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, an afterlife for servants of nature.\nDetailed account.\nAlliance side.\nThe Horde invasion.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; received disturbing messages from &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; operatives stationed in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Reports indicated that Warchief Sylvanas was mobilizing an army to march on &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, the site of and a hotbed for &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Given the potential of Azerite to change the face of warfare, it came as no surprise that she sought to lay claim to it. A significant &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; fleet immediately set sail for Silithus to deter the Horde's campaign, but new information came to light. The &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; have begun to receive reports of their patrols and outposts coming under attack by Horde rogues. One such attack led to the assassination of Commander &lt;a href=\"Anaris%20Windwood\"&gt;Anaris Windwood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; managed to capture &lt;a href=\"Rifen\"&gt;Rifen&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde rogue who perpetrated the assassination and interrogated him. Rifen revealed that the Horde's campaign in Silithus was a ruse and that their true objective is the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and the conquering of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Dalaryn, Anaris' successor and now commander of Ashenvale's defense, sent Sentinel &lt;a href=\"Eriadnar\"&gt;Eriadnar&lt;/a&gt; to warn &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde invasion while she and Ashenvale's defense force hold off the coming army. Meanwhile, the Horde had diverted at the north fork of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and had started marching on &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The kaldorei fleet was already halfway to Silithus by then, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Darnassian City Guard&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Captain Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; as the only remaining defenders in the area. Knowing their chances of stopping the Horde army were slim to none, Captain Summermoon hoped that her forces could buy enough time for the Alliance to evacuate the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; civilians to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalfarren River.\nAs the main Horde army marched through &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, they faced their first resistance at &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf defenders led by Captain &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; burned down the connecting bridges of the river, halting the Horde army and harrying them with arrows. &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s to fire covering fire while the Horde tried to swim across the river. However, night elf &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; began to covertly destroy siege weapons on the Horde's side of the river. Meanwhile, the night elf druids traveled through Ashenvale's canopy and were using guerrilla warfare to reinforce hot spots. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and her archers went on to snipe all the night elf magi and provided intelligence and range support. Saurfang had his spellcasters enchant his &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s, using the flash of their exploding payloads to reveal hidden enemies. When it was safe to proceed, Varok had Horde magi freeze the river so his army could cross. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; arrived just as the Horde army breached the night elves' side of the river. Malfurion ordered a majority of the night elf defenders to fall back, while he and a few defenders covered their retreat from the forests. As the Horde army tried to get into a defensive formation, Malfurion made himself visible in the forest so that he could pick off the clusters of Horde soldiers foolish enough to pursue him. Malfurion and Saurfang exchanged words before Malfurion too fell back. \nDelaryn Summermoon's forces gathered in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt; to halt the Horde's advance. Knowing that the defenders couldn't last long against the Horde army, the Alliance launched its &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; fleet to reinforce Darnassus, recalled the night elf fleet, and sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to buy time for the navy to arrive.\nAstranaar.\nCaptain Summermoon collected nearby night elf corpses and placed them in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, masking their wounds to make them look as if a battle had taken place in Astranaar, before hiding around the town to ambush the Horde forces. When High Overlord Saurfang arrived and took residence in the Astranaar inn, a night elf rogue named &lt;a href=\"Tavar\"&gt;Tavar&lt;/a&gt; disguised himself as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and tried to lure Saurfang into the open for an ambush. The orcs saw through the deception, however, and killed him. Saurfang went outside the inn to berate his guards about the lax security, almost dropping his guard. However, the orc realized the danger and tried to return to the safety of the inn. Fortunately, Malfurion Stormrage arrived and attacked with nature's fury, consequently allowing Delaryn's forces to leap from the trees and ambush the Horde soldiers in the chaos. The attack nearly succeeded \u2014 the Horde soldiers were taken by surprise and Malfurion had summoned an overgrowth to crush the inn that he had pursued Saurfang to; burying Saurfang in the inn's collapsing rubble. Warchief Sylvanas joined the fray, however, and rallied the Horde's forces. The Horde waylaid the night elves and forced Malfurion and the night elves to retreat. Unfortunately, the night elves later discovered Saurfang had survived his encounter with Malfurion.\nWhen the Alliance champions arrived, the village of Astranaar was burning. Bodies littered the ground. They found Captain Summermoon kneeling before the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Alennah%20Starsong\"&gt;Captain Alennah Starsong&lt;/a&gt;. She explained that they tried to set a trap for the Horde, but it failed, and they could not stop them. Their outposts were taken by surprise, falling one by one, the guards poisoned. Not even the civilians were spared. The loss of life was clearly visible by the abundance of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s. Despite the urgency of the situation, Summermoon insisted for the bodies of the fallen soldiers to be honored properly, allowing their wisps proper release. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Assassin%20%28War%20of%20the%20Thorns%29\"&gt;Forsaken Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s that still skulked within the village were dealt with as well.\nIn the distance, Delaryn heard something going on. The champions rushed to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s rooted by vines summoned by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. As the grunts broke free and charged the archdruid, he summoned an immense, magical wall of wisps. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were slain as they tried to pass through it. They did not harm the champions, however, who joined Malfurion's side.\nDarkshore.\nMalfurion explained that when the Horde invaded, he did his best to thwart them, but many forces still made passage already. The wall would slow them down, but it would not halt their attack entirely. He then heard the &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;s call to them. Champions were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vale\"&gt;Twilight Vale&lt;/a&gt; to find the druids present and send them to the Ancients' protection.\nThe ruin wrought by the Horde was also driving the children of the forest mad, chief among being the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20tribe\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. They gave into the madness and became a threat to everyone. If left to their madness, they could strike the night elven from behind while they engaged the Horde, leaving them to fight a battle on two fronts. Though it pained him to ask this, he asked the champions to put them out of their misery before they endangered anyone else.\nCaptain Delaryn Summermoon then arrived with dire news. Horde forces had gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion understood that the Banshee Queen sought to capture the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. He tasked Delaryn with traveling to the night elven outposts and gathering every soldier she could find. Meanwhile, word was sent to the night elven fleet to return. Since Sylvanas sought to engage Malfurion, he planned to give her what she wanted.\nTwilight Vale.\nAfter the furbolgs were slain and the Druids of the Claw were dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Grove of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the champions met with Delaryn and encountered &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and their infernal machine desecrating the grove. The &lt;a href=\"Monstrous%20Shredder\"&gt;Monstrous Shredder&lt;/a&gt; was brought down by the druids and the champion, while Delaryn drove the invaders away. The defenders then gathered around the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20Lore\"&gt;Ancient of Lore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onu\"&gt;Onu&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that the ancients of the forest were all connected to one another and that they could sense a disturbance from deep within their roots. He could feel the rumble of the footsteps in the distance, the thundering clamor of war. With every branch they were breaking, they awakened the ancients. His brethren were about to answer in kind, for nothing should disrupt the balance of nature.\nMeanwhile, the champions and Delaryn went to investigate one such disturbance within &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Den\"&gt;Blackwood Den&lt;/a&gt;, where furbolgs were crying for help. The Horde had set up camp in their den. Having been ousted from their own is what had sent the Blackwood furbolg into a frenzy. The heroes saved some of the furbolg, and sabotaged some of the Horde's terrible war machines, saving dozens of lives.\nReturning to Onu, the disturbance had become more severe. He sensed a powerful force unlike anything he had felt before, coming from the earth itself. Delaryn and the champion went to investigate it at &lt;a href=\"Nazj%27vel\"&gt;Nazj'vel&lt;/a&gt;. There, Horde forces had taken the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;Master's Glaive&lt;/a&gt;, and were now bombarding the island for an unknown reason. Nazj'vel was glowing, and while the night elves believed it was &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s light, as they got closer they realized it was from the many &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; deposits that had appeared, and which the Horde desired.\nIt was Azerite that was hurting Onu. The night elves could not let the Horde retrieve, and weaponize, all of the mineral, and set out to collect as much as possible, while killing the Horde forces present. Then, Malfurion's voice was heard. With the Horde pressing further into Darkshore, he called for everyone to rally at the &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt;.\nStalemate at the river.\nThere, the night elven armies were clashing with the Horde forces across the river. The former were joined by numerous mighty &lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, who lifted and threw gigantic boulders on the invading forces. The champions rode onto the ancients, who crossed the bank of the river and smashed into the Horde forces.\nBut for every foe slain, two more took their place. Despite their efforts, the defenders were too few in number to stand toe to toe. Malfurion, the champions, and Delaryn fell back and regrouped in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. In order to break the stalemate at the river, Delaryn and the champion called upon all the strength of Darnassus's forces.\nThey rallied the druids, the &lt;a href=\"priestesses%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestesses of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, and many others including &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Myara%20Sunsong\"&gt;Myara Sunsong&lt;/a&gt;, the Captain of the Darnassian Army, sent huntresses and glaive throwers to reinforce the southern border of Darkshore, Sentinels to create a battle line at the Wildbend River and rouse their allies at the Grove of the Ancients, and she took hippogryph archers with herself to form a mobile response unit and regroup in &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii Starseeker&lt;/a&gt; sent words to the &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;High Priestess&lt;/a&gt; as well. With the Darnassian forces rallied, the champion rejoined with Malfurion at &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;. The night elven fleet had finally returned.\nThreat from the North.\nTaken by complete surprise, the night elves realized that a Horde army was approaching from the North. They had scaled the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion also sensed that the wisps were growing disoriented, and the wall was failing. He transformed into a crow and Delaryn jumped on her hippogryph. The enemy was advancing upon &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;. The suddenness of the Horde's attack gave citizens little time to flee. Many were hiding in Lor'danel, waiting for help. Malfurion had the civilians located and sent to safety.\nThe druid believed that it was only a matter of time before the Horde broke through and attacked from both sides. Sylvanas sought to engage Malfurion, so he decided to give her what she wanted and left Lor'danel, to try to locate the Warchief. In his absence, Commander Summermoon would lead the defense of Lor'danel. She tasked the champion with slaying two of the Horde's strongest warriors who had led a charge to try and capture the night elven fleet, which they would then use to sail them to Darnassus. Despite the kaldorei's best efforts, &lt;a href=\"Morka%20Bruggu\"&gt;Morka Bruggu&lt;/a&gt; led a group of Horde infiltrators and managed to covertly commandeer some of the night elven ships.\nLor'danel.\nDespite everything, the Horde was relentless. Lor'danel was overrun. The only solution left for Delaryn was to send the champion to seek her Shan'do and ask for his guidance. The champion found Malfurion southwest of Lor'danel, locked in a fight with the Banshee Queen whom he had rooted. They witnessed Varok Saurfang approaching the archdruid from behind, and tossing his axe at Stormrage. Sylvanas incapacitated the champion and congratulated the orc, before asking him to finish the druid and leaving for the shore. Saurfang knelt on the ground. He had dealt a dishonorable blow, it had not been his place to interfere. He regretted his action.\nAt that moment, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived. She took Malfurion, but knew that the war was lost, and that Teldrassil would soon fall. She asked the champion to take her hippogryph to Darnassus and make the Horde's occupation as \"tolerable\" as possible. She would use the hearthstone that &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt; gave her to leave for Stormwind, to tend her love's wound, and help her people find respite from this madness. The orc let them leave, before joining his Warchief on the beach.\nBurning of Teldrassil.\nOn the ravaged shore, Sylvanas ordered the Horde to secure the beach, and prepare to invade the tree. Amidst the corpses, she found a mortally-wounded Captain Delaryn Summermoon. Despite all that had transpired, the spirit of the night elf remained whole. Her people would heal. She told the Banshee Queen that she could never win, for she could not kill hope. Sylvanas calmly turned the commander's head toward the tree, and ordered her troops to set it ablaze.\nThe champion's hippogryph reached Darnassus as it was already burning. Many of the city's structures had already caught fire. They met with &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, who asked them to help evacuate the city before it burned to ash. They doused the flames, rescued the trapped civilians within the buildings, and saved as many lives as possible. Eventually, smoke filled their own lungs, and they passed out. They awakened back at the Temple, with Mia kneeling over them and carrying a &lt;a href=\"Finel\"&gt;night elf child&lt;/a&gt;. She asked &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii&lt;/a&gt; to hurry and evacuate but, exhausted, she fainted. Mia and the child were subsequently trapped underneath some collapsing rubble, causing Astarii and a night elf mage to try to dig her and the night elf infant out.\nAt that moment, her husband &lt;a href=\"Genn\"&gt;Genn&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; portal and rushed to her. Genn managed to dig her out and told Mia she couldn't stay in Darnassus any longer. Genn urged her to escape to the human capital of Stormwind, but a half-conscious and injured Mia told Genn to take the night elf child and leaver her. Genn refused and carried both the night elf child and Mia, determined not to lose either of them. Genn urged Astarii to escape with them, but Astarii and the other priestesses were determined to stay behind and pray for the comfort of those that could not be evacuated. Genn wished for Astarii's &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt; to watch over her one last time before Genn, Mia, the Alliance champion, and the night elf child escaped the burning city together.\nEnding dialogue.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt; addresses the champion:\nHorde side.\nThe Warchief's agenda.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; organized a meeting with other faction leaders in her chambers in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, where privacy could be assured. &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; had indeed become riddled with spies. The Banshee Queen explained that an army led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; was advancing towards &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to mislead the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. It had reached the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; by now. She sent a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; to notify Saurfang that the preparations were complete. The army was to actually march onto the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe massive army was halted at the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, awaiting the moment they should divert. They were now ready for a coordinated, synchronized attack on key &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; outposts in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The goal was to quickly destroy the kaldorei's defenses and clear a path all the way to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, and conquer &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; before the reinforcements that &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; would surely send arrived. While Saurfang diverted the troops, he sent the champion to &lt;a href=\"Lorash\"&gt;Lorash&lt;/a&gt;, the operative outside Astranaar, for further instruction.\nFalfarren River.\nAs the main Horde army marched through &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, they faced their first resistance at &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf defenders led by Captain &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; burned down the connecting bridges of the river, halting the Horde army and harrying them with arrows. &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s to fire covering fire while the Horde tried to swim across the river. However, night elf &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; began to covertly destroy siege weapons on the Horde's side of the river. Meanwhile, the night elf druids traveled through Ashenvale's canopy and was using guerrilla warfare to reinforce hot spots. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and her archers went on to snipe all the night elf magi and provided intelligence and range support. Saurfang had his spellcasters enchant his &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s, using the flash of their exploding payloads to reveal hidden enemies. When it was safe to proceed, Varok had Horde magi freeze the river so his army could cross. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; arrived just as the Horde army breached the night elves' side of the river. Malfurion ordered a majority of the night elf defenders to fall back, while he and a few defenders covered their retreat from the forests. As the Horde army tried to get into a defensive formation, Malfurion made himself visible in the forest so that he could pick off the clusters of Horde soldiers foolish enough to pursue him. Malfurion and Saurfang exchanged words before Malfurion too fell back.\nAstranaar.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, Lorash explained that the kaldorei outposts in Ashenvale were already attacked by hundreds of rogues. On the champion's signal, they would begin the next phase of the war, sowing chaos. But since his colleague had died, he asked the champion for help. By staying out of sight, the town wouldn't even know it was under attack before all of its guards were down. Using poison that kills extremely quickly and silently, the champion signaled to Lorash which targets were safe to attack without being noticed.\nLorash lit a bonfire that burned with purple smoke and rose above the trees to signal the others to begin their assault. The champion and him then infiltrated Ashenvale and started theirs. Many Sentinels were brought down, and he personally took out &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Alennah%20Starsong\"&gt;Captain Alennah Starsong&lt;/a&gt;. With the city sacked, they used a smoke bomb and escaped. Lorash then went to check on the other outposts in case his colleagues encountered issues. At that moment, the Horde army, joined by the Warchief herself, had arrived and stood before an already burning Astranaar. The champion met with the Banshee Queen to inform her that Astranaar had been secured.\nSaurfang moved his army to Astranaar to act as their new staging ground with Astranaar inn acting as their command post. Saurfang was impressed by the Horde rogues' effectiveness since not a single night elf was alive when they got there. Sylvanas said that she would continue her hunt for the only creature that could stop the Horde's march to victory, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas tracked Malfurion to the northern border of Ashenvale, but she discovered he went back south. Sylvanas' intuition told her Malfurion planned to attack Astranaar. In Astranaar, Saurfang and his guard &lt;a href=\"Morka%20Bruggu\"&gt;Morka Bruggu&lt;/a&gt; uncovered a night elf provocateur disguised as high ranking &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and dispatched him. When Saurfang went outside to berate his guards about the lax security, he sensed an ambush and tried to return to the safety of the inn. Unfortunately, Malfurion Stormrage arrived and attacked with nature's fury, consequently allowing &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Captain Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt;'s forces to leap from the trees and ambush the Horde soldiers in the chaos. When Malfurion pursued Saurfang to the inn, Saurfang knew he nor his guards would be a match for him. Saurfang told his tacticians to bring their battle plans to the warchief while he dies an honorable death buying them time to escape. Saurfang tried to challenge Malfurion to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; to keep Malfurion's attention on him, though Malfurion had little interest in an orcish duel and was after Saurfang's life anyways. Malfurion began to summon a massive overgrowth to consume the inn and Saurfang. Saurfang was nearly about to meet his end until Warchief Sylvanas attacked Malfurion and drew his attention away from him. Saurfang was buried in the inn's collapsing rubble while Warchief Sylvanas rallied the Horde forces to route the night elves. Once the Horde secured Astranaar, they rescued Saurfang from the rubble.\nZoram'gar.\nThe next order of business, for now, was to establish a foothold at the base of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Grimfang\"&gt;Commander Grimfang&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt; would be able to accommodate an incoming army.\nShe sent the champion to him to inform of their arrival and ensure the necessary preparations were made. &lt;a href=\"Innkeeper%20Duras\"&gt;Innkeeper Duras&lt;/a&gt; gathered every resource available so the army would want for nothing, and the weaponsmith &lt;a href=\"Dagrun%20Ragehammer\"&gt;Dagrun Ragehammer&lt;/a&gt; stood at the ready to repair the soldiers' weapons.\nThe champion returned to Astranaar, which was now occupied by the Horde's armies. All of Ashenvale was secured. However, the town was also being overrun with &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s. Saurfang had seen this once before when the demon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was felled by the sting of thousands of them. This could mean only one thing. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; was beckoning the aid of his ancestors. The Warchief had already taken a scouting party ahead to Darkshore to intercept him.\nDarkshore.\nThe champion found Sylvanas at the border between Ashenvale and Darkshore. Her troops and herself had been rooted by Malfurion, and she had engaged in a ranged duel with the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;. When grunts accompanying her broke free of the vines, Malfurion conjured an immense, magical wall made of wisps. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s rushed toward him, and were instantly burned by the wall. As the champion joined Sylvanas, the two were ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Huntress\"&gt;Ashenvale huntresses&lt;/a&gt;. The forest was still brimming with Stormrage's forces. Fending off the attack, Sylvanas believed the druid would soon return with an army.\nThe wall had effectively halted the Horde's progress. Moreover, the kaldorei had begun to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. The path to Teldrassil was becoming more difficult than anticipated. Sylvanas knew that Malfurion was trying to hold them back until his fleet returned from &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Until then, however, his army was too small, they just needed a way to pass through the wisps. She rode to Zoram'gar and met with Saurfang and Blightcaller, who had arrived with the Horde army.\nInto the woods.\nNathanos believed that &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s and a few demolishers could easily overcome the wisp wall. Sylvanas retorted that her scouting party had underestimated the wisps as well, and paid the price for doing so. The wisps could not be destroyed, at least not in numbers enough to matter. But she believed they may be able to be dispersed. Saurfang noted that the wisps had responded to Malfurion's call, and making more of the forest cry for help might just work. Sylvanas decided to have the champion use the explosive reserves and apply pressure with &lt;a href=\"Zarvik%20Blastwix\"&gt;Zarvik Blastwix&lt;/a&gt;'s bombardiers, directly attacking the forest by destroying trees and killing many wandering wisps. This wouldn't bring the wall down, but it could reveal an opening. A squadron would be ready to strike if they managed to break ground. \nTheir theory proved right, the wisps were susceptible to distraction, a weakness the Horde would exploit to get past them. Sylvanas ordered Saurfang to take a force into &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and seek a path over the mountain into Darkshore, though the siege weapons would be left under her command. They aimed to squeeze Malfurion from both sides.\nHigh Overlord Saurfang says: Warchief, there is no safe passage through Felwood. Blightcaller would help Saurfang find a hidden route used by smugglers for his troops.\nMaster's Glaive.\nWith the forest in distress and the wisps occupied, now was the time to strike. Sylvanas took a force of sturdy soldiers and demolishers and met the champion before the wall. Using her &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; powers, she held open a small, temporary breach allowing her forces to pass through. The Horde pressed on and gathered around the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;Master's Glaive&lt;/a&gt;. They formed lines against the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who had amassed an army and were reinforced by siege weaponry. But the Horde war machine would not be stopped, and they charged forward.\nTwilight Vale.\nThere were also brightly glowing owls scattered among the trees, above their heads, but they were not living breathing denizens of the forest, they were kaldorei magic, sentries reporting everything they saw. As the Horde progressed through the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vale\"&gt;Twilight Vale&lt;/a&gt;, they took down the owls, along with anything standing in their way, such as the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; furbolg. With the eyes of the forest shut, there remained the ears. The &lt;a href=\"ancients\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; felt every vibration of the Horde's footsteps, reporting to and helping the night elves in the defense of Darkshore. The Horde assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Grove of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, setting fire to the ancients and fighting the defending &lt;a href=\"druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; present, until Malfurion finally arrived, who confronted Sylvanas and the Horde, blinding them before leaving again.\nBlackwood Den.\nAfter recuperating from their confrontation, Sylvanas decided that she would move all Horde troops into Darkshore, but she needed to establish a foothold in &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Den\"&gt;Blackwood Den&lt;/a&gt; first. The furbolgs had been driven into a hysteria, and with their enemies pouring in from the north, the threat the creatures represented was a nuisance that couldn't be afforded. While she brought more forces past the wisp wall, the champion slaughtered the furbolg and raised up banners of the Horde to assert the faction's dominance.\nSylvanas returned with more troops from Zoram'gar and had them set up camp in the conquered Den. On her way back, she had spotted something interesting. She took the champion with herself, along with sappers and shredders, and brought them to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Shore%20%28Darkshore%29\"&gt;Twilight Shore&lt;/a&gt;. There, they found &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; growing around the island of &lt;a href=\"Nazj%27vel\"&gt;Nazj'vel&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; had beaten them to it and night elves had already started mining it. A night elven ship was also moored to the island. Believing that it could only have come from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas left, stating that she had a \"crow\" to hunt.\nStalemate at the river.\n&lt;a href=\"Jux%20Burstkix%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Jux Burstkix\u200e&lt;/a&gt; oversaw the mining of the Azerite. The mineral would be primordial in the assault against the night elves, and they could not be allowed to gather it. The Horde also opened fire on the elves to prevent them from further progression. The Azerite that the Horde managed to gather was brought to &lt;a href=\"Zarvik%20Blastwix\"&gt;Zarvik Blastwix&lt;/a&gt; at the main camp of &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Den\"&gt;Blackwood Den&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to modify and upgrade the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Hellion%20%28War%20of%20the%20Thorns%29\"&gt;goblin hellions&lt;/a&gt;. He then notified the champion that battle was raging at &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt;, where the Warchief and her troops were fighting.\nHe gave them a hellion to ride on and they rained Azerite-powered destruction down upon the night elven forces, which had been reinforced with the full might of the &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s. For every enemy slain, two replaced them on the battlefield, noted Sylvanas. The stalemate was unwise to pursue, and she regrouped at Blackwood Den. The Horde had to stay the course for now. She would continue leading soldiers through the wall while they awaited word from Saurfang. In the meantime, they would keep the kaldorei under pressure.\nSaurfang's return.\nSaurfang and his army eventually managed to make their way from &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. At the Den, Sylvanas remarked that the &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s were scattering, one by one the wall came crashing down. Now was the time to strike and take the World Tree. She sent the champion to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;, where they met with Saurfang. The town was all that stood in the way before the capture of Darnassus and the claiming of Kalimdor. It had mustered significant reinforcements on its shore, however, enough to drive the Horde back. Saurfang ordered a swift strike to break through their lines and slay the two commanders, leading the fleet and the field troops. Without leadership, their force would crumble. Not a single enemy would escape until they secured control over the World Tree. Lor'danel was to be in order by the time the Warchief arrived. He would not slay innocents, however. As long as they did not raise arms against the Horde, they would be spared. They would be captured, questioned and then released. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Morka%20Bruggu\"&gt;Morka Bruggu&lt;/a&gt; led a group of Horde infiltrators and managed to covertly commandeer some of the night elven ships from the kaldorei fleet.\nLor'danel was successfully taken, but Saurfang felt that it was almost too easy, and sensed something was amiss. There had been no sign of Stormrage. Malfurion would have never let Lor'danel fall without a fight. He believed that the archdruid had gone after Sylvanas. With Saurfang's army having approached from the North, and our reinforcements having arrived from the South, this meant that they were not along any of the roads. Saurfang set out to search the forest for the Warchief, and found her southwest of the town. Corpses of Orgrimmar grunts lay on the ground as &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; was fighting Sylvanas. Saurfang approached the archdruid from behind, and tossed his axe at Stormrage.\nAfter congratulating him and asking him to finish the druid, she rode to the shore and joined the army. Saurfang knelt on the ground. He had dealt a dishonorable blow, it had not been his place to interfere. He regretted his action. At that moment, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived. She took Malfurion, and the orc let them leave, before joining the Warchief. Saurfang went to join Sylvanas on the beach of Darkshore in order to inform her of what had transpired and also to plan for the occupation of Teldrassil. News of Malfurion's survival, however, upset Sylvanas and she felt Darnassus' conquering would not be enough of a fatal wound for the Alliance.\nBurning of Teldrassil.\nOn the ravaged shore, Sylvanas ordered the Horde to secure the beach, and prepare to invade the tree. Amidst the corpses, she found a mortally-wounded Captain Delaryn Summermoon. Despite all that had transpired, the spirit of the night elf remained whole. Her people would heal. She told the Banshee Queen that she could never win, for she could not kill hope. Sylvanas calmly turned the commander's head toward the tree, and ordered her troops to set it ablaze.\nAreas of battle.\nWith both sides running low on food, Sylvanas and Delaryn sent adventurers to gather as much meat as possible at &lt;a href=\"Long%20Wash\"&gt;Long Wash&lt;/a&gt; for the troops.\nThe Horde conquest took them to the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Grove of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, where the Ancients have woken up to defend the land. The Horde sent shredders to cut down the trees and their protectors. Both forces tried to deal with each threat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; were seemingly abandoned by the Twilight's Hammer and became a war zone between the night elves led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Aylissa%20Silverarrow\"&gt;Lieutenant Aylissa Silverarrow&lt;/a&gt; and the orcs led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Oogra\"&gt;Lieutenant Oogra&lt;/a&gt;. Both sides tried to push each other away.\nAt the beach side of &lt;a href=\"Mist%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Mist's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde brought with them ships filled with a large supply of &lt;a href=\"Keg%20of%20Azerite%20Powder%20%28War%20of%20the%20Thorns%29\"&gt;Azerite Powder Kegs&lt;/a&gt; for the war effort. The night elves were able to intercept these ships and throw all the kegs in the ocean before attacking the Horde's crew. Despite this, Horde adventurers were sent to recover the kegs while Alliance adventurers were sent to destroy them.\nAlthough the Horde had secured the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;Master's Glaive&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance still sent troops to engage with the Horde troops. The Horde, however, is constantly pushing them back.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20Fury\"&gt;Azerite Furies&lt;/a&gt; started to spawn around Darkshore, both sides sent their troops to kill and contain it.\nWith the Horde slowly advancing through Darkshore, Delaryn sent adventurers to mobilize the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Claw%20%28War%20of%20the%20Thorns%29\"&gt;Druids of the Claws&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vale\"&gt;Twilight Vale&lt;/a&gt;. To keep the night elves uninformed, the Horde sent its troops to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Sentry%20Owl\"&gt;Sentry Owl&lt;/a&gt;s in the area. \nWith the wisps dissonant, the spirits of long-forgotten &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; began to take forces from both sides and turn them into mindless slaves. Malfurion asked Alliance adventurers to put them to rest, free his soldiers and calm the wisps who were lost to a frenzy. Sylvanas, on the other hand, simply wanted the destruction of the wisps.\nWith all the commotion, the goblins found a great spot to dig for oil, the &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Strand\"&gt;Blazing Strand&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion sent adventurers to put a stop to it, while Sylvanas sent adventurers to repel the night elves and secure the oil.\nWhen the Horde found the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Mathystra\"&gt;Ruins of Mathystra&lt;/a&gt;, they realized it was full of resources. The night elves attempted to take the lumber from the Horde's clutches while the orcs kept cutting down the trees.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20War%20Camp\"&gt;Shatterspear War Camp&lt;/a&gt; being used to attack the night elves from all sides, Delaryn sent adventurers to deal with the Horde threat and free their prisoners. In the meantime, Horde soldiers did their best to hold their ground.\nOn the Twilight Shore &amp; &lt;a href=\"Nazj%27vel\"&gt;Nazj'vel&lt;/a&gt;, Azerite vein began to spawn all around the place. Both sides try to gather as much as possible. Delaryn gathers as much as she can and gives them to her alchemists to store away. Sylvanas adds her stash to the pile.\nAs the battle progresses at the stalemate of the &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt;. Delaryn asked adventures to guide a tree of life to inflict massive damage to the Horde. The Horde retaliates by using Goblin Hellions.\nFollowing the Burning of Teldrassil, Lor'danel remained a battlefield. Delaryn sent adventurers to heal her archers. The Horde took out a portion of their forces before nightfall to avoid their advantage.\nThe Horde forces and night elves also engaged in conflict at the &lt;a href=\"Remtravel%27s%20Excavation\"&gt;Remtravel's Excavation&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde also took &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Camp\"&gt;Blackwood Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvent.\n\"Conflict emerges in Darkshore as the Horde and Alliance battle for control over Teldrassil in this limited time event!\"\nIn-game, the War of the Thorns runs from the week of July 24 up until the launch of \"Battle for Azeroth\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth%20intro%20experience\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth intro experience&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "14096", "revid": "29688651", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14096", "title": "War of the Three Hammers", "text": "The War of the Three Hammers was a series of civil wars and conflicts, separated by a short period of peace, between the three rival &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s of the city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Originally beginning as an internal conflict to decide the ruler of Ironforge, dwarf clans &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; fought ferociously among themselves, resentful of cultural and ideological differences as well as past grievances. The conflict ultimately decided the political landscape in and around Ironforge for many centuries to come, and had major consequences for the future of the dwarf race.\nAlthough prosperous through loose partnerships with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;s to the north, the dwarf society was deeply divided. Its three clans vied for power in the political arena, with each clan possessing their own advantages in terms of resources and specialists. These problems were only further exacerbated by the old age of High King &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, who served as one of the few barriers to an all-out war. Upon Anvilmar's death around 230 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the fierce tensions that permeated the city boiled over. War subsequently broke out between the three rival clans and all of Ironforge's resources were mobilized in support of one clan or the other. The War of the Three Hammers was ultimately ignited by a failed coup.\nBloody and destructive, the war raged on for many years before finally the Bronzebeard clan, the most numerous and martial of the three, successfully drove the other two from the city, claiming it for themselves. Bitter from defeat, the Wildhammer and Dark Iron clans left the region and established their own nations nearby; the Wildhammers created &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and the Dark Irons founded their new kingdom of Thaurissan in the peaceful &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nAlthough a period of relative peace now ensued, it proved to be short-lived. Unable to come to terms with his clan's defeat, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; now prepared his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; to launch a massive, two-pronged invasion of the other two clans' respective territories, to seek revenge for the original conflict. Thaurissan himself led the assault on Ironforge, relentlessly pushing deeper into the city. Eventually, the Bronzebeards rallied and managed to drive the Dark Irons from the capital altogether. At Grim Batol, Thaurissan's wife, the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt; led the attack on the Wildhammers.\nUsing dark magics to wield shadows against her enemies, a vicious battle ensued between Modgud's forces and the surprised &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The tide turned when Modgud herself was killed in a daring counterattack, and the Dark Iron forces retreated back towards their lands. They were ultimately caught and crushed between the pursuing Wildhammers and the Bronzebeards who had now pushed Thaurissan's army back to Redridge.\nHis armies smashed and broken, Thaurissan attempted a powerful conjuration to defeat his enemies but mistakenly summoned the Firelord, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, whose arrival destroyed Thaurissan, as well as much of the surrounding landscape. With the war now over, the Wildhammers and Bronzebeards began friendly interactions, a result of having banded together during the war. Abandoning the now cursed Grim Batol, the Wildhammers settled far to the north in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the remaining Dark Irons were enslaved by the Ragnaros. Now residing in the recently-created volcano &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, they retained a fierce hatred and resentment of the other clans; one which would become relevant once more in the future with the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nA city divided.\nFor many years following its founding, the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;High King Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; thrived in the snow-covered land of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. Over the recent centuries, partnerships and trade agreements with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms to the north had filled Ironforge's coffers and made the kingdom extremely wealthy. Great and expensive wonders, such as the mighty &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Dam\"&gt;Stonewrought Dam&lt;/a&gt;, attracted visitors from as far away as Quel'Thalas, who would be awed by the architectural skill and resources involved. However, although prosperous, Ironforge was far from peaceful. Tensions simmered between the city's three powerful clans: the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt;. Though all were dwarves and all inhabited Ironforge together, they were culturally and traditionally diverse, and constantly vying for political power within the kingdom.\nThe largest of the three clans, the Bronzebeards were led by the wilful &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Thane Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. The clan, which formed the bulk of Ironforge's military and mercantile classes, considered itself the backbone of the kingdom and claimed to share distant blood relations with High Kind Modimus. The Bronzebeards themselves were tough, stubborn, and suspicious of their fellow dwarves, who they considered weaker.\nUnlike the other two clans, the Wildhammer clan preferred to inhabit the craggy hills and icy sloped outside Ironforge, and were led by &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;. They subsequently gained notoriety as adept and incredibly resilient mountaineers, for which they were proud. Considered uncouth by the Bronzebeards, the Wildhammers struggled to gain more sway with the High King and to solidify their place among the ruling elite of the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; ruled the Dark Iron clan, who inhabited the deepest and darkest corners of the subterranean city. Their long-standing practice of dabbling in sorcery, along with a penchant for secrecy and political scheming, drew the ire of the majority of Ironforge's other inhabitants. Thaurissan, however, held firm control over the kingdom's richest gem and mineral deposits, using this wealth as leverage to protect his people and secure a place in Ironforge's increasingly volatile political arena.\nCivil war.\nA member of none of the three clans, High King Modimus attempted to remain neutral in matters of government and always strove to treat each clan with fairness and respect. He was ineffective in attempting to reduce tension between the rival factions, however, and this would ultimately lead to catastrophe. Around 230 years before the first opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, High King Modimus Anvilmar passed away from old age. Before the rightful heir, Modimus' eldest son, could be crowned, the simmering cauldron of rivalry in Ironforge boiled over. Although no-one can be sure which clan struck first, the city soon fell into a state of open warfare. Each clan mobilized all of their resources and assets in an attempt to seize control of the mountain from the other two. Chaos reigned, and for years the war raged through the mighty halls and dark caverns of the once-thriving capital. Eventually, the Bronzebeard clan, using its martial expertise and large size, gained the upper hand and successfully defeated the Wildhammers and Dark Irons. The two beaten clans were driven from Ironforge, and the Bronzebeards claimed total control of the mountain and city.\nBattered and weary from the war, Khardros Wildhammer and his clan gave up on Ironforge and left for the east. Soon, they settled in the nearby region of marshlands and highlands. There, they created a new city for themselves: &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. So magnificent and well-built was the city that it soon rivalled even Ironforge in its size and prestige. Although his clan's previous defeat weighed heavily on Khardros' heart, he and his kin came to accept their lot and became content and prospered in their new home. They lost interest in claiming Ironforge and neither made nor planned any attempts to wage hostilities against the Bronzebeards in their newly-claimed city.\nMeanwhile, the Dark Irons, also badly mauled by the war in Ironforge, were forced to leave Dun Morogh and decided to venture south, to the tranquil and idyllic &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. There, in a similar fashion to the Wildhammers, they forged their own independent kingdom and constructed their own nation. Dubbed the Kingdom of Thaurissan, after their leader, they also found a great degree of prosperity in their new home. Unlike Khardros, however, Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan was far from content to simply accept his clan's failure to take Ironforge. Wallowing in humiliation and with his pride permanently damaged, Thaurissan carefully plotted the Dark Irons' eventual reconquest of the old kingdom. As well as revenge on the Bronzebeards, Thaurissan also sought retribution on the Wildhammers who, although being driven from the capital as well, still fought ferociously against the Dark Iron clan during the war.\nThaurissan's war.\nAfter years of scheming, the Sorcerer-Thane was finally ready to act. In the recent lull since arriving in Redridge, he had begun building up large forces. Among the many Dark Iron warriors and battlemages, the clan's armies also included legions of the powerful and effective &lt;a href=\"war%20golem\"&gt;war golem&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as devastating siege machines. With this new and diverse army, Thaurissan was confident that he could at least exact retribution on their dwarven cousins. The clan's plan of attack included a two-pronged invasion of both the Bronzebeard and Wildhammer territories simultaneously. The Sorcerer-Thane planned to lead one army to Ironforge himself and personally defeat the Bronzebeards, reclaiming the city. A second army led by his wife, the sorceress &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, would invade the Wildhammer's nation at the same time and seize their equally important capital of Grim Batol.\nAs planned, Thaurissan and his army marched deep into the Bronzebeard kingdom and eventually reached Ironforge itself. Using his vast siege engines and constructs, the Sorcerer-Thane struck deep into the city, forcing back the beleaguered Bronzebeard defenders. As in times past, battles raged across Ironforge's inner halls. Despite the Dark Iron's large forces, the Bronzebeard put up a stubborn and powerful defense. Only after Thaurissan had reached the very heart of the city itself was he halted. Having finally rallied his forces, Thane Madoran Bronzebeard began to push the Dark Iron clan from the city.\nAs events unfolded in Ironforge, Modgud had successfully lead her army to the Wildhammer capital and laid siege to it. The Wildhammers were surprised by this sudden assault but desperately held their ground against the invaders. Dark Iron mages and sorcerers used their dark magics to batter and break the Wildhammers' will. Led by Modgud, they brought the shadows of Grim Batol to life, transforming the bustling city into a realm of nightmare and shadow. The darkness itself began to stalk the dwarves in their own stronghold and soon began to take a major toll on the Wildhammers' strength. Desperate, Khardros Wildhammer led some of his best soldiers in a swift and brutal counterattack, which just succeeded in slaying Modgud herself. With her death, and a renewed Wildhammer resistance, the Dark Iron army fled south. Coordinating with the Wildhammer, Madoran learned of this recent development and brought his forces north. The Dark Irons were caught between the Bronzebeards and the Wildhammers; they were attacked from both sides and utterly annihilated. In the Dark Irons, Madoran and Khardros and their clans had found a common enemy and a new purpose. They promptly put aside their old rivalries and marched their mighty host southward, pledging that they would not rest until they had purged Thaurissan and his treacherous Dark Irons from the world. Soon, their armies began to converge on Dark Iron territory with no Dark Iron army large enough to oppose it.\nThe fall of the dark irons.\nAs the Bronzebeard and Wildhammer armies closed in, Thaurissan desperately scrambled for a way to salvage the situation. He ultimately decided to draw on the fiery powers from deep within the world and use them as a powerful weapon. Thus, Thaurissan wove a great spell to save his kingdom. Yet, amid the conjuration, his mind turned to the death of his wife and his recent defeats. Anger roiled through Thaurissan's heart. His rage grew so absolute that his spellwork breached the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; and tapped into a powerful being: &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, the Firelord. Unwittingly, Thaurissan ripped Ragnaros from the Elemental Plane and summoned him to the surface of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The earth began to buckle and wrench apart, as the Firelord's violent arrival sparked a series of apocalyptic explosions that instantly killed the Sorcerer-Thane and shattered the surrounding mountains. From far away, Madoran and Khardros watched in horror as the world was torn asunder and firestorms engulfed the area. They realized in that instant that Thaurissan had doomed his people. Fearing for their own safety, the Wildhammers and Bronzebeards turned around and retreated back to their lands in the north. The war had, at last, reached its conclusion.\nAftermath.\nIn the years following the War of the Three Hammers, Madoran and the Bronzebeards rebuilt the damage inflicted on Ironforge during the war. The Wildhammers, however, found that Grim Batol would forever remain uninhabitable. Upon her death, Modgud had cursed the city, permanently transforming it into a place of darkness and terror. Although the Bronzebeards offered the Wildhammers a place in Ironforge, it was little more than a conciliatory gesture. Madoran knew in his heart that Khardros was too proud to ever accept such an offer. Once again, the Khardros and the Wildhammer clan set out to create a new home for themselves and forge a new future for their people. While some Wildhammer dwarves settled in the land of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;, not far from Grim Batol, Khardros and the majority of Wildhammers ventured farther north until they reached the wooded region of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. With the terrible memories of Grim Batol still fresh in their minds, the dwarves decided to forego the usual underground dwellings of the past and instead constructed a majestic open-air city, &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. In their young city high in the mountains, the Wildhammer honed their ties to the natural world that they had possessed and treasured since their days in Ironforge. They began to actively practice &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt;, and befriended the intelligent half-lion, half-eagle &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s which called the nooks and crannies of the mountains home. Over time, the Wildhammer clan as a whole would develop an inseparable bond with these creatures, even learning to tame and ride them. These two species would become emblematic of each other and their bonds would persist even through some of the darkest wars in history.\nMadoran and Khardros, the leaders of the victorious clans, established diplomatic ties between the two healing nations. The great arches of the bridge known as the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; were constructed, both as a means to ease trade and travel between the two nations, as well as a symbol of their unity and friendship. Although rivalries and ideological differences would persist, the two leaders vowed that their clans would never take up arms against each other again. When Khardros and Madoran eventually passed away, their two sons commissioned masons to forge two great statues of the leaders. The craftsmen constructed these at the entrance to the southlands, beyond which lay the decimated territories of the Dark Iron clan. There, the statues would maintain a tireless vigil, their stony eyes ever watching over the broken domain of their nemeses. These two monuments survive to the modern day and can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Valley of Kings&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nRagnaros's rebirth had scorched and destroyed much of the Redridge Mountains; a raging volcano known as &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; now towered over the ruined Dark Iron kingdom. The smoldering wasteland south of the volcano became known as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, while the yawning chasm to the north was dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. Weakened from his summoning, Ragnaros retreated deep inside his new lair within the blistering heart of Blackrock Mountain. From this sanctum, known as the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, he went about enslaving the remaining Dark Iron dwarves. Ruined and having little choice, the dwarves obeyed their new elemental master's every order. They carved out a new fortress under the mountain and named it &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;. Within their new fiery home, the Dark Irons would nurture a permanent hatred for their cousins, who they would never forgive for the wrongs they committed against their clan and people.\nLegacy.\nThe War of the Three Hammers was one of the most significant events in shaping the future of the dwarven race. The war spread the dwarf clans out considerably and each clan would go on to play its own role in the future of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and Azeroth itself. As a token of reconciliation, &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the new lord of Ironforge, offered the then-deposed prince of the &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar%20family\"&gt;Anvilmar family&lt;/a&gt; and his descendants a permanent seat on &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge's senate&lt;/a&gt;.\nRumors persisted that when Modgud's army was crushed attempting to retreat from Grim Batol, some Dark Iron dwarves survived and managed to flee into the deepest reaches of the city itself. With Grim Batol's curse and transformation, no-one desired to hunt these dwarves and so their fate remained a mystery.\nYears later, a group of Bronzebeards was sent by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to investigate Grim Batol, headed by &lt;a href=\"Rom\"&gt;Rom&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after arriving, they had the misfortune of discovering that the long-held rumors were true; some survivors had fled here, but they little resembled dwarves now. Being constantly exposed to Modgud's dark magic for generations had warped them and their descendants into something more reptilian than humanoid, the &lt;a href=\"Skardyn\"&gt;Skardyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenturies after the war, the three dwarf clans would find themselves sharing the capital of Ironforge once again. A period of instability ensued with the return of the estranged &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Queen-Regent Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Moira Bronzebeard, who laid claim to the thrones of both the Bronzebeard clan (being the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;the previous king&lt;/a&gt;) \"and\" the Dark Iron clan (being the wife of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;the previous emperor&lt;/a&gt;). After a brief conflict, the situation settled somewhat and a new form of government was installed on Ironforge: the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. With a representative from each clan, the council's goal is to ensure that the three clans coexist peacefully. This is made greatly problematic by the feelings and resentment over the events of the War of the Three Hammers. These recent events are clear evidence that, even many years later, the war is still highly influential on dwarven society and politics.\nHowever, as time has worn on, Moira's matured as a person and grew more noble and compassionate, as has those of her clan who remained loyal to her. This didn't stop the other two clans from being suspicious of the Dark Irons. During the course of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, a single Zandalari priest was able to turn the Frostmane trolls into a significant threat due to the unwillingness of the dwarves to act, for fear that the Dark Irons would betray them while they had their attention elsewhere. The Dark Irons, ultimately, took it upon themselves to deal with the problem and helped to strengthen the ties between the three as a result. Yet, even as recently as the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; the Dark Irons were treated with distrust by other dwarves, showing that the rifts still have a ways to go before being fully healed.\nStrengths.\n&lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20elemental\"&gt;Fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s (at the very end of the war)"}

Two years ago, O'mrogg began a twelve-step plan to develop a synergy between his warring personalities.

When he emotes, he switches tables, which, when it occurs for the first time, is an effective aggro wipe, except for one person (not the tank) who is assigned a small amount of threat. Use no DoT effects or HoT, and keep the tank topped off to lower the likelihood of non-tank aggro right after a table switch. The tank should immediately attempt to gain aggro after the switch, as all DPS ceases until he has control.\nQuotes.\nO'mrogg's heads talk during the whole fight with each other:"}

The title has also been used by leaders of the Horde's offshoots and previous incarnations\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"film%20universe\"&gt;film universe&lt;/a&gt;'s .\nDuring the war with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; envisioned two groups of leaders for the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s when he united them into the Horde: the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; who shared his vision, and the publicly elected Warchief to be its puppet. On &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul took the title in the event Gul'dan should ever return. The Warchief became the title of the Horde's supreme leader, though their duties no longer included simply war.\nThe position was ultimately retired following the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, after the tenure of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was riddled with controversy in the wake of warchiefs such as &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the Horde is now led by the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;; though it is unknown if the position will be restored should the Horde go to war again.\nList of Warchiefs.\nOther Warchiefs.\nOther organizations, primarily orcish clans or offshoots of the Horde, have warchiefs as well.\nRoles of the Warchief in the Horde.\nThe Warchief of the Horde stands as the undisputed leader. The warchief holds dominion over the entire Horde. The warchief maintains the Horde, has the power to declare war for the entire Horde, take any precaution to ensure the stability and security of the Horde's member states, and has the final say in the induction of new Horde members.\nAll members of the Horde have to swear a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Oath%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;blood oath&lt;/a&gt; to join the Horde and are thus obligated to follow the warchief's commands and support the warchief in times of war if the warchief calls upon them for aid.\nThe position of warchief can be attained by having the previous warchief chose a successor or challenging the current warchief to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;: a prearranged duel with deadly weapons between two people following a formal procedure in the presence of witnesses and traditionally fought until one party yields or is killed, usually to settle a quarrel involving a point of honor. Above all else, the title warchief is granted to those who display strength and decisive action. Warchiefs must be able to gain respect via combat effectiveness and martial conquests but also have enough tact to keep the Horde united and stable.\nThe warchief may accept ambassadors and advisors from all the different tribes and members of the Horde to makes sure their voices are heard in the running of the fledgling hegemony but ultimately, only the warchief has the final say in matters concerning the entire Horde.\nBeing warchief wasn't just about being a military leader. It was also among a warchief's duty to hear petitioners about more mundane matters and to settle disputes as a neutral third party.\nPersonnel.\nThe Warchief of the Horde has several personal staff:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Over the years, he has severed both of his hands and replaced them with weapons of war, a bloody ritual unique to his clan. The joy he derives from inflicting pain on both others and himself is legendary among the orcs. As the Fel Horde's tyrannical ruler, he has channeled his ruthlessness and ferocity into forging an unstoppable army within the iron walls of Hellfire Citadel.\"\nAbilities.\nThe Warchief's Guard.\nThe Warchief's Guard come to defend Warchief Kargath Bladefist in battle.\nBasic strategy.\nNote: At the start of the fight, pairs of stealthed elite assassins (identical to the ones that attack you in the last hallway) spawn near the bottom of the stairs on both sides of his cage. These assassins will not aggro unless a player gets too close to the bottom of the stairs. Thus, it is very important for all members of the party to stay no more than two steps from the cage.\nSuggested Scatter Positioning for Blade Dance.\nIt is important for all players in the cage to spread out as much as possible to avoid multiple hits from Blade Dance. Since this happens on a regular timer, it is not difficult for melee DPS to know when the next one is coming and disengage and move away before it begins.\nHere is the positioning that we tend to use, which works very well and results in few injuries. The position of the tank also lets him grab initial aggro on adds as they run in the room to give DPS more room for burning them down.\nObjective of.\n&lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; give quests to kill Kargath and bring back his bladed fist."}

The two organizations traveling through Azeroth, sometimes hold and share information by codes and secret means.\nHistory.\nThe dwarves unearthed a series of ruins that held the key to the secrets of their lost heritage. Driven to discover the truth about his people's fabled origins, King Magni Bronzebeard ordered that the dwarves shift their industry from mining and engineering to that of archaeology. Magni helped to create the famed Explorers' Guild of Ironforge, a group utterly devoted to plumbing the secrets of the ancient world and delving out the truth of the dwarves' fabled existence.\nA branch of the League, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Expedition\"&gt;Dwarven Expedition&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was sent to scout &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the League discovered &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;.

Moreover, they spread across the world, including &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and were interested in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Explorers' League's use of explosives on the land has led to conflict with the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; and especially in the southern &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.

Unfortunately, the Explorers' League was in the area of &lt;a href=\"Thor%20Modan\"&gt;Thor Modan&lt;/a&gt;, researching the titans, when a battle between the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt;s began.

Varana had also reported to the League that the iron dwarves were serving Loken, but they didn't initially know what it meant.\nMembers of the League are highly involved with the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Explorers' League has appeared again in the areas of Azeroth, constantly rivaling with their Horde counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;, to the point where overt hostilities erupt. \nIt was initially believed that the Explorer's League would hold a major presence in the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;-related zone of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, but so far only &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; has had any visible involvement.\nThe League has since expanded, accepting &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; into their ranks and entering areas like &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Badlands, they discovered new titan ruins near &lt;a href=\"Dustwind%20Dig\"&gt;Dustwind Dig&lt;/a&gt;.\nA group of the explorers established themselves at the &lt;a href=\"Unearthed%20Grounds\"&gt;Unearthed Grounds&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but majority was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe Explorers' League serves as a survey team for while also excavating historical treasures from Pandaria. This puts them in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;, who, like the Explorers' League, are also researching Pandarian artifacts and ruins in order to learn more about the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nSome members of the league are found in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nMembers of the League can be found across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, with Brann going to a new camp every two weeks for &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Finley%20Mrrgglton\"&gt;Sir Finley Mrrgglton&lt;/a&gt; is at &lt;a href=\"Dreyrgrot\"&gt;Dreyrgrot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, investigating the &lt;a href=\"vampyr\"&gt;vampyr&lt;/a&gt; there.\nBefore the Storm.\nA team of the Explorers' League was sent to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.

The team and the Sentinels were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblins in order to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Explorer's League is present at &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; joining them. They come into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;. They also uncovered a devilsaur skeleton in &lt;a href=\"Seekers%27%20Expedition\"&gt;Seekers' Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, the league is digging through &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; ruins at &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Thovas\"&gt;Gol Thovas&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Assaults\"&gt;Assaults&lt;/a&gt; have started, members of the League appeared at &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; to help &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20Accord\"&gt;Uldum Accord&lt;/a&gt; against the forces of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, and they can be found in &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Maker%27s%20Ascent\"&gt;Maker's Ascent&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the league is still present and active on an &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League%20Digsite\"&gt;excavation site&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, but also in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, more precisely in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, where they continue to unearth the ruins in search of ancient treasures. The league still has a good relationship with the , which leads the &lt;a href=\"High%20Explorer%20Muninn%20Magellas\"&gt;High Explorer Muninn Magellas&lt;/a&gt; to hide precious missives in a cache under the carpet at the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Explorers\"&gt;Hall of Explorers&lt;/a&gt; for the agents of the SI:7.\nEven after the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, several maddened former members of the League are found inside the &lt;a href=\"Whisper%20Gulch\"&gt;Whisper Gulch&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nWith the re-emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, at the behest of the Alliance, the Explorer's League worked alongside the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their joint-mission, rivalries between the Explorer's League and Reliquary endured. However, members of both factions worked together on uncovering various secrets and artifacts across the island.\nCulture.\nDiscoveries and beliefs.\nSome of the dwarves believe that &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s are descended from &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s such as an extinct type of raptor that had &lt;a href=\"Feathered%20Raptor%20Arm\"&gt;feathered arms&lt;/a&gt;. The feathers suggest some kind of missing link between the two different kinds of animals.\nOrganization.\nThe League has an academy in Ironforge and holds annual conferences.\nThe Explorer's League has long used a variety of gadgets to bypass locks, traps, and other mechanisms.\nFor every artifact the League finds, there are six forms to fill out.\nCamps and digsites.\n\"Note: This list may be incomplete.\"\nItems.\nSome NPCs are seen sporting an Explorers' League &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Expedition%20Commander\"&gt;Expedition Commander&lt;/a&gt; and his crew or &lt;a href=\"Surveyor%20Daltry\"&gt;Surveyor Daltry&lt;/a&gt;, but the tabard isn't accessible to adventurers.\nReputation.\nReputation description.\n\"This organization seeks to find the origin of the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; race by collecting &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts. Their most recent research has led them to various archeological sites in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nGuide.\nPrior to \"\", the Explorers' League existed as a pseudo-faction in that there were many NPCs related by quest chains tagged as &lt;Explorers' League&gt;, but there was no &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; unique to them (if their quests rewarded reputation, it was for another faction, typically &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;).\nSince the launch of \"Wrath of the Lich King\", it is now finally possible to earn reputation for the Explorers' League. However, as for all &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; subfactions except &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;The Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, there is no quartermaster and no other gain for hitting exalted (except maybe for achievement purposes).\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3\"&gt;patch 3.3&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; factions receive spillover rep from quests and 5-man dungeons. This negates the need for solely doing Explorer's League dailies to reach exalted.\nPlayers start with 0/3000 and can gain reputation by completing quests in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; and by doing one daily quest at &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Gate\"&gt;Steel Gate&lt;/a&gt;. All non-repeatable quests together give 7850 reputation. To hit exalted, one needs to complete the daily quest at least 137 times (122 times for humans).\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe Explorer's League, here syntactically rendered the \"League of Explorers,\" is the main focus of the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" . The adventure follows four members of the League, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elise%20Starseeker\"&gt;Elise Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reno%20Jackson\"&gt;Reno Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Finley%20Mrrgglton\"&gt;Sir Finley Mrrgglton&lt;/a&gt;, as they collect the pieces of a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Staff of Origination&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the \"League of Explorers\" expansion, Brann, Elise, Reno, and Sir Finley would go on to become prominent reoccurring characters in Hearthstone. They were the main heroes of the across both the \"Saviors of Uldum\" and \"Descent of Dragons\" expansions. They have also appeared individually in both the Battlegrounds and Mercenaries game modes. \nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nIn the RPG books, this faction is known as Explorer's Guild, The Guild, Explorer's League, or Explorers' League.\nExploring nearly every corner of the world. Searching for &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts. Amassing one of the world's largest libraries of information on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history, people and cultures. When it was first discovered that the origins of the dwarven people might be tied to the ancient and mysterious titans, expeditions were quickly organized to search for artifacts and information that might confirm the theory. The first of these expeditions were led by hardy dwarven prospectors accustomed to long treks in unforgiving territory. As they taught their skills to the new generation of journeymen, a new breed of dwarven traveler emerged. These travelers appointed themselves the task of gathering as much information as possible about the world, its history, and its cultures in hopes of finding the scraps of information the titans might have left behind to lead their progeny to the truth. Though they often still called themselves \"&lt;a href=\"prospector\"&gt;prospector&lt;/a&gt;s\", they gathered together under the banner of their true calling: the Explorers' Guild.\nIn less than a decade, the Explorers' Guild has already amassed an incredible archive of information and artifacts in their guildhall close to the dwarven throne in Ironforge. The tales brought back by the members of the Guild have ignited the\nimaginations of the dwarven nation, and children who once dreamed of carrying a blunderbuss into battle or piloting a &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt; now play at exploring in the caverns near their home. Though many of them think the dwarves' obsession with the titans verges on the ridiculous, the soldiers and diplomats of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are happy to support the efforts of the Explorers' Guild so long as it continues to provide useful news from distant and unexplored places. In addition to the cultural and geographic intelligence it gathers, information provided by the Guild has allowed the Alliance to produce a map of more than 400 untapped gold mines across &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for an eventual move north to battle the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\nNew members of the Explorers' Guild spend their early days honing their skills close to home, guiding travelers through the peaks and passes of Khaz Modan and leading supply expeditions for the dwarven kingdoms. Once they've proved themselves, these \"prospectors\" are upgraded to \"journeyman\" status and given their first field missions by the Guild. Often, these missions involve traveling to remote but previously visited locales in order to update the Guild's library with news of current events in the area. Eventually, the journeymen are upgraded to full Explorer status and given carte blanche to travel where they will with full Guild support, provided that they produce regular reports on their excursions.\nThe dwarven king is the official head of the Explorer's Guild, though the title is mostly honorary \u2014 only once in Guild history has the king filed a report in the Archives. The daily operation of the Guild is overseen by the Excursion Council, made up of several dozen of the oldest and most experienced members of the Guild. The younger members of the Guild have nicknamed this group the \u201cExcuse Me Council,\u201d as many of the Council are constantly leaving behind their duties to set off on their own self-assigned journeys. Yet so long as a small fraction of the Council remains in Ironforge to coordinate outgoing and incoming Guild expeditions, the organization continues to run smoothly.\nLocations.\nFor many years, members of the Guild met in the &lt;a href=\"Weary%20Boots%20Tavern\"&gt;Weary Boots Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in Ironforge, storing their reports and retrieved artifacts on sagging wooden shelves in a disused warehouse. Several years ago, treasure gathered by the Guild was combined with a bequest from the throne to pay for a new block of chambers to be carved out of the rock of the dwarven capital. The newly completed Guildhall provides members with offices and meeting rooms, workshops to repair gear and equipment, warehouses and libraries, private quarters for higher-ranking members and group bunkrooms for newer initiates. A large &lt;a href=\"Library%20%28Ironforge%29\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt; open to the public shows exhibits of relics collected by the Guild; when titan artifacts are on display, the line to get into the museum often snakes out the entrance of the Guildhall and across the public square in front of the building. Smaller guildhalls, called \u201cway stations\u201d, are being established in far-flung corners of Azeroth, usually in the back rooms of inns or taverns along well-traveled routes to distant parts of the continent. Though they still vary in the level of service they can offer, some way stations can provide detailed maps of the local area while others stockpile supplies of dried foods and basic traveling necessities that can be drawn upon by Guild members (who are expected to pay for their withdrawals of Guild property whenever possible).\nMembership.\nThe overwhelming majority of members in the Explorer's Guild are dwarves. Fewer than a dozen members of other races are inducted into the ranks each year, usually after providing exemplary service to the Guild on several official expeditions.\nA green torch burning at the entrance to the Guildhall in Ironforge marks the rare occasions when the Guild is accepting new applicants, a call usually answered by hundreds of young dwarves who can demonstrate the requisite skill with languages and a broad base of geographic and historical knowledge. For each opening, twenty top potentials are selected and taken into the mountains of Khaz Modan by one of the Excursion Council. What follows is an intensive three-week trial that tests not only the potentials' physical ability and stamina but also a wide range of skills from map making and tracking to herbalism and mineral location. At the end of the test period, the applicants who come out on top are inducted into the Guild and officially allowed to call themselves prospectors. \nMembership in the Guild is selective, as each member receives a stipend from the Guild of two gold pieces per day, rising to five gold pieces when on a sanctioned expedition. In addition, the Guild stores will completely outfit any official expedition with supplies and equipment \u2014 though the quartermasters are notoriously stingy when arguing the definition of \"completely outfit\". All Guild members can also make their home at the Guildhall in Ironforge, though when all the private quarters are taken up by higher-ranking members of the Guild (as during the annual Convocation, when the Guild gathers to share stories and plan expeditions for the coming year), even full-fledged explorers can find themselves sleeping in the fifth slot up in the bunkhouse. Guild members come from all walks of life, their skills contributing to the goals of the Guild and the dwarven people. For some, however, exploration becomes more than a profession \u2014 it becomes an avocation and a passion. The members of the Explorers' League are spread across the globe at various key digsites and expeditions.\nLeaders.\n was the Grand Explorer of the Guild, a position of honorary leadership.\n&lt;a href=\"Samul%20Strangehands\"&gt;Samul Strangehands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryona%20Blondbeard\"&gt;Ryona Blondbeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hona%20Stonefall\"&gt;Hona Stonefall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yulanini%20Hammersmith\"&gt;Yulanini Hammersmith&lt;/a&gt;."}

Bring up the exploding sheep incident of the war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in any tavern in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s there roar with laughter and buy you a drink, each desiring to tell his or her own version of the story.\nThe tales differ, but most agree that after the Burning Legion had invaded the plague-ridden &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, most people were dead, undead or fled. One, a goblin tinker merchant traveling through the town, started making mechanical animals to distract any Burning Legion demons so that he could make his slow and panicked way south. One of these devices was cobbled together from wool, wood and some primitive clockwork. On a whim, he decided to fill it full of explosives and have it totter towards the demons. When it exploded, he decided, he would flee in the chaos that followed.\nHe didn\u2019t expect a demon, a dim-witted &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;, to pick up the sheep and inspect it. He damned himself for outfitting it with a timer and not a remote, but he nearly squealed with glee with the curious demon popped the treat into its mouth. The resulting explosion of demon parts was definitely enough for the &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt; to get away, laughing so hard he nearly gave himself away.\nNow the mechanical sheep has a bit more thought \u2014 and a lot more explosives \u2014 put into it. The goblins mainly make them to amuse themselves, giving their enemies a moment of confusion before death, but they are powerful explosives in their own right.\nSource.\nThis item is created with &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (150); taught by trainers."}

In \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" he, unlike the rest of other dragonkin, can still be seen as a rare mob.\nIn the RPG.\nGeneral Colbatann is a powerful male Blue &lt;a href=\"Dragonspawn\"&gt;Dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, who guards the true stronghold of the blue dragons in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of the matron &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt;. He is highly intelligent and diplomatic, and is one of the most renowned heroes of the blue dragonspawn. He serves as the leader of their military forces in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Colbatann focuses on the protection of the dragon eggs, which are being stolen by the blacks for some evil purpose. Periodic conflicts occur between the forces of the sorcerer-dragon Colbatann and the night elves.\nThis blue dragonspawn is a majestic figure, his massive frame covered from head to clawed feet in shining mithril scale armor dotted with glowing blue runes. The greatsword he carries resembles a jagged shard of ice, and his flowing white and blue cloak a rift of snow. General Colbatann is a proud warrior, as well as a cunning tactician and kind-hearted soul. His goal is to eradicate the black dragonflight from the world, but for now, he settles for using his ever-growing army of blue dragons and blue dragonspawn to protect those who require shelter from the evil dragons. He is one of few dragonspawn intelligent and diplomatic enough that, rather than serving a dragon as most do, he is a leader for the blue dragonflight. Colbatann works closely with the blue dragon matron Haleh, and together they plan to strike against &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. In combat, Colbatann is usually in a commanding role, and he uses his spells to wear down enemies from a distance, typically beginning with his lowest-level spells to test his enemies\u2019 defenses. If participating in a battle between two large groups, he finds a good place to cast blizzard. If forced into single combat, he keeps his distance long enough to use frost bolt and frost nova to slow his enemy, then protective spells such as mana shield and protection from evil before entering melee."}

From the pinnacle of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, he oversaw his forces in their war to drive out the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; from the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Drakkisath can be found in his throne room behind the Halls of Ascension in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis personal weapon was &lt;a href=\"Blackblade%20of%20Shahram\"&gt;Blackblade of Shahram&lt;/a&gt;, which could be looted on his body.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"A cunning and ruthless strategist, Drakkisath commands Nefarian's armies in the war with &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. After securing victories against the Dark Irons, General Drakkisath's forces are positioned to drive the dwarves out of Blackrock Mountain once and for all.\"\nStrategy.\nDrakkisath is flanked by his two &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Elite%20Guard\"&gt;Chromatic Elite Guard&lt;/a&gt;s. The party's best chance of success is to engage the guards first, eliminating them while Drakkisath is lured away, or \"&lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;d\". To this end, a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; (or any other class that can lose &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; suddenly, such as a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; or a frost &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;) can be used to gain Drakkisath's notice and drag him across the bridge back to the Beast's lair or Rend's room. Generally speaking, by the time the hunter has done this the General's guards will be dead. The hunter can then &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; (or perish) and when the General returns, it's best to have two &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;ing classes engage him. Drakkisath's Conflagration attack will cause the victim to become confused and run about in circles all the while dealing &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage to nearby party members. This last 6 seconds and deals roughly 3,000 damage to the target. While this effect is in place, the General will turn on the next player highest on his hate list. If two tanks are utilized, there is less of a chance that the General will chase after a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; or mage, or similar class who will fold under his attack. Once the conflagration effect wears off the main tank, they can go back to work gaining aggro and trying to attain second place on the General's hate list as he most likely will conflagrate the second tank. The tanks can trade off aggro in this fashion while the rest of the party whittles the General down. Because of the AoE effect of the Conflagration attack and the General's breath weapon, it's important for the tank to turn the General away from the rest of the party and to maintain some distance from them as well.\nHunter strategy to kiting Drakkisath.\nA hunter can kite Drakkisath by enabling &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Aspect of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt;ing him with &lt;a href=\"Distracting%20Shot\"&gt;Distracting Shot&lt;/a&gt;. Another distracting shot may be fired once the hunter reaches the end of the bridge. It will take a second for Drakkisath to come into range, so the hunter should wait and spam distracting shot until Drakkisath is in range. Afterwards, the hunter should run all the way to Rend's room and feign death once Drakkisath catches up. The hunter can then follow Drakkisath back to the group. By then, both guards should be dead and the group can kill Drakkisath. (Note: There are other ways and other places to kite Drakkisath, but Rend's room seems a good place. The Beast's room has fire, which will daze the hunter if Aspect of the Cheetah is left on.)\nShould the party feel confident in the number of tanking classes and healers they have at their disposal, they can simply attack all three simultaneously. Killing the guards first as they are easily downed, and then focusing on Drakkisath.\nObjective of.\nIf you are attempting to complete the quest of attunement to &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, you must touch the orb located behind General Drakkisath. (He does not have to be dead, but this requires several seconds of uninterrupted cast time.) \nIn the RPG.\nDrakkisath's ultimate goal is to drive his army into the depths in a climactic battle against &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;, all in the name of his master Nefarian. Drakkisath is well known for his ruthlessness and total lack of quarter in combat. He shows no mercy and expects none in return. Although quite clearly evil, he commands respect from his troops, primarily because when he gives his word he keeps it. This giant, scaly, four-legged dragonspawn is a mottled orange with dark red and brown stripes. He bears a large banner on his back, wears immaculate plate armor, and carries a scimitar.\nDrakkisath would prefer to lead his armies directly, but understands his own importance and doesn\u2019t risk his life in meaningless encounters. Drakkisath has a handful of special attacks and special qualities that set him apart from others of his kind, all granted to him by his draconic lords. If forced to join the fray, he maneuvers to a position where his flame burst ability won\u2019t affect any allies (of course he knows full well that red dragons and other red wyrmkin are immune to fire) and then lets loose with repeated blasts until his enemies are reduced to ash. He targets particularly troublesome foes with black conflagration. Drakkisath can call upon eldritch powers granted by his master, causing a single foe within thirty feet to burst into flames.\nDrakkisath is a cruel, mighty warrior and is responsible for the deaths of thousands. He is a clever fighter, well-trained and organized. He knows how best to use his unit, and he knows the capacity of each individual in his army. Drakkisath is always guarded by two of his best warriors.\nLike all &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, he uses his skills, powers, and equipment toward the same end: to protect the dragonflight of his patron and its fellow dragonspawn."}

He earned his place after the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; crushed &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt; to dust, and so he does not like them.\nBackground.\nA decorated &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury&lt;/a&gt; soldier, Jakra'zet joined the coalition of forces under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; campaign. Despite the outcome of the campaign, Jakra'zet's skill in strategy and tactics could not be denied. Eventually, the great Prophet Zul petitioned to promote Jakra'zet to the role of general. Of the Zanchuli Council, &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27kaal\"&gt;Vol'kaal&lt;/a&gt; voted with Zul for the appointment. &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Raal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Loti&lt;/a&gt; objected, but they were overruled by &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, who was curious at what Jakra'zet could accomplish. And thus, Jakra'zet became the first of the Sandfury Tribe to hold the rank of General of the Zandalari army. Jakra'zet holds a great hatred for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, holding them responsible for the Sandfury tribe's downfall. He counselled against Rastakhan granting the Horde a place of honor within Zuldazar, eager instead to execute their representative himself, but was overruled.\n&lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; suspected that Jakra'zet plotted something in the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;. Jakra'zet oversaw the exile of many Zandalari to Vol'dun, including his personal chef, &lt;a href=\"Sezahjin\"&gt;Sezahjin&lt;/a&gt;, who was banished to the desert for cooking a meal that made the general ill. Jakra'zet also exiled any trolls who questioned his actions, including &lt;a href=\"Warguard%20Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt;, who came close to proving that Jakra'zet was a traitor to the crown. The general subsequently also hired &lt;a href=\"Grozztok%20the%20Blackheart\"&gt;Grozztok the Blackheart&lt;/a&gt; and sent assassins to the desert in order to slaughter the exiles. Those who distrusted the general were justified: in truth, Jakra'zet and his Sandfury trolls had struck up an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; emperor &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt;, and together they plotted to unleash the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; from his tomb of &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and use him as a weapon to conquer Zandalar and, eventually, all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. However, they first had to obtain the three keystones required to break the magical barrier around Atul'Aman.\nBefore long, Warguard Rakera's subordinate &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt; and her companions \u2014 including the Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 ventured into Vol'dun to search for Rakera. At the time, Jakra'zet was conversing with Emperor Korthek, telling him that they needed to speed things up as King Rastakhan had received \"nosey visitors\". When Jakra'zet noticed the &lt;a href=\"pterrordax\"&gt;pterrordax&lt;/a&gt; mounts of Kaja and her companions passing overhead, Korthek conjured lightning magic that blasted two of the intruders from the sky.\nLater, the adventurer encountered Jakra'zet and Grozztok at Atul'Aman, where they were apparently trying to find a way into the pyramid. When Jakra'zet noticed the trespasser, he ordered Grozztok to kill them and then teleported away.\nEventually, the adventurer, Kaja, and Rakera retrieved one of the three keystones and found allies in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;group of sethrak&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;, who held another of the keys. While Kaja and Rakera stayed behind to guard the two keystones at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer worked with Vorrik and Vol'dun's &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; to assault the Faithless sethrak's stronghold and eventually kill Emperor Korthek himself. Meanwhile, however, Jakra'zet \u2014 who had already been given Korthek's key \u2014 assaulted the Sanctuary of the Devoted and stole the remaining two keystones, meaning that he now had everything he needed to break the seal on Atul'Aman. Kaja and Rakera hurried after the general into the great pyramid to prevent him from resurrecting Mythrax and were soon joined by Vorrik and the adventurer. Together, the four went to confront Jakra'zet at the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Font\"&gt;Blood Font&lt;/a&gt;, where he was in the process of conducting &lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;a blood ritual&lt;/a&gt; to raise Mythrax from the dead. During the battle, Jakra'zet incapacitated one of the adventurer's companions after the other, but was eventually mortally wounded by the hero. Rakera told Kaja to give the general a clean death, but before she had a chance to do so, a triumphant Jakra'zet jumped into the nearby pit, killing himself and thus performing the final blood sacrifice needed to resurrect Mythrax.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nI don't care what deal ya think to barter from da King and his daughter. Know that ya not welcome in Zuldazar.\nAnd while da Princess may have a lot of authority, she not be queen yet.\nUntil then, da real power of Zuldazar lay with me and da Zanchuli Council.\nSpeculation.\nJakra'zet says that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; laid waste to his people. This could refer to potential adventurers of the Horde who might have raided either &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;."}

The encounter with Nazgrim involves dealing with his various &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;-powered abilities as a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and the Kor'kron adds he summons. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Once a &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt; in service of the former warchief, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, General Nazgrim rose quickly through the ranks after overwhelming victories in Grizzly Hills and sunken city of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. Fiercely loyal to the Horde and bound by a rigorous code of honor and duty, Nazgrim will hold the line for his warchief until his dying breath.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"The decision to include Nazgrim as a raid boss was a controversial one\u2014Horde players have seen him rise through the ranks from Sergeant, to Legionnaire, and now to General. Unlike many of our Raid bosses, he is not necessarily wicked, but he is a soldier whose loyalty to Orgrimmar leaves him no choice but to defend its walls. Of course, the Alliance likely has a different perspective on just how \u201cnoble\u201d his past actions have been. . . .\"\nOverview.\nGeneral Nazgrim is a powerful warrior who builds Rage by damaging players with various abilities, and periodically spends that Rage to unleash powerful attacks. Throughout the encounter, mixed groups of three Kor'kron troops at a time stream in to assist their General.\nStrategy.\nNazgrim is an add management fight with a high emphasis on execution -- even minor mistakes in executing the encounter can snowball into a wipe.\nHandling adds.\nNazgrim will pull with a large group of Orgrimmar Faithful, but these adds have low health and only weak melee attacks. These adds should be AoE-ed down at the pull.\nFor the rest of the fight, Nazgrim will periodically summon two adds. These will be randomly selected from four types of adds, and no summon will have more than one type of add. In order of priority, the adds that can be summoned are:\nHandling Nazgrim.\nNazgrim cycles through three stances on a one-minute timer in the same order. Battle Stance simply causes Nazgrim to generate 1 Rage each second. Beserker Stance loses the 1 Rage per second generation, but causes him to do 25% increased damage (though he will also take 25% increased damage as well) and causes all his other Rage generating abilities to generate double Rage.\nThe third stance, Defensive Stance, is worthy of special mention. Nazgrim will take 10% reduced damage, and will gain 3 Rage for each attack made to him, except for tanks debuffed with Sundering Blow. Since success in this encounter will come through keeping Nazgrim's Rage bar as low as possible, it is extremely important for the raid not to DPS Nazgrim at all during Defensive Stance (except for debuffed tanks), even if there are no adds present at the time (this is the reason for the raid wanting to keep as many Ironblades as the raid can comfortably handle alive until this point).\nNazgrim has two standard abilities. The aforementioned Sundering Blow is a tank debuff that additionally causes Nazgrim to unavoidably gain Rage (more Rage depending on how many stacks of Sundering Blow the tank already has); tanks will need to perform a standard tank swap to deal with this. Bonecracker places a bleed effect on players and reduces their maximum health; healers will just need to keep these targets alive until the debuff expires.\nThe remainder of Nazgrim's abilities cost Rage to use. He will use one Rage ability every 15 seconds (this can be tracked through his Cooling Off debuff), and will always use the most expensive one he can afford. The abilities he can use are:\nFinal 10% burn.\nThe final 10% of the fight can be extremely problematic, as Nazgrim will overwhelm the raid with adds if not defeated quickly.\nA strategy for dealing with this is:\nAchievement: Gamon Will Save Us!\nTo begin with, one raid member should free &lt;a href=\"Gamon\"&gt;Gamon&lt;/a&gt; from the tree that he is tied to, on the Demolisher trash preceeding the raid's descent into the Cleft of Shadow on their way to Nazgrim.\nOn the actual fight, earning &lt;a href=\"Gamon%20Will%20Save%20Us%21\"&gt;Gamon Will Save Us!&lt;/a&gt; is a reward for doing the fight \"properly\", and requires that the raid handles Nazgrim's Rage perfectly. Two casts of War Song will kill Gamon, and so will any Ravager weapons that wander into Gamon's vicinity. It is however possible to heal Gamon, and additionally, it has been reported that the raid can skip the warlock trash causing Gamon to remain behind there.\nAn important note is that, much like the &lt;a href=\"Only%20the%20Penitent...\"&gt;Only the Penitent...&lt;/a&gt; achievement in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, the raid only has one chance per raid lockout.

Victory is the only honor he seeks, and Pa'valak will not tolerate failure should his minions fall short of their goal.\"\nStrategy.\nGeneral Pa'valak will throw his weapon at a random party member and then charge after it. Move away from the weapon and move out of his charging path.\nHe casts Tempest which deals nature damage and negates the first 30.000 healing done. It's impossible to avoid so as a healer you need to be aware of this.\nPa'valak casts a shield over himself at 65% and 35% health. Bombs fall down and adds spawn. The shield absorbs 1.000.000 dmg. \nDPS should use the bombs to get the shield down, tank may use extra bombs for adds. Bombs arm themselves after 3 seconds and explode after another 3 seconds. Either use all the bombs or make sure to move away from them.\nTrivia.\nPa'valak is voiced by &lt;a href=\"David%20Blue\"&gt;David Blue&lt;/a&gt;."}

During the war, he clashed with &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;Valstann Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; forces, and later personally executed Valstann by ripping him in two with his claws.\nAbilities.\nThis is not a traditional fight. Before you actually fight Rajaxx, you must defeat an entourage of his War ranks, each with a pack of mobs. Each wave consists of an Officer, and a varying mix of &lt;a href=\"Swarmguard%20Needler\"&gt;Swarmguard Needler&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Qiraji%20Warrior\"&gt;Qiraji Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. There are seven waves before Rajaxx:\nWave 1: Center - \nWave 2: Left side - \nWave 3: Right side - \nWave 4: Further left - \nWave 5: Further right - \nWave 6: Deep left side - \nWave 7: Deep right side - \nGeneral Rajaxx - \nWeaknesses.\nSwarmguard Needlers and Qiraji Warriors can be frozen, feared, rooted, and stunned.\nTaking advantage of these crowd control methods can allow a raid to divide or disable the enemy for easier handling.\nFor example, a raid may disable or delay Qiraji Warriors while the deadly but fragile Swarmguard Needlers are eliminated, as well as allowing a raid to quickly kill sub-bosses with particularly dangerous abilities such as Tuubid and Drenn.\nStrategy.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Kurinnaxx\"&gt;Kurinnaxx&lt;/a&gt; is dead, 5 NPCs will spawn: &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20General%20Andorov\"&gt;Lieutenant General Andorov&lt;/a&gt; and 4 &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Elite\"&gt;Kaldorei Elite&lt;/a&gt;. These NPCs will aid you in the battle to and against Rajaxx, so make sure you keep them alive. They can be healed and given an Earth Shield. You can also buff them with single paladin buffs. Once you talk to Andorov, the encounter will begin. \nAndorov will passively heal the raid every 3s via Aura of Command, while increasing the casting speed and attack power of anyone who is Neutral or higher with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; by 10%.\nOn every waves, CC the adds and kill the officer as soon as possible. Once the officer is dead, slowly finish off the rest of the adds. This is especially crucial on the 2nd wave, as Tuubid will mark a single target causing all the adds to aggro on that target.\nFear prevention measure must be taken to counter Qeez's AoE fear. The tank must be careful on Drenn, as his hurricane ability can deal significant damage towards Andorov. The tank must move him away if this happens to get Andorov out of the hurricane. Pakkon should be tanked towards the wall, facing away from the raid as to mitigate Sweeping Slam. Zerran's enlarge must be dispelled.\nRajaxx will appear after all 7 waves are cleared. The raid must positioned themselves near the wall as to mitigate the knockback effect of Thundercrash. It has a minimum of 100 nature damage. The tank must be quick to get aggro after. If Andorov is alive, he'll heal the raid(except the tank) above the threshold for instant kill. If Andorov is dead, the healers must keep everyone healthy.\nRajaxx may also drop aggro on his current target. The tank must quickly pull aggro off Rajaxx when this happen. If Andorov is dead, then an offtank must be ready to get aggro whenever this aggro drop occur.\nIf the NPCs are still up once you've killed Rajaxx, you can wait a few minutes and they will despawn and give you 150 reputation with Cenarion Hold. You can also pull mobs to them and let them take care of business while you wait for them to despawn.\nReward.\nReputation:"}

The malignant ones are purple and always spawn on the left side when you are facing him. There will only be one malignant trogg alive at any given time. If the malignant trogg is &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20control\"&gt;CC'd&lt;/a&gt;, the next summon will only have 3 trogg dwellers.\nThe Malignant Troggs apply a stacking debuff on their melee target. It also has the curse Modgud's Malady. If it is killed near another trogg or the boss, it will spread the disease to other Troggs or Umbriss, and enrage them. Therefore it must be killed away from other troggs and the boss. Alternatively, it could be CC'd throughout the entire fight. To complete the achievement &lt;a href=\"Umbrage%20for%20Umbriss\"&gt;Umbrage for Umbriss&lt;/a&gt;, the malignant trogg should be CCed, and then released at around 10-15% and brought to the boss (either by a high threat DPS, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt;, or a tank taunt) and killed.\nTank and melee must be careful to avoid Ground Siege. It's a front &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;, and Umbriss does not move while casting, so it is very easy to dodge.\nHealer needs to watch for Bleeding Wounds on tank, and heal the tank to at least 90% to prevent the &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; from doing any extra damage.\nRanged damage dealers and healer need to watch for Blitz being cast on them, and move away if it is. This functions similarly to the charge stun from &lt;a href=\"Icehowl\"&gt;Icehowl&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusader's Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, charging the previous location of the targeted player. When the ability is announced, the targeted player should quickly move away (and out of the route of General Umbriss). Any player can be damaged or killed by this ability, so all players near the targeted player must also move. Cloth wearers can potentially be one-shotted by this ability.\nAt about 30%, Umbriss enrages (Frenzy). A hunter may use &lt;a href=\"Tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;Tranquilizing Shot&lt;/a&gt; to remove it. Otherwise everyone should use any cooldowns left and burn him down before the damage on the tank overwhelms the healer. Alternatively, he may be kited.\nAs a final note to &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;skinners&lt;/a&gt;, he can be skinned, but this requires 530 skill. Presuming you have maxed your skill at 525 and are not a &lt;a href=\"Flayer\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, you will need a glove enchant, and either &lt;a href=\"Pip%27s%20Skinner\"&gt;Pip's Skinner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Zulian%20Slasher\"&gt;Zulian Slasher&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Zulian%20Slicer\"&gt;Zulian Slicer&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Mana-based classes will have to deal with a lock on their regen, but will be able to restore it by destroying crystals that drop a residue on the floor.

One of their mightiest commanders, General Vezax, guards the twisted passages leading to the Prison of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-saron\"&gt;Yogg-saron&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOverview.\nGeneral Vezax inflicts all healers with Aura of Despair, removing all mana regeneration. Mana can be restored by utilizing the Saronite Vapors that coalesce on the ground in the area.\nAbilities.\nSaronite Vapors.\nSaronite Vapors periodically coalesce in the area.\nHard Mode.\nSix Saronite Vapors will coalesce into a Saronite Animus and General Vezax will gain Saronite Barrier.\nStrategy.\nBefore pulling, assign casters in circle around General Vezax at a fair distance of each other in order to avoid spreading the Mark of the Faceless and too many (unreactive) people being hit by a Shadow Crash.\nWhen the tank pulls, all healers must come in melee range of the boss (&lt; 15 yards), in order not be concerned by the Mark of the Faceless and to leave the greatest space to the casters.\nSearing Flames must always be interupted when General Vezax starts casting it.\nWhen General Vezax casts Surge of darkness, the tank can stay where he stands, since Vezax's damages are healable.\nAfter every Surge of darkness, a melee or unoccupied ranged dps should go to kill the closest Saronite Vapor. All healers stand in until they have 6-7 debuffs, then step out. If that first regen is not enough, they can step in the vapor for another 6-7 debuffs (once the first 6-7 debuffs have ticked off).\nIf the next Saronite Vapor is not near the boss, the tank will have to move toward it. All the raid must proceed very carefully (healer and melee still in the 15 yards) and casters still spaced from one another.\nDue to the use of the Energy Field left by a Shadow Crash, casters are less likely to have the need of a Saronite Vapor until the fourth or fifth Surge of darkness. When they will need it, while coming in melee range, they must be carefull not to be afflicted by a Mark of the Faceless. As long as DPS watch the aggro list, they can do damage continuously (the General is not tauntable, so overhauling the tank will usually result in the death of the careless DPS player and possibly the entire raid).\nWhen a Shadow Crash heads toward a caster, he must move to avoid the AoE and then come back to stand in. In order to avoid spreading the Mark of the Faceless, only the caster targeted by a Shadow Crash should stand in it.\nIn order to save mana, casters would be advised to DPS only when they stand in the Energy Field left by a Shadow Crash. While this can be frustrating, this is the safer way to save the Saronite Vapors for the healers' need, besides the 10 minutes enrage allows to do it safely.\nAlso of note are Lifebloom and Power Word:Shield in conjunction with Shadow Crash puddles; since Power Word:Shield is an absorption effect, the absorbed amount is not reduced by Shadow Crash puddles but the mana cost is. Lifebloom's healing is reduced by the shadow crash puddles; however it is possible to regain mana when the stacks bloom if they were initially cast in a Shadow Crash puddle. It is worthwhile to note that Lifebloom blooms do restore less mana than usual to the casting druid.\n\"Notes:\"\nElite mode.\nTo successfully perform this elite mode, players must fight Vezax for long enough without using six Saronite Vapors that spawn, defeat the Saronite Animus that spawns, and then kill Vezax. To help somewhat with mana regen, a raid can stock up on , or alternatively . Ranged DPS will have to spare their mana for when they are on a shadow crash puddle to maximize the damage they can get with it. Aim towards getting General Vezax's health as low as possible without actually killing him. (Below 8,000,000 is doable). With higher levels of gear, it's entirely possible to kill Vezax BEFORE the Animus spawns - if this happens, the group will not be awarded achievements, and no elite mode loot will drop.\nThe animus spawns at Vezax's starting position and must be picked up immediately by the offtank and kept in place so that melee does not have to move when switching targets at all. It will spam profound darkness every two seconds and melees for just about as much as Vezax without the periodic enrage) All DPS must switch to the Animus and kill it as quickly as possible. If the raid takes too long, Profound Darkness will eventually outdamage any possible healing and wipe the raid. Shadow Crashes will one-shot anybody that gets hit by them so do not lose focus. Since the fight has been patched, Vezax no longer casts searing flames while the animus is up.\nVezax will regain some health from Mark of the Faceless, so one player has to reapply a healing debuff onto him to minimize it such as an &lt;a href=\"Arms\"&gt;Arms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Combat\"&gt;Combat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; on their main hand. (Wound Poison \"does\" proc on a &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt;)\nAfter the animus is dead, the stacks will still be applied and all that is left to be done is finish the home stretch of Vezax's health. Keep in mind that the Profound Darkness debuff is still applied and Shadow Crashes will kill anybody that does not avoid them. The hard part of the achievement is done so long as nobody in the raid does something foolish to cause a wipe.\nRelated achievements.\nThe following achievements are for the encounter's elite mode.\nQuotes.\nSound Files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0General%20Vezax\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: General Vezax&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:C'Thraxxi]]\n[[Category:Ulduar mobs]]\n[[Category:Bosses]]\n[[Category:Hearthstone legendary cards]]"}

The easiest way is to have your main tank tank the boss where he stands. Have all dps fall into the hole literally as close to the boss as their class allows. The offtank will only stand about 5 feet from the furthest out dps and let the adds virtually walk to him as the current a.i. will actually make them walk the offtank for some reason(Do not know if this is a glitch or intended reaction). All healers focus on main tank (Since he will be staying at 5 stacks of the armor debuff for a significant amount of time.) and just toss a few heals here and there on the off tank.\nNote: A Zerg requires great healers or a warrior or rogue to disarm, to keep the damage on the main tank lower.\nNote: Boss must be tanked in his cliff area. He will vanish and reset if pulled outside his area.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nTrivia.\nZarithrian is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Shearman\"&gt;Alan Shearman&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are the dominant race of the collective of plant creatures known as the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, and are worshipped as deities by their lesser relatives. While not the most powerful genesaur encountered, &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt; is the most directly antagonistic and the one who most directly commands the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe genesaur were hunted to extinction by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the main universe, but they are still present in the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Draenor of an alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAs the stone giant &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt; battled the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s, pieces of the battling leviathans fell to the earth and gave rise to new types of creatures. The plant matter that tumbled from the three Sporemounds &lt;a href=\"Zang\"&gt;Zang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naanu\"&gt;Naanu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt; contained a small portion of their life essence and gave rise to many unique beings, the strongest of which were the mighty genesaur. Meanwhile, the boulders that toppled from Grond grave rise to the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. After Grond's death at the hands of Botaan, the stone giant's creator &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; empowered the colossals to continue the fight against the minions of the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt;, who had begun to reclaim the lands that Grond had destroyed. The colossals were determined to bring balance to Draenor, but it was an enormous task, for the Evergrowth had enveloped much of the world and Botaan now eclipsed Grond in size, stalking through the jungles alongside hundreds of genesaur. The Sporemound would have to be drawn away from the Evergrowth if the colossals had any chance of succeeding, and so they drew its ire by hacking way at the forests at the Evergrowth's edge. Botaan rallied the genesaur and stormed toward the colossals, who retreated into barren ravines and hills that would give them the advantage. Botaan followed them as it saw the colossals as only pale imitations of Grond, and when it left the borders of the Evergrowth the colossals attacked with their full might. The ensuing war shook Draenor for thousands of years, with control of the world constantly moving back and forth between the two forces.\nThe colossals finally decided to sacrifice themselves to kill Botaan in a massive explosion. The spores from Botaan's corpse settled in the wilds, giving sentience to existing forms of plants and causing many new beings to take shape. The &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; were the most prolific new race and worshipped the genesaur as gods, seeing them as echoes of the great Sporemounds, faint memories of which lingered in their minds. The botani, genesaur and other plant-creatures were known collectively as the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, and their devotion to protecting the forestlands inevitably caused them to clash with the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, the descendants of Grond. For many long ages, the two factions engaged in sporadic battles with one another, neither side ever managing to destroy the other.\nThe birth of Taala.\n2,000 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; learned of the ancient history of the Evergrowth and the Sporemounds from the genesaur. The treant became the caretaker of the botani of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, teaching them unique ways to harness nature magic. The botani crafted pools of potent nature energies, which they used to transfer the spirits of fallen genesaur into new bodies. When Gnarlgar began creating a new Sporemound named &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt; and commanded the Primals to march to war against the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, new genesaur were awakened from the botani birthing pools. The genesaur marched on the Apexis spire along with the other Primals, but much like their kin, thousands of them were incinerated by the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nThousands of years later, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched across Draenor. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; led his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; on a campaign into the lush, isolated island of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, the last bastion of the Primals. After crossing the ocean with the help of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; shipwrights, orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s leeched life from the Primals and used the stolen power to set the forests ablaze while Kilrogg and his army slaughtered every botani and genesaur they could find.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the genesaur are still prevalent in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. The genesaur &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt; and its many botani followers were a major and recurring obstacle faced by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies during the campaign in Gorgrond. The giant was finally defeated at &lt;a href=\"Moira%27s%20Bastion\"&gt;Moira's Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, which it was drawn to by the &lt;a href=\"%3AWill%20of%20the%20Genesaur\"&gt;:Will of the Genesaur&lt;/a&gt;, a botani artifact retrieved by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after Iyu's defeat, the adventurer and their allies used the Will against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gar\"&gt;Commander Gar&lt;/a&gt;, who destroyed the device with an artillery attack before he himself was killed.\nIn , the botani of the &lt;a href=\"Blademoon%20Bloom\"&gt;Blademoon Bloom&lt;/a&gt; began attacking wandering travelers and dragging their bodies back into the bloom to fertilize a &lt;a href=\"Blooming%20Genesaur\"&gt;growing genesaur&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the first reported case a of genesaur being born on Draenor in over three hundred years. Luckily, the &lt;a href=\"rangari\"&gt;rangari&lt;/a&gt; were able to kill the genesaur with the aid of an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; before it managed to grow to maturity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; attempted to construct an outpost known as the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Bluff\"&gt;Violet Bluff&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt; with a portal linking back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, but as they unwittingly built it in the midst of the sacred &lt;a href=\"The%20Everbloom\"&gt;Everbloom&lt;/a&gt; the outpost was quickly overrun and infested by Primals. &lt;a href=\"Yalnu\"&gt;Yalnu&lt;/a&gt;, mightiest of the genesaur, was drawn to the strange energies emanating from the portal and sensed a new world where his kind could flourish and spread unchecked. While Yalnu did manage to cross the portal into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, it was quickly slain by the Kirin Tor and a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s before it managed to spread the overgrowth further.\nDescription and culture.\nThe genesaur are lumbering, four-legged giants and &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s who date back to the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Colossals\"&gt;Age of Colossals&lt;/a&gt;, when giants shaped the terrain of Draenor amidst constant warfare. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; describes the genesaur as the closest one can get to the primordial creatures who shaped all life on Draenor. A mane of thick fronds covers the genesaur's skin, and despite their enormous size, they are incredibly swift and agile. They are considered to be among Draenor's most vicious creatures.\nMuch of this mighty race has died out, and it is relatively rare to see a genesaur in the wild. The &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; have retained the ability to communicate with these bastions of life, and genesaur are revered as gods in their culture. &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; have not yet determined if genesaur are immortal or not; genesaur emerging from botani-tended pools often retain the memories and will of their long-dead forebears. Adventurers fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of these rare beings are cautioned to give genesaur a wide berth. They are deceptively quick given their size and destroying them will take a small army of well-equipped heroes."}

He is a large bearish man, a brawny &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; with thick features, a heavy beard, and black and gray armor. Greymane has also been noted for being stubborn, proud, strong-willed, cunning, and arrogant.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Greymane met with the other &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; leaders at &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; to hear of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s fall at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Greymane joined the other human leaders in forming the Alliance of Lordaeron to counter the Horde threat, but due to his pride, he offered only token support. After the conclusion of the Second War, Greymane chafed at using Gilnean taxes to help pay for the orc &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation&lt;/a&gt; of the orcs from internment camps by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Greymane decided that Gilneas could not and would not pay for the wars of other nations, so he &lt;a href=\"The%20Alliance%20Splinters\"&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; Gilneas from the Alliance, ordered the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; and isolated &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of the world.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Greymane instructed &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; wizard loyal to Gilneas, to summon feral &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; to protect Gilneas from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; threat. The plan backfired, and the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; would eventually run rampant among the Gilnean population. In the time between the Third War and the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the number of those afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;Worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; had grown and were now attacking &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;. To counter the threat, Greymane helped to defend the city and aided in the evacuation of citizens to &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, Greymane faced the dual threats of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; invasion, culminating in the battle to retake Gilneas City, where he witnessed the death of his son and heir, &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt;, at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nHumbled by his son's death and the devastation of his kingdom, Greymane accepted the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who had offered to relocate Gilnean survivors to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. In a fit of stubbornness, Greymane was against formally rejoining the Alliance until he had almost lost his wife and daughter during the crossing. Following the formal establishment of diplomatic ties with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Greymane became a staunch supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, adding the ferocity of the Gilneans to the considerable might of the Alliance, and intending one day to reclaim his lost kingdom.\nWhile Greymane himself became a close friend of Varian, his death during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore%20%28quest%29\"&gt;assault on the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, partly a consequence of the actions of Sylvanas, only intensified Greymane's burning hate for the new Warchief of the Horde. Their rivalry would come to define the brewing animosity between the Alliance and the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; campaign and the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Greymane became an advisor to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and assisted him in leading Alliance forces to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;liberation of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as well as rallying his people to a new strength, going on the offensive to reclaim their homeland from their perennial foes. \nFollowing the reclamation of the Kingdom of Gilneas, King Genn handed over the throne to his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, who now rules Gilneas as Queen. \nBiography.\nEarly life.\nGenn Greymane is the son of &lt;a href=\"Archibald%20Greymane\"&gt;Archibald Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, the Gilnean king who lead Gilneas into its industrial age. From a young age, Genn was taught by his father not to rely on others and that asking for help was a weakness, and this characteristic stuck with him throughout his life. Genn had grown up with the man who would eventually become &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Baron Ashbury&lt;/a&gt;, and Ashbury's father was a member of Archibald's council of Lords that had helped Archibald build up Gilneas into the industrial nation it would become. Because of the closeness of the two families, Genn was advised by Archibald to put his trust into the Ashbury family's fidelity to the crown.\nAfter Archibald's death, Genn took the throne and led Gilneas much like his father had. At some point, Genn met his wife, &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Aderic%20Banquet\"&gt;Royal Aderic Banquet&lt;/a&gt;, and theirs was not an arranged marriage. They had two children: &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt;, his son and heir, and &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess&lt;/a&gt;, who would have died in infancy if not for the intervention of the Royal Chemist, &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;. Genn was gruff with his children, and rarely told them he loved them.\nAlliance of Lordaeron.\nPrior to the Second War, Greymane was among the human leaders summoned to an emergency meeting at &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. Accompanied by a group of nobles including Baron Ashbury, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Vincent Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest and newest of the council of lords, Greymane listened to the plight of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; regarding the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the threat of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Greymane dismissed these concerns, stating with confidence that the Gilnean army could withstand any threat. While most of the other heads of the human nations were in agreement that an alliance against the orcish invaders was needed, Greymane was hesitant about joining, and was difficult about it.\nAfter a polite state dinner with his fellow rulers, Greymane retired to his guest chambers for the evening to discuss the situation with his nobles. Crowley was enthusiastic about the prospect of an alliance, stating that sending the whole &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20military\"&gt;Gilnean military&lt;/a&gt; to aid their sister nations against the orcish threat would strengthen ties, and it would help the people of Gilneas in the long run. Greymane felt Crowley was too naive and idealistic in this situation, and dismissed his ideas. Godfrey agreed with Crowley, but suggested that to stay in the good graces of their sister kingdoms for the benefit of trade and tariffs, they should only send a small token force instead of the whole Gilnean army. Baron Ashbury echoed Godfrey's sentiment, and Greymane stated that he would consider it.\nWhen the rulers of the human nations met again, Greymane voted to join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, though Gilneas offered only token support. Genn himself personally served on the field, and even argued that he should assume the role of Supreme Commander of the Alliance, since Gilneas was the most southern of the kingdoms and that meant it would be first overrun if the Horde wasn't repelled.\nAfter the Second War, he was present at the meeting with other kings of the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Greymane complained about the expenses of the keep, though the newly crowned King of Stormwind &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that a price couldn't be put on something as essential as their safety.\nAfter the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, was revealed, Greymane had his eye on ruling the now-leaderless kingdom, even though he had no right to it. He supported the claim of Lord Perenolde's nephew, &lt;a href=\"Isiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Isiden&lt;/a&gt;, to Alterac's throne. A base in Alterac would give Gilneas access to resources the southern kingdom did not have, and the excuse to send its mighty ships across the Great Sea. Greymane almost fought with Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; over the issue, but the confrontation never came as both of them had reluctantly agreed not to bring back any weapons. They had even agreed to having themselves searched by selected sentries from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the only military unit they all trusted despite its outward allegiance to Terenas. Over time, due to mind control by the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, he grew to support Lord &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; (actually Deathwing in human form), in his bid for the throne. However, after Prestor vanished, Greymane continued to push Isiden's claim.\nGenn was later present at &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s induction into the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeceding from the Alliance.\nAfter the war, Greymane chafed at having Gilnean taxes pay for orc &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; and the construction of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. In a discussion with Godfrey, Greymane questioned the wisdom of listening to the advice of Crowley and Godfrey in joining the Alliance, stating that it had gotten them nothing but dead Gilneans. Greymane stated his plans to withdraw from the Alliance and wall off Gilneas from the rest of the world. Upon looking at the map of Gilneas Greymane had in front of them, Godfrey suggested the wall be built through Crowley's lands, in effect cutting off &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of the kingdom, as Crowley's lands had the mountains as a natural barrier the wall could be built into. Greymane agreed and was confident that Crowley would understand his reasoning.\nYears after, the departure of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; who stated that the humans' poor leadership had led to the burning of their forests during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, led to the departure of Gilneas and its military from the Alliance, and the beginnings of the construction of the Wall to split his kingdom off from the world.\nHowever, Crowley did not take Greymane seceding from the Alliance and the building of the wall through his lands as well as Greymane hoped he would. In an act of defiance against Greymane, Crowley sent the group of soldiers known as the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; to assist &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Genn had tried to reason with the noble, to make it clear that this wall was the way forward, and to explain why assisting the Alliance was so wrong. But Crowley refused, and insisted that he was doing what was best for the future of Gilneas, that he would end the King\u2019s \u201ctyranny\u201d, and started a rebellion against Greymane, gathering like-minded Gilneans including his daughter &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tobias%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Tobias Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; in forming the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;Northgate rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting civil war weakened the kingdom and split the populace into two groups, \"royalist\" and \"rebel\", labels that continued to spark fights years after the event ended.\nGreymane was hurt that a man he considered his friend started an uprising against him, but did not blame him for it. Greymane's forces eventually captured Crowley and his followers and threw them in jail. When the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, he did not send any troops to help. In fact, he saw it as confirmation that he'd made the right choice in isolating Gilneas.\nUnleashing the worgen.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a massive sea of undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; marched in waves upon the Greymane Wall. Their number was small at first, but it increased over time and they did not flag. Fearing it would break, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; opened the gate and Gilnean soldiers poured from Gilneas into Silverpine Forest. The Gilneans defended the wall for days, however, the Scourge defeated the soldiers and raised them into undeath. Greymane had secretly consulted with &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; Archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, a Gilnean patriot who had discovered a way to summon worgen, feral creatures from &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;another dimension&lt;/a&gt;, to use as an instrument against the Scourge. Desperate to protect his people, and telling no one of his plan, Greymane ordered Arugal to summon the worgen in an effort to protect his nation.\nAt first, everything went according to plan until the Scourge were driven off. Yet, with no more enemies left to fight, the feral creatures turned on the Gilnean soldiers stationed beyond the Greymane Wall, and soon spread their &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; throughout the human population of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, King Greymane ordered the return of his troops as well as the permanent closure of the Greymane Wall's doors, however, some retreating soldiers were infected and began secretly to spread the worgen curse. Over the years, reports of strange attacks and disappearances rose, fear took root in the hearts of Greymane's people, while the curse continued to spread in the kingdom through the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;, gradually eating away at Gilneas' humanity.\nFollowing the civil war, to counter the threat, Greymane and his nobles, including Godfrey, Ashbury, and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Marley\"&gt;Lord Marley&lt;/a&gt;, would secretly hold hunting parties during the full moons into &lt;a href=\"The%20Blackwald\"&gt;The Blackwald&lt;/a&gt; to track down and shoot any feral worgen they came across. During one of these trips, Greymane went ahead by himself in pursuit of a worgen and it ambushed him, biting him in the shoulder before he could shoot it and infecting him with the curse. Knowing that the nobles would shoot him as well if they saw the bite, something he would do himself and would expect no less of them, Greymane panicked. His jacket apparently not damaged, he wiped the blood from his shoulder then ripped off a piece of his satchel to stuff under the shoulder lining (presumably to absorb any bleeding and conceal any deformation of his shoulder) and pulled up the collar as high as it would go. As he hoped, his deception would prove successful.\nCurse of the Worgen.\nGenn Greymane has had his hands full since the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;Northgate rebellion&lt;/a&gt; had been resolved. He and his people are trapped: outside of Gilneas, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; are battering at the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; in a bid to conquer their lands. Inside, there have been rumors of Crowley supporters reforming, the &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20Slasher\"&gt;Starlight Slasher killings&lt;/a&gt; are becoming more frequent, and reports of livestock missing. Genn increases security throughout Gilneas without compromising the security at the Greymane Wall and plans to issue a curfew to give him more time to find a more permanent solution for Gilneas' problems. He also learned about the apparent death of &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;. Genn is sure that the perpetrator of the Starlight Slasher killings are worgen but tells the people of Gilneas that the increased security is due to renewed civil unrest from Crowley sympathizers. As time goes on, the Gilnean people become more afraid to leave their homes and the nobles become more anxious. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, despite the other problems Gilneas is plagued with, is only concerned with the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and questions Genn on why he hasn't gone on a hunt with them lately. Godfrey questions if Genn has lost his edge after the civil war and asks Genn to let him take over so he can end the worgen threat. Genn however, feels that Godfrey's worgen hunting antics will incite panic among the populace who are already on edge due to the murders. Genn also knows that if Godfrey ever found out the truth about Genn and the worgen, he would rebel against him. Genn frequently hides away in his observatory in &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Manor\"&gt;Greymane Manor&lt;/a&gt;, where his secret ally, &lt;a href=\"Belysra\"&gt;Belysra&lt;/a&gt;, helps him control his worgen transformations and also tells him the origins of the worgen and the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;. \nBelysra, a night elven priestess, explained the origin of the worgen curse and offered up a partial cure. She explained to Greymane that the worgen released by Argual were once night elven druids who had fallen victim to a cursed and corrupted druid form around ten thousand years ago during a conflict known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;. To contain the threat these druids posed, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; ordered them sealed into an eternal slumber in the Emerald Dream. Belysra explained that a night elven priestess ritual was a palliative method of letting infected Gilneans keep their minds intact while in their wolven form, but if the Gilnean still held onto the guilt of any kind, he or she could not switch back into human form at will. Still keeping his infection hidden from even his family, Greymane had been letting her perform a compact version of this ritual on him. He also asks her to aid his friend, the alchemist &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;, in making his experimental potion that will help stem the worgen transformation.\nUsing a combination of Krennan Aranas' potions and Belryssa's use of Elune's Light and the worgen ceremony, Genn had managed to keep his worgen infection in check and a secret. Yet it was becoming more unlikely that he would be able to continue keeping up the facade. Genn considered granting his old friend Darius Crowley and his rebels amnesty and together they would be able to beat the worgen and the Forsaken, however, he was also wary of this as he feared that he and Darius wouldn't be able to put aside their differences.\nCataclysm.\n\"The people of the Alliance remember the king of Gilneas as a proud, strong-willed, cunning, and arrogant man. He and his armies stood by the Alliance during the Second War, but in the aftermath, it became clear to Genn Greymane that the Alliance needed Gilneas more than Gilneas needed the Alliance. He ordered that the Greymane Wall be closed to all outsiders, effectively sealing off his kingdom from the outside world and its conflicts. But fate, it seems, was intent on teaching the king a lesson in humility...As the worgen curse swept the nation and early attempts at containment failed, Greymane found himself fighting a battle for his people's very humanity.\"\nThe Northgate rebellion left Gilneas in a weakened state, and the number of Gilneans infected with the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;Worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; rose to the point where feral worgen openly attacked &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;. Greymane, his son &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt;, and Lord Godfrey led the defense against the infected worgen, and Greymane decided that despite their differences, they needed Crowley to assist them, so Greymane arranged for Crowley's release. Upon his release, Crowley gathered some of his fellow rebels to the cause and let Greymane's forces make use of his hidden artillery stash.\nDuring the chaos, the Royal Chemist, &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;, was captured, and once he was secure, the order was given by Greymane to evacuate Gilneas City. Crowley and his men decided to stay behind to create a distraction so that Greymane could evacuate his people to safety in &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;, where they lived in peace for a relative time. Lorna had received word her father was free, but Liam told her about the choice Darius made. Lorna pulled out her gun and took aim at Genn, cursing at him and believing this was his idea of revenge after the Northgate Rebellion. Liam restrained her, and a hysterical Lorna demanded she be let go to die with her father before she began to cry in Liam's arms.\nDuring the Cataclysm, the barrier reefs protecting Gilneas shattered, and parts of the Greymane Wall were exposed, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to invade Gilneas and take Gilneas City from the rampaging feral worgen.\nSince evacuating Gilneas City, Greymane and Krennan Aranas have been working on a partial cure for the worgen curse. Greymane's forces have been capturing feral worgen and using their temporary cure to help the worgen regain their sanity. Godfrey raises objections as to the point of saving feral worgen, saying they are all beasts that should be shot, but Greymane overrides him and saves &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;one such worgen&lt;/a&gt; from an executioner's blade by injecting them with a serum that gives them control of their minds, thus allowing them to retain some semblance of their humanity. When Forsaken ships arrive to bombard the town of Duskhaven, Genn orders Krennan to administer the potion to as many feral worgen as possible and leads the sane worgen in defending the town.\nAfter the loss of Gilneas City, he retreats to &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Manor\"&gt;Greymane Manor&lt;/a&gt;, where he tries to think of a plan to safeguard his people from the invading Forsaken navy forces. Tess reminded him of hope by showing him a &lt;a href=\"Peacebloom\"&gt;Peacebloom&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; sends &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt; underwater, he decides to move the evacuees further inland and sends the Gilnean survivors towards &lt;a href=\"Stormglen\"&gt;Stormglen&lt;/a&gt; in stagecoaches.\nHe later journeys to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the Gilnean worgen who underwent the ritual, and reunites with the now worgen Lord Darius Crowley and his army of worgen. Greymane and Godfrey wished for Crowley and his worgen to join forces against the Forsaken. Crowley remained skeptical of joining forces with Greymane, especially alongside Godfrey, who had a noted prejudice against those afflicted with the worgen curse. Greymane replied that he came to Crowley as an equal, and revealed to Crowley and Godfrey that he too was affected by the curse. Satisfied with the answer, Crowley pledged his help against the Forsaken, and together, the two united Gilneas against the Forsaken invasion. They also secured help from the night elves native to the Gilneas area.\nHaving learned of Greymane's worgen affliction, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; and his supporters &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Walden\"&gt;Lord Walden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Baron Ashbury&lt;/a&gt; betray Gilneas by attempting to turn Greymane over to the Forsaken and held him hostage at &lt;a href=\"Tempest%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Tempest's Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Under orders from &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;, Walden and Ashbury were killed, Greymane was rescued and Lord Godfrey's machinations were foiled by adventurers. Instead of letting himself be arrested for treason, Godfrey killed himself, stating he'd rather die than have a worgen as his king. Days later, observing Gilneas City, he told Liam the truth about how the curse spread and revealed to him that he was bitten. Liam was fine with the revelations thus ending the emotional rift between the son and father. Greymane decided to stop concealing his infection and let his people know that he too was afflicted by the curse, and the Gilnean people accepted him and rallied to him when he called for a united counterattack against the Forsaken.\nGreymane participated in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Battle of Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; in order to reclaim the city from the Forsaken, personally calling out and attacking &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Forsaken. During the ensuing battle, his son Liam Greymane is killed by a poisoned arrow from Sylvanas Windrunner that was intended for Greymane. Greymane, Crowley and Lorna Crowley had a funeral ceremony for Liam at &lt;a href=\"Aderic%27s%20Repose\"&gt;Aderic's Repose&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the majority of the Gilnean population was forced to leave in a mass exodus of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; because of the information that Sylvanas is going to use the Plague, Crowley and any remaining militant forces remained behind, forming the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to rout the Forsaken out of Gilneas.\nAftermath.\nUsing resources provided to them by their night elven allies, Greymane and Gilnean citizens boarded ships headed for the night elf capital of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Greymane boarded one ship, and his wife Mia and daughter Tess were aboard \"&lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Radiance\"&gt;Elune's Radiance&lt;/a&gt;\". Due to the Cataclysm, the crossing was overtaken by a powerful storm. During the trip, Greymane suffered from guilt over the choices he had made, which cost him his country and his son, and chafed when captain &lt;a href=\"Talar%20Oaktalon\"&gt;Talar Oaktalon&lt;/a&gt; suggested that Gilneas join the Alliance. When \"Elune's Radiance\" was damaged and began to sink, Greymane shifted into worgen form and joined the rescue parties from his ship and rescued his wife, who had a broken leg, and his daughter, who had refused to leave her mother. Genn was sucked under with the ship, but Oaktalon managed to save him at the last moment. After everyone was safe, Greymane reconsidered his position of joining the Alliance.\nFor a short time after the fall of Gilneas, Greymane is present at the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt; in Darnassus, where the surviving Gilneans have resettled. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the night elven leaders, welcome Greymane and the Gilnean survivors to Darnassus, and he instructs the survivors to assist the night elves in any way they can as repayment for the help they had given the Gilnean nation.\nLater, the Front would succeed in securing the mainland with aid from the Alliance and Bloodfang allies, Greymane has yet to make any decisions on the future of his people's land. However, with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;coast being contested&lt;/a&gt; and the push into Silverpine having failed, it is doubtful Genn would allow the populous to return just yet.\nWolfheart.\nWith Gilneas' induction into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; dependent on the approval of the other Alliance representatives, Genn had given his word to Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; that he would give his best impression to the Alliance dignitaries. When Genn Greymane made his introduction at the welcoming banquet, he admitted to the Alliance representatives that walling off his kingdom was a mistake and that he thanks the Alliance for giving Gilneas a second chance. The Alliance dignitaries generally seem accepting of Greymane's apology and the banquet started off pleasant. Yet the situation became tense with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival. As Genn was telling the tales of his victories against the Horde during the banquet, Varian Wrynn arrived and mocked Gilneas. Varian insulted Gilneas by implying that they were pathetic cowards and weaklings. Despite the insults to him and his people, Genn held his anger in check and tried to persuade the king of Stormwind that Gilneas has changed, and that they are now ready to be staunch supporters of the Alliance. Varian Wrynn however, was still bitter over Gilneas' abandonment of the Alliance during their hour of need during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Varian denounced Gilneas as an ally and absolved himself of any association with the desperate nation. Despite the awful first encounter, Genn would later reveal that he noticed &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;'s presence around Varian when they first met; which is why he still held out hope that Varian would later change his mind.\nDuring the summit, Genn demonstrated Gilneas' military might and the supernatural strength of the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; form to show what it could provide to the Alliance. The Alliance approved of the benefits and many began to support Gilneas' readmission. Despite this, Varian Wrynn stood up and made an announcement. Although he acknowledges the benefits Gilneas could bring to the Alliance, he points out that he could never trust nor forgive Gilneas for abandoning them in their hour of need during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Varian declared that the Alliance has no need for such fair weather friends and would never consent to allow such mongrels into the Alliance. This left the summit in an uproar and effectively ruined any chance Gilneas had of joining the Alliance. Genn left the summit angry and disappointed in Varian.\nGenn later encountered Varian again when Malfurion lured Varian into the worgen's hunting grounds. An argument was sparked between Varian and Genn about who was the better hunter. Malfurion proposed a hunting challenge to settle the matter. While chasing a boar, however, they inadvertently agitated a giant bear. With one of Genn's subjects in danger, the Gilnean king and the king of Stormwind worked together to kill the giant bear, with Varian landing a killing blow to the bear's neck with his hunting knife. Genn and his worgen honored Varian for his kill, though he didn't stay around to accept it as he snuck off to self-reflect in the woods.\nAfter much self-reflection, Varian sought Genn out again just as he was about to depart from Darnassus. Varian asked him for his help in how to better control his rage. Genn led him to the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt; where he showed him the night elf ritual that allowed the worgen to control their bestial fury. Though he did warn him that not all survived the trials the ritual entailed and some had to be put down since they lost themselves to their worgen nature, Varian decided to go through with it. To Genn's surprise, it was recommended for Varian's ritual that he drink the waters from the Wells of Tranquility, Balance, and Fury all at once instead of separately, which Varian did.\nGenn guided Varian to recall the most relevant moments in his life and the choices that led up to them. After Varian underwent the ritual and mastered his rage, Varian heard Goldrinn howling in approval and he awakened, with Genn and the worgen watching in awe as the aura of Goldrinn envelops him. Without a shadow of a doubt, Varian was indeed Goldrinn's champion. Varian told Genn to gather his worgen, as he was determined to do battle with his enemy, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving gathered the worgen and his forces, Varian mobilized his forces through &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and reinforced the Alliance forces battling there with Garrosh Hellscream's &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Genn and his worgen supported Varian as he led the charge against the Horde. The worgen were instrumental in routing the Horde and killing several massive &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde had captured in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. With the worgen reinforcements and Varian Wrynn's leadership, the tide of battle turned and the Alliance were able to drive out the invading Horde army.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Varian was honored as the hero of the battle for Ashenvale and Goldrinn's favored champion. Varian later called for a second Alliance summit, this time being a proponent for the induction of Gilneas and the worgen into the Alliance. After Gilneas was officially voted into the Alliance, Varian spoke of how many threats have arisen to challenge the Alliance and disrupt the peace that they worked so hard to attain. The Horde has threatened the Alliance and now more than ever, it needs to band together and match their enemies' fury and energy in order to survive in this new &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; created. With the worgen at their side, Varian assures his allies that the Alliance will prevail and will do so with honor.\nShattering.\nGreymane later journeys to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to aid Varian Wrynn with Alliance military operations and assisting in Gilnean reclamation efforts. Greymane remains at the side of Wrynn and his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; in the throne room of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gwen%20Armstead\"&gt;Gwen Armstead&lt;/a&gt;, the mayor of Duskhaven, takes Greymane's place in Darnassus.\nGenn makes a brief appearance as being present at the meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Delegation\"&gt;Honor Delegation&lt;/a&gt; and Varian Wrynn in the &lt;a href=\"throne%20room\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;When Theramore was in danger of being invaded by the Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Varian Wrynn assured Jaina that he would request Genn's help.\nGenn was present during a meeting with Varian and other Alliance leaders or ambassadors to decide on the best way to destroy the Horde's blockade around Kalimdor. He suggested tricking the Horde into believing they would liberate &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nGenn is seen in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;, where the Alliance dignitaries and allies discuss the pros and cons of using &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; power. Genn was awed by the Sha's horrific power.\nWhile Genn is not present in the Siege of Orgrimmar, he can be seen in a vision of an alternate timeline where he is present with the leaders of the Alliance and Horde observing Garrosh's body.\nGenn was present at the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Opting for his worgen form, he accused the Horde leaders of being complicit in Garrosh's crimes, arguing that some of them like Sylvanas had even launched their own attacks, and wanted to put all its leaders on trial, after which &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; calmly told him that such would take quite a while, and that not all of them had long lives.\nLegion.\n\"In recent years, the grizzled ruler of Gilneas has suffered many hardships: his &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; and his nation fell to the Banshee Queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and he nearly lost his humanity to the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;. Yet from these tragedies, Genn has found new strength and courage. He is determined to fight tooth and claw against any enemy that threatens the safety of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nShortly before the Burning Legion's third invasion, Genn left &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nGenn participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, and Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, personally leading a squad of &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Royal%20Guard%20%28Broken%20Shore%29\"&gt;Gilnean Royal Guards&lt;/a&gt;. Going as reinforcements, the team came to &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;'s aid, and faced as he reached the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, along with the demons he summoned. Varian calls in the Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" and orders Genn to advance to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and instruct her to clear the skies. Yet before he could carry out his task, Sylvanas uses her war horn to signal the Horde forces to quit the field, leaving Genn livid over their abandonment. Without the Horde's support, the Alliance would be overrun and thus Genn urges Varian to order a retreat. Varian orders all Alliance forces to fall back to the gunship. As it takes off, however, Gul'dan summons an immense &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt; through the portal, which grabs onto the \"Skyfire\", causing it to tip and send many Alliance soldiers plummeting to their deaths. Genn turns human again and reaches out his hand to pull Varian up to the deck but instead of handing him his hand, Varian passes a letter he wrote to his son and asks Genn to deliver it to Anduin. Genn nods at his request and watches Varian dive to slay the fel reaver impeding their escape while Genn orders the gunship to depart. Varian made a valiant last stand against the demons, killing several of them until he was finally subdued. Genn screamed in anguish after he watched Gul'dan obliterate Varian with overwhelming &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nAfter the battle ended with Varian's death, Genn and Jaina held the Horde responsible for the disaster and resolved to avenge Varian. Genn did not attend Varian's funeral because he could not bring himself to face Anduin, and he asks an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the letter in his stead while he prepares the \" Skyfire\" to take off with his Gilnean forces. Genn himself tells the adventurer that rage has taken over him, and he is determined to get his vengeance against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Varian's death, Genn becomes the leader of the Alliance forces on the Broken Isles, having instructed the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; to establish &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt; to secure &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; from threats. Genn's Gilnean forces are supplemented by &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; and on the \"Skyfire\" as they undertake an official mission by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to escort Alliance champions to Stormheim and aid them in obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Unofficially though, after receiving intelligence of suspicious Horde activity, the \"Skyfire\" has been tracking Sylvanas Windrunner's fleet. Genn Greymane and &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, who believed Sylvanas herself was a passenger on one of the ships, chose to attack the fleet. Unable to make contact with the rest of the Alliance fleet, the \"Skyfire\" proceeded with their assault. Though their forces managed to board the Forsaken's ships and kill their captains, when they boarded the royal flagship the Alliance discovered that Sylvanas had already left the ship and that &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; was leading a Horde force to the \"Skyfire\". Genn would face off against Nathanos himself during the defense of the ship, who goaded Genn to fight him using his worgen form.\nGreymane gained the upper hand and managed to wound Nathanos, but the battle abruptly ended as Forsaken boarders completed their sabotage, causing the \"Skyfire\" to crash. The \"Skyfire\" was destroyed but its crew was able to evacuate before the crash and rallied in the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire%20Triage%20Camp\"&gt;Skyfire Triage Camp&lt;/a&gt; while combating the Horde. The survivors were evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt; where Genn Greymane oversees the campaign to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; and hunt for Sylvanas.\nWhile Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s pursue the Aegis, Genn uncovers that the Forsaken means to plague Greywatch like they did Gilneas. Greymane commands his forces to destroy the plague caches and the invading Forsaken apothecary to secure Greywatch and later sends &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; to uncover what Sylvanas seeks in &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt;. As Lorna discovers that Sylvanas means to create more &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; by subjugating &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;, Genn musters the Alliance fleet in trying to assault &lt;a href=\"Dreadwake%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Dreadwake's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. The battle at &lt;a href=\"Greymane%27s%20Offensive\"&gt;Greymane's Offensive&lt;/a&gt; goes poorly and his offensive is repelled. After hearing news of Lorna's intelligence, Genn personally goes to the vault in Skold-Ashil to confront Sylvanas.\nAt the vault, Sylvanas uses a magical lantern called the &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt; to bind &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; and tortures the Val'kyr to obey her commands. Genn lets out a beastly howl and speaks to Sylvanas in a menacing tone from the shadows. Genn told Sylvanas her quest for immortality has left her vulnerable and cries out that he will have his vengeance on her as he pounces at her from the ceiling. He then declared he will avenge Varian, Gilneas, and his son as he strikes at her, eventually knocking her down. Genn then charged at her but Sylvanas evaded him and shot a poisoned arrow at his shoulder, turning Genn human. Sylvanas taunted Genn by saying she overestimated him and calling him an \"old wolf\". However, Genn then revealed that he had swiped the Soulcage during his last charge, and smashed it on the ground, destroying it and freeing Eyir. Sylvanas watched in shock and anger as Eyir was released from her constraints and disappeared. Genn walked out of the vault, snapping the shaft of Sylvanas' poisoned arrow lodged in his shoulder, and told Sylvanas that since she stole his son's future, he now took hers. Genn returned to Lorna and the Gilneas Brigade, who manage to successfully reverse the effects of the poison back at Greywatch.\nHe later appears (vocally, not physically) when the player assaults any &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Towers\"&gt;Warden Towers&lt;/a&gt;, giving them orders on capturing the tower for Gilneas and commending them when they are successful.\nSometime after the campaign in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; rebuked &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt; and Genn Greymane for taking his assignment much further than he had ordered.\nThe Compass.\nBefore the campaign on Pandaria, Anduin made a compass for his father's birthday. Varian would keep it close to him until the end. When the Legion attack Varian's airship during the Burning Legion's third invasion, the airship fell into the water and Varian with it. As he slowly was drowning, Varian accidentally dropped the compass into the sea.\nWhen an Alliance hero was skulking around the monsters of the sea of the Broken Shore, a glittering spark caught their attention. Swimming to the bottom of the sea, they found that it was a compass with a picture of Anduin inside. Although it has long stopped working, whatever remained of the portrait inside could clearly be identified as Anduin. Thinking it was important, the adventurer brought the compass to the king. Anduin was stunned and realized that he didn't have time to mourn after his father passed away. The king thanked the adventurer.\nAll would be quiet until Genn called for the same adventurer to meet him in the keep. Genn mentions that the king had not been the same ever since the adventurer brought him the compass back, mentioning that Anduin had become listless and distracted. Genn sends two guards to surveil him and they said that the king had been praying at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. He asks the adventurer to remedy his melancholy by going to the king and convince him to resume his duties.\nAfter returning to the keep, Anduin finds Genn and Velen discussing him. Velen holds Anduin in high regard saying that a vision showed him becoming a great leader. Genn, on the other hand, feels that Anduin doesn't have the mettle to succeed, for he doesn't have the experience of the Broken Shore and how the compass easily broke his spirit.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Wrynnfall\"&gt;Wrynnfall&lt;/a&gt; in front of the Tomb of Sargeras, Genn shows Velen the site of Varian's death, and Velen comments that Anduin does not know the Legion like they do. Anduin arrives, much to Genn's initial shock but it quickly becomes sorrow, and Anduin reveals his worries and doubts about living up to his father's legacy. The young king finds one of the &lt;a href=\"Shalla%27tor%20and%20Ellemayne\"&gt;two blades&lt;/a&gt; comprising his father's sword &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; under the ash and sand and falls to his knees. Genn kneels before a despairing Anduin to speak to him face-to-face and tells him how Varian's heroic actions were a challenge to them to never let fear prevail, even at the very gates of hell. With encouragement from Genn and a vision of his father, Anduin finds renewed hope and the sword begins to glow in his hands.\nThe Wound.\n&lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, lord of the Burning Legion, was eventually defeated, but not before he managed to wound Azeroth greatly in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their losses, Anduin gave a hopeful speech at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind to the Alliance, with Genn watching him from the back of the crowd while smiling proudly. &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of approached Genn and told him that he needed to speak with the High King immediately. As Genn and Shaw walked off, Anduin saw them and quickly ended his speech. Away from the crowds, Shaw reported that many &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s had been digging up a &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;mysterious new substance&lt;/a&gt; in Silithus. Though they did not know what this substance was, it seemed that the Horde did know. Anduin said they had to learn more, and Shaw assured him that SI:7 was already on it.\nBefore the Storm.\nWhen King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; summoned his councilors to Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"map%20room\"&gt;map room&lt;/a&gt; to discuss opinions on &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, both Greymane and &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; marveled at its power but were also aware of its potential for misuse. Although Anduin was reluctant to use Azerite for destructive purposes, Genn reminded Anduin that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; would use it for destructive purposes and so should the Alliance. When Anduin revealed his plans to travel to the other member nations of the Alliance so that he may thank them, provide them aid in their economic recoveries, and enlist their help as well, Greymane reminded Anduin that he is king of Stormwind and his people needed him there. Genn added that Gilneas for their part needs no royal visit. When Anduin transitioned the conversation of how his travels to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; has benefited his development as a leader, Greymane stressed to Anduin that his safety and presence are integral to the stability of his kingdom and the dangers of him adventuring with no successor to his throne. Even so, Anduin firmly believed that although Stormwind needs him, him traveling to the other Alliance countries to promote unity and prosperity is the right thing to do for all and the proper use of peacetime.\nSometime later, Anduin had breakfast with Genn Greymane and Prophet Velen. Anduin told Genn he would like him to act as regent of Stormwind while he was away, as well as serve as his heir should something happen to him. While Genn was honored and agreed to serve Stormwind in Anduin's absence, he also noted that he was an old man and that Anduin should be thinking of creating an actual heir. In the meantime, Genn and Velen continued to advise Anduin on how to go about his diplomatic tour.\nAfter Anduin returned from his trip from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Genn Greymane and Anduin had dinner in Stormwind, where they were filling out all the paperwork required to formalize the state of affairs before Anduin's trip to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Genn once again thanked Anduin for trusting him with his kingdom, but he felt it was his duty to discuss the matter of an heir for Stormwind. Though Anduin tried to make light of the situation, Genn sternly reminded him that matters of politics aren't a game and Stormwind could find itself in a dire situation if power is transferred to the wrong person. Anduin agreed, having been reminded of the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt; riot that killed his mother, and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s machinations. Genn recalled how the death of his son &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt; had left a void in his heart, and how he's had his love for the remnants of his family and his hatred for Sylvanas to cope with the pain. Though he still mourns Liam's passing, he sees a lot of the goodness Liam represented in Anduin and finds himself wanting to guide Anduin as he would his own son. Anduin was moved but told Genn he can't replace his father. Genn gave Anduin the same advice he would have given Liam: that life is too short and unpredictable. Genn urged Anduin to use this time of peace, for however long it may last, to search for a queen to bear him a successor. Genn suggested that if he has not found a mate already, perhaps he should consider an arranged marriage and would even offer his own daughter's hand. Anduin knew he needs to undergo a courtship eventually but he found the idea of an arranged forced marriage, stranger or not, abhorrent and felt &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; would feel the same. Anduin promised he will revisit this topic with him at a later date and transitioned the discussion to be about his meeting with &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. When Anduin discussed how the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; had brought together priests from all walks of life, including &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Genn reminded him that although his compassion for all races is an admirable trait, he must be wary it does not lead to dangerous naivet\u00e9. Although the Horde has produced some notable noble members such as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, Genn stressed that the Forsaken are depraved abominations who don't feel the same things living people do. When Anduin countered that the Conclave was being led by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, Genn was outraged that such a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; had befallen such a beloved hero of humanity and questioned Anduin how he could tolerate it. Anduin responded that the Conclave had shown him that the Forsaken aren't all mindless &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and although not all of them are good, some such as Alonsus Faol and &lt;a href=\"Frandis%20Farley\"&gt;Frandis Farley&lt;/a&gt; are. Although Genn was eager to walk out and dismiss the notion of seeing the Forsaken as people, Anduin was stern and managed to get Genn to listen to his proposal. Anduin proposed using Faol to open negotiations and heal the rift between the Forsaken and the Alliance. Anduin proposed that if the Alliance reunited the Forsaken with their families, Sylvanas may be convinced to not consider the Alliance as a threat and use Azerite for destructive means. And should true diplomacy with the Forsaken succeed, then the Alliance and Horde can work together to heal Azeroth.\nSometime later, Genn aided Anduin in arranging his manservant &lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll Benton&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral and returned to the map room to attend Anduin's meeting. There Anduin revealed his intention to set up a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; between the Forsaken and their human loved ones. Genn concurred with &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt; that the Forsaken were undead monsters whose malady the Alliance shouldn't embrace and also stated his belief that they are plotting to spread their curse to all of humanity. Genn advised against Anduin's Gathering for practical political reasons as well and agreed with &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; that one escalated altercation can lead to political catastrophe and war. When Genn accused Anduin of using the Gathering as a way to make himself feel better about Wyll's passing, Anduin could not deny it since it was partially true. Even so, Anduin's desire for peace, partially to honor his friend Wyll's dying wish, and his belief that Sylvanas would never endanger her Forsaken in such a way that would start a war overcame his trepidation for any of the stated risks. Sternly, he commanded his advisers to support him in securing and orchestrating this meeting.\nGenn and Calia Menethil aided Anduin in interviewing potential candidates for the Gathering. Much to Anduin's slight annoyance, however, Genn was very dour and constantly reminded the candidates to keep in mind their loved ones have changed into undead Forsaken who serve Sylvanas and may have done horrible things as members of the Scourge. Genn had asked Anduin how he could tolerate working with Sylvanas after she abandoned his father Varian during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and all the foul deeds she committed. Though Anduin admitted it wasn't easy, the Gathering's potential to stop a war fueled by Azerite was too promising a reward to pass up.\nOne late evening, Anduin summoned Turalyon and Genn to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and reunited them with Alonsus Faol in a last ditch effort to convince them of the righteousness of his cause. Genn was outraged that Anduin would traumatize them by using an abominable version of their old friend in order to make a point. He accused Alonsus of manipulating the boy, but Faol retorted to Greymane that his hatred of him stems from fear; fear that if he acknowledges the Forsaken as people, then he would also be acknowledging that his son died for nothing. Though Genn was about to assault Faol in fury, Turalyon stopped him as he would not permit violence in a sacred place. Faol tried to convince Genn his rage and pain was prohibiting him from understanding a truth that could change his perceptions, but Genn wanted to cling to hatred and sorrow as it was what fueled him to fight. Faol sympathized but when he asked if he would still hate the Forsaken if Faol came to him with a Forsaken Liam, Genn was shaken to the core. Unable to face the truth, Genn howled in fury and fled the Cathedral.\nGenn attended the Gathering but was regulated to staying at &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; to organize the Alliance security forces, since Anduin didn't want to risk an altercation between Genn and Sylvanas. Though the Gathering started off peaceful, Sylvanas eventually ordered to recall the Forsaken participants. When some Forsaken participants refused or hesitated to retreat from the event, Anduin felt the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;'s pain in his body and realized that &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; had revealed herself to instruct any of the deserting Forsaken to find sanctuary in the Alliance's side of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas responded by sending her dark rangers to kill all the Forsaken participants. Genn was one of the Alliance leaders that scrambled to secure the Alliance participants.\nBack in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin helped the Stormwindians bury the Forsaken participants of the Gathering. As Anduin and Genn attended the Forsakens' funeral, Anduin fully expected to be chastised for his failure and welcomed Genn to do so as he felt responsible for the dead. Instead, Genn gave him comforting words and told him to not blame himself, and that Sylvanas was the one responsible for killing her own people. Genn apologized and acknowledged that the Gathering showed him that the Forsaken still had humanity in them and that peace was possible between them and the living. Anduin also acknowledged that Genn was right about Sylvanas, but Genn said that he was wrong about her as well, as he thought her to be ruthless to the Alliance but not to her own people. Anduin lamented how Sylvanas had politically outmaneuvered him to twist the outcome of the Gathering to her own advantage. Anduin finally came to the conclusion that peace could never be possible with Sylvanas in power, and that he truly believed that Sylvanas was irredeemable.\nWar of the Thorns.\nAs King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and Genn Greymane sparred in the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20%28Stormwind%20Keep%29\"&gt;royal garden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; interrupted their training to report that their plan to saturate &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with agents had been successful. Shaw stated that there has been a disagreement between &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and High Overlord &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; regarding the deployment of troops. Saurfang was said to have wanted an army deployed to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, while the Blightcaller regarded it as a waste of resources. Many in the Alliance interpreted the deliberation to march on Silithus as a sign of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s intention to weaponize &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and secure a monopoly of the mineral in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. After relaying this information to High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande had begun to secretly amass a night elf army in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to intercept the Horde forces should they march to Silithus.\nLater on, Shaw reported the public fistfight between Nathanos and Varok. Nathanos' subsequent reprimanding seemed to confirm the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders' suspicions of the Horde's capability to make Azerite weapons and that &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had endorsed Saurfang's Silithus campaign. Greymane believed the Horde has already found a way to create Azerite weapons and Tyrande concurred with him. Tyrande stated that if the Alliance was in agreement, her army stood ready to deter the Horde's campaign. King Anduin, in the end, gave his endorsement to deploy the night elven troops. While Genn and other Alliance leaders were at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; aiding in the planning for the upcoming war, the Horde saw an opportunity to attack &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. With the night elf fleet en route to Silithus, Ashenvale had only &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and an insufficient amount of defenders to defend it. When word reached Stormwind of the Horde invasion, the Alliance leaders realized that the Horde had deceived them into weakening Ashenvale's defenses. Genn was furious about Shaw's misleading information but Anduin told him the spies reported what they saw and that the failure was his. The Alliance leaders coordinated with each other to accommodate as many refugees as possible and to reinforce the Ashenvale warfront. Genn had desired to go to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt;'s evacuation since the Gilneans would need a respected authority figure to calmly arrange their evacuation. However, Anduin objected as he needed Genn in Stormwind to advise him should the worse outcome occur. Instead, Genn recruited his wife &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia&lt;/a&gt; for the endeavor and though he instructed her to complete her task as quickly as possible so she could come back safely, part of Genn knew she would go beyond her duties to save as many lives as possible.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; progressed, Anduin became more restless. One sleepless night, he went to the &lt;a href=\"map%20room\"&gt;map room&lt;/a&gt; to look over the map table and recalled which areas the night elves were losing ground in. Genn who also couldn't sleep, joined him in contemplating about their dire situation. Anduin discussed with Genn that the Horde's influence would nearly dominate all of Kalimdor and should Sylvanas hold Darnassus and its citizens hostage, it could tear the Alliance apart or paralyze the Alliance from retaliating. Anduin told Genn that Sylvanas may coerce him to abandon Gilneas in favor of safeguarding a hostage &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and that political manipulation would put them at odds. To Anduin's surprise, Genn told Anduin he would not withdraw his support from the Alliance even should such an event come to pass, as he would never betray the kindness of the night elves in order to reclaim his homeland. Genn stated he was committed to the protection of his Alliance allies even if it required sacrifice and that was something that Sylvanas did not understand about the living nor the Alliance. Anduin and Tyrande, who had overheard their conversation, were moved by Genn's words. Tyrande stated that even should her city fall, the Alliance will not be divided. However, she also bore bad news as recent reports stated that the night elves were making their stand at &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Horde began to besiege &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, an outpour of panicked refugees began to rush out from the portals in the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Though Anduin tried to keep the portals open for as long as he could, he nearly ordered closing them in order to safeguard Stormwind. Mia, however, still hadn't made it through to Stormwind, so Genn powered his way to the main portal. Although Anduin and Tyrande tried to restrain him from charging into the danger, Genn was determined not to let Sylvanas take away another thing he loved. After running through the main portal, &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii Starseeker&lt;/a&gt; and a mage called out to him. Together, the group helped an injured Mia and the night elven infant &lt;a href=\"Finel\"&gt;Finel&lt;/a&gt; get out from a pile of rubble. After Astarii healed Mia's wounds, Genn carried Mia and the infant and asked Astarii to come with them to safety. However, Astarii wanted to stay behind to comfort those who were about to die, leaving Genn to wish &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;her goddess&lt;/a&gt; to watch over her one last time. Genn carried Mia and Finel to safety in the last portal before ordering it closed. After he returned to Stormwind, Genn told Tyrande and the other Alliance leaders that the Horde had burned Teldrassil, but angrily vowed to make the Horde pay for their transgressions.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBattle for Lordaeron.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance retaliated with a massive assault on the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to reclaim the fallen human kingdom. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he notably swatted aside &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; after he knocked down &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, before being himself incapacitated by a troll shaman.\nGenn and the other Alliance leaders eventually managed to corner Sylvanas within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;Imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt;, with Genn disgusted by how she desecrated &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas'&lt;/a&gt; throne with her presence, and where King Anduin demanded her surrender. However, the Banshee Queen had lured them into a trap and escaped to her &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; while a massive torrent of Blight drowned the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Saved by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Genn and the other Alliance leaders returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; to plan their next move.\nKul Tiras.\nFollowing the battle at Lordaeron, the Horde infiltrated Stormwind and freed two &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; prisoners: &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;. Genn confronted them in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20District\"&gt;Cathedral District&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the Horde to run to the harbor, where they escaped to &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing an alliance between the Horde and the mighty troll empire, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; suggested an attempt to recruit &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and its legendary fleet in service of the Alliance. As she left for her homeland, Anduin asked Genn to help her and travel to Kul Tiras with a &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; escort in order to establish a foothold there.\nGenn's ship arrived shortly after Jaina and an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;alliance emissary&lt;/a&gt; were taken into custody by the Kul Tirans, but was given sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;Boralus Harbor&lt;/a&gt; by its harbormaster &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, who had also hired &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; to free the emissary as well. When Genn questioned why Cyrus was helping them despite the icy reception the Alliance had received from Kul Tiras thus far, Cyrus told the story of an old friend of his from the Second War who had tragically died from a wound he chose to ignore rather than ask others for help before it was too late. He reflected that Kul Tiras was in a similar state, with &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; blinded by poor advice from her &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;advisors&lt;/a&gt; to the nations internal problems, and that if they didn't reach out for help from the Alliance his beloved kingdom would meet the same fate as his friend. Genn agreed with that sentiment, having experienced the same humbling lesson during the fall of Gilneas, and that they would work together to open Katherine's eyes and show her that in unity there was a strength.\nAfter the Alliance had united or freed the various Houses of Kul Tiras and exposed the attempted plot of Priscilla Ashvane to bring down House Proudmoore and take over the kingdom, Genn finally approached Katherine at &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lord Admiral's Rest&lt;/a&gt; in front of &lt;a href=\"Daelin\"&gt;Daelin&lt;/a&gt;'s grave lamenting how alone she felt now. Genn gently reminded her that she still had Jaina. Turning to her fellow and last remaining living leader from the original Alliance of Lordaeron, Katherine rebutted by saying Jaina had betrayed her kingdom. Genn, in turn, insisted that Jaina simply did what she felt was right by following her heart in the hope of peace at the time and that she had suffered for it even now. Katherine admitted to Genn that Jaina's fate haunted her dreams, with Genn now beseeching that it wasn't too late to rescue her daughter, and for Katherine to take the chance Genn himself would have given anything for to hold his own son Liam again by bringing Jaina home.\nTides of Vengeance.\n&lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; sought to convince Anduin to commit Alliance forces to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; to retake it from the Horde, but with the war focused on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;; Anduin did not have the troops to do so. Despite Anduin's refusal Genn wouldn't stand by. Citing all the aid that the night elves had given to the Gilneans in the past, he sent Gilnean forces to Darkshore to help.\nDuring the Battle of Dazar'alor, Genn confronted King Rastakhan in his throne room and tried to convince him to surrender. Rastakhan refused, however, forcing the Alliance to battle him to the death. After the battle, Genn attended a war council with Anduin, Wyrmbane, Shaw, and Jaina to discuss their next move. When Anduin expressed regret over Rastakhan's death, Genn reassured him that it was an unavoidable casualty of war, and admitted that he respected Rastakhan as a true king for being willing to fight to the very end for the sake of his people.\nHe was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nRise of Azshara.\nAfter catching wind of the remains of the Horde fleet moving out to the sea, the Alliance assembled their fleets to finish the Horde's naval power, with Genn among their forces. Unbeknownst to the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; was using the &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;black blade&lt;/a&gt; to guide the Horde fleet and pursuing Alliance fleet towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where both fleets would be attacked by the naga under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s command after the seas were opened. Though surprised by their arrival in Nazjatar, Genn and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; rallied the Alliance together.\nRealizing that their shelter was barely defensible, and much of the Alliance army was in an even more precarious position, Jaina elected to search deeper into Nazjatar for a more defensive position. However, en route, the Alliance encountered &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Okani\"&gt;Blademaster Okani&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade Ankoan&lt;/a&gt;. As they ventured together, they were confronted with an astral projection of Queen Azshara, who boasted that Nazjatar would be the last thing they would see and promised that she would hold the waters around Nazjatar at bay as long as she remained entertained. Deciding to work together, the Waveblade Ankoan allowed the Alliance to regroup and reinforce their base of &lt;a href=\"Mezzamere\"&gt;Mezzamere&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Alliance spies caught wind of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; planning to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin sought Jaina's aid to rescue him, which Jaina accepted due to recognizing that she owed Baine for returning Derek to her. Unaware of her mission, Genn asked Jaina what had transpired when she returned causing Jaina to reveal that she and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; had sneaked into Orgrimmar and while there joined with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Baine from being assassinated. Initially outraged at Jaina and Anduin for saving a leader of the Horde, Jaina was able to calm him down by pointing out that they had a common enemy. Remarking that Sylvanas and Azshara wanted the Alliance and the Horde at each other's throats, Jaina suggested that they direct their efforts against Azshara instead of the Horde. She further encouraged that it would buy time for Saurfang's rebellion to take root. Though wary Genn agreed but warned her that if the Horde turned against them, they will answer for it.\nSeeking to gain control of the Tidestone away from Azshara, Jaina directed &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the champion to investigate the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; for anything potent enough to counter Azshara's sorcery. After Jaina learned that the &lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt; were obtained, she declared it an amazing find and that with them they could assault the guardian of the Tidestone and secure it. Declaring that now was the time to act, Jaina directed the Alliance to take the fight to the naga. En route, however, the Alliance encountered Horde forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and after a brief argument, both sides agreed to fight together against Azshara's forces, where during the fighting Genn worked side by side with Lor'themar. After the Javelins of Suramar were used to shatter the Tidestone's protective barrier around &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Zharessa\"&gt;Lady Zharessa&lt;/a&gt;, Genn joined the fight against Azshara's champion. After Jaina and Thalyssra combined their magics in order to use the Tidestone to open the way to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina warned that they couldn't underestimate Azshara as she was one of the most powerful sorceresses alive but declared, nevertheless, that she must be defeated. However, Lor'themar and Jaina argued about which side would deal the final blow to the Queen only to be interrupted by Azshara herself, who formally invited all of them to enter her palace.\nGenn was later informed of Azshara's defeat and was witness to Lor'themar declaring it a hollow victory as not only did Azshara survive, but N'Zoth was freed. In response, Jaina declared that the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; had kept them distracted and that divided they had no hope against N'Zoth. Agreeing with Jaina's assessment Lor'themar revealed to her his vow to tell his people of what transpired in Nazjatar, of how Azshara fell because the Horde and Alliance stood together, of the rising threat of N'Zoth, and his promise to take his place besides Saurfang and Thrall.\nGenn was present at Anduin's side when his and Saurfang's combined forces marched on &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of assaulting the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;main gates&lt;/a&gt;, Greymane and his forces were tasked to flank the city alongside the &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Gate\"&gt;western gate&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; between Sylvanas and Sarufang and ending the war between the two factions, Genn could be seen expressing his outrage over not only how Sylvanas escaped, but by how lightly he feels the Horde has been punished for their war crimes. When Genn returned to the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\", Genn shared with Mathias Shaw his concerns about how not only are Sylvanas and her agents still at large but also how the Horde has become united once again. Shaw suggested they watch the Horde closely and inform King Anduin if there is a need for action.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Genn was present at Stormwind Embassy during the peace treaty. He witnessed Tyrande interrupt Anduin's speech, saying the call for vengeance was still strong, that the Horde had yet to answer for their crimes and that they were untrustworthy, asking Anduin how he would handle it if Stormwind fell. After she concluded her speech by calling Anduin's faith in the Horde naive, Genn told Anduin that there was truth in her words. He further remarked that while peace was on the table today, soon enough the Horde would sound their drums and march for war, and when that day comes, no scrap of parchment would hold them back. Genn also believed that in order to preserve peace, the Alliance must prepare for war.\nShadows Rising.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Genn attended a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; in the crypt of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, in which the corpses of retrieved of members suggested that &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s were on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. This knowledge caused Turalyon to wonder if Sylvanas sought vengeance on &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; for pulling her support to the Banshee Queen, while Genn believed that Talanji was still working with Sylvanas and was providing her shelter on the island. Anduin then declared Turalyon as the Lord Commander of the Alliance forces, with the task of finding &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and to use whatever means he must, something that Genn saw as a wise choice.\nHe was later informed by Jaina, that Turalyon and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had uncovered that Sylvanas's &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; were heading to Zandalar.\nShadowlands.\nGenn was present in &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed Tyrande's speech about Horde's defeat in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Sylvanas used the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; to shatter the barrier between Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, both Genn and Anduin were at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. Genn was forced to watch helplessly as two &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped Anduin, and while he attempted to stop them, they easily took him away to the Shadowlands. Realizing Sylvanas was responsible, he howled her name in helpless rage.\nAccording to Genn, Sylvanas deliberately left him behind, apparently seeking to torment him with the loss of yet another son. He vowed to do whatever he could to find Anduin and the other leaders. He later met with the other Alliance leaders and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; to discuss their next course of action.\nOnce released from the [[Maw, [[Jaina Proudmoore]] sent reports to Genn to keep him informed of events in the Shadowlands, including of how Anduin was [[Domination|Dominated]] by [[Zovaal|the Jailer]] and later managed to break free. After the Jailer's defeat, Genn traveled to [[Oribos]] to attend Sylvanas' trial, which ended with Tyrande sending her to the [[Maw]] to free all of the souls trapped therein. Genn was not satisfied with Sylvanas' fate, refusing to believe that she felt remorse for her crimes and arguing that both she and the rest of the Horde still had much to answer for with respect to Teldrassil, Gilneas, and his son. However, he decided to focus his efforts on helping Anduin recover from his trauma first and foremost. Before going home, Genn stayed with Anduin for a time in the [[Crucible (Oribos)|Crucible]] atop Oribos and told the younger king not to blame himself for the things the Jailer had made him do. Anduin tried to argue that he should've been stronger, but Genn replied that he was the strongest man he knew. Anduin stated that he couldn't return to Azeroth yet and that he trusted Turalyon to watch over the Alliance and Genn to watch over their loved ones in his absence. Genn protested at first, arguing that Stormwind's people needed him, but then accepted Anduin's decision and asked him to take the time he needed and come home when he was ready.\nThe [[blood elf]] regent lord [[Lor'themar Theron]] also approached Genn to tell him that he hoped Sylvanas' fate would bring the Alliance some peace. Genn replied that the regent lord should ask the souls of Sylvanas' victims if they felt peace and that peace was something he himself would never know as long as Liam's killer endured. He then sardonically asked Lor'themar if he hoped Sylvanas would come back from the Maw to serve as his [[Ranger-General|ranger-general]] or [[warchief]] again. Lor'themar defended himself by saying that although he'd once admired Sylvanas as his hero and friend, the banshee that almost led the Horde to ruin had been neither of those things. Genn replied that, if so, Lor'themar shouldn't have followed her commands. The king and regent lord then curtly bid each other good day.\nSometime later, Alliance spies discovered that the [[Forsaken]] were mustering in [[Tirisfal Glades]], with [[Calia Menethil]] amongst them. Not knowing what they were up to, he instructed Alliance champions to don a disguise and see what they could discover. Though Calia and [[Dark Ranger Velonara]] both saw this disguise, they kept silent on the matter, and accepted the aid of the Alliance as part of their efforts to reclaim their territory. After the Forsaken reclaimed the [[Ruins of Lordaeron]], they established a new [[Desolate Council]] consisting of [[Lilian Voss]], Calia Menethil, [[Deathstalker Commander Belmont]], Dark Ranger Velonara, and [[Master Apothecary Faranell]] to lead them. Calia thanked the Alliance champions for their efforts in this endeavor and revealed her intention of proposing to her fellow council members the withdrawal of Forsaken troops from the [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Kingdom of Gilneas]]. The knowledge that the Forsaken had reestablished themselves and that Calia was seeking to return his kingdom to him deeply surprised Genn.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Genn received an invitation to the wedding of [[Lor'themar Theron]] and [[Thalyssra]], but refused to attend, and [[Mia Greymane|Mia]] elected to go in his stead. The [[Forsaken]] delegation consisting of [[Derek Proudmoore]], [[Calia Menethil]], and [[Lilian Voss]] were uncomfortable at Genn's rejection but Calia noted that it was a pleasure to see the queen again.\nDragonflight.\nWith the return of the [[Dragon Isles]], and the Alliance answering to the call of the [[Dragon Aspects]], Genn was present with [[Turalyon]] and [[Mathias Shaw]] at the [[Stormwind Harbor]], where the [[Dragonscale Expedition|expedition]] was preparing to depart. He discussed with the Spymaster about [[Wrathion]] and his inquiries regarding Anduin, and after hearing the report, he replied that the king could not be found before he wished to, and that they had only to wait for him patiently. He is also revealed to be in contact with [[Baine Bloodhoof]], keeping the tauren chieftain informed about updates regarding Anduin.\nAbilities.\nGenn Greymane fights alongside Varian Wrynn at Stormwind Keep. Only Varian's death is needed for the achievement.\nPersonality.\nGenn Greymane is one of arguably the most complicated Alliance leaders - while one of the most hostile to the Horde and its interests, he is also one of those who has undergone the most changes, physically and emotionally, and the most significant character development. In the [[Second War]], he was arrogant and impetuous, very reluctant to support [[Anduin Lothar]] and the [[Alliance]] he helped establish between the [[Seven Kingdoms]], even after hearing of Stormwind's fate and the [[orcish]] invasion, and provided only token support to their efforts in [[Lordaeron]] and later [[Draenor]]. Shortly afterwards, he sealed off [[Gilneas]] in a strictly isolationist policy after they left the Alliance, believing that their people neither wanted nor needed the support of the other kingdoms, refusing even to support his neighbors against the [[Scourge]] in the [[Third War]].\nThe [[Cataclysm]] with its destruction of the [[Greymane Wall]], allowing for the Horde and [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] to invade Gilnean lands, and Genn's subsequent transformation into a [[worgen]] himself seemed to have marked the beginning of a major personality change, especially after the death of his only son and heir [[Liam Greymane]]. While he was filled with a deep and overwhelmingly loathing of the Forsaken and Sylvanas in particular, he was also shaken from his previous detached apathy, and filled with a sense of greater purpose - to rejoin the Alliance he once abandoned and to reclaim the [[Kingdom of Gilneas]] from the Horde. Despite having likely no knowledge of the night elves as a people and culture, he was able to quickly bond with them, as they were responsible for saving the remnants of his people and giving them a second home in [[Darnassus]], especially after [[Talar Oaktalon]] helped save his wife and daughter during their stormy voyage to [[Teldrassil]]. [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] and [[Malfurion Stormrage]] asked Genn for help at [[Lor'danel]] and against the Horde in [[Kalimdor]], which he was more than eager to provide.\n[[Varian Wrynn]]'s arrival in Darnassus, however, stirred old and bitter memories between the two leaders, who had known each other since the Second War, and despite Genn's initial attempts to reconcile with him, he refused to forgive Genn for abandoning the rest of the Alliance afterwards, and rejected all notions of welcoming them back into their ranks. Only after Genn helped Varian reach balance within himself using the [[Ritual of Balance]] did the two leaders begin to slowly see each other as friends, and together, they were able to cooperate and drive [[Garrosh Hellscream]]'s invaders from [[Ashenvale]], saving the night elves when even Tyrande Whisperwind and her daughter [[Shandris Feathermoon]] could not turn the tide. Afterwards, Genn apparently left the [[Howling Oak]] and moved to [[Stormwind Keep]], serving as a personal advisor to Varian in his capital, from where they organized Alliance forces during the rest of the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]]. While he was a staunch supporter of the Alliance henceforth, his rage at the Horde and Sylvanas did not abate even after the events of [[Pandaria]], when he proposed placing all the Horde leaders on trial at the end of the [[Alliance-Horde war]], as he deemed all of them guilty of enabling Garrosh's crimes or even launching their own attacks against the Alliance.\nAfter participating in the [[Battle for Broken Shore]], Genn witnessed Sylvanas Windrunner retreating her forces, and tried to save Varian as a [[fel reaver]] prevented their escape, but Varian instead gave him his last letter to Anduin, and Genn howled in impotent rage as he heard Varian's final dying scream of agony. He then immediately organized the other Gilneans to pursue [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] to [[Stormheim]] aboard the \"[[Skyfire]]\", and personally faced Sylvanas, shattering her [[Soulcage]] and preventing her from salvaging the [[Forsaken]]'s future, believing that his son had been avenged, but further deepening their personal enmity. His pain and rage would be eased, if only slightly, after he returned to the Broken Shore with [[Velen]] and gave [[Shalamayne]] to [[Anduin Wrynn]], witnessing him accepting his responsibilities as the rightful King of Stormwind.\nGenn remained in Stormwind and became a close advisor to Anduin, lending his vast experience to the younger ruler, admitting that he had a \"hole in his heart\" where Liam used to be, which he attempted to fill with his hatred for Sylvanas, but later found another purpose in guiding Anduin, who reminded him of Liam. Despite his shock at Anduin inviting [[Alonsus Faol]] to the [[Cathedral of Light]], he nevertheless accompanied him to [[Stromgarde Keep]], where Sylvanas slew most of the Forsaken who met with the Alliance. He realized, however, when he observed the Forsaken that not all of them were broken by their terrible ordeals, and apologized to Anduin for having judged them all as monsters. Sylvanas later attempted to use Genn's hatred for her to her advantage during the [[War of the Thorns]], believing his wanting to assault Gilneas or Lordaeron would splinter the Alliance, but it largely backfired when Genn, no longer the selfish man and ruler he once was, vowed to place the interests of the night elf people before his own. After losing his second home, along with the lives of most of the Darnassian night elves and very nearly his wife [[Mia Greymane]] in the Burning of Teldrassil, Genn's hatred for Sylvanas and the Horde was freshly rekindled, and he sent most of his forces to the [[Battle for Darkshore]] when even Anduin was unable to directly aid them. At [[Kul Tiras]], where Gilnean sailors had settled long ago, Genn helped [[Katherine Proudmoore]] reconcile with her estranged daughter [[Jaina Proudmoore]] after telling her of how he would give anything to hold Liam again. Although he cooperated with [[Lor'themar Theron]] and [[Thalyssra]] in Nazjatar, he seemed to retain his intense skepticism towards the idea of lasting peace with the Horde, apparently agreeing with Tyrande and gravely warning Anduin that even without Sylvanas, they would eventually march against them.\nInterview with James Waugh.\nGenn's personality in-game seems drastically different from that shown in the novels, appearing as a kinder, understanding ruler instead of the gruff, impatient king. This was addressed and explained during an interview:\nQuotes.\n[[Hallow's End]].\n[[File:Hallow's End Genn Greymane2.png|thumb|Genn celebrates Hallow's End.]]\nLegion.\nGossip.\nGilneas demands justice!\nWe must act swiftly if we wish to apprehend the Banshee Queen.\nAre you prepared to answer the call of duty, &lt;class&gt;?\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGossip.\nRemain vigilant, &lt;name&gt;.

He is classified as a [[fighter]], [[hunter]], and scoundrel.\nAppearance.\nGenn Greymane is a grizzled, bearish man with fading gray hair and blue eyes. From \"Legion\" onward, his hair has faded completely to white.\nIn his original appearance from \"Cataclysm\", Greymane used [[:File:Genn Gilneas.jpg|a generic human model with a black suit and a golden cloak]]. This inspired a few pieces of artwork, as can be found [[:File:King Genn Greymane TCG.jpg|in the TCG]] and [[:File:Chronicle3 Genn and Liam.jpg|in \"Chronicle Volume 3\"]]. In \"[[Curse of the Worgen]]\", he wore [[:File:CurseWorgen4CoverSample.jpg|a matching but more detailed, grey suit with a golden trim]]. In \"[[World of Warcraft: Legion|Legion]]\", Genn's hair and beard were trimmed, and Genn's model was finally and retroactively [[:File:Genn Greymane legion model.jpg|updated to match his \"Curse of the Worgen\" depiction]]. In \"Legion\" onward, [[:File:Gennlegion.png|his suit is brown with a silver trim]].\n[[:File:Glowei Worgen Greymane.jpg|His worgen form's original art]] by [[Wei Wang]] depicted him with gray-white fur and blue eyes, akin to his human form. In-game, he initially used [[:File:Genn Greymane worgen form.jpg|a generic worgen model with dark fur and golden eyes]], which \"Chronicle Volume 3\"'s [[:File:Chronicle3 Genn and Liam.jpg|art matches]]. In \"Legion\", [[:File:Genncinematic.png|Greymane's model]] has a stark white fur, but still with golden eyes. In the \"[[World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth|Battle for Azeroth]]\" cinematic, Genn matches exactly [[:File:Glowei Worgen Greymane.jpg|his original art]] by Wei Wang, with a [[:File:Greymane and Anduin - Battle for Azeroth.jpg|marine blue outfit]].\nIn \"[[Heroes of the Storm]]\", [[:File:Greymane HotS Art.jpg|Greymane is depicted]] with pointy werewolf ears, and his worgen form has dark fur and blue eyes.\nIn \"[[Hearthstone (game)|Hearthstone]]\", he is depicted [[:File:Genn Greymane HS.jpg|with his \"Heroes of the Storm\" outfit but with gray-white fur]].\nIn Hearthstone.\nGenn Greymane appears as in the \"[[Hearthstone: The Witchwood|The Witchwood]]\" expansion for \"[[Hearthstone (game)|Hearthstone]]\".

Now, they were directed to utterly wipe out the planet's other most powerful race, the draenei, who had been fleeing the Legion's wrath for millennia by moving to new worlds when they had been discovered.\nWith relatively little effort due to the vastly larger numbers of the united clans and newly-gained powers, the Horde succeeded in pushing the draenei back from many of their major settlements and strongholds. Although confused by the orcs' sudden aggression and drive to make war on them, the draenei nonetheless did their best to preserve their civilization. Ultimately, however, they were overwhelmed and forced back to their last bastion and capital in the form of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that there existed no hope of overcoming their foes, the draenei leader &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; reluctantly led a group of &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s into hiding away from the battle. Utilizing their new demonic abilities, the orcs breached and sacked the city.\nIn the period following the Horde's victory over the draenei, and believing that no more of their adversaries remained, the orcs turned their attention to a new conquest, in the form of the distant planet of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPact with the Legion.\nIn the years following the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; flight from their home planet of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to escape the wrath of their brethren who had joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; dedicated himself to hunting down these exiles, feeling betrayed at &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;'s refusal to accept &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' 'gift'. Having pursued Velen's draenei across many worlds, Kil'jaeden decided to employ a new strategy when his agent &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; discovered their presence on the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. So far, each time the archdemon had sent the Burning Legion directly after the draenei, Velen's exiles had simply left their planet aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". Kil'jaeden now wanted to attack them with a less obvious threat, one which would have them stand their ground instead of flee. He planned to use one of Draenor's native species\u2014the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014to destroy Argus's exiles, believing that the draenei would not realize the threat until it was too late.\nTo this end, the demon lord contacted the ambitious chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, and through deception convinced him to rally the other orc clans. Appearing to the elder &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; first as his deceased wife &lt;a href=\"Rulkan\"&gt;Rulkan&lt;/a&gt; and then directly as himself, Kil'jaeden was able to convince Ner'zhul that the draenei were, in fact, plotting the wholesale destruction of the orcs and that they needed to be crushed swiftly before it was too late. Ner'zhul was respected among the orcish clans, and through the advice of their shaman each chieftain eventually followed his orders to militarize and prepare for conflict against those they now perceived as malevolent invaders plotting to destroy them. Soon orcish raiders began killing isolated draenei hunting parties to hone their skills and equipment, with &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; leading the charge.\nKil'jaeden's ruse initially worked - when Velen heard of the orcs' sudden aggressiveness, the prophet didn't take it as proof of demonic corruption, but as a dire misunderstanding to clear up. Thinking that things could no longer continue as they used to and that orc and draenei could no longer live in distant familiarity with one another, Velen decided to leave &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; for a pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, inviting Ner'zhul to join him. Velen thought that there were now no other alternatives than making the orcs their allies instead of their enemies, and he wanted to show them the truth of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt; sleeping in the orcs' revered Mountain of Spirits. Unfortunately, Ner'zhul refused the offer thought doubt started creeping up in his mind. &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; intercepted Velen's pilgrims instead, taking for the nascent &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; two shards of the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt; that they transported: the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Heart of Fury&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Star\"&gt;Brilliant Star&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs skirmishes continued happening, at some point the orcish shaman stopped hearing from the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s, depriving them of their spiritual powers. This left the orcs at a disadvantage against the draenei &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and what were supposed to be certain victories for the orcs turned to humiliating defeats against smaller draenei parties. &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; himself nearly died in such failed ambush, only spared after the draenei leader &lt;a href=\"Restalaan\"&gt;Restalaan&lt;/a&gt; recognized him as the young orc he had welcomed to &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt; years earlier.\nUltimately, Ner'zhul discovered Kil'jaeden's deception but was unable to stop events already in motion as his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; officially took his place, the warlock having actually been working for the demon for a long time. Gul'dan soon began to spread the Burning Legion's demonic influence to the other orcish clans. He promoted Blackhand as the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; leader of the united Horde, and oversaw the creation of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who wielded the demons' power as their own instead of relying on fickle spirits as the shaman of old did. The first orc warlocks other than Gul'dan were from the Blackrock clan, but more and more shaman volunteered for warlock training to replace their lost elemental powers. Blackhand also ordered the new warlocks to artificially age every orcish child in order to bolster the ranks of the Horde with a plethora of fresh soldiers.\nWar and corruption.\nThe hidden city of &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt; was the first major draenei settlement to fall to the new Horde's united warriors and warlocks. Gul'dan eventually convinced the other clans to consume the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Lord\"&gt;Pit Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. Through his efforts with &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;:the Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan severed the orcs' ties to their ancestors and &lt;a href=\"Cyrukh%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;the elements&lt;/a&gt; at what would then become known as the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving overseen the creation of numerous warlocks among the orcish race as well as some &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, Gul'dan now formed the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, consisting exclusively of the most powerful warlocks, to direct the Horde behind the scenes and commune with their demon masters. As the orcs began to launch their first major attacks on draenei territory, the Shadow Council ensured that the Legion's corruption would be left in their wake, often seen in the form of an ominous red mist. Even those orcs who had refrained from consuming the demon blood, such as the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, began showing signs of corruption, such as their skin turning from the normal brown to a bright green.\nThis corruption emanating from the Horde's presence also affected many of the draenei who survived the initial attacks, often causing them to become mutated &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; or insane &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s. Even the very land of Draenor succumbed to the demonic taint. As more and more orcs began to wield warlock magics, the gentle fields and streams of the world began to blacken and fade. The vast prairies withered away, leaving only red barren soil. The demon energies were slowly killing the world. In order to make sure there would be no coming back for the orcs, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and Gul'dan had a barrier put around Oshu'gun which prevented the ancestral spirits and K'ure from making contact with the outside world. Orcs were also forbidden on &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s orders to ever return to the mountain, to make sure none could realize the deception. To make sure the order was properly enforced, Kil'jaeden even had &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s guarding Oshu'gun against would-be visitors. This effectively outlawed &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism and its practice.\nMeanwhile, the draenei, unable to counter the Horde's vastly larger numbers and newly-acquired powers, were in a constant state of retreat. They were pushed farther and farther back, with major bases like &lt;a href=\"Tuurem\"&gt;Tuurem&lt;/a&gt; falling rapidly to the Horde's onslaught. Fully intending to drive the draenei to extinction, as ordered by their master Kil'jaeden, the orcs showed no mercy to any they encountered as they pushed deeper into their enemies' lands. Even the spiritual center of the draenei, the sacred &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, was lost when Gul'dan ordered it to be conquered. Karabor wasn't their capital, but the Horde wanted it destroyed in order to shatter the draenei as a people, destroy everything that meant anything to them.\nGul'dan and the Shadow Council decided to ignore the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;'s warnings about the Dark Star, an ancient god of the Void that was actually the fallen &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt;. They conducted a ritual to call on the Dark Star in their war against the draenei and channeled it at Karabor. A pillar of &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energy ripped through the heavens and slammed down on Karabor, driving many draenei defenders to madness while many others died instantly. Velen called on his powers to keep the Void at bay and rally the survivors to Karabor's harbor, but the Dark Star had forever darkened Karabor, and it became known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; and was taken by the orcs.\nEventually, one of the last bastions of resistance remaining was the draenei capital of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;.\nFall of Shattrath.\nUnderstanding that they could not succeed in defeating the Horde, Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; was reluctantly convinced to flee the city before it fell, along with a small group of refugees, while enough forces stayed behind to give the impression that the draenei had made their last stand in the city. Despite a stalwart defense, and the best efforts of many of the draenei people's best champions such as &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, Shattrath City was breached, and the orcs flooded in. As &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s crashed into the city's structure, and the warlocks' red mist seemingly cut off the draenei paladins' and priests' connection to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; itself, Shattrath's defenses collapsed. The majority of the capital's inhabitants were slain either during or after the battle.\nDuring the siege of Shattrath, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Guard%20Porung\"&gt;Porung&lt;/a&gt; stormed an enclave of draenei paladins who had barricaded themselves within a corner of the city. He single-handedly slaughtered the defenders, but suffered a grave injury.\nWith Shattrath's fall, many &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; fled to Auchindoun in hopes of defending it from the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; led the defense against the Horde's assault led by &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt;. As the draenei defenders gained the advantage, the Shadow Council warlocks summoned &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt; to break their offense, and the shockwave on its arrival ripped the earth asunder. Many draenei were killed, and Auchindoun was blasted apart. Waves of destructive energy rolled out and leveled the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;surrounding forest&lt;/a&gt;. Maladaar and a handful of his draenei used their magics to shield themselves from the blast. But though they survived, they no longer had the numbers to resist the Shadow Council. Teron'gor and his warlocks overwhelmed the draenei and bound them in chains, and contained Murmur deep within Auchindoun as well.\nKil'jaeden, upon hearing of the city's fall and the apparent extinction of the draenei, was exultant at finally having gained vengeance on those he considered to have betrayed him. Unbeknownst to Kil'jaeden or the Horde, however, Velen and his group of survivors had escaped the slaughter. The draenei leader led what was left of his people into hiding in the region of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the orcs to believe they had been wiped out. Though they had suffered irreparable damage in the conflict, the draenei survivors retained their faith in the Light and maintained hope for the future of their race.\nAftermath.\nOnce Shattrath fell, the Horde turned its attention to the other civilizations of Draenor, which Warchief Blackhand had always planned to conquer. Clans burned down the forest island of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, the last bastion of the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, and killed every &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; they could find. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;, orcs laid siege to the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; where they slaughtered the &lt;a href=\"high%20arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; before turning on their outcast allies, only a few of which survived. Other orcs were tasked with wiping out the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s who hadn't joined the Horde. The &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; was sacked, many &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s including &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt; being slain in the process.\nKil'jaeden, however, was finished with the orcs; having used them to do his bidding, there remained no reason to spend any more time on them. The Horde was left alone with its desiccated world, in a period that would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Dying%20Time\"&gt;Dying Time&lt;/a&gt;, a period of disease, mass starvation and internal conflicts. The orcs suffered more casualties during this period than during the entire conflict before it. The clans started raiding one another for resources, with Blackhand barely able to maintain peace by ordering them to submit their finest warriors for &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;controlled, one-on-one or small party fights&lt;/a&gt; in public display. The winners would receive food from the losing clan, and a supply of pure water as well as honor and fame. Then one day, anxious with the lack of communication from his former demonic master, Gul'dan was suddenly contacted by a different entity: a powerful sorcerer on another planet named &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Medivh's aid, the Horde began construction of a gateway, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which they were told would allow them to reach a new world ripe for conquest. They built a long road leading from the heart of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the Portal, paved with the bones of the draenei. The orcs even called it the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt; as a reminder of their victory over their enemies. Under the instructions of Medivh (who was, in fact, under the sway of the Burning Legion's master &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;) the portal was eventually completed. To open it, nearly all of the Horde's draenei prisoners that still lived were brought to the base of the portal. The moment the ritual began, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; instantly drained all of their life essences, creating the massive spike of power needed to bridge the distance between the two worlds. Meanwhile, Medivh called on his powers as a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; to rip open the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian side of the rift in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;. With that, the Orcish Horde began &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;its invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the world of Azeroth.\nIn hiding, the draenei were still affected as the planet continued to suffer from demonic influence. Many degenerated into &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lost%20one\"&gt;lost one&lt;/a&gt;s, and lost their ability to wield the Light as their connection to it became severed. This led many former draenei to lose faith in the Light altogether and despair. &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; would later teach many broken, including the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Ashtongue&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, the ways of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism.\nDecades later, Velen would lead a raid on the once-&lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; controlled ship of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\". Using it to escape &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; (what Draenor had become known as) the draenei soon learned that the ship had been sabotaged by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; they had seized it from. Ultimately, it crash-landed on the planet of Azeroth, and the draenei, emerging battered but intact into the new world, were aided by and joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Since their arrival on the new world, the draenei remain dedicated in their opposition to the Legion, further bolstered by the sacrifices of their brethren on Draenor.\nLegacy.\nThe crimes committed by the orc warriors against the countless innocent draenei would continue to haunt many veterans even after &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; led them back to their traditional and shamanistic roots. &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; in particular claims that the corrupted orcs had no reservations about killing draenei children. The sound of their screams apparently reminded him of swine being slaughtered for their meat.\nNot all orcs were corrupt -- such as &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaruk%20Bloodfyre\"&gt;Jaruk Bloodfyre&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, who saved a draenei girl named &lt;a href=\"Leena\"&gt;Leena&lt;/a&gt;.\nForces.\nThere were significantly fewer &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; than united orcs. The orcish ranks were swelled up by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and artificially-aged warriors.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Users also pointed out that the guild name Kali Compton clearly violate Blizzard's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.blizzard.com/support/wowgm/%3Fid%3Dagm01723p\"&gt;naming policy&lt;/a&gt;, including both a real-world reference, and the name of a Hindu deity.\nThe official Blizzard response to the uproar:\nOriginally Posted by Ordinn\nOver the weekend, a thread was posted on the Tichondrius realm forum warning Horde players of certain guilds and characters they should look out for while adventuring. This thread contained information on a Blizzard employee\u2019s guild, and conjecture was made on which character that employee played. This thread was deleted, and all subsequent threads created on this topic were closed. Several other threads containing references to this guild were also deleted, and a few players were wrongly suspended or banned from the forums for participating in these threads. We would like to correct this mistake. If you feel you were wrongly banned or suspended from the forums, please email your character name and the name of the realm you play on to wowreportedpost@blizzard.com. Furthermore, please note that we are taking measures to ensure this does not happen again.\nWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this caused and thank you for your understanding and patience.\nIn addition, as part of our normal name-review process, the aforementioned guild\u2019s name was reviewed last week and was found to be in violation of World of Warcraft\u2019s naming policy. The name violates the rule dealing with real-world references, and is subject to the same procedure as other guilds. Therefore, the guild will be disbanded and reimbursed for their tabard, and will have to re-form using a different name. Please note that these are two separate issues that have the unfortunate coincidence of requiring attention at the same time.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//imdb.com/name/nm1981379/filmoyear\"&gt;Filmology&lt;/a&gt; - Link to game credits."}

Geomancy is a practice of divination and &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; combat native to several &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany races and factions on Azeroth have geomancers, including &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; (including the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Head%20tribe\"&gt;Death's Head tribe&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult.\nGeomantic races and factions.\nOgres.\nThe ogres of practice geomancy on a large scale.\nTroggs.\nTrogg geomancers practice a fairly basic form of geomancy in comparison to races such as the pandaren and quilboar. It's primarily aggressive and unknown whether the emphasis on spiritual affinity is as relevant to their people. They are particularly talented with the element of fire.\nQuilboar.\nThe quilboar utilize their elemental understanding to combat the press of orcish settlements upon their native lands. The predominant religious ruling group of the quilboar, the Death's Head, wields an impressive legion of geomantic quilboars. Like the pandaren, the geomancers of the quilboar use all elements in relative amounts.\nKobolds.\nKobolds also practice a fairly basic level of geomancy, much like the troggs. It is likely that the kobolds invested in this study and beliefs due to their underground dwellings and familiarity with stone and earth. Like troggs, kobold geomancers are particularly gifted with fire.\nIn the RPG.\nPandaren.\nThe spirits of the land are very real and sometimes very dangerous. The sacred duty of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; geomancers is to understand the lay of the land, to study the natural terrain for clues as to the nature and disposition of the spirits within it. Yet the geomancers do more than simply examine the spirits of the lands; they also work to appease them. Through the use of rituals, songs, and sacrifices, the geomancers attempt to propitiate the spirits, lulling them into complacency with attention and honor.\nShould this process fail, the geomancers are not above manipulating the very nature of the spirits. Geomancers teach that the land is a reflection of the spirits, but the spirits are also a reflection of the land. When the spirit changes, the land around it changes as well; but more importantly, when the land changes, the spirit may also. So, the geomancers guide their clans in reforming the land around them, remaking it into a suitable place not only to dwell, but to help make the spirit into a friendlier entity.\nIn combat, the normally peaceful geomancers can be fierce. The spirits of the land, beholden to the geomancers for their happiness, are only too willing to fight on their behalf. Those who run afoul of geomancers in battle find that the very land may rise up, taking the form of rock and stone elementals. The legends still speak of geomancers capable of calling up the earth to destroy the settlements of their enemies with devastating earthquakes. A known pandaren geomancer is &lt;a href=\"Raiden\"&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental beliefs.\nGeomancy is an aggressive practice, the power drawn from the elements used offensively as opposed to defensively. A geomancer has the ability to manipulate the spirits of nature into a devastating power through ritualistic dance and rune-making, often done in the earth itself. These rituals are done in attempts to earn the trust and honor of the earth, not unlike a shaman's converse with the spirits of the elements, so that a fully-fledged geomantic warrior may effectively call upon these powers.\nIt is in this belief system that geomancers strive to reform the land to appease both their spirits and the earth's. \nDifference from shamanism.\nThe main difference between a geomancer and a shaman is in fighting style and method through which the trust of the elements is gained. A shaman speaks directly with the elemental spirits, whereas a geomancer uses forms of devotion dances and rune-making to impress the elements as a whole.\nWarcraft III April Fools.\n\"Much like the night elf druids, the pandaren mystics developed an affinity for the spirits of the earth. These hearty mystics developed the practice of geomancy - and learned to wield the fury of the earth by appeasing the restless elemental spirits. Many geomancers have been known to summon various types of rock and stone elementals, and great geomancers have even caused catastrophic earthquakes to swallow enemy armies.\"\nInspiration.\nGeomancy (from Old French geomancie &lt; Late Latin \"ge\u014dmantia\" &lt; Late Ancient Greek \"\u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1/ge\u014dmante\u00eda\" &lt; \"\u03b3\u1fc6/g\u00ea\", \"earth\" + \"\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1/mante\u00eda\", \"divination\") from the eponymous \"ilm al-raml\" (\"the science of sand\"), is a method of divination that interprets markings on the ground, or how handfuls of dirt land when someone tosses them. The Arabic tradition consists of sketching sixteen random lines of dots in sand.\nIn Africa one traditional form of geomancy consists of throwing handfuls of dirt in the air and observing how the dirt falls. In West Africa, geomancy involves a mouse as the agent of the earth spirit. \nIn China, the diviner may enter a trance and make markings on the ground that are interpreted by an associate."}

Malone's Expedition Journal\" as well as the \"Wonders of Un'Goro\" web series.\nBiography.\nWeek 1-2.\nDoyle and his assistant, Eddie, first met at a tavern in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, where the professor was telling everyone about a semi-mythical beast \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Galvadon\"&gt;Galvadon&lt;/a&gt;, the last existing &lt;a href=\"kaleidosaur\"&gt;kaleidosaur&lt;/a&gt; specimen in all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 dwelling in the depths of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. When Eddie found out that Doyle was looking for an assistant to film the trip, he jumped at the chance.\nAfter a brief stop in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; where Eddie got attacked by and mugged, the expedition reached the rim of Un'Goro and made their way down into the crater. After a \"bird incident\" involving Eddie trying to capture a Jeweled Macaw parrot, the group set up camp and the expedition leader, &lt;a href=\"Elise%20Starseeker\"&gt;Elise Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;, gave a speech explaining Un'Goro's beauty, wonder and extreme danger. Doyle was chasing a huge butterfly during the lecture, but Eddie took notes of the main points. Shortly after, Elise wanted to seek shelter due to the sky looking odd, but Professor Doyle instead wished to take a few quick shots to see what they would be able to discover.\nHowever, Doyle and Eddie had just started filming when a massive lightning storm hit. Due to the storm, a mudslide, tree uprooting, cliff drop, and unfortunate trouser soiling, the two were separated from the rest of the expedition. Since the camera survived, Doyle decided to do some more filming and showcased a bush of fire thistle and lillyfeather he had found that morning, naming it the first \"Doyle Discovery\" before being immediately covered in venomous plant darts.\nThe following day, Doyle could move again. He was entirely uncoordinated and hard to understand, but as that's normal Eddie took it for a good sign. Since the professor's G.G.P.S. was going haywire and since Eddie's compass was malfunctioning, the two decided to press on, marvelling at the enormous plants and trees, which Doyle claimed had not been described by science. A few days later, the two managed to escape the plants chasing them and found themselves in a humid marsh where they were captured by \"&lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;hideous lizard people&lt;/a&gt;\". Eddie remembered Professor Starseeker's advice to be friendly to the natives and gave his compass to the creatures as a gift. The beings seemed impressed before tying Eddie and Doyle up and eating their provisions. Shortly after, however, the two were rescued by a tribe of friendly turtle people known as &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s. Doyle was excited to meet an undiscovered tribe, while Eddie was simply happy to meet something that wasn't trying to eat them. At the campfire, Eddie asked the tortollan leader &lt;a href=\"Spiritsinger%20Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; for help finding the rest of the expedition, but she simply smiled and said, \"The greatest virtue is patience\". Eddie suspected that she was going to lead them to a hilltop village he spotted before they made camp.\nWeek 3-4.\nTwo days later, Doyle and Eddie were led to the village by the tortollans as expected, and discovered that it was full of strange, primitive-looking &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Umbra handed the two explorers over to them, and the murlocs began drumming on driftwood totems to summon a lot more murlocs. Eddie thought to himself that he and the professor were safe for now, but he also started to wonder if it was a mistake to trust the tortollans.\nThe next day, while Doyle was rummaging around in the tent, Eddie watched a team of murlocs polish the strange purple floor with some kind of fruity-smelling juice. More murlocs showed up and started dancing around and singing while draping the two exploreres in seaweed and painting their faces. Eddie only managed to pick up a few words of what they were saying: \"party\", \"feast\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Megafin\"&gt;Megafin&lt;/a&gt;\", and became convinced that the murlocs were going to feed them to \"whatever a megafin is\". As usual, the professor thought it was a perfect time to start filming, naming the murloc tribe as another \"Doyle Discovery\" before being offered a cup of murloc floor polish that caused him to suffer extreme hallucinations before passing out. He almost missed the arrival of Megafin, the biggest murloc Eddie had ever seen, and it turned out that the explorers were not destined for dinner, but guests of honor at a murloc \"fin-dig\". Megafin ended up being \"really nice\", and he and Eddie agreed to be pen pals. When Doyle woke up and saw the murloc party, he made a little whimpering sound and went back for seconds of the floor polish, causing Eddie to consider giving it a try as well.\nThe next day, after suffering the after effects of drinking murloc floor polish, Eddie and Doyle discovered that the entire murloc village was constructed on the back of a . Umbra shouted something to Megafin and pointed in the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; in the center of Un'Goro, causing the entire village to begin moving in that direction. Once the explorers, tortollans and murlocs arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Golakka%20Hot%20Springs\"&gt;Golakka Hot Springs&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the volcano, Umbra took Doyle and Eddie aside and told them to climb the \"fire mountain\" to see \"the truth\". The explorers waved goodbye to their new friends and pitched a base camp at the base of the volcano, leaving them to decide whether to take the smoother but slower path, or the more jagged and faster one.\nDoyle spent the next few days running around and drawing sketches of the small &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s that seem to be attracted to the volcano. Eddie wondered if some of the adorable-looking &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s would make good pets. After Doyle's observational sketches and Eddie's underwear burned up just after they had begun filming again, he concluded that they make very bad pets. The next day, the two explorers decided that speed was the most important thing when climbing the volcano and began hiking up the jagged slope. Eddie noted that they made really good progress, especially if you don't count all the time the professor spen with his eyes clenched shut muttering about danger being opportunity instead of climbing, or when the two were almost broiled alive by a huge fire elemental. Eddie and Doyle camped near the caldera, but Starseeker's expedition was nowhere to be seen. Strangely, from their position, the two should have been able to see all of Un'Goro, including the distant crater walls, but instead found that they couldn't see any crater walls. Instead, jungle could be seen carpeting the land as far as the eye could see in every direction. Even the professor wasn't sure what was going on, but Eddie wondered if it was what Umbra had been trying to show them.\nWhile in the caldera camp, the two explorers observed &lt;a href=\"Kalimos%2C%20Primal%20Lord\"&gt;a huge elemental seemingly made up of all the other elements&lt;/a&gt; and several of . Although it was fascinating, it was time to pack up and leave the volcano. The next day, they were trying to sneak past the elementals when Doyle tripped over a glowing crystal, which seemed to anger the elementals and cause them to start chasing the two explorers. As fate would have it, that's also when the volcano started to erupt. Just as the elementals and lava were closing in, a huge &lt;a href=\"pterrordax\"&gt;pterrordax&lt;/a&gt; swooped down and snatched Doyle and Eddie off the side of the volcano and dropped them off at its nest. As the creature could be back at any moment, it was high time for the two to get out of there as quickly as possible. On the way in, Eddie saw a cave and some ruins, leaving the two to wonder which destination to choose.\nWeek 5.\nThe two explorers' stay in the pterrordax nest was cut short when the professor accidentally stepped on and destroyed one of the pterrordax's eggs. As they didn't have much breath to spare for conversation while running from the angry mother, the two humans ended up heading in the direction of the ruins. Along the way, they passed through &lt;a href=\"Lakkari%20Tar%20Pits\"&gt;an area filled with tarpits&lt;/a&gt;. They couldn't see far through the low hanging mist, but at one point heard what sounded like &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;a dwarf&lt;/a&gt; screaming at the \"scrubs\" to get out of his jungle because they were scaring away all of the game. Once they reached the safety of the ruins, which contained a strange construction of several pillars with a stone ring on top, the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; guardians there allowed them to set up camp but told them that they could only enter if they brought enough crystals to \"\".\nThe next day, Doyle and Eddie embarked on a hike to the nearby crystal cave. When the professor saw the clusters of multicolored glowing crystals filling the cavern, he became extremely excited and began talking about how Galvadon must be close, and before long he was proven right. A group of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s who were part of a lost expedition had made friends with Galvadon, who lived in the cave. When they introduced the two explorers to the great creature, Doyle started crying, dancing around and hugging everyone. The paladins told the two adventurers that Spiritsinger Umbra had told them to expect the professor and his asssistant, leading Eddie to deduce that she was the one who had sent the pterrordax to rescue them from the volcano. The group gathered up some crystals, and on the next day they all mounted up on &lt;a href=\"stegodon\"&gt;stegodon&lt;/a&gt;s that the paladins had tamed and met up with the tortollans and murlocs before heading for the titan ruins. On the way there, however, they ran into trouble with the saurok, who had brought an army of dinosaurs and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s with them. Thanks to Galvadon and Umbra's participation in the fierce battle, the saurok were defeated and their apparent leader surrendered. After working out some translations, they all decided to head for the &lt;a href=\"Waygate%20%28location%29\"&gt;Way Gate&lt;/a&gt; together.\nTogether, the group had no trouble getting to the Way Gate, which turned out to be the tol'vir-guarded titan ruins that Doyle and Eddie had visited before. The tol'vir performed a ritual using the crystals the humans had brought from the cave, and a &lt;a href=\"Amara%2C%20Warden%20of%20Hope\"&gt;giant stone being&lt;/a&gt; appeared. She told the group that they should return from where and when they came, and before long she had everyone casting spells that would help her open the Way Gate. The professor and his assistant decided to shoot one last bit of film before they went through the Way Gate. The two explorers looked back on their journey and hugged one another just before they spotted a giant meteor in the night sky heading towards them. Before they had time to panic, the Way Gate flashed with blinding light and the meteor was gone. Eddie remarked that it all seemed very strange; they were still in Un'Goro, but it seemed different somehow. After some celebration and a few farewells, everyone started going their separate ways, with Umbra and the tortollans solemnly thanking the two explorers and promising to help them get back to Starseeker's expedition.\nUmbra's pterrordax friend dropped Doyle and Eddie off near where their adventure in Un'Goro originally began. Eddie thinks that the pterrordax dropped the professor a little harder on purpose. After a short walk, the two adventurers were back in Starseeker's camp. Oddly, Starseeker didn't seem to surprised to see them and simply said that they must have gotten the worst of \"last night's storm\" judging by the state of their clothes, and it seemed like no time had passed for the main expedition at all. Doyle and Eddie considered telling her the whole story but didn't think she would believe them, and since she was kind enough to lend them new gear they didn't want to spoil the moment. As a closing remark in his journal, Eddie stated that he was still a little confused about everything that had happened, but he was not worried about it. It looked like they were about to make the journey into Un'Goro all over again, and he couldn't wait."}

Corruption caused by fel energies may be the cause of this mutation, as seen in the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and Lost Ones, or it may be an intentional augmentation made to wrathguard in order to increase their mobility."}
