Once a victim comes within reach, they pounce, biting several times and then backing off. Unlike other large spiders, giant spiders will rip bits of flesh free, storing them in something like cheek pouches for digestion. Prey is wrapped in a thin sheet of webbing mainly to make it easier to transport them back to the spider's lair.\nNotes.\nA model, first introduced with &lt;a href=\"Maexxna\"&gt;Maexxna&lt;/a&gt;, exists using the name GiantSpider.

Once the &lt;a href=\"Beastwatch\"&gt;Beastwatch&lt;/a&gt; camp was established, she and Draka entered the jungle's forests to search for other orcs that had been caught in the middle of the war between &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;. While initially suspicious of Kaz, Draka comes to respect the Laughing Skulls and admire Kaz's dedication to her family. Horrified at the vile nature of the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; (abducting children in particular), she notes their savagery is what has helped them survive in the brutal lands of Gorgrond. Once located, Kaz ordered the adventurer to kill the infected orcs and to find three particular individuals - of whom all were dead, including her mate, &lt;a href=\"Torg%20Earkeeper\"&gt;Torg Earkeeper&lt;/a&gt;. Their son, Cutter was also caught but was kept alive and immediately rescued. Her next plan was to use the sacred waters of the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; in the ensuing conflict. Kaz even comes to call Draka \"sister\" in their confrontation against the attacking genesaur &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt;, symbolizing the two clans' growing respect for one another. After Iyu's death, she participated in the attack on the northern part of Gorgrond against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and eventually joined the commander as a follower and left for &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe can also be seen watching fights between &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;garrison commanders&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Coliseum\"&gt;Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on Draenor, the orcs and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; lived in peace alongside each other for years as they rebuilt their world. Eventually however, &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; arrived and the draenei became fanatic, forming the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; and converting many orcs to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; whether they wanted it or not. While several decades had passed on Draenor, only a handful of years had passed on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The eventually were transported to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, Kaz, like the other Mag'har, would join the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. She participated in defending &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Zuldazar\"&gt;Alliance's assault&lt;/a&gt;, using several \"tamed\" &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; to eat &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; machinery.\nSpeculation.\nIt is speculated that Kaz is the chieftain of the Laughing Skull clan. Though there is no specific mention of her being the clan's chieftain, she apparently has a certain authority given on one orc's comment (&lt;a href=\"Limbflayer\"&gt;Limbflayer&lt;/a&gt;: \"No one blows up MY village! Nobody! Except maybe Kaz. But nobody else!\"). She refers to the clan as \"her\" people. In addition, Kaz is the only recruit-able follower from the Laughing Skull clan to have her own unique sound files when clicked."}

Kazakus' motto is that \"Power should be attainable for anyone, at a price\".\nKazakus' tusks have become contorted and twisted due to the corrupted mana he uses, and the large red circle on the center of his stomach is a portal that goes right through his body to an unknown destination, possibly another dimension. The troll is responsible for brewing , a cold and refreshing beverage drunk by all members of the Kabal, but which also acts to slowly erode the drinker's will and sense of self. Under Kazakus' tutelage, the Kabal have learned to concoct all manner of potions. Under his guidance they are Gadgetzan's master mixologists, brewing potent, overwhelming, petrifying and explosive potions of power.\nSome claim that a back alley potion brewer couldn't possibly have such knowledge, and some are foolish enough to spread rumors that he's secretly a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, or some other powerful entity in disguise. Indeed, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/20344072\"&gt;rumors abound&lt;/a&gt; of \"secret dragon people\" infiltrating Gadgetzan in disguise, and suggest that there may be more to the alchemist than initially meets the eye, as does Kazakus' hiring of &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; to keep tabs on his opponents."}

{"id": "706212", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=706212", "title": "Keda Bloomblade", "text": "Keda Bloomblade is a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and the protagonist of the &lt;a href=\"short%20story\"&gt;short story&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Stones%2C%20Moss%2C%20and%20Tears\"&gt;Stones, Moss, and Tears&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nTradition dictated that every man in Keda's family take up the mantle of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism, and the line of Bloomblade druids was one of the oldest of all kaldorei. When Keda was born as her parents' only child, they saw her as a boy and expected her to continue the tradition, but she instead chose the life of a female and joined the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. Her family could not see past the broken tradition and estranged her, leaving her alone in the world but for her sisters-in-arms.\nWhen one of her fellow Sentinels fell ill, Keda traveled down the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to the reclusive alchemist &lt;a href=\"Elyrion%20Fogsong\"&gt;Elyrion Fogsong&lt;/a&gt; for an antidote. The two became friends, and she frequently returned to him for wares and conversation. She often tried to invite him to visit her in the nearby village, with no success.\nLong after her and Elyrion's first meeting, Keda fell in love with the Lorekeeper &lt;a href=\"Toreth%20Bluestar\"&gt;Toreth Bluestar&lt;/a&gt; but lacked the boldness to confess her feelings for him, instead often turning clumsy and awkward in his presence. After she single-handedly defended a shrine from a &lt;a href=\"bog%20beast\"&gt;bog beast&lt;/a&gt;, Keda was honored with a Sentinel ceremony where she received embellishments on her facial markings. After the ceremony, Toreth approached her to ask questions about the battle with the beast, explaining that it was his duty to record notable deeds. This gave Keda the idea to impress Toreth and work up the courage to confess her feelings by performing feats of heroism, later explaining to Elyrion that being a good soldier was her only desirable quality. The alchemist disagreed, telling her that she was a remarkable person who deserved love simply for who she was.\nKeda began throwing herself against increasingly dangerous foes: first an escaped &lt;a href=\"void%20hound\"&gt;void hound&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt; she killed in a bog where she nearly drowned, and then a band of &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; attacking a village at the edge of Hyjal. She got to speak with Toreth after each deed and he started inviting her for tea, but she continued to feel too embarrassed to accept his offers. Elyrion offered to brew Keda a potion that would let her see herself as worthy of Toreth's attention, if she collected the last few ingredients for him: three crescent stones, two moss bunches, and a &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;'s tear. When she returned with the ingredients, Elyrion warned her that pursuing what she wanted also meant that she had more to lose. He revealed that he himself had once lost a life of happiness and now preferred to live alone in the bog and find purpose in helping others with his potions. Keda responded by returning the advice Elyrion had given her earlier: that he had value beyond his usefulness.\nThe potion caused Keda to feel more confident, to the point where she finally agreed to have tea with Toreth. They began meeting regularly, with Toreth one night inviting her to the roof of the Sentinel barracks to watch a migration of &lt;a href=\"glowmoth\"&gt;glowmoth&lt;/a&gt;s. He told her that there was more to life than service and battle, and the two shared a kiss. Weeks later, Keda revealed what it was that caused her to start courting Toreth, but he in turn revealed that all the ingredients she collected for Elyrion were useless. He added that he was familiar with the alchemist's history: his &lt;a href=\"Ellaene\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arietta\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; were killed in battle. Keda and Toreth sought out the alchemist, who explained that he'd kept his tragic past a secret because doing so helped alleviate the pain of losing his family. Keda invited Elyrion to return to the village with her. He initially refused, saying there was nothing there for him, but Keda retorted that visiting him had begun to feel like coming home for her. She then offered him a bundle of three crescent stones, two moss bunches, and a nightsaber's tear, saying that the mixture would help him see himself as worthy of having a family again, and added that she had \"love enough\" in her heart for a father of her choosing. After a moment, Elyrion smiled and accepted the bundle."}

They are often protected by strong walls, and several races besides those of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are known to build them.\nSecond War.\nIn large and well-defended settlements, the keep replaced the &lt;a href=\"Town%20Hall%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; as the center of commerce where &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;peasants&lt;/a&gt; could deliver shipments of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; for processing. The artisans who dwelled here had mastered means of better extracting the gold from the ore mined by the peasants, thus increasing the yield of mining operations. The keep was also a military structure protected by high granite walls, making it difficult to destroy. Advancing legions of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish warriors forced the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to assign their elite troops - the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;elven rangers&lt;/a&gt; - only to such places, where their presence could serve to deny the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; further strategic gains. As control of these towns became more critical, the keep could be needed to be upgraded into a &lt;a href=\"Castle%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterlude.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and the closing of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; dedicated themselves to safeguarding the land from &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; attacks by directing a few settlements across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The settlements were described as keeps, with high stone walls surrounded functional and unadorned establishments where &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;holy knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"squire\"&gt;squire&lt;/a&gt;s, and small populations of common folk attempted to live in relative frugality. The banners of the brotherhood flew side-by-side with those of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and if not for the townsfolk, these settlements might have been mistaken for completely military operations, for the rule of the holy order clearly had control over all matters.\nOne such keep stood in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; on the way to &lt;a href=\"Hasic\"&gt;Hasic&lt;/a&gt;, being yet unnamed on Alliance maps. Its walls were breached when &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sapper\"&gt;sapper&lt;/a&gt;s tried to murder &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, only for &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; to swoop down and save the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; from certain death. The keep was under direction of Lord &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Senturus\"&gt;Duncan Senturus&lt;/a&gt;, a paladin of the Order of the Silver Hand.\nThird War.\nWith the advancement of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; technology and the need to support growing numbers of fighting troops, the &lt;a href=\"Town%20Hall%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; may be upgraded to a keep. In addition to adding heavier fortification, the keep allows for the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; class into human society. The keep can later be upgraded even further, to a &lt;a href=\"Castle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh elven and blood elven keep.\nThe keeps helped the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; to fend off &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to attack their capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in ' by serving as a returning point for gold and training units. However, the Keep couldn't be built by the &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28high%20elf%29\"&gt;high elf worker&lt;/a&gt; unit likely due to the limited ability of the map editor prior to the ' expansion. With the addition of The Frozen Throne expansion's map editor, it is possible to make additional groups with building orders.\nThe keep also helped the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; campaign in The Frozen Throne. This keep produced unique blood elven-only units.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nKeeps can be found as the center, or at least military center, of many human towns. Keep can also refer to both the building and the town within its walls.\nFor some reason, the human keep design used in \"Warcraft III\" was combined with the Alliance &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; design of the same game to create the type used in \"World of Warcraft\". This means that the human barracks found in \"World of Warcraft\" are very similar to keeps, to the point that barracks and keeps are often interchangeable in dialogs.\nBuildings that are distinctly ruined keeps have a clock tower like they did in \"Warcraft III\", but there is no intact keep model. As an example, &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Keep\"&gt;Menethil Keep&lt;/a&gt; previously had a barracks model when it was intact, but now that it has been partially destroyed it uses a keep model with a clock tower.\nThis continued with the new style of buildings used by the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where keeps are similar but again distinct from the barracks due to their tower. Sadly this does not stop the confusion, as &lt;a href=\"Recruitment%20Officer%20Blythe\"&gt;Recruitment Officer Blythe&lt;/a&gt; calls the presumed keep part of &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; a barracks in &lt;a href=\"Enlistment%20Day\"&gt;Enlistment Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo make matters worse, dwarven keeps like &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Garok\"&gt;Dun Garok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angor%20Fortress\"&gt;Angor Fortress&lt;/a&gt; were previously often described as either keeps or barracks. Keeps of other races exist as well.\nDwarven keeps.\nSee also the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Bunker\"&gt;Dwarven Bunker&lt;/a&gt;s, which were inspired by the design of dwarven keeps.\nOrc keeps.\nThese could be considered as &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s instead. Some of them uses a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; model.\nIn the RPG.\nA keep is a fortified stone building which has fifteen to twenty-five rooms. A keep surrounded by a stone wall is known as a &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;."}

He ran as swiftly as he could to a hidden valley in the Stonetalon Mountains and found a number of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; machines deforesting the area. &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; had gone to the valley to find a rare plant for his beers, &lt;a href=\"indellium\"&gt;indellium&lt;/a&gt; hops, and Orremin watched as the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; destroyed a fair amount of the machinery on his own. Orremin helped Chen by entangling the goblins in roots and opening crevasses for the machines to fall beneath the earth.\nAfter the goblins had been fought off, only two plants of indellium remained. Orremin offered Chen a handful of hops, but he declined after realizing how rare it was and that even that small amount of flowers could help with the recovery of the species. Chen ventured off to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Orremin hid the plants behind an illusion to allow them to regrow and took a stand as a protector of the valley.\nYears later, near the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Orremin found two more pandaren visiting his valley: &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; and Chen's niece &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt;, to whom he told the story of his meeting with Chen.\nOrremin declared that his time guarding the valley was done, for he had to return to the Emerald Dream and confront a &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt; that was growing within. He then asked that the two of them grant him a request: to accept the same amount of indellium hops that he had offered to Chen and brew it into a beer as Chen would have done, as his way of saying thank you."}

He is a fast Hero and Entangling Roots has very good range, damage and duration, especially at higher levels where it is guaranteed to kill a non-melee ground unit if not dealt with accordingly. This spell prevents units from auto-attacking, making it very useful in removing enemy attackers during a battle.\nForce of Nature is reasonable for creating early sandbags for creeping and the Treants themselves have reasonable stats in the early stages of a game. \nWhile Thorns Aura is good at reflecting damage dealt by melee attacks, it can usually be ignored as many players tend to drop using melee units (if they were using any) early game, who generally get replaced by either ranged units who ignore the aura, or very bulky melee units where the effect essentially doesn't deal enough damage back.\nTranquility is his most powerful spell, as it stacks with friendly healing wards and Unholy Aura for very high health regeneration for a short amount of time. The spell itself can essentially be used to heal units in a pinch or during a hectic battle.\nSpells and abilities.\nntangling Roots.\nEntangled Units are unable to attack, though they can still cast spells.\nEntangling Roots will prevent enemy Heroes and units from teleporting back to town via Scrolls of Town Portal or the &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt;'s Mass Teleport spell. It can also interrupt channeled spells.\nDispel the roots.\norce of Nature.\nForce of Nature is useful for accessing areas blocked by trees and also for early creeping. Outside of that, they're fairly useless despite being able to benefit from the Nature's Blessing research. If you are not intending to access areas blocked by trees, only take down as much trees as necessary since destroying numerous trees will still yield the same amount of Treants as the spell can create.\nThey can be dispelled or stolen from by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Spell Breakers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThons Aura (Passive).\nNotes: The damage is reflected, before it is reduced by armor.\nThorns Aura is only effective if your units are being hit by melee attackers. \nranquility (Ultimate).\nOnce this spell is cast collect units under the rain until they are healed.\nThis spell must be maintained by having the Keeper of the Grove stand still while the spell is cast to get the full effect.

They are powerfully attuned to nature and seek to preserve the balance above all things.\nParentage.\nKeepers of the grove are thought to be descendants of Cenarius' sons Remulos and Zaetar.\nWhile many sources refer to the keepers as the sons of Cenarius, there is some controversy over whether Cenarius fathered a number of keepers, or just two. Keeper &lt;a href=\"Celebras\"&gt;Celebras&lt;/a&gt; speaks of the \"Sons of Cenarius: &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;\", which some interpret to mean that Cenarius had no other sons. Others do not interpret this so strictly, suggesting it could refer to the two most important sons, or the two sons relevant to the tale. A major difficulty with strictly interpreting Celebras' speech is that he describes Remulos' children as including himself and his sisters, making no mention of any other sons. It is possible that night elves may be the offspring of Cenarius as well. Dryads, keepers, and night elves are sometimes referred to as \"Cenarius' favored children\". Dryads and Keepers are often described as having the upper bodies of night elves.\nIn the RPG.\nA keeper of the grove uses the forests to aid him in battle. As a first action, the keeper uses his greater force of nature spell-like ability to animate trees near his enemies. He takes full advantage of thick undergrowth and his woodland stride ability to outmaneuver foes and stay out of melee. If necessary, he casts plant growth to create thick undergrowth. By casting entangle or entangling roots each round, the keeper hopes to keep his enemies away from himself, and immobilize them so his summoned treants can attack stationary targets. If the keeper of the grove has time to prepare, he casts aid. If the battle goes poorly, he casts tree stride to escape.\nA keeper of the grove's right hand is gnarled and twisted like the clutching roots of a tree. A leafy, barbed vine grows from the end of his hand and wraps itself around the keeper's arm. The keeper of the grove can extend this vine at will and use it as a short whip for melee attacks, or he can snap it to send out a barbed projectile as a ranged attack. The keeper of the grove can fire 12 such projectiles per day (the barbs grow back by the next day). The whip functions like a spiked chain with a reach of 5 feet, and the barbs are equivalent to thrown darts.\nKeepers primarily speak &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. Keepers of the grove occasionally learn the languages of Kalimdor's natives \u2014 such as &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey can be &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20wild\"&gt;druids of the wild&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\" novel, it is said that in ancient times, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who met &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; were so transformed by the demigod's teachings that they chose to remain by his side. These disciples ceased to be elves and became woodland guardians physically altered forever.

It is located to the west of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, southwest of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and northwest of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; lies in between the continents. Kalimdor is home to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Other races present include the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, and other, more minor races.\nKalimdor can be further divided into three major regions (western continents) known as &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;North Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Central Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;South Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Other sources vary on how it is divided. The \"World of Warcraft\" Manual divides it into the Northern Kalimdor and Southern Kalimdor regions. The various editions of the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Guide\"&gt;World of Warcraft Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" breaks it into Northern Kalimdor, Central Kalimdor, Southern Kalimdor, and &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; regions. At least one map has divided it into the three regions of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, and Kalimdor (shown through largest font size and caps), although the Durotar and Mulgore emphasis could just be the fact that the book talks about the Tauren and Orcs' new homelands throughout the book. A few maps however do not divide Kalimdor into separate continents and treat it as one single large landmass.\nKalimdor was primarily the domain of the night elves in the ten thousand years between the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. In the years since the battle, night elf dominion has given way as the tauren adopted a more centralized system and accepted their allies, the orcs and the trolls into their midst. The recent arrival of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; adds a new power to the map.\nNow, however, the continent is a politically divided one, the Horde have established strong control in the central and eastern areas while the night elves, now aided by the draenei, preserve footholds in northwestern areas.\nHistory.\nAfter the War of the Ancients.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s departure, the remaining night elves deliberately withdrew from the rest of the world. A veil of mist descended upon their entire continent, shrouding its presence from passing sailors.\nThe knowledge of Kalimdor survived in some old &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; legends, but without details about its history or whereabouts, merely that the land was broken and set beneath the waves during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering of the World&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, however, knew the truth, as some &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; visited them in the following millennia. This led to a group of high elves leaving Quel'Thalas and traveling to &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; in order to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;Crystal of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt; one hundred of years before the events of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSecond War.\nAfter their defeat on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and his surviving minions of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; sailed west to the mysterious continent of Kalimdor, drawn in by the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. They were followed by &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, who was eager to hunt out the last members of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nApproximately four years after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; brothers, &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silverlaine%20Thorne\"&gt;Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; started, Kalimdor was still considered a mere legend among most humans, with people such as the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;' court not believing in its existence. A few heeded &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s warning however and traveled west, such as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandmass.\nKalimdor also refers to the massive continent that composed &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nKalimdor has a huge variety of both animal and plant life. Within this continent, you will find almost every land type; from the ice cold plains of &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; in the north, to the hot desert of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; in the south. The mystical woods of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, the dry, rocky &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, the tropical, lush jungle of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 this continent has it all. \nTo the north the landscape is primarily coated in thick alpine woodland, typical in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Central Kalimdor, home to the horde, is far more rugged and barren, save for the safety of Mulgore. In the south, desert areas dominate the terrain; however, nestled between these bleak landscapes are realms of beauty and wonder such as the thriving tropical regions of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegions.\nKalimdor has been shown to be divided into three great regions or continents:\nKalimdor is further divided into the following regions:\nIn the RPG.\nAfter the surviving &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; were exiled by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; from Kalimdor, kaldorei &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s wove a powerful spell to close their borders within an eternal mist. There they remained for thousands of years, hidden by the mist and by the swirling seas of the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother version is that following the birth of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; gathered all the druids into a conclave, where they underwent a great slumber, sending their spirits into the Emerald Dream. A great barrier of mist grew around Kalimdor, to prevent eyes even in Azeroth from finding the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kalimdoran\"&gt;Kalimdoran&lt;/a&gt; is a language common to many natives of the continent."}

At the continent's center, where Y'Shaarj had settled, an immense hole was torn as &lt;a href=\"Aman%27thul\"&gt;Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; ripped Y'Shaarj from the planet's crust, and from which tremendous amounts of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy - the very lifeblood of the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; - now seeped. The Keepers closed the wound in the form of a massive lake of scintillating energies. The lake, which they named the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, was to be the fount of life for the world.\nIts potent energies would nurture the bones of the world and nourish life to take root in the land's rich soil. Over time, plants, trees, monsters, and creatures of every kind began to thrive on the primordial continent. As twilight fell on the final day of their labors, the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s named the continent Kalimdor: \"land of eternal starlight\" in &lt;a href=\"Titan%20%28language%29\"&gt;their language&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe waters of the Well of Eternity would coalesce in a select few places and create gigantic enclaves of life that Keeper &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; would take care of.

The massive explosion sent massive quakes ripping through the tortured earth and the surging Well of Eternity buckled in upon itself and collapsed. The resultant catastrophic explosion shattered the earth and blotted out the skies. As the aftershocks from the implosion rattled the bones of the world, the seas rushed in to fill the gaping wounds left in the earth. Nearly eighty percent of Kalimdor's landmass had been blasted apart, leaving only a new, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;raging sea&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; - an eternal storm of chaotic energies at its center, surrounding a handful of major new continents and scattered islands: the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the remnant still referred to as &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and many other smaller islands.\nGeography.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; was fought by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; in his lair among the highest peaks of Azeroth, this means the highest point in Kalimdor (at least before the ordering of Azeroth) was located in Al'Akir's domain to the southwest, near the ocean, between what would become &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\n' states that the war between the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; \"ripped Azeroth into new shapes\"."}

Apparently, unlike other birds, kaliri mothers don't chew their hatchlings' food for them.\n&lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;'s minions have been attempting to corrupt these birds before they hatch, which would make them mindlessly serve Terokk. Corrupted kaliri can often be found where Terokk's minions are found.

He inspired the pandaren slaves to rise up against their &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; masters, igniting the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Revolution\"&gt;Pandaren Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLong ago, the pandaren were slaves of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;. The emperor at the time, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Lao-Fe\"&gt;Lao-Fe the Slavebinder&lt;/a&gt;, was a monster among beasts even by mogu standards. His favored punishment among pandaren slaves was to separate families. Slaves who displeased him would have their children sent to the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall, to suffer and die as fodder for the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; swarms. This was the fate that befell Kang, a young &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20brewmaster\"&gt;brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;. His cub, &lt;a href=\"Sheilun\"&gt;Sheilun&lt;/a&gt;, was sent to the mantid, and his wife died trying to stop it. Kang was so grief-stricken over the loss of his family that he chose to wear all black. In a moment of clarity, he saw the mogu overlords for what they were: weak. They possessed dark magics and horrific weapons, but their empire was completely reliant on slave labor. Since the servant races were not permitted to carry weapons during the reign of the mogu, Kang determined that the pandaren themselves would become the weapons. History does not report if Kang and his son ever met again, but it was this father's love that sparked the rebellion that would change the face of Pandaria forever.\nOne day, Kang issued a challenge to his fellow slaves to hit him. Surprised, the beleaguered pandaren slaves tried to strike Kang. One by one they failed, for he intercepted their blows like a dancer and sidestepped their attacks like a reed in the wind. Kang told the slaves, \"Our backs are hardened by the whips of the mogu. Our arms are powerful from building their fortresses. Our minds are sharp from working alongside our enemy. You think the mogu are stronger? I say we are their strength!\" Inspired by his defiance, the slaves begged Kang to teach them to fight. So it came to pass that pandaren monks began their training in the martial arts, and Kang became known as the Fist of First Dawn.\nWhen word of the movement reached mogu ears, Kang and his followers relocated to &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; and secretly built a monastery to continue their training. To his vast surprise, Kang also found the prison of one of the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, the White Tiger. Kang often communed with the imprisoned Celestial, learning the secrets of inner strength and passing these lessons on to the other students. Xuen taught Kang not only the strength of raw power, but the strength of endurance. He told the pandaren that to know strength, he had to look to the little life he could find in the heights. Kang looked, and saw the twisted, gnarled trees growing along the Kun-Lai ridgelines. The trees' trunks were sturdy and strong and their roots were deep, as they needed to be in order for them to endure the biting winds. The pandaren used these trees to build the walls of their monastery and craft their first weapons \u2014 not blades, like the mogu used, but staves. Kang brought his staff to Xuen, who blessed it, after which the monk named it \"&lt;a href=\"Sheilun%2C%20Staff%20of%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Sheilun&lt;/a&gt;\" after his late son. He continued to carry the staff with him throughout the revolution. On some days, it was a mere walking stick, but on others, it saved his life by deflecting the blows of mogu axes or swords.\nThe rebels won several major victories, and soon the pandaren were joined by the other slave races: the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"grummle\"&gt;grummle&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; (possibly humans and defected Zandalari trolls as well). Eventually, Lao-Fe's forces retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, and Kang knew that the rebels needed to expose themselves and launch an attack. Without hesitation, Kang led the charge deep into the Vale and fought Lao-Fe hand-to-hand. The monk succeeded in defeating the emperor, but sustained mortal wounds in the process. The former slave and the Slavebinder died together, but with his sacrifice, Kang had freed all of Pandaria. His staff was brought back to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; that he and his monks had constructed in the mountains and continued to be used in service to Pandaria for generations to come."}

Following the battle he shared the secrets of &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Illidan's transformation&lt;/a&gt; with the Council. After Deathwing's downfall, he gathered great warlocks together to form the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; and they decided to go after the powers left behind by &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, and return in a year's time. He partnered himself with the undead warlock &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and together they went to accomplish their mission on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravels through Outland.\nKanrethad and Jubeka traveled throughout Outland, studying the various demons of the fel-infested land - the &lt;a href=\"fel%20imp\"&gt;fel imp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"voidlord\"&gt;voidlord&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; - seeking to learn the sources of their power, as well as the secret to how Illidan was able to control them while not being a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. From a captured doomguard in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Kanrethad learned that the doomguard had been servants of the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; who punished those who worked in sacrificial magics. Near the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, the great fel volcano in the center of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Kanrethad revealed his ultimate intention - to possibly become a demonic entity himself, recognizing that it came with incredible risk. He recognized that Jubeka feared that he would do to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; what &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; had done to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the world Outland had once been; he revealed that he had chosen Jubeka as his companion because if he failed, she would have to banish him forever.\nApotheosis and banishment.\nKanrethad and Jubeka returned to the Black Temple, evading the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Ashtongue Deathsworn&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; who had reclaimed the temple after Illidan's death. Entering the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Shrine of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt;, Kanrethad recognized it as the power source that allowed Illidan to control demons without their being corrupted by the fel energies endemic to the Legion, and theorized that it had been originally intended as the power source to replace the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; aligned with him. Since Illidan's death, it grew in strength and power, waiting to be harnessed. The two warlocks prepared a &lt;a href=\"Empowered%20Soulcore\"&gt;crystal&lt;/a&gt; to absorb the arcane magics within the Shrine, leaving it to do its work when they heard Ashtongue patrols hunting them.\nAn &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who studied warlock magics soon came on their trail, locating a strange book known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Codex%20of%20Xerrath\"&gt;the Codex of Xerrath&lt;/a&gt; from a creature on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Upon speaking to their warlock trainer, they learned of the Council and its mission after Deathwing's demise, and followed the trail left by Jubeka into the Black Temple. Reclaiming the now-empowered crystal and taking it to the summit, the warlock witnessed the opening of a massive gateway, and from it stepped Kanrethad in a monstrous &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;demonic form&lt;/a&gt;, utterly corrupted by absorbing too much fel energy. He declared that the Black Harvest would enslave hordes of demons and destroy anyone who stood against them, on Outland or on Azeroth. The warlock who stood against him used all of the powers at their disposal, taking control of Kanrethad's &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; minion and using its powers to augment their own. Though Kanrethad's powers were formidable, the warlock perservered long enough for Jubeka to arrive and fulfill Kanrethad's earlier request to banish him. The warlock then absorbed some of the fel magic, &lt;a href=\"The%20Codex%20of%20Xerrath%20%28ability%29\"&gt;corrupting their fire spells&lt;/a&gt; into a sickly fel-green.\nWith Kanrethad defeated, Jubeka brought him to the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Altar of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;, in the shadow of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, where she intended to keep him banished forever.\nLegionfall.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Green%20Flame\"&gt;Cult of the Green Flame&lt;/a&gt; have been lured by Kanrethad's power and sought to be near him at any cost to share in it. From the other side of the cult's portal in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, where they were attempting to undo Kanrethad's banishment, Kanrethad called out to Jubeka, who arrived after feeling his presence, telling her not to let the Legion take him for he could not endure such a fate. It is then that Jubeka realized that some of her friend remained in the demon he had become.\nUsing crystals stolen from the cult, Jubeka and the rest of the Black Harvest siphoned the fel from Kanrethad at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, turning him back into a human. Jubeka gathered the crystals used to absorb Kanrethad's fel energies, for if any were to break then the energy would go right back into him. Still recovering, Kanrethad was brought to the council's new base, &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;. He recognized the council's new leader, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Netherlord&lt;/a&gt;, as the same warlock who he fought at the Black Temple. Assuring the Netherlord that he had no intention of becoming the leader again, Kanrethad asked to serve the Netherlord and the council for there is much they could learn from each other."}
{"id": "365555", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=365555", "title": "Kanrethad Ebonlocke (tactics)", "text": "Kanrethad Ebonlocke is the final boss in the &lt;a href=\"Pursuing%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Pursuing the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; scenario.\nTactics.\nIntroduction.\nThe encounter begins when the player places the Empowered Soulcore in the Demonic Soulwell, creating a large Demonic Gateway through which Kanrethad will arrive. Kanrethad will then taunt the player, allowing them to damage him for several seconds; unimpressed, he will begin to summon a &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Lord%20%28Pursuing%20the%20Black%20Harvest%29\"&gt;Pit Lord&lt;/a&gt; through his Demonic Gateway. The Pit Lord is a level 91 elite with 20,376,600 health. The player should immediately cast &lt;a href=\"Enslave%20Demon\"&gt;Enslave Demon&lt;/a&gt; on the Pit Lord when it arrives, gaining access to the demon's unique abilities which are needed to survive the encounter.\nCasting Phase.\nAfter the player has enslaved the Pit Lord, Kanrethad will direct his attention to the player and begin casting various spells in a generally random order and frequency. His Curse of Ultimate Doom acts as a soft &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;enrage timer&lt;/a&gt; for the encounter, while his Excruciating Agony and Seed of Terrible Destruction should be dispelled using the Pit Lord's Fel Flame Breath. His Soul Fire casts are weak and can generally be ignored, and his Rain of Fire area of effects should be avoided when possible. He will occasionally buff himself with Aura of Omnipotence, which increases both his damage dealt and taken, and can be dispelled with the Pit Lord's Fel Flame Breath.\nAbout one third of the way through his casting phase he will begin to cast Chaos Bolt, a potentially deadly attack which triggers a raid warning and should either be mitigated with survival abilities, avoided using &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt;, or trivialized by taking advantage of your own Demonic Gateway. Approximately two thirds of the way through his casting phase, Kanrethad will move to the center of the area and begin to channel Cataclysm, an unavoidable attack that triggers a raid warning and will kill the player if it is not interrupted using the Pit Lord's Charge ability.\nKanrethad will transition back and forth between his casting phase and summoning phase for the remainder of the encounter.\nSummoning Phase.\nAfter completing a casting phase, Kanrethad will move towards his Demonic Gateway and begin to channel one of three different demon summonings; the order in which he summons these demons is fixed. Upon completing the summon he will immediately transition back into his casting phase.\nKanrethad's first and fourth summoning phases will always be to channel Summon Wild Imps, summoning three Wild Imps every .5 sec over 10 sec until a total of sixty Wild Imps have been summoned. Each Wild Imp is a level 91 elite and has 81,506 health. The player should attempt to eliminate these adds as quickly as possible using &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; spells and the Pit Lord's Fel Flame Breath. The player may also want to make use of the Pit Lord's Charge.\nKanrethad's second and fifth summoning phases will always be to channel Summon Felhunters, summoning one Felhunter every 3 seconds over 9 seconds, for a total of three Felhunters. Each Felhunter is a level 92 elite and has 505,910 health. The Felhunters will &lt;a href=\"spam\"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt; Devour Enslavement, a 100 yard range frontal cone ability which can instantly dispell your Enslave Demon if they turn towards the Pit Lord, triggering a raid warning. To prevent this, the Pit Lord should be positioned away from Kanrethad's Demonic Gateway and the Felhunters should be aggroed immediately using an area of effect such as Rain of Fire; the player should burn them down as quickly as possible while taking care to ensure that they do not face the Pit Lord. It is also advisable for the player to drop aggro by using &lt;a href=\"Soulshatter%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Soulshatter (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt; while Kanrethad is channeling the summon, so that the Pit Lord can tank Kanrethad while the player eliminates the Felhunters. The Felhunters will likely devour the player's &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Intent\"&gt;Dark Intent&lt;/a&gt;, so it should also be recast after the phase ends.\nKanrethad's third and sixth summoning phases will always be to channel Summon Doom Lord, summoning a single Doom Lord after 10 sec. The Doom Lord is a level 92 elite with 8,431,850 health. The Doom Lord can be trivialized by &lt;a href=\"banish\"&gt;banish&lt;/a&gt;ing it or keeping it &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;ed, or by having the Pit Lord tank them by attacking them for a few seconds and then dropping aggro using your &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Gateway\"&gt;Demonic Gateway&lt;/a&gt;. It is also advisable for the player to quickly dismiss and re-enslave the Pit Lord while Kanrethad is channeling the summon, in order to prevent the Enslave Demon from wearing off at an unexpected or inopportune time.\nAfter the sixth summoning phase, Kanrethad will only summon Wild Imps for the remainder of the encounter.\nConclusion.\nUpon bringing Kanrethad to 1% health, he will cast Annihilate Demons, instantly destroying any of the demons he summoned during the encounter which may still be alive, and will stun the player with Demonic Grasp. A scripted event will take place between Kanrethad and &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, during which Jubeka will cast Eternal Banishment on him. The player must then right click on his banished form to learn &lt;a href=\"The%20Codex%20of%20Xerrath%20%28ability%29\"&gt;The Codex of Xerrath (ability)&lt;/a&gt; which corrupts their fire spells with green, fel energy, and simultanously completes the scenario.\nTrivia.\nThough they do not play a direct role in the encounter, Kanrethad has assigned abilities for &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3D138557\"&gt;Burning Embers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3D138555\"&gt;Metamorphosis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3Did%3D138556\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt;, which along with his other spells would seem to indicate that he has mastered the simultanous use of all three &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20abilities%23Specializations\"&gt;warlock specializations&lt;/a&gt;. He also uses a unique primary &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; called \"Fel Fury\" instead of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The two then got into a fight when Tirion told their son &lt;a href=\"Taelan\"&gt;Taelan&lt;/a&gt; that not all orcs were bad, and that the good ones were just harder to find. Karandra however was very stuck in the idea that orcs were evil and should all be killed, a very traditional and common view.\nWhen Tirion was eventually &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;excommunicated&lt;/a&gt; and exiled for attacking &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and refusing to break the promise he made to the orc, Karandra didn't go with him for Taelan's sake. She told their son that Tirion had died, and took him to a false grave at the &lt;a href=\"Undercroft\"&gt;Undercroft&lt;/a&gt;, where Taelan buried the toy warhammer his father had given him, and the memory of this father, forever. Years later, she was present at a ceremony in which Taelan became a paladin. \nHer subsequent life is unknown but she died at some point.\nMemory.\nThe only known picture of Karandra is a painting which is the goal of the quest &lt;a href=\"Of%20Love%20and%20Family\"&gt;Of Love and Family&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. Tirion explains: \"\"When Taelan was a child, we would often visit &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; on family excursions. On our last visit, an artist by the name of &lt;a href=\"Artist%20Renfray\"&gt;Renfray&lt;/a&gt; painted a portrait of us poised along the beachside. It is my fondest memory of both Taelan and Karandra. For it was at that moment, with my wife and son in my arms, that I felt a bond of love and family that I would never know again.\"\"\nSpeculation.\nWhile she is confirmed to be deceased, it is currently unknown how and when exactly she died. It may have been during one of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s attacks on Hearthglen during or after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;."}

But recently, Karazhan has reawakened \u2014 an evil presence has taken the tower as its own, its halls crawling with spirits and demons, and with the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Shade of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, his power being so great that his magic still echoes through the halls of Karazhan.\nIt is impossible to set eyes upon Karazhan without reflecting on the dark saga of its master. As befitting his title, the Last &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; had amassed a vast collection of writings and artifacts that dwarfs even that of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. The tower is vast, dangerous, with &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s everywhere, and where some of the world's most powerful and dangerous artifacts are stored, brought for years by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar moved into the tower, seeking knowledge to save &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, as a level 70 ten-man raid instance, was opened in '. &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;Return to Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%23Megadungeon\"&gt;megadungeon&lt;/a&gt; released in '.\nHistory.\nThe land which the tower sits on \"was similar in shape to a human skull. Many had noted it over the years, though only a few had been sufficiently brave, or powerful, or tactless to mention it to the property's owner\".\nKarazhan's history begins with an explosion that carved out &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; and weakened the fabric of reality in the region, which was caused by &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt; draining the land of life with &lt;a href=\"%3AUlthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;:Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt;. The tower was built in secret by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"%3AAluneth\"&gt;:Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; around 600 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, after she grew increasingly paranoid and hostile to her fellow members in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a result of the dark influence that the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was exerting over her. The tower acted both as a refuge from the council and as a conduit for the potent &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s in the region, through which Aegwynn could siphon power as needed. Aegwynn's son &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; eventually took up residence in Karazhan, but mused that the explosion and the construction only happened because he would eventually arrive.\nAs the structure was built atop a nexus of potent ley lines, the energies that coursed through Karazhan sometimes warped reality in the region. Because of that, the mage &lt;a href=\"Arrexis\"&gt;Arrexis&lt;/a&gt; came to Deadwind Pass to study the tower and its powers, experimenting with their warding magics outside Karazhan, attempting to neutralize the tower's strange powers.\nIn time a small &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Cellar\"&gt;human village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;its church&lt;/a&gt; flourished around the tower, but both ended up abandoned at some point.\nThe Last Guardian.\nPrior to the First War, the tower was inhabited by Medivh, his steward &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt;, and his cook named &lt;a href=\"Cook%20%28character%29\"&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt;. Though Medivh was the greatest wizard of his day (and humanity's intended custodian), Medivh was secretly possessed by the dark spirit of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the Destroyer of Worlds. This led him to sometimes being sick and indisposed, and as such a group of would-be &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s once came to the tower to minister to his needs, but also to steal some of his valuables. But another time, Medivh also revealed himself to be very influenced by the demon when he cursed a group of charlatan &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s who tried to sell him fraudulent magical artifacts by transforming them into the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;'s behest, the Kirin Tor sent agents to infiltrate Karazhan and spy on the young Medivh, taking parts in his parties in the magical tower. The spies, however, always left empty-handed - Medivh made sure of it. The &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt;, a secret sect founded by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, was later assigned to keep an eye on Karazhan and to spy on the Guardian and his works. Among their agents sent inside, &lt;a href=\"Koren\"&gt;Koren&lt;/a&gt; the blacksmith was under their pay, and pretended to serve Medivh. The &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keanna\"&gt;Keanna&lt;/a&gt; was also present in the tower, where she was staying up at the guest chambers.\nCorrupting Medivh more and more, Sargeras eventually opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to allow the orcs to wage war upon the kingdoms of Azeroth, while also himself murdering the suspecting members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Order of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh hid this corruption behind a lavish lifestyle, inviting many nobles to party down in Karazhan. This didn't stop the dragon &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt; to travel to the tower with Aegwynn to confront Medivh about his acts. The night the tower was crowded with nobles who were expecting a gala, and so Aegwynn entered alone at first, hoping to convince Medivh to give up his power peacefully. After Medivh revealed that said power was that of Sargeras, he and Aegwynn began to fight, shaking the tower to its foundations and causing the would-be revelers to flee. Arcanagos was struck down by the spirit of Sargeras. As the duel between mother and son continued Aegwynn slowly gained the upper hand, until Medivh resorted to draining the life of nearby all occupants of the tower in order to fuel his strength. Now stronger but still unable to kill Aegwynn, Medivh instead banished her from his sight, leaving Karazhan a haunted tower of madness populated by ghosts and afterimages.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; later joined the tower as Medivh's apprentice. &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; also resided here as an emissary at the same time as Khadgar's apprenticeship. As a result of the recent events and the region's already weakened reality, many strange and disturbing visions lurked within the tower, and Moroes was now wearing blinders to avoid seeing them. In the months that followed, Karazhan became darker and more twisted. Tormented spirits floated through the hallways in greater numbers than ever before. From time to time, Khadgar and Garona were subjected to vivid, horrific visions of the past, present, and future. Khadgar suspected this was all due to Medivh. The Guardian's mood swings had vanished entirely. That was a relief, but only at first; his rage had disappeared, but it seemed to have been replaced with nothing at all. It was as if Medivh had simply lost the ability to feel anything. As he withdrew from his humanity, the fabric of reality in Karazhan seemed to unravel.\nThe visions were ultimately ended when most of Karazhan's ambient magical power was absorbed by the resurrected Medivh, reducing it to \"a pile of stone in the remote reaches\", its power taken to serve the Prophet.\nAs the war progressed, Medivh fought against Sargeras' control. The raging conflict within him finally drove the wizard irrevocably insane, until his childhood friend, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, aided Medivh's young apprentice, Khadgar, in storming Karazhan and slaying their former comrade. Since that day, a terrible curse has pervaded both the tower and the lands around it - casting a dark pall over Deadwind Pass and the region that is now known as Duskwood.\nAfter the fall of Karazhan, the Kirin Tor dispatched an assembly of mages to search the tower and seize all items of import for the purposes of \"research.\" It was then that &lt;a href=\"Atiesh\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt; was discovered and brought back to Dalaran.\nLegends.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; an area, which would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; and the town of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; (later known as Darkshire), became darkened and surrounded by dark creatures. The people of Grand Hamlet thought the evil was caused by the tower of Karazhan. Several townsfolk ventured there to investigate the tower but they did not return. A &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Dougan\"&gt;Dougan&lt;/a&gt; along with his friends &lt;a href=\"Kardan\"&gt;Kardan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voldana\"&gt;Voldana&lt;/a&gt; entered the tower but the raid failed and resulted in the death of Dougan. While there, time seemed to unfold in strange ways for the trio.\nKardan and Voldana managed to escape, but Dougan did not and was killed inside. He would later discover that anyone who dies inside Karazhan will have their spirit trapped there, unable to escape.\nYears later, Dougan's daughters, &lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loania\"&gt;Loania&lt;/a&gt; teleported into the tower only to find the horrors of its curse. Having escaped from Moroes, they found the killer of their father, satyr &lt;a href=\"Terestian%20Illhoof\"&gt;Terestian Illhoof&lt;/a&gt;. They killed him but Loania was hurt. As they were trying to leave they found the ghost of Nielas Aran who tried to kill them. Loania summoned Dougan who protected them while the horrors went after them. The twins teleported out of the Karazhan, leaving Dougan still trapped there.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn recent years, nobles of Darkshire ventured into Deadwind Pass to investigate the blight that had settled over the region. None who entered the dark tower ever emerged.\nRecently, despite Medivh's absence and the draining of magic, a new power seems to have made its home in Karazhan. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, though rarely seen, have a connection to Karazhan. However, no one knows who their master is. &lt;a href=\"Jitters%27%20Completed%20Journal\"&gt;One recent sighting&lt;/a&gt; is cause for concern \u2014 the Dark Riders seek the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact with the ability to summon the vile &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; into this world.\nIf you traced the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s traversing Azeroth, you would find they all converge under Karazhan. However, this is no longer true after &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; redirected Azeroth's ley lines to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt some point, the tower of Karazhan had sealed itself and several agents of the Eye were trapped there. Inside, the agents died for unknown reasons, and the magic of the tower notably prevented Koren's soul from finding eternal rest. Before the closing, demonic agents of the Burning Legion managed to enter into Karazhan, as the tower is a portal into &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, a beacon shining into other worlds.\nSince this time, the mages of &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; have been guarding and examining the tower and its secrets, as it is their mission to ensure that the tower doesn't fall into the wrong hands, or the possible repercussions would be unthinkable. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Alturus\"&gt;Archmage Alturus&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the haunted tower was no longer emanating all manner of arcane currents, but instead, became a huge energy vacuum with a very faint &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic echo.\nWith the help of &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and somehow of Medivh in the past, the adventurers managed to reform &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%27s%20Key\"&gt;The Master's Key&lt;/a&gt;. Once Karazhan was reopened, Archmage Alturus sent the adventurer to assess the situation inside and to find &lt;a href=\"Keanna%27s%20Log\"&gt;Keanna's Log&lt;/a&gt;, an encoded log of all her observations, and advised them to seek help from the ghost &lt;a href=\"Koren\"&gt;Koren&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, the Violet Eye sent three agents to track down &lt;a href=\"Medivh%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Medivh's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, but none of them came out and the adventurer was thus sent to accomplish the mission. Inside the tower, the agents &lt;a href=\"Wravien\"&gt;Wravien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gradav\"&gt;Gradav&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kamsis\"&gt;Kamsis&lt;/a&gt;, somehow succumbed to the dark magic of Karazhan during their investigation, dooming their souls to relive their final moments forever. Despite the curse, they still managed to help the adventurer who later brought back the diary to Archmage Alturus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Horde and Alliance later raided the tower, defeating its ghostly inhabitants and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt; at the very top of the tower, in the &lt;a href=\"Netherspace\"&gt;Netherspace&lt;/a&gt;.\nScourge Invasion.\nDuring the second &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh's son, entered the tower and met with the avatar of his father who told him about his history.\nLater, Karazhan was infiltrated by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tenris%20Mirkblood\"&gt;Tenris Mirkblood&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;elven prince&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; heroes to kill him and learn &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Orders%20from%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Riders.\nAround the time of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, a group of soldiers from the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; militia led by &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brink\"&gt;Brink&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; only to be teleported to Karazhan by one of the Dark Riders. While Karlain and Mardigan were watching a cursed vision in the Opera House, the rest battled against &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt;. Brink then found an amulet which he used to return their enemies and the Night Watch back in time preventing the events leading them to engage in battle. Brink and Revil then regrouped with Karlain and Mardigan in the Opera House, witnessing the true vision of &lt;a href=\"Aredhel\"&gt;Aredhel&lt;/a&gt;'s death. After this, they teleported out of the cursed tower.\nLegion.\nAfter witnessing the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar entered Karazhan in order to find knowledge against the demons. He was approached by the spirit of Medivh who said that it is time to fulfill his destiny by becoming Azeroth's next Guardian. Khadgar refused and the spirit revealed himself to be, in fact, a &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; in disguise. The archmage defeated him stating that Karazhan will not become a stand for the demons.\nLater, after learning of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar returns to Karazhan with an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to find their location, as knowledge of the pillars had been entrusted to the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. But Khadgar's reminiscing about his apprenticeship years ago is interrupted when an echo of Medivh himself interferes and brings down Khadgar's wards around the tower, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to invade and try to stop them from finding the Pillars' location. Khadgar is able to alter the tower's defenders to fight off the Burning Legion while he and the adventurer retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Notable%20Antiquities%20of%20Ancient%20Azeroth\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; authored by &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, the first Guardian, which contains information on the Pillars of Creation.\nBy this time, Khadgar considers the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Library\"&gt;Guardian's Library&lt;/a&gt; at the least to be his.\nReturn to Karazhan.\nSome time later, &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt; has been overlooking the neighborhood of Karazhan, and noticed the forces of Burning Legion marching towards Karazhan, which he saw as an omen heralding the return of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. He invited them into the tower. The Legion intended to use the tower as a conduit to each and every one of the countless worlds that they had consumed during their Burning Crusade, but Medivh severed the connection between Karazhan and those worlds.\nAfter he was killed by Moroes, Darius became a &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; and was granted the rank of mage posthumously. He then received the new charge of sprucing up Karazhan, in order for it to be a bit more inviting in case Khadgar had further need of it. Now able to enter the tower safely, Darius enlisted the help of the adventurers in his tasks to clear the tower of the vermin inside, to calm the ghosts in the &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Hall\"&gt;Opera Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and to disable &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt; once more.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar returned here. Magni later visited him and, studying the tomes here, they came up with a plan to destabilize the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in .\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Prince &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to Karazhan where he received information from the library that allowed him to craft &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Mental%20Clarity\"&gt;a potion&lt;/a&gt; that could cleanse someone of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' corruption. While there, he encountered the shade of Medivh, who encouraged him that while Wrathion could not change the past, he could forge a new legacy to leave for the future.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar still occupied the tower, and check up on the tower and him. The archmage wrote a letter to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; about the status of artifacts stored in Karazhan, its presence greatly facilitating the task, and revealed that he was also trying to repair the erratic &lt;a href=\"Curator\"&gt;Curator&lt;/a&gt;. Revil Kost came back to return the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Cloak of Purity&lt;/a&gt; after availing himself of its protection as he hunted the Dark Riders.\nIn the RPG.\nKarazhan is also known as the Ivory Tower of Karazhan or Ivory Spire of Karazhan.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

This raid was designed for level 70 characters and opened near the beginning of \"\".\nThe raid is a single huge wing (containing seven stories and 17 map pages) containing both the lower guest complex and upper tower, with some shortcuts. It encompasses twelve boss encounters, some scripted with different possibilities per week from 22 different NPCs. While the layout is largely non-linear, there are four essential bosses: &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Event\"&gt;Opera Event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;Chess Event&lt;/a&gt;. These four must be defeated in order, but all other bosses are optional. The final boss is &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezzar\"&gt;Prince Malchezzar&lt;/a&gt;, as the tower's last known occupant \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s presence as the last &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; being somewhat absent due to his death. The tower has been sealed off from the rest of the world and is filled with spirits and demons, which are the main opponents in the instance.\nGeneral information.\nMedivh's staff \u2014 \u2014 can provide quick transport to the tower. It will teleport players to the front gate of Karazhan.\nThe raid originally had three shortcuts to access the upper floors from the main entrance. While two are discussed below, the third shortcut was the Side Entrance of the upper Tower. As of Patch 7.0, while both function as entrances and exits, on entry you may be teleported to the other entrance inside, depending on your progress through the instance. In Patch 7.1, the side entrance was re-purposed for the &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;Return to Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; dungeon. The portal is found when climbing the tower to the right of the main entrance (across the small creek), the stairs lead to a bridge and to a door which would be unlocked from the inside once the &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Event\"&gt;Opera Event&lt;/a&gt; has been cleared. \nInstance layout.\nThe following is a compilation of areas in Karazhan and the corresponding bosses of the apparent layout of Karazhan. \nThere are two shortcuts in the instance. First, &lt;a href=\"Berthold\"&gt;Berthold&lt;/a&gt; the Doorman in the front entrance will later teleport you up to the private library. This teleport which activates after the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Aran\"&gt;Shade of Aran&lt;/a&gt; is killed. Secondly, the Servants' Entrance Door is in the Broken Stair, and links with the Ballroom. It is first found near the Master's Terrace by going down a small ramp, where the door can be unlocked from the back. Once open the upper floors can quickly be accessed from the Opera mezzanine above the ballroom, e.g. from the blacksmith to the Curator, or from Nightbane to Berthold (in order to get to Aran). This shortened path helps while running back despite not helping for the initial clear. The Side Entrance no longer works.\nYou do not have to clear the entire quarters for a boss to spawn. It appears that the boss will spawn after a certain number of kills occurs. Look for an emote, such as 'Hyakiss the Lurker emerges from...' The boss can also spawn multiple times if the quarters continue to get cleared. Killing the maiden does not prevent respawns in this room.\nNOTE: These bosses, if done previous to any real bosses in Karazhan, will not lock you with a &lt;a href=\"Raid%20timer\"&gt;raid ID&lt;/a&gt; to Karazhan. The main value of this area is that it helps a new raid group build confidence and quickly levels everyone's reputation to honored so that Koren can be used to repair (something you want the whole raid to be able to do).\nYou must kill Moroes before Barnes will allow you to try the Opera Event. To check the week's event without making a real attempt, start it with &lt;a href=\"Barnes\"&gt;Barnes&lt;/a&gt;, then with one or more people on stage (to die) leave the rest of the raid in the pit below. If it's the Big Bad Wolf, the person(s) on stage will need to talk to Grandmother to actually initiate the encounter, without this person the event can sometimes lock up the doorway and the GMs will not help you. The other two events will engage straight away and the person on stage will die or alternatively a Hunter's &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; can be used.\nBe aware that the conversations between the stagehands do not contain hints about the upcoming event. They will say \"need more paint for the Oz set\", even if R&amp;J or Wolf is up for the week.\nThe Broken Stair is after the stairs leading from the Opera event. The terrace is notable for the summonable boss &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt; and just by the terrace door, the Servant's Entrance to the upper tower.\nBuilt-in zone maps.\nKarazhan's map was added in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1.0\"&gt;patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt;. It, far and away, has the most floors of any instance with \"seventeen\" floors (The next highest is &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; with eight, and a few others with seven).\nRelated quests.\nFor a description of the entire Karazhan quest chain see: &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20quest%20progression\"&gt;Karazhan quest progression&lt;/a&gt;\nGetting opens the following follow-up quests:\nFor the old Serpentshrine Cavern attunement:\nLoot.\nTier 4.\nTier 4 parts dropped by &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt; (Glove tokens):\nTier 4 parts dropped by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt; (Helm tokens):\nBadges.\nThe bosses of Karazhan used to drop &lt;a href=\"Badge%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Badge of Justice&lt;/a&gt; in addition to their normal loot. In Karazhan, all bosses dropped two Badges each, except for the animal bosses (zero), &lt;a href=\"Attumen%20the%20Huntsman\"&gt;Attumen the Huntsman&lt;/a&gt; (one) and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt; (three). Since the chest at the &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;Chess Event&lt;/a&gt; also contained two badges, a total of 22 Badges could be obtained from clearing the entire instance. From &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; all bosses instead awarded &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt;.\nKarazhan gryphon roost.\nThe Karazhan gryphon roost is left over from the planning phase of Karazhan. Before the teleport to Aran's room was implemented, the original plan was to have a &lt;a href=\"flight%20path\"&gt;flight path&lt;/a&gt; that connected to the top of Karazhan for the convenience of groups who had already cleared most of the instance. With the ability to fly in Azeroth it is now possible to reach the ledge, but the portal is still blocked. It is notable that a &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Gryphon%20%28Karazhan%29\"&gt;skeletal gryphon&lt;/a&gt; can be seen flying around the tower too.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", Medivh and Khadgar used the gryphons to reach Stormwind and the Black Morass."}

He was followed to Karazhan not only by the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, but also by a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; adventurer seeking &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; adventurer seeking &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; who had dealt with the Dark Riders before. After they find clues as to his whereabouts at his &lt;a href=\"Ariden%27s%20Camp\"&gt;old camp&lt;/a&gt;, Ariden was pursued into the Dark Riders' base of operations beneath Karazhan. He and his Dark Riders held them off, but though Ariden even claimed the artifacts they seek, he was defeated by the adventurers.\nAfter the battle, Revil Kost announced that the Dark Riders were defeated, and that he would reclaim the stolen artifacts and return them to their rightful owners.\nBefore the events of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire%20Campaign\"&gt;Black Empire Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; intended to study the artifacts stored within the catacombs, continuing his journey to find a way to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.

There are a lot of restless spirits in the area, and he would like to study them. He is an old man, however, and not up to the rigors of collecting the essences of the spirits first-hand. You, being young and spritely, volunteer.\nAlturus is also trying to get an imprint of Karazhan's energy, but is not getting useful results from the surface. There are, however, two places his crystal would get useful results - an underground pond, and a well in one of the cellars. Unfortunately, those places are guarded by ... you guessed it, restless spirits that he is not up to warding off. Since you're retrieving spirit goop for him anyway, you volunteer to do that too.\nStudying the crystals and essences you brought back, Alturus has come to some worrying conclusions. So worrying, he tells you about a very select group - the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt;. He asks you to take a message to another member of the Violet Eye - &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Cedric\"&gt;Archmage Cedric&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou find Cedric in the north end of ruins surrounding &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter traveling to Dalaran and finding Cedric, he decides that since you know so much already anyway, he'll use you to get back into Karazhan and investigate the demonic emanations coming from within (not to mention find out what happened to their lost agents). He recently figured out that &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; is alive in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and sends you to get the key from him.\nKhadgar reads Alturus' report and is equally troubled by the news. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the key anymore, thinking it would be safer scattered into pieces across &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; instead of on his keyring. The first piece is in Auchidoun, which since Khadgar's last visit has been taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. He asks you to go get it.\nFortunately, the key fragment was still there and still safe and you bring it back to Khadgar. Relieved that you ended up having worthy enough eyes to see through his spell, he asks you to recover the 2nd fragment that's probably somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; (since he threw it in a lake), and the 3rd fragment from a room in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; that seemed nice at the time.\nYou come back with the last two key fragments and Khadgar seems genuinely impressed. He sticks the three fragments back together again but notes that there's still a problem. The key needs &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s consent in order to be able to open Karazhan. Death not being a problem for Khadgar, he asks you to enter the Caverns of Time and convince Medivh to let you into his home.\nYou head to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; and help Medivh open the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and start three of the most destructive wars to have ever occurred on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Then you show him the key. Medivh, being the powerful wizard he is, recognizes Khadgar's key even though he hasn't given it to him yet and seems to remember something about you in the future. He decides he wants to keep Khadgar's key so he can give it to Khadgar, so he gives you his key instead.\nYou head back to your own time and give Khadgar Medivh's key. Confused about where his key came from in the first place, Khadgar shrugs it off and sends you on your way back to Karazhan to check out the place.\nImpressed that he tagged you as a delivery boy and you came back with a way to break through the seal (that they couldn't), Alturus asks you to head on in and find a log of one of their agents who died awhile back, Keanna. He's not sure where the log might be, but there's a blacksmith who used to be on the payroll that might know.\nFortunately, the blacksmith was still around, although he seems to have lost some of his memory, and all of his life. He remembers the name Keanna though and bashfully confesses she spent a lot of time up in the guest chambers. You head up there and find her small red book.\nYou take the book back to Alturus who skips to the end and confirms that he was right all along. Apparently, there's a demon at the top of the tower and since you're the only one with the key, you have to go kill it. After huffing it to the top and killing &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt;, you head back down to Alturus. Delighted, he confirms that things are back to normal (only undead and evil spirits now). Assuring you that Dalaran really is cool despite what you think, he sends you back to his boss.\nHaving already talked to Alturus through the great void, Cedric gives you one last task: to forever guard Karazhan as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; (since you're the only one that can get in). You graciously accept the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Badge\"&gt;Violet Badge&lt;/a&gt; before selling it to the nearest vendor.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;==Karazhan quest progression==\n&lt;onlyinclude/&gt;\nKarazhan stealth attunement.\nIt is a somewhat lengthy chain requiring groups and so being able to solo any aspect of it will possibly quicken the overall time to attune.\nHere will be described the actual attunement process, describing which can be soloed and how.\nStarting at Karazhan.\nGo to Karazhan and get the two quests, one which will require you to collect some essences that drop off the mobs, and another which will require you to get to two scrying points. The essence will require killing a lot of the mobs, and you can pick and choose your points. The two scrying points are in the two cellars, and both can be stealthed to with relative ease. One is a well, and the other is a river. After completing both quests, the quest chain will have you travel to the Alterac Mountains before continuing with Khadgar in Shattrath.\nReturn to Shattrath and the First Fragment.\nGo to Khadgar who will give you the quest to get the first fragment from Shadow Labrynth. This is not soloable, and the fragment is at the very end behind Murmur. As of the patch 2.0.7, you can no longer buy your way into a finished instance and must do this instance yourself with a group.\nFinding the Second and Third Fragment.\nThis is one quest given by Khadgar, who instructs you to get both the second and third fragment before returning to him.\nThe Steamvault.\nTo get to The Steamvault fragment, you will need to be careful of the pats and the bog giants, who detect stealth. Move your way to the first boss. Right before the first boss, there is a pool on your right side, the fragment is at the bottom of this pool. There are no mobs in the vicinity so once you are there you can safely retrieve the fragment. As of patch 2.0.7, retrieving the fragment will summon an elite monster that can be soloed if prepared for. Bring healing potions and bandages. You should be able to duo this easily.\nArcatraz.\nThe Arcatraz fragment is trickier to acquire, but it is possible. You will either need the key to Arcatraz or have 350 lockpicking. Druids will likely not be able to solo this. Your first step is to move past the first room, which requires a bit of timing. You will have to move past the two blood elves and the infinitely incoming mobs. There will be occasional breaks that you can take advantage of if you do not have Master of Deception. Hang to either the left or right side, avoiding the center completely. Once you are past this tunnel, hang to your right side. If you had to use a vanish, wait for it to cooldown as you will need it.\nThe next objective is to get to the top of the staircase. Be wary of the corpses, as non-elite adds will spawn if you get too close. Move past the various pats onto the staircase, sticking to one side as there is a single pat that goes down the middle. Wait once you hit the top of the staircase as you will need your cooldowns for vanish, sprint, and cloak of shadows if you used them.\nThe next step is to get past the tunnel, which has two corpses which will spawn adds, as well as a sentinel who appears dead, but will attack you as you get close. The idea here is to move straight down the middle, sprinting while stealthed, using cloak of shadows just before you enter the tunnel, and vanishing if the lightning bolt from the sentinel breaks stealth when you hit the other side. This requires you to be ready to do all these things very quickly, so be prepared.\nOnce you are on the other side, hang to the right side of the wall, a voidwalker will patrol between the center of the room and the fragment. He is very slow at patrolling, so wait for him to get out of distance. When you loot the container, a mob will be summoned that has the fragment on it. You must be prepared to kill it, so have healing potions and bandages ready. Be careful of the pat and bring a friend if possible. If you wish to attempt walking out you are welcome to, but waiting for the voidwalker to patrol away again and then hearthing is a safer method.\nThe Black Morass.\nYou are now tasked with convincing Medivh to complete the key. This requires speaking to him after the Opening of the Dark Portal has been completed in the Black Morass. As of patch 2.0.7, you can no longer enter a finished instance and must complete this with a group."}

Adena injured Kardan and Voldana stayed to defend him, while Lieren and Loania went to put to rest Adena, successfully. After this, they returned to &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; where Adena was reburied. Kardan and Voldana claimed that they have repaid their debt to Adena and Dougan."}

Thus interconnected, the crystals created a field of energy known as &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Gatekeeper.\n&lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; of the location of each of the three mooncrystals during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to open Ban'dinoriel after finding them.\nEach mooncrystal had a different color, and seems to be linked with different aspects of Ban'dinoriel. The first mooncrystal, cut from the emerald &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Jennala\"&gt;Eye of Jennala&lt;/a&gt;, opens the mind of the Gate Keeper, the second, cut from the amethyst &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Hannalee\"&gt;Stone of Hannalee&lt;/a&gt;, opens its heart, and the third and last, cut from the sapphire &lt;a href=\"Body%20of%20Enulaia\"&gt;Body of Enulaia&lt;/a&gt;, opens its soul.\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; later recovered the crystals and, splitting the three between himself, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor&lt;/a&gt;, used them to overcharge and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, which had been irrecoverably tainted by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s resurrection. The crystals endured the Sunwell's destruction and had retained some of their power, but had also been corrupted by the explosion.

To bypass the mighty gate, you must locate and combine the three separate Mooncrystals which, when pieced together, form the Key of the Three Moons.\"\nGates of Silvermoon.\n\"Now that the Key of the Three Moons has been completed, you must bring it to the heavily guarded Elfgate and unleash its ancient power.\"\nBattle.\nHaving destroyed the outer elfgate, Arthas and his army pressed on into the Inner Kingdom, killing all in their path. Sylvanas ordered her forces to retreat over the &lt;a href=\"Elrendar%20River\"&gt;Elrendar River&lt;/a&gt;, waiting alone to confront Arthas personally. She swore that while Arthas had gotten through the first gate, he would never breach the second, since the inner gate to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; could only be opened by a special key, which she would make sure he never possessed. Arthas watched her retreat, sneering that she was wasting her time trying to \"outrun the inevitable\". Sylvanas commented she was not running and remarked Arthas had clearly never fought elves before, upon which she used a magic arrow to destroy the bridge, the only crossing point over the Elrendar, thus delaying the Scourge's advance.\nFurious, Arthas ordered his soldiers to find another way across the river. The undead fell upon a small village trapped on their side of the river, slaughtering the helpless villagers, destroying the buildings and raising their own base upon the ruins. Arthas's forces were bolstered by two new arrivals: greedy goblins willing to offer their &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s to the death knight, and a new form of solder; the spider-like &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20fiend\"&gt;Crypt fiend&lt;/a&gt;s. These arachnid warriors quickly proved their worth when a force of dragonhawk riders attacked, shooting their webs over the airborne riders, bringing them down and leaving them at the mercy of the undead.\nHaving assembled a substantial force, Arthas used the zeppelins to ferry his army to the nearest elven settlement to the east, which the Scourge destroyed swiftly. In the aftermath of the slaughter, Arthas found in the ruins of a temple a strange crystal. The shade of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; told him the crystal was part of the Key of the Three Moons, the key required to open the inner elfgate. Knowing now what he needed to do, Arthas quickly reassembled his army and fell upon the next elven settlement, this time to the north. This village offered little more resistance than the first; it was quickly overrun and Arthas claimed the second crystal from the ruins of the temple there. Finally, the Scourge army fell upon the final elven village to the west. This one proved more of a challenge, for Sylvanas and her army were positioned there, and they fought like ones possessed to defend it. Though the efforts of the high elves delayed the undead for a time, ultimately, the Scourge would not be denied, and the settlement was taken. Sylvanas and her surviving forces retreated back to outposts they held in the forests while the Scourge ravaged the fallen settlement, and Arthas claimed his prize from the ruins of the third temple. With all three crystals in his possession, the Key of the Three Moons was complete and the way onward was now open to the Scourge.\nArthas retreated back to his base, where he began to gather his forces for a final assault on the inner elfgate. In a final defiant gesture, Sylvanas obtained some zeppelins of her own, as well as more dragonhawk riders, and led them in desperate hit-and-run attacks on the Scourge, hoping to prevent their advance, but ultimately, once a suitable force had been raised, Arthas departed with his army and fell upon the defences of the inner elfgate without mercy. The elven defenders bravely fought to the end, but they were too few and too weakened to put up much of a defence, and were killed down to the last elf. With the defences gone, Arthas used the Key of the Three Moons to blast open the elfgate; the way to Silvermoon was now open to the dead. Sylvanas ordered her remaining forces to retreat to their holdings on the city's outskirts, wondering if there was any way to drive the undead back, while Arthas, growing ever more vexed by the Ranger-General's defiance, vowed to deal with her before he marched on the elves' capital.\nArthas: Rise of the Lich King.\nWhile the game depicts Sylvanas using magical arrows to sink the bridge, ' reveals that she actually used an \"extremely non-magical, quite practical incendiary device\" to cause the bridge to explode. Furthermore, in the book, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; didn't hire goblin &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s and instead ordered the weakest ghouls to make a bridge with their bodies. Using this tactic not only helped him cross, but also poisoned the waters of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;."}

The keystones may be used exactly like 12 fragments, meaning that if a keystone gives more fragments than necessary to complete an artifact, the extra fragments will roll over to the next artifact project. If a player changes their mind about using a keystone before solving the project, they can left-click the socket again to remove the keystone.\nCommon artifacts that permit keystones only allow the use of one or two.

Their capital of &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt; is located beneath the island, deep in the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Kezan's prominence as a mercantile hub, it's been divided into dozens of districts by the trade princes, who view every inch of land as an opportunity waiting to be converted into gold and silver. Kezan's tropical palms are bisected with miles of roadway, and even the beaches are beginning to be paved over by goblin ambitions. Nature eventually reclaimed the island of Kezan as the massive Mount Kajaro erupted with the Cataclysm, flooding the island with searing lava and sending tidal recoil sweeping through Kezan's harbors.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Princes\"&gt;Trade Princes&lt;/a&gt; reside here, as does &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt;, the founder and ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Director%20Riddlevox\"&gt;Director Riddlevox&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the goblin &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Union\"&gt;Tinkers' Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;playable goblin race&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20starting%20experience\"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; a phased instance of &lt;a href=\"Kezan%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; in their earliest levels before evacuating to the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Kezan is not reachable by other races or beyond these initial levels. Many of the denizens now live in &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe first recorded inhabitants of Kezan arrived around ten thousand years ago, following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, when some of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s that had previously resided near &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; took refuge on the island.\nAfter the Sundering, the Zandalari trolls that once ruled a large part of Azeroth started exploring numerous islands that dotted the newly formed sea. During one of these trips, they discovered Kezan and the goblin race, who were very primitive but still possessed some intellect. Initially, the two races kept a distance as the Zandalari only came to the island in order to mine the rare mineral &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt;. While the trolls didn't know too much about it, they realized that it was very potent, and used it as a sacred component in their rituals and ceremonies. For many centuries the trolls mined and occasionally even paid goblins in trinkets in order to work for them, but this arrangement was soon to change. At some point the trolls, while digging, discovered that Kezan possessed an unimaginable deposit of kaja'mite underground, more than they would ever need. So rather than digging for it themselves, they enslaved the goblins and forced them to drill in terrible conditions. For thousands of years the goblins, too weak to resist, suffered under the rule of the Zandalari.\nWhile Kezan was thus part of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, it was kaja'mite that finally led the goblins to their salvation. By this time the goblins had long forgotten the role kaja'mite had once played in their society, enhancing their then remarkable intellect. But, over time, as the slaves breathed in the dust of the ore which clouded the mines, it began to awaken the goblins' dormant intelligence. Secretly they plotted to start a rebellion, gathering any materials they could find and hide in order to create a wide range of weapons, traps, and explosives. \nOne hundred years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the troll overseers were caught completely off guard when the goblin masses stormed out from the mines, armed with technology that the Zandalari couldn't even imagine at the time. The trolls' hold over Kezan was shattered completely, their mining operation failed and the surviving Zandalari fled. Though they no longer inhabit the island, the Zandalari still consider it sacred to this day.\nThe goblins were now free, and in order to celebrate their newfound freedom they turned on each other, creating chaos as countless feuds were waged and alliances formed. Soon enough they were split into various different groups, with the most powerful of these groups known as the &lt;a href=\"Cartel\"&gt;cartels&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the battles raged on and it became clear no one was actually winning, the cartels realized it was in their mutual interests to broker a truce. Despite this, the conflict would never really end, as the goblins now turned to trade, doing battle in the economic arena. For years to come the cartels were rivals, constantly outshining and outsmarting each other as they continued in their quest for wealth and power.\nWith kaja'mite once more enhancing their intellect and innate craftiness, the goblins of Kezan rapidly expanded their knowledge of technology. As the cartels branched out into commerce, goblins established themselves as master technicians, selling their goods on the open market. Eventually, kaja'mite supplies ran low and as the goblins' intelligence dwindled, their inventions became more and more unreliable. As a result, the goblins turned increasingly to mercantilism as a source of income, in the process transforming Kezan into a profitable trading hub.\nCataclysm.\nKezan received heavy damage when &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt; erupted due to the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; evacuated their city of &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt;, but how the other cartels reacted is unknown. The status of the capital of &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt; is also unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; later revealed to Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; that when they were still on Kezan, his cartel had dug really deep and found a small vein of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and took its substance. He also admitted that there's a possibility that the deep digging may have contributed to the volcano eruption together with Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nRent asunder by the eruption of Mount Kajaro, Kezan is now brimming with &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' assault on Azeroth. Seeking to make a fortune and stake his claim to the title of Trade Prince, &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; has focused the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts on weaponizing Azerite and selling it to the highest bidder, taking over &lt;a href=\"Crapopolis\"&gt;Crapopolis&lt;/a&gt; as their base of operations in Kezan.\nGeography.\nKezan is a tropical and volcanic &lt;a href=\"island\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, not far from the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;, southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, and northwest of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; was located in the northern coast and the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt; is located within and under the isle itself. Due to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt; erupted, destroying Bilgewater Port and possibly the other settlements around the island, also presumably changing the landscape. Despite the destruction, the town of &lt;a href=\"Crapopolis\"&gt;Crapopolis&lt;/a&gt; on the southern shore survived, meaning other areas of the island might have as well.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nEarly development.\nThe Isle of Kezan had been in the planning stages long before \"Cataclysm\". This section details its previous, unused incarnations.\nOther than the &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;, notable locations include &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;, an active volcano in the southern part of the island, and &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; on the northern coast. The non-canon RPG also featured &lt;a href=\"Edj\"&gt;Edj&lt;/a&gt; on the northeastern coast, and &lt;a href=\"Voodress%20Village\"&gt;Voodress Village&lt;/a&gt; inhabited by &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Voodress is mentioned in \"World of Warcraft\" by &lt;a href=\"Maywiki\"&gt;Maywiki&lt;/a&gt; as being in the South Seas, but whether it is on Kezan or not is unstated. &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Diary\"&gt;World of Warcraft Diary&lt;/a&gt; also shows a location labeled as \"Steamwheedle\" on the northern coast.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Behind-the-Scenes%20DVD\"&gt;World of Warcraft Behind the Scenes DVD&lt;/a&gt; there was a map of the Isle of Kezan, which is above the Undermine, visible on a whiteboard. It shows:\nCataclysm.\nKezan was eventually repurposed as the &lt;a href=\"Kezan%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;initial starting zone&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt; in \"\". The &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; area was the only explorable place of the isle. In the starting zone, an open bridge and an invisible wall prevents access to the rest of Kezan.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"MOTHERLODE%21%21\"&gt;The MOTHERLODE!!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; was added as a dungeon in \"\". It is located somewhere on Kezan.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Isle of Kezan is under the control of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, making the whole place a swarming cesspool of corruption, chaos, scheming, and invention. Several cities exist on Kezan, including the nefarious &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;, the de facto capital of the goblins' trade empire, the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt;.\nKezan is a tropical island, and palm trees and other greenery appear in profusion. The isle's many ports bustle day and night as merchant &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s approach and depart, carrying goods of all sorts to places of all sorts for people of all sorts. Kezan is a valuable way station between the &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and almost all travelers stop here, whether traveling by ship or &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; or more esoteric means. The island is the heart of the goblins' mercantile efforts, pumping trade throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Isle of Kezan is the largest and southernmost of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; islands, and, despite the goblin presence, the safest. Unlike the surrounding islands, Kezan's inhabitants won't try to kill you on sight; rather, they \ufb01rst attempt to take your money and all your worldly possessions, then leave you to die on the rain-soaked cobblestone streets. Kezan's ports are valuable neutral areas for both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and if not for the goblins, trade would grind to a standstill and you would not \ufb01nd adventurer shops in remote places such as &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery city on the island is a bit like &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; but on a larger scale. Goblins control just about everything on Kezan, and you will leave with less gold than you had when you came. Goblin &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s are found throughout the island.\nHistory.\nNo particularly noteworthy events have happened in Kezan. The goblins created Undermine and beat up the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s pretty bad. Since that time, they have ranged out and allowed people of all races to buy silly merchandise at exorbitant prices. They allied themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; (either because the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s paid and/or intimidated them), but in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; they were a neutral force, making money off every side.\nAn orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Dak%27mal\"&gt;Dak'mal&lt;/a&gt; was recently captured on Kezan by a group of adventurers who penetrated his stronghold and apprehended him. He was controlling a cult of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; worshippers in the isle's jungles. The adventurers returned him to Bilgewater Port for incarceration, but the goblins, thinking the orc to be too dangerous to keep in a conventional prison (and too big a political issue to execute, as the orc claimed to be a simple &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and a representative of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;), decided to transport him in the \"&lt;a href=\"Fearsome%20Yacht\"&gt;Fearsome Yacht&lt;/a&gt;\" to the magic prison of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, though they never reached the destination.\nPeople and culture.\nThe goblins' entire culture is, apparently, focused on mercantile enterprises, and they work hard to expand their markets in any way possible. Most goblins seem friendly but insane.\nGoblins can be cutthroat &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s, and this ruthlessness is more prevalent on Kezan than anywhere else \u2014 probably because the goblins are competing against their own kind. While goblins answer to no king or other such titular head, a collection of &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s rules their merchant empire, which is called the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. Of\ufb01cially, \ufb01ve trade princes exist, though it would not be a surprise if there were one or two more lurking about in the shadows. The goblins certainly don't elect their trade princes, nor are the positions hereditary; the trade princes killed, blackmailed and schemed their way to the top. Together, these \ufb01ve goblins make the mercantile machine run, organizing the extensive and complex &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Fleets\"&gt;Trade Fleets&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Trade Coalition is huge, far-reaching and massively complicated. In addition, numerous other, smaller goblin companies, created and run by entrepreneurs called &lt;a href=\"mogul\"&gt;mogul&lt;/a&gt;s, operate throughout Azeroth. Perhaps the most famous of these smaller businesses is the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, founded and ruled by &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt;. Goblins engage in any activity that earns them a pro\ufb01t. They traf\ufb01c in legitimate dealings, including food, spices and textiles, as well as more esoteric and questionable wares, such as magic items and arms dealing. Goblins have no respect for nature and engage in deforestation and mining on vast scales (the Venture Company is particularly notorious for such activities). In addition, goblins run morally corrupt businesses such as smuggling and slave trading. While the Trade Coalition condones all such activities, goblin smugglers and slavers prefer to maintain low pro\ufb01les \u2014 for obvious reasons.\nAs chaotic as it is, goblin society does have some order to it. Goblin &lt;a href=\"baron\"&gt;baron&lt;/a&gt;s serve as magistrates to run the trade princes' lands and holdings, and goblin captains command vessels for the Trade Fleets or for private merchants.\nGeography.\nKezan is a tropical island, and the associated flora and fauna appear in the wilderness between cities. Palm trees are everywhere, and in the wild places you can find tasty fruits and flowers the size of a dwarven head. There are also many tropical animals, including &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;s and lots of bugs.\nThe isle has several natural bays, and the goblins have constructed at least small port towns in most of them. As you travel south, the elevation rises. Southern Kezan is volcanic, and several volcanoes constantly ooze lava into the ocean. &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;, the most recognizable mountain on Kezan, is found there. Lava tubes and other geological tunnels and caves riddle the island.\n&lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt; is located beneath and within Kezan, and is connected to the island via a series of volcanic tunnels. Its main centers of population are in volcanic caverns beneath Kezan. The harbors of &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edj\"&gt;Edj&lt;/a&gt; are found on the northern part of the Kezan. The &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; settlement of &lt;a href=\"Voodress%20Village\"&gt;Voodress Village&lt;/a&gt; is located near Mount Kajaro.\nDirectly east of Kezan is &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Isle\"&gt;Plunder Isle&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; is to the northeast.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "15106", "revid": "53869121", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15106", "title": "Khadgar", "text": "Khadgar is perhaps the most accomplished of all living &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s and one of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azerothian&lt;/a&gt; history. Khadgar currently acts as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. He was an apprentice to the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, until he helped defeat his possessed master. Though he was prematurely aged into an old man long ago, Khadgar nevertheless has been an exemplar for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, leading the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and counterattacking against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and all who would threaten his world with annihilation.\nWhile a hero of the Alliance, Khadgar is willing to work with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for the greater good of Azeroth. As a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar hopes to drive the politics out of the Kirin Tor, and has been known to clash with the more &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;partisan&lt;/a&gt; members of the council.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;the events&lt;/a&gt; on the alternate , he led the forces of the Alliance and the Horde to shut down the , and later worked with them to cripple the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; in various areas of the world. He focused heavily on combating and the , mostly by working alongside the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;faction commanders&lt;/a&gt; and empowering them through a legendary ring of power.\nReturning to Azeroth, Khadgar tried to prevent Gul'dan from opening the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; but was forced to witness helplessly as the portal formed and the Legion poured through. He quickly informed important leaders of Azeroth of the impending &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invasion. Though the factions of Azeroth rallied to combat the demonic threat and attempt to reseal the portal, their armies were defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnowing that the combined forces of the greatest champions of Azeroth are necessary to succeed in resealing the portal, Khadgar made a plea to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to readmit the Horde back into the Kirin Tor in order to fight the demons at full strength. The leader of the Kirin Tor at the time, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, was in opposition to this, but the Council put the matter to a vote and the majority voted against her. In response, Jaina left the Kirin Tor, unable to condone the Council's decision. Khadgar assumed leadership of the Kirin Tor after Jaina's departure and coordinated the campaign on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was one of the main protagonists in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\".\nBiography.\nApprenticeship with Medivh.\nAt the young age of 17, Khadgar was sent by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; to apprentice under the wizard &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; in his tower at &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Having traveled from Kul Tiras via a ship, he got to Karazhan where Medivh's servant, &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt;, was already waiting for him. At first, Khadgar believed Medivh to be nothing more than he appeared to be \u2014 a kindly, old, if slightly eccentric and curious wizard. After Medivh asked Khadgar everything about the Kirin Tor, Medivh ordered him to clean up the library, as he had with his previous apprentices - dozens of them, none of which lasted for more than a few days. While wandering in the tower, Khadgar found a room where he saw visions of a human army led by an old, long white-haired mage battling against creatures with green skins and black armors. Khadgar was surprised to see that the mage's eyes looked like his own. Another day, as Khadgar was sorting books, Medivh returned to his tower and attacked him, thinking that Khadgar was a thief \u2014 Medivh had forgotten that Khadgar was still there. Medivh apologized and together they went atop of the tower. By touching his head, Medivh taught Khadgar how to ride a gryphon and they went to explore the southern part of the kingdom: the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;. There he made his first contact with the orcs and warlocks such as &lt;a href=\"Nothgrin\"&gt;Nothgrin&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedivh and Khadgar soon crossed paths with the King's Champion &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers on a scouting mission to the Black Morass. Lothar had encouraged his friend to rejoin Stormwind's defense, though understood that Medivh struggled with the power he unleashed on the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; years ago. The Guardian played along and feigned a fear of tapping into unwieldy magical powers, though his true intention was to buy time for the Horde to gain power. Lothar also spoke with Khadgar, telling him about Medivh's troubled past and asking him to act as a caretaker in addition to an apprentice. Medivh became more erratic afterward, disappearing for days at a time and being exhausted when he finally returned.\nAfter returning to Karazhan, Medivh left Khadgar alone in the tower. Khadgar continued studying and preparing for a &lt;a href=\"Farseeing\"&gt;special spell&lt;/a&gt;. When he thought the spell was completed, he used it and witnessed the epic battle between &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; and Sargeras. Medivh later returned so Khadgar could accompany him to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Hugarin\"&gt;Hugarin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huglar\"&gt;Huglar&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhadgar discovered Medivh was actually a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, a lineage of incredibly powerful wizards empowered by a council to combat the forces of the Burning Legion. Soon after he began to sense something was drastically wrong with his master, though he never suspected that Medivh was actually being controlled by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, he became suspicious of his master's actions and motives.\nAfter meeting a &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; emissary, the &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; assassin &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar unraveled Medivh's plot to open a portal between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing it was already too late to stop the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; from opening further, Khadgar and Garona rushed to King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth for help. The pair, along with Lord Anduin Lothar and a group of soldiers, returned to Karazhan and entered its &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Karazhan\"&gt;lower part&lt;/a&gt; to find Medivh in psychic link with the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar fought and managed to best his master and Sargeras by plunging a sword into Medivh's heart, but not before having his life and magical energy sucked out of him. By the end of the events of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", Khadgar had gone from a young adult to a frail old man. Sargeras, possessing Medivh, had tried to rip his soul from his body, nearly killing him in the assault, but instead drained part of his life force. After the death of his master, he buried the remains of Medivh, Moroes, and the &lt;a href=\"Cook\"&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt; behind the tower. After it was done, he finally recognized the vision which had been following him since he first entered the tower \u2014 the future-Medivh that was about to collect Karazhan's energies for &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;next battle&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second War.\nFollowing Medivh's death and the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to the orcs, Khadgar &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;fled north&lt;/a&gt; with Lord Lothar and the rest of the refugees to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. His magic returned to him over time (far stronger than it had been before), but his youth did not. While he retained the endurance, strength, and agility of a young man, his appearance remained that of an old man with a lined face and stark white hair. Khadgar's presence helped lend weight to Lothar's testimony about the rest of the kingdoms aligning together to fight against the coming &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He was also surprised to learn that Lothar hailed from the ancient Arathi bloodline.\nWith the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; secured, Khadgar was called to meet the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; of Dalaran, where he revealed the truth regarding his apprenticeship to Medivh. Additionally, he revealed that he planned to aid Lothar and the Alliance in their battles against the Horde threat. Recognizing that Khadgar would follow his own course regardless of their counsel, the archmages gave him leave to go, and appointed him their official liaison to Lothar. He then joined Lothar and witnessed the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. During this time a newly made paladin by the name of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; developed a rapport with Khadgar, who despite his aged appearance, was roughly the same age as the paladin.\nKhadgar fought at Lothar's side for the first &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;skirmishes&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. After forcing the Horde from their initial beach landing, the Alliances forces followed the Horde northeast to the mountain pass leading to the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;' keep of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Unknown to the trailing Alliance forces, the Horde's goal was not the dwarven stronghold there. It was merely a feint to lure the bulk of their pursuers into a cat-and-mouse diversion in the mountains and forests of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, while the main body of the Horde marched on the elven homeland of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. From this location, the Horde could launch an assault on either &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. After realizing the Horde's true intentions, Lothar sent Turalyon, Khadgar, and Alleria to intercept the Horde before Quel'Thalas burned. The army was ferried from below &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; to an area near &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and continued to the border of Quel'Thalas. The Horde proceeded and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;set fire&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt; in southern Quel'Thalas.\nThe Allied forces managed to halt the Horde's advance into inner Quel'Thalas, but at the cost of many lives and a sizable portion of the Eversong Forest being destroyed. Khadgar tried to suppress the fires by summoning a vast storm, which stretched across the entire battlefront and exhausted his entire magic supply. The weather made the fighting soggy and miserable, but only managed to put out the fires for a time, as the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s' waves of flame were so hot that under their breath trees blackened in an instant, crumbling to ash despite being soaked minutes before. However, the Horde's wanton destruction and brutal assault on their home had convinced the elves to throw their full support behind the Alliance. When Khadgar finally left Quel'Thalas, it was at the head of an elven armada. They arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, after passing through the mountainous region of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, just in time to turn back &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s siege, and then chased the orcs back to the beaches of Southshore.\nAs the Horde retreated further south the two Alliance armies finally reconnected and marched south after them. When the two forces clashed, the Warchief of the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, eventually fought and killed Anduin Lothar. Instead of shattering the Alliance's resolve as Doomhammer intended, the Alliance rallied under Turalyon and the bulk of the Horde was defeated. The Alliance forces continued south towards the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and defeated the remnants of the Horde gathered there. Having studied Medivh's spells and the nature of the Dark Portal, Khadgar was able to destroy it, effectively severing the link between Azeroth and Draenor and cutting off Horde's reinforcements. The rift between worlds remained, however. To guard against a second attack from Draenor, Khadgar oversaw the construction of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance Expedition.\nKhadgar's fears would be validated only a year after Nethergarde's completion, when the portal opened again, and orc forces began pouring out, striking strategically to steal powerful artifacts. While fighting the orcs, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; suggested he'd get some food and rest. During his sleep, Khadgar had a particular dream. He was a giant running in the middle of Lordaeron, with the young appearance he had before being aged by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. When he noticed Dalaran, he ran towards and slowly began to shrink. When he touched the pavement, he was at his normal size again. There he entered the &lt;a href=\"The%20Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;The Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, where a dinner with a host awaited him. It was &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, warning him that the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was stolen. Antonidas promoted Khadgar to the rank of archmage and placed him in a position of authority over the mission to enter the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and investigate &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRealizing the havoc the Horde could bring, the Alliance launched &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;an expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;orc homeworld&lt;/a&gt; headed by Khadgar. In Draenor, Khadgar quickly discovered that the situation was even worse than he had feared. The orcs, under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, were planning on opening doorways to new worlds for the Horde to plunder. During the Sons of Lothar attack on &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar entered into a duel of honor with &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt;. Dentarg's magic couldn't strike through Khadgar's defenses, and when Dentarg sent his most powerful spell Khadgar merely absorbed it into his palm and was refreshed by it. Accepting his defeat against a more powerful sorcerer, he bowed his head and Khadgar decapitated him.\nMoving from there Khadgar and his fellows sought the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, finding it in &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s possession and to this end they form an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. After that, Gruul and his ogre minions, along with the heroes, challenged Deathwing from his perch in Blade's Edge Mountains \u2014 killing his eggs and impaling his lesser black drakes on the mountain spikes. Infuriated by this act, Deathwing landed on top of them and attacked Gruul. Although clearly no match for the mad Aspect's power, Gruul was saved by Khadgar's miraculous spell when he disassembled some of the adamantium plates that were holding Deathwing's unstable body together resulting in Deathwing's retreat. Honoring his word Gruul allowed the Alliance to leave unharmed, which they did so with the Skull of Gul'dan now in Khadgar's possession.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces ultimately failed to stop Ner'zhul from opening and escaping into his portals, and the subsequent chaotic energy the portals released began to destroy the planet. However in an act of last defiance against the dying &lt;a href=\"Obris\"&gt;Obris&lt;/a&gt; (who had been betrayed by Ner'zhul) handed over the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, which he had been entrusted with, to Khadgar. To prevent the potential destruction of Azeroth, the archmage used &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Medivh's spellbook&lt;/a&gt; to close the Dark Portal from the other side, thereby shielding Azeroth from the final cataclysm of Draenor's destruction. Khadgar ushered the survivors into one of the rifts and returned back to the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;remnants of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhadgar is immortalized in a massive stone statue in the Valley of Heroes in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the other leaders of the Alliance Expedition.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", Khadgar is present in the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. He is affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and brought the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; led by A'dal to Outland because he believes that only their power can drive the Legion from this universe. Because of Outland's nature, it is a strategic location in the Nether, and is the perfect staging ground for Legion invasions or a resistance. He hoped to unite both Alliance and Horde against their &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;true enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhadgar had traveled around Draenor visiting places like &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; and Tempest Keep. Mages of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; asked him for help with the reopening of Karazhan. Four months before the death of the Betrayer, the Sha'tar sent him to &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; to investigate some strange appearances. So he was not present when &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; visited the city but the warden learned about him from &lt;a href=\"Alexius\"&gt;Alexius&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; innkeeper.\nKhadgar, probably an advisor to the naaru called &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in the central dome of the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, located in the western borders of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. He appears as an NPC representing the need of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to work together to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; (much like the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; in Azeroth, which encourages the rival factions to ally against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;).\nKhadgar likely also met &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, during this time, and was probably surprised to be informed that Garona was not only half draenei, but was also Maraad's niece. Maraad's explanations of Garona's background gave Khadgar a complete picture of Garona, and a better understanding of her, realizing a parallel between her and Medivh. His experiences, in turn, furthered along with Maraad's search for his niece and knowledge of what happened to her after she left Draenor through the Dark Portal and up until the end of the Second War. The two men apparently also became good friends as the result of meeting each other.\nKhadgar explains to the varied &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; that although they may have withstood the Burning Legion twice, the Burning Legion is still marching across the universe continuing their &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing war to snuff out life in the universe, burning planets and crushing everyone in their path and that &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s must join the fight.\nThe son of Medivh.\n&lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; would leave for Azeroth with the re-opening of the Dark Portal to continue his search for Garona. He eventually returned briefly with Garona's son, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, whom Khadgar could see a resemblance with Maraad, and immediately saw that the youth was likely the son of his old master, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Having just recently learned the truth, and feeling ashamed of his heritage, Med'an confirmed this. However, Khadgar explained that he had eventually realized that Medivh and Garona had been doomed even before birth; victims of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Even so, he says that although he personally had not even suspected Med'an's existence, for Med'an to have been born they must have fought against their fate and through him the demonic forces may yet be undone. Now knowing that his parents were not ultimately responsible for the evil they had wrought, Med'an thanks Khadgar for answering the questions he held in his mind. He refused to join the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; but sent the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Dalynnia%20Wrathscar\"&gt;Dalynnia Wrathscar&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nTides of War.\nKhadgar is revealed to be a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; and was present during the two meetings between the Council of Six and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who was requesting for help in defending &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; from the Horde and later on for attacking &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. \nThough not specified, Khadgar is \"the most likely suspect\" to have asked &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; to sent help to Theramore.\nKhadgar was glad that she had survived Theramore's destruction. As the Council went to discuss Jaina's proposition of destroying Orgrimmar in retaliation for &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;'s death, it was Khadgar who told Jaina the Six's final verdict - Dalaran would not be helping her in attacking Orgrimmar. Their reasoning being that many innocents who had nothing to do with Theramore's destruction would be caught in the crossfire of Jaina's vengeful retribution and Khadgar appealed to Orgrimmar's orphanage as an example of this. Jaina retorted that the children there will be raised to hate the Alliance anyways.\nIn the end, it was he who suggested that Jaina Proudmoore be elected as the Kirin Tor's new leader as a replacement for the recently deceased &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;; based on scrolls of prophecy that had been written by &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; himself that indicated that Jaina was destined for the position.\nThe Iron Tide.\nWhen the Portal turned red, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched into the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; and laid waste to &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Unrivaled in his wisdom and experience, Khadgar was summoned to help repel the invasion. Now freshly shaven, he was firstly seen at the site of the goblin &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Pazaztick\"&gt;Scout Pazaztick&lt;/a&gt; and the gnome &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Pazerp\"&gt;Scout Pazerp&lt;/a&gt; examining the Portal. He then transformed into a raven and went to inform Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn Draenor, Khadgar showed the ability to transform into a &lt;a href=\"raven\"&gt;raven&lt;/a&gt;, which he learned from his mentor &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. He also is seen wielding &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe led the combined forces of the Horde and Alliance alongside Thrall, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and Maraad to the crater of the Dark Portal and began the mission to shut down the portal on the Draenor side. In Tanaan, he directed the adventurers in deactivating the portal. After it was done, he and his group retreated to the eastern jungle. Commanding the group, they created distraction, only to be stopped by an eye of Kilrogg. Therefore he sent the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt; to distract the eye, while the rest escapes. When showed up, Ariok sacrificed himself, leaving Khadgar having no choice but to destroy the bridge between them. Near the end of the battle in &lt;a href=\"Kargathar%20Proving%20Grounds\"&gt;Kargathar Proving Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, he froze the enemy combatants and left for &lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Halls\"&gt;Umbral Halls&lt;/a&gt;. While there he collapsed the entrance and sent &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olin%20Umberhide\"&gt;Olin Umberhide&lt;/a&gt; / and &lt;a href=\"Qiana%20Moonshadow\"&gt;Qiana Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt; to scout the cave. After it was done, they faced off who tried to collapse the cave. Khadgar teleported the group before the shaman could finish it. In &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Quarry\"&gt;Blackrock Quarry&lt;/a&gt; he assigned his bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;, to the adventurer while he used his magic on a dam that eventually crashed and flooded the Blackrock orcs. While aiming the Worldbreaker, he and the others fought off the Iron Horde. When the collapsed, he left Tanaan on the Iron Horde's ships.\nRight after the landfall, he opened portals for &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baros%20Alexston\"&gt;Baros Alexston&lt;/a&gt; to come in and build a &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde and Alliance, respectively. In &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar expressed gratitude that at least some members of the Horde have agreed to work alongside him and the Alliance against the Iron Horde. He stayed in &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Outpost\"&gt;Starfall Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in Shadowmoon planning to stop Gul'dan. Once he located Gul'dan in &lt;a href=\"Gul%27var\"&gt;Gul'var&lt;/a&gt; through All-Seeing Eye, that the commander and Cordana had caught, he learned the warlock's plans. Projecting himself to the village, the archmage instructed to catch the leader of the . escapes before he can be captured. However, he sends the alternate timeline version of Khadgar's old friend after Khadgar, who nearly succeeded in assassinating him but was stopped and fought off by Cordana. He also traveled to Frostfire Ridge, where he asked the Horde commander to help him with the Frostwolf orcs of &lt;a href=\"Throm%27var\"&gt;Throm'var&lt;/a&gt; and continued with his original goal - the Shadow Council (the exact result of catching Gul'dan happened here too).\nHe was based in &lt;a href=\"Zangarra\"&gt;Zangarra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; and welcomed both Alliance and Horde there, though not without trouble from arcane guardians. &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; ordered all outsiders to Dalaran - especially the Horde - not allowed on Kirin Tor grounds. Despite this, Khadgar said that as he was a member of the Council, his friends - regardless of faction - were allowed in, and if Jaina had a problem with it she could take it up with him. He introduced the commanders to his friends - &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Krelas\"&gt;Magister Krelas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Serena\"&gt;Magister Serena&lt;/a&gt; who were to help the faction's Arcane Tower.\nKhadgar participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Shattrath\"&gt;Battle for Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; to free the city from the control of the Iron Horde troops led by and . His force cleaned up the harbor and Iron Horde's ships. When the heroes attacked Blackhand on his flagship, an explosion happened. Khadgar believed that no one survived but after seeing a flash of the Light, he teleported &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, , commanders, and the deceased heroes back to the harbor and ordered to fire the remaining ships. He also asked &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Elandra\"&gt;Archmage Elandra&lt;/a&gt; to assist the in the fight against the Legion, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt; to spy in &lt;a href=\"Socrethar%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Socrethar's Rise&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was also seen in &lt;a href=\"Riverside%20Post\"&gt;Riverside Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yrel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Yrel's Watch&lt;/a&gt; conversing with Durotan and Yrel, respectively. Ultimately, he and many others were seen near the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Stones of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; after the death of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. He also sent his &lt;a href=\"Khadgar%27s%20Servant\"&gt;elemental servant&lt;/a&gt; to Garrisons in order to inform the commanders about Draenor's threats, such as .\nLegendary Journey.\nLater, he worked with adventurers to battle Gul'dan and the Shadow Council, who he saw as a far greater threat than the Iron Horde. At this point, Khadgar offered quests to obtain a ring from &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, which he imbued with power over the course of the questline. During the beginning adventures, he instructed the adventurer to obtain various items from across Draenor. After Maladaar sent him an urgent message, he had the commanders infiltrate where they seemingly killed Teron'gor and acquired his blood, which was then used in a failed attempt to locate Gul'dan. Later the commanders and Khadgar met up with &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; in . They were searching for &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, only to find his corpse in the &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Glade\"&gt;Time-Lost Glade&lt;/a&gt; where they battled with his spirit, defeating it in the process.\nKhadgar then wanted the adventurer to venture through &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve ogre artifacts from there in order to find out the secrets of the . When the adventurer returned from Highmaul, Khadgar started his spell to find Gul'dan once again, this time managing to converse with Gul'dan. Gul'dan informed Khadgar that he had been inquiring about him and discovered that they had a history - and that the scrying worked both ways. Garona tried again to kill Khadgar, and this time, she successfully poisoned him only for his life to be saved by Cordana and the recently arrived &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina brought up that the Horde had no involvement in the Council of Six's business. She did not approve of this, but Khadgar remained steadfast and said it was not the first time he had disagreed with the Council of Six. Garona was subsequently captured as Khadgar began searching for a way to break Gul'dan's mind-control spell on her.\nHis next goal was thus the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt; and its elemental knowledge and artifacts, ultimately leading to the death of Warlord . With the artifacts obtained, Khadgar attempted to use a spell to break Gul'dan's hold on Garona. He began channeling the spell, which made Garona reel in agony; Khadgar interrogated Garona for her master's location, quickly growing agitated as he intensified the spell. Cordana implored Khadgar to stop, seeing this as torture. Khadgar realized what he was doing and relented, opting to find another way. Khadgar instructed the adventurer to continue their efforts against the Iron Horde while he researched alternative methods.\nA short time later, Khadgar sent the adventurer to obtain an &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;Orb of Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact used by the Shadow Council to brainwash their spies, in order to break Gul'dan's hold over Garona's mind. The adventurer returned with the Orb, and Khadgar used it to expose Garona's Demon Within, a shadowy representation of Gul'dan's will. When the creature was slain, Garona thanked Khadgar and the adventurer for her freedom and vowed to fight alongside them.\nGarona later led Khadgar and the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Bladefury%27s%20Command\"&gt;Bladefury's Command&lt;/a&gt;, an Iron Horde outpost in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, where Gul'dan was planning to meet with . Garona and the adventurer sneaked inside and witnessed Gul'dan, once again, offering demonic blood to Grommash, saying that Hellscream's men had died for nothing - including his son, Garrosh. Grommash furiously declined and attempted to strike Gul'dan down, but was restrained by the warlock's demonic magic. Gul'dan then offered his blood to the rest of the orcs present; stepped forward and drank the blood, becoming a vicious fel orc. Garona and the adventurer informed Khadgar of these events, and Archmage noted that &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; was poised to repeat itself; he instructed the adventurer to marshal their garrison for an assault on Tanaan Jungle, while he researched ways to counter Gul'dan's magic, promising to be in contact soon.\nFury of Hellfire.\nSome time later, Khadgar arrived to Frostwall / Lunarfall to begin the preparations for the next attack. Shortly after the commander's shipyard was built, it was time to get the experience of navy combat. Khadgar would tell the commander to find a &lt;a href=\"Draenic%20Sea%20Chart\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; and obtain &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; from inside . When they arrived back to him with everything he needed, Khadgar told the commander to go to his tower and tell Cordana to destroy the books that had been collected. Unfortunately, it turned out that Cordana had kept the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;orb&lt;/a&gt;, which led to a fight with the Warden before she stunned them and opened up a demonic portal in order to retreat. Khadgar was visibly stricken with grief at this betrayal but soldiered on. After the commander had gone to &lt;a href=\"Light%20Be%20With%20You\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Draenor%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; to accept the final blessings of their ring, Khadgar led the commander into the heart of Hellfire Citadel itself to thwart Gul'dan.\nKhadgar arrived at the gates shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Reaver\"&gt;downfall of an experiment&lt;/a&gt; and began to channel to make portals all over the citadel. He was then seen after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Gorefiend\"&gt;Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, horrified by the sight, he teleported the adventurers further into the Citadel. After adventurers defeated &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, it was time to end Gul'dan's reign of terror for he had no place left to run, and he wanted his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull for reasons&lt;/a&gt;...\nKhadgar accompanied Yrel and Grommash as they fought Archimonde alongside the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, he went up to the portal and looked down at the staff of Gul'dan and saw it turn into disappear into fel flames. He then told Yrel that Gul'dan and the devils that commanded him were not so easily banished. For he feared that .\nDuring the fight against &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was shown a possible vision of their death, where Khadgar and the adventurer fought a losing battle in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"the%20Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;the Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt; (depending on the adventurer's faction) against the demons of the Burning Legion. The vision ended when Khadgar died and sent out a blast of arcane energy, killing everything in the throne room.\nThe third invasion.\nThough he was unable to stop from opening the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; to flood into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; once more, Khadgar was determined to find the means to reseal the portal and foil the Legion's invasion. He knew that the combined forces of the greatest champions of Azeroth were necessary to succeed, even as dissenting voices spoke against a coalition and risk ultimate destruction by the demons.\nThe Tomb of Sargeras.\nSeeking to locate Gul'dan, Khadgar would eventually track his magical signature to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving, he met up with &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; seeking her help in finding Gul'dan, though the warden would refuse and hold Khadgar responsible for Cordana's betrayal. Disappointed, Khadgar would depart in order to continue his search for Gul'dan. However, both Khadgar and Maiev were unaware that Gul'dan had observed their meeting, before leaving at Kil'jaeden's command. The warlock would reach the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; that his other self had raised from the ocean depths many years prior. With ease, he dismantled the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; locks and barriers blocking the entrance into the Tomb of Sargeras before blasting the door open and swiftly plunging into the darkness.\nShortly thereafter, Khadgar entered the tomb as well after hearing the massive blast caused by the door's destruction. After evading several of the deadly magical traps laid by Gul'dan, the mage confronted the warlock in a towering chamber, and a furious battle erupted. Colossal waves of arcane and fel crashed together, threatening to ignite the air around the two combatants. Kil'jaeden's voice angrily told Gul'dan that neither of the two could die this day and that he had to withdraw. Realizing that if he did not obey, he would get cut off from the Legion immediately, the warlock shrouded himself in fel, causing Khadgar's arcane magic to unleash a blinding explosion. When he opened his eyes again, Gul'dan was gone. A deadly cat-and-mouse game ensued, with Khadgar taunting Gul'dan in an attempt to bring him out of hiding while launching blasts of fire at random into the darkness.\nAfter a lucky shot almost reduced him to cinders, Gul'dan convinced Kil'jaeden to tell him about the power locked in the tomb and how to unleash it. Then, using this knowledge, he began deactivating the five arcane seals that had been created in the tomb by the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of Suramar during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; using the five &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar noticed this attempt and began sending out &lt;a href=\"arcane%20elemental\"&gt;arcane elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to find the warlock while also starting to ask if the orc had ever learned of the fate of his main universe counterpart. Gul'dan ignored him, continuing to break the seals until he reached the fifth and final one, which had begun growing more powerful with each passing moment, arcane energy surging into it \u2014 a mechanism created hundreds of years ago by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;a female Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar sensed this and created a massive arcane wedge and began slamming it into the floor of the chamber. Gul'dan threw his concealing illusion aside, and the battle between the mage and the warlock erupted once again. Realizing that he could not kill Khadgar \"and\" break the last seal at the same time, Gul'dan attempted to convince Kil'jaeden to infuse him with the tomb's power, while Khadgar finished his story and revealed the fate of the original timeline's Gul'dan: having been torn apart by the demons he had once served. Gul'dan suddenly realized that he was guaranteed to outlive his usefulness in the Legion's eyes, but in that moment, Kil'jaeden conceded and allowed the energies of the tomb to surge into the orc.\nGul'dan immediately ceased his attack upon Khadgar, instead crushing the final seal in a fist of fel fire. The energies necessary to tear open a rift between Azeroth and the Nether began surging towards the portal buried below Thal'dranath, but Gul'dan seized them for himself. After a moment of drowning in pain beneath an endless ocean of power, he regained his control and, by lifting only a finger, caused the chamber to erupt with overwhelming fury. Khadgar managed to seal himself in ice once more, but Gul'dan simply hurled the ice block through a doorway before collapsing tons of rock on top of it, blocking the entrance.\nKhadgar would free himself from the ice and subsequently be joined by Maiev Shadowsong. Working together the pair would breach the chamber and head towards Gul'dan, who with no effort would brush their attacks away again and again, yet they would keep coming at him. Recognizing the need for assistance Gul'dan would let his power slip away from him and down towards the portal, at last allowing the Burning Legion's third invasion of Azeroth to commence. As Khadgar and Maiev dropped to the floor, Kil'jaeden commended Gul'dan for his choice, and now Gul'dan had something he had never had from the Legion before: their trust.\nAs demons began pouring out of the portal, Khadgar and Maiev ran for their lives, with the Warden heading north to fortify the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; and Khadgar transforming into a raven to fly east. As the archmage glanced back towards the ever-darkening sky above the tomb, he saw Gul'dan levitating in the middle of the inferno, laughing and pointing towards the fleeing archmage to order several demons to pursue him. Khadger would evade them however and fly to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; and personally informed &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin&lt;/a&gt; about the arrival of the Legion.\nHarbingers.\nSome time after the Legion's initial return to Azeroth, Khadgar flew to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; in search of knowledge to aid against the demons. While he was searching the libraries of the tower, an image of his old mentor &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; appeared before him, asking why he had come. When Khadgar said that he was seeking knowledge, Medivh replied that what he needed was not knowledge, but a weapon \u2014 that it was time that Azeroth had a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; once again. Khadgar angrily replied that it was decided after Medivh's death that none could resist the temptation of such power and that a Guardian was not what Azeroth needed, to which Medivh asked \"If not a Guardian, if not you, then who can stop the approaching storm?\" The former Guardian showed his former student a vision of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; falling from the sky in flames, saying that if he did not accept his fate, all that Khadgar had accomplished and sacrificed would be for nothing.\nKhadgar objected by saying that even if he said yes, there were none remaining capable of bestowing the powers of a Guardian upon him. Medivh simply replied, \"I remain\". He claimed that he had known this day would come, and that before his death he had imbued a tome with an echo of his essence, and that opening it would make its energies be absorbed into Khadgar. While Khadgar was still hesitant, Medivh urged him to accept his desires and showed him a vision of the new Guardian annihilating an endless army of demons by channeling their powers through Atiesh. Khadgar at last admitted that he had long desired the position and yearned for the Legion to cringe before the fury he would unleash... which was why he could never accept Medivh's offer. Medivh's eyes flashed &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; green as his mouth twisted into a demonic maw, just as Khadgar unleashed an explosion which destroyed the tome and revealed that Medivh's echo was in fact a monstrously gargantuan &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. The demon growled that Khadgar's will was strong and that he would have served the Legion well, to which the mage replied that he would never be the Legion's pawn, and that Karazhan would never be their den. Through Atiesh, he then channeled a beam of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy that destroyed the demon and blew a hole through a window in the tower.\nAs Khadgar left the tower and mounted his gryphon once more, he came to the realization that no single person, not even a Guardian, could hope to stand against the Legion alone, and that the mortals of Azeroth must once again band together, united, \"for Azeroth\".\nLegion.\nAfter Dalaran temporarily moved above Karazhan, he asked the other members of the Council of Six to allow the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; back into the Kirin Tor, knowing that the conclave needed the addition of Horde mages to fight at full strength against the Legion. Jaina refused as she still held immense blame on them for destroying Theramore and seemingly abandoning the Alliance at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The council held a vote that ended 4-2 in favor of the Horde rejoining. Jaina teleported out in anger, leaving Dalaran and the Kirin Tor in the hands of Khadgar. As the council decided their next move, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; showed up explaining that his brother Magni had awoken from his imprisonment and had gone to Ulduar. Khadgar and an adventurer went off to Ulduar and, after fighting off forces from both &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; and the Legion, learned Magni had been talking with Azeroth herself, revealing that the planet was a titan. He then went on to explain that the only way to end the legion invasion was with the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar recognized the name and believed he saw them in one of Medivh's books in Karazhan. He and the adventurer teleported to the tower to find the book but discovered that the defenses that Khadgar had installed on a previous trip had been activated. After fending off the Legion and the tower's defenses, they found the book and took it back to Dalaran, where they summoned the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, the first Guardian and author of the book, to tell them where the pillars were. Alodi explained they were in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and, after fending off the Legion and closing up several small arcane anomalies in the city, Khadgar and the mages of Dalaran teleported the city to the Isles.\nKhadgar later traveled to the Vault of the Wardens to ask the recently freed Illidari to join the fight against the Legion. He teleported them to Stormwind City and Orgrimmar.\nA &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Warbrave%20Oro\"&gt;Warbrave Oro&lt;/a&gt; came to visit Dalaran and stationed at Krasus' Landing awaiting the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;class champion&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar stated that the people in the mountain could prove a powerful ally in the war against the Legion.\nNews from &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; made Khadgar rarely say that there's good news: &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; managed to return to his home of druidism and took care of things and is off on a head start.\nKhadgar accompanied the class champion to Azsuna. He believed he uncovered information concerning an ancient relic, which might be the key to stopping the Legion. The naga also played a part in this as &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself wanted the &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillar of Creation&lt;/a&gt; in the area which came to Khadgar's surprise. The &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; were the first thing to deal with before attempting to find the relic. After rescuing a &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, she told him that her grandfather &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, knew where the Pillar of Creation resided. As both Khadgar and the champion arrived at &lt;a href=\"Azurewing%20Repose\"&gt;Azurewing Repose&lt;/a&gt;, the blue dragon was in a weakened state that Khadgar was able to stabilize with his magic. After collecting &lt;a href=\"Crackling%20Leyworm%20Core\"&gt;Crackling Leyworm Core&lt;/a&gt;s and throwing them into Senegos's pool, Khadgar asked him about the Pillar of Creation. Senegos told him that the relic, the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;, was shattered ages ago. Khadgar questioned how it happened; the elder dragon didn't know, but he knew where the pieces lie. Khadgar eventually defended &lt;a href=\"Azurewing%20Repose\"&gt;Azurewing Repose&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; alongside their &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Archmage made a discovery and told the class champion to report to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, the champion, and Khadgar witnessed a message from a &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Anomaly\"&gt;Arcane Anomaly&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, telling them that her people made a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;dire pact&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar opened up a portal to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and informed the champion to be careful since the land has been wild for ten thousand years.\nA &lt;a href=\"Sentry%20Pierce\"&gt;sentry&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; spotted emergency signal flares in the sky above the lodge. &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; and the huntmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; went to investigate and discovered that Khadgar had lit the flares. He stated that some of his best archmages had gone missing and have been getting killed off. The adventurer followed him and spotted &lt;a href=\"felstalker\"&gt;felstalker&lt;/a&gt;s consuming magics from the mages. Before Khadgar and the huntmaster could kill them, the felstalkers' master, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;, arrived to intervene. He took his felstalkers safely with him, vowing that they would make a meal out of Khadgar soon enough. Eventually, the three elite rangers &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; joined the cause and plotted their next move. Vereesa's plan was to lure a trap within the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, with which Khadgar and the others agreed. Khadgar channeled his essence in an arcane vessel to draw out the Houndmaster which would make him vulnerable. Hakkar was defeated by the huntmaster, and Khadgar was relieved that the threat was stopped.\nRegarding &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt;'s condition, &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt; called the archmage to help investigate how to cure the illness. To make matters worse, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; has been absent from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; during this time, which concerned Khadgar. The &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Kalec\"&gt;Archmage Kalec&lt;/a&gt; went to investigate Vargoth, along with searching for the cure. Eventually, it turned out the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; was playing with an image of Meryl from distances away. It was learned that a gem called the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; that both the mage and &lt;a href=\"Millhouse%20Manastorm\"&gt;Millhouse Manastorm&lt;/a&gt; recovered in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; could be the only way to contain the dreadlord. They succeed, and Meryl recovered. They kept Kathra'natir imprisoned in the stone. Khadgar told Meryl that with the council and the newest class champion leading the order, they would be able to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Millhouse just wanted to use the soulstone for his own needs. Khadgar remarked that so long as the Soulstone serves as Kathra'natir's prison it is best left untouched, and he was sure that there are plenty of other powerful artifacts out there for the gnome to find.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Deucus%20Valdera\"&gt;Deucus Valdera&lt;/a&gt; accidentally summoned the projection of &lt;a href=\"Svena%20the%20Infused\"&gt;Svena the Infused&lt;/a&gt;, she threatened to destroy Dalaran. Khadgar sensed her presence and quickly arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Agronomical%20Apothecary\"&gt;Agronomical Apothecary&lt;/a&gt;, blasting the projection away. After assuring that everyone was alright, he warned Deucus to have more care when handling ancient relics, and left.\nThe archmage said that the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; has reported that an extraordinarily luminescent object had emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; and was currently falling towards the coast of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. What he found most curious about this occurrence was that the object was reported as having \"cut a swath\" through the Felstorm itself. The champion went to the shores of Suramar and found the object in the hands of a &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Murkmouth\"&gt;Yorg Murkmouth&lt;/a&gt; within an underwater cave. Upon returning to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar examined the object and it actived itself to tell a message from the beyond. It was from Khadgar's dear old friend &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and he said that the &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Lightbound%20Object\"&gt;Mysterious Lightbound Object&lt;/a&gt; had to be brought to the &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, for he knows what it was. Khadgar then made a portal to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" to send the champion to deliver the object and tell what had transpired. Returning from Velen of the information given to the champion as well as &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;relaying about a conflict that transpired in the city&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar instead entrusted the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt; to the champion to keep it safe in the one place on Azeroth that he would trust with the safekeeping of the object: the class champion's order hall. Placing Light's Heart in the order hall, Khadgar sent a crystal ball of his image to the champion in this base of operations that he may have found a \"key\" of unlocking it. Khadgar believed that &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; may have created the naaru prime &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; with her &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;tears&lt;/a&gt;, and could be used to unlock the secrets within. After obtaining the tears, Khadgar readied them for transport to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to give to the class champion. Upon using it at the order hall, Xe'ra appeared before the class champion and was told everything about her mission of desperation: the &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;child of Light and Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. Being unconscious for 3 days according to &lt;a href=\"Vicktor%20Ebonfall\"&gt;Vicktor Ebonfall&lt;/a&gt;, the champion rushed to the Violet Citadel to tell Khadgar what they have learned. For the first time, the archmage felt powerless to do anything from beyond what he just heard. Khadgar then wanted to be alone for at his age it was too much to bear.\nIn the days to come, the champion and Xe'ra would together discover Illidan's history, his purpose and most importantly, work to bring him back into the fold. After gathering &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Prism%20of%20the%20Illidari%20%28quest%29\"&gt;many soul fragments&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Allari%20the%20Souleater\"&gt;Allari the Souleater&lt;/a&gt;, it was later discovered that the soul of Illidan was taken to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; after she struck a bargain with . The champion returned with the demon hunter's soul within the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Prism%20of%20the%20Illidari\"&gt;Soul Prism&lt;/a&gt; and gave it to Xe'ra. She told the champion to deliver the vessel to Khadgar with the following instructions: when Gul'dan attempts to tear the sky asunder and bring the dark titan into our world, call forth the power of this vessel and release Illidan's soul into his body. Khadgar was surprised by their plan but stated he would do his best with the Light's Heart in his possession.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemist\"&gt;Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s steal a single strand of Khadgar hair for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Market\"&gt;Black Market&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssault of Karazhan.\nHe later returned to Karazhan once the Legion had infiltrated the tower, working with the Kirin Tor and a band of heroes to liberate it from their grasp. Finding that Medivh had bound the tower to the Legion core worlds during his possession by Sargeras, Khadgar set off to undo the bindings as the heroes fought to rid the tower of Legion influence. By the end of the tower, Khadgar has unbound most but not all of them, finding it impossible to undo the final bindings. This was done, instead, by his teacher, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who re-appeared suddenly before the group to aid them. Shocked, Khadgar attempted to question his teacher about where he had been, but the fight with the Legion took precedence. After the band of heroes defeated the Legion in the Netherspace, he asked Medivh to aid them in their fight, only to be declined as the former guardian is \"needed elsewhere\". Instead, Medivh stated that Azeroth had found her Guardian in Khadgar, despite the latter declining the power of the Magna. Told by Medivh he did not need the power of the Tirisfalen, rather, he had all the power he needed due to his courage, will, and heart to protect the world, which made him this world's Guardian, and also he would be a far better guardian than Medivh ever was. Medivh also said that while it might be simpler to shut &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;a door&lt;/a&gt; than pass through it, sometimes a step into &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;the unknown&lt;/a&gt; was required to break the bonds of fate. With that, he flew off as a raven into the Nether.\nWith the tower secured, Khadgar returned to Dalaran with the heroes of Azeroth, pondering on where his mentor has departed to.\nSuramar.\nKhadgar and the Kirin Tor traveled to Suramar to aid the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and served as peacekeepers between the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high&lt;/a&gt; elves. Khadgar befriended &lt;a href=\"Oculeth\"&gt;Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; as the two worked together to teleport enemy &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; forces out of the way. When Elisande used the power of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; to freeze time on the united elf army, Khadgar worked with an adventurer to free &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, but was unable to free the rest due to how dangerous the time stop was. After the death of Elisande's First Arcanist of the Duskwatch, &lt;a href=\"Andaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Andaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt;, the breach was secured as Oculeth teleported Thalyssra and Khadgar to the champion's position. When they arrived at the entrance to the Nighthold raid, Khadgar believed that if the timelock spell was broken, Gul'dan would surely fall. He clearly stated that the withered would not be able to handle what was coming in there and relied on the hero to gather an &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;elite group&lt;/a&gt; together and would be right behind them.\nWithin the Nighthold the &lt;a href=\"Chronomatic%20Anomaly\"&gt;Chronomatic Anomaly&lt;/a&gt; is taken out as the timelock spell is lifted and Khadgar tells the remaining forces of what happened because they are disoriented, but will eventually catch up. After &lt;a href=\"Spellblade%20Aluriel\"&gt;Spellblade Aluriel&lt;/a&gt; was slain by the champions, the gates are finally breached as it took some time, because they had to clean up out front. Progressing deeper into the city he wondered about that &lt;a href=\"High%20Botanist%20Tel%27arn\"&gt;palace gardener&lt;/a&gt;, and Thalyssra comments that he simply took his job seriously. Krosus returns to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; as Khadgar proclaims that &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; may have not been killed by the doomlord by play a role in this war. He tells the champions a briefing of &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; and comments that the &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;demon hunter's spirit&lt;/a&gt; is pleased that the dreadlord has met another painful end.\n&lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s soul inside, is brought to Khadgar with instructions to call forth the vessel's power when Gul'dan attempts to summon &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, thus releasing Illidan's soul into his body and preventing Sargeras from possessing his hollow shell. At the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar attempts to return Illidan's soul to his dormant body. But unbeknownst to Khadgar, Sargeras has already filled Illidan's empty shell, and doing so awakens him. When the battle is over, Illidan kills Gul'dan by burning his body with fel until only his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; remains, and then shattered the skull in his hand. Illidan then proclaims to the assembled fighters that they have seen what he has seen and now know what they face. Ominously, he tells them to follow him into the abyss.\nLegionfall.\nKhadgar spoke to &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; and the champions of each of the order halls at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; about using the Pillars of Creation to close the portal at the Tomb of Sargeras. However, Velen reminded all assembled that Gul'dan was merely a pawn and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; was still out there. Kil'jaeden, watching this all from his ship in orbit above &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, sent &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;s to assault Dalaran.\nKhadgar led the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. By studying the writings of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, he learned that the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; could trigger a failsafe in the Tomb of Sargeras if it were to be placed in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the cathedral, while Khadgar and Velen descended into the tomb. However, near the top of the cathedral, an image of Khadgar appeared before Maiev, Illidan, and the adventurers to tell them that the assault on the lower levels of the tomb was a failure. After Illidan and Maiev led the adventurers in defeating the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;, an echo of the former &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; appeared and spoke to the champions. She revealed to them that she intends to later aid them in their quest and also what would truly be required to close the Legion's portal; the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; would have to be used in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing this information, Maiev stated that Khadgar would want to hear of this and relayed Aegwynn's information to him.\nAfter defeating &lt;a href=\"Goroth\"&gt;Goroth&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar and the champions of &lt;a href=\"Legionfall\"&gt;Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; regrouped at the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Chamber of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, where he and other champions met with the echo of Aegwynn. Aegwynn informed them that the Legion was intending to reanimate &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;Fallen Avatar&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn instructed Khadgar on how to use the Pillars of Creation to remove her protective wards on the Avatar of Sargeras in order to prevent the Legion from claiming the avatar. After battling their way to remove Aegwynn's wards and placing all of the Pillars of Creation, Khadgar returned to Aegwynn to report their success and to declare to her that they will not fail in thwarting &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s plan. Although Illidan and Aegwynn warned Khadgar of the great danger and intimidating obstacles they would face, Khadgar was certain that if they stood together, Azeroth can yet be saved.\nWhile adventurers battled the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;Fallen Avatar&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan, Khadgar, and Velen faced Kil'jaeden. When Kil'jaeden retreated to his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar sought to close the portal to his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;. However, Velen rushed through the portal to follow Kil'jaeden in pursuit, despite Khadgar's protests. Illidan praised Velen's initiative and convinced Khadgar that the Legion's invasions would never end unless they pursue Kil'jaeden and vanquish him once and for all. Upon Kil'jaeden's death, his ship began to crash on Argus. Illidan used the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; to open a rift between Argus and Azeroth, allowing Khadgar to teleport them safely to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their return to Azeroth however, it was revealed that Illidan had left the rift from Azeroth to Argus open, and Argus became visible on Azeroth's sky. Khadgar, horrified, asked Illidan what he had done, and Illidan responded that sometimes the hand of fate must be forced.\nArgus.\nKhadgar traveled to Argus aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", a new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt; crafted by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. He can be found within the Vindicaar's Matrix Core room alongside &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, where the two discussed how each feels overwhelmed by the powers at play. Khadgar can also be found at &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Ridge\"&gt;Darkfall Ridge&lt;/a&gt; where he fights demons seeking to reach the \"Vindicaar\", after it landed.\nIn a reunion with &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, he informed them that &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt; were both still alive, though he did not get to see them as often as he would like. The three agreed that when the fight was behind them, the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; would hold a reunion feast and that, at Alleria's insistence, it would be Khadgar's turn to buy the drinks.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar said that the campaign against the Legion had been long and wavering. After traversing entire worlds and spanning the Twisting Nether itself to finally achieve victory, he was tired. Yet he knew he could not rest, for Magni's visions of doom shook him to his core. Only one titan remained behind, and Khadgar knew they had to defend it.\nThe Wound.\nHowever, Sargeras's final desperate attack on Azeroth, stabbing Azeroth, in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, caused her grievous harm. As her blood began to appear on the surface in the form of a powerful magical resource called &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance and Horde started to fight over it with war threatened on the horizon. Khadgar had hoped that after the Legion's defeat the people of Azeroth would have built a new future together. Not wanting to stay and watch more lives be lost, nor willing to take up arms against either side after all they had been through together, Khadgar instead chose to go to Karazhan and speak to Medivh. He hoped that somewhere in Medivh's ancient texts lay the knowledge needed to heal the world. Khadgar and Magni came up with the plan of using the &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapons to drain the power from the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, saving Azeroth.\nExploring Azeroth.\nKhadgar returned to Karazhan, and the went to check up on him. The archmage was disappointed about the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; and refused to participate in it, instead he hoped to aid the wounded world. Following the war, he learned about the armistice between the Alliance and Horde, and hoped that they will see the strength in unity. He wrote a letter to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; about the status of artifacts stored in Karazhan and revealed that he was also trying to repair the erratic &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;Curator&lt;/a&gt;. With the letter, he sent &lt;a href=\"%3AGarona%27s%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;:Garona's Signet Ring&lt;/a&gt; and asked Shaw to return it to Garona. Khadgar had also met with &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; who came to return the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Cloak of Purity&lt;/a&gt;. The archmage noted that Kost was the angriest priest he had ever met.\nShadowlands.\nFeeling the weight of the world upon him from the burdens he carried and the choices he made, Khadgar decided to visit the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; before his own end. After arriving in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, he conversed with &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; who was able to cheer him up. Having become intrigued by tales of conniving &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;city of secrets&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;land of ancient knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar sent off to explore the Shadowlands.\nDragonflight.\nA few years later, Khadgar was visited in Karazhan by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, who informed him that ancient enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; were returning to threaten the world and seek to cleanse Azeroth of the \"stain\" of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. Realizing their oncoming threat, Khadgar agreed to rally the mortal races of the world and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to warn everyone.\nKhadgar and the Kirin Tor later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to help Kalecgos and the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. After establishing &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Antonidas\"&gt;Camp Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, they came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Proto-dragon\"&gt;Proto-dragons&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the aid of adventurers, they were able to hold the line until Kalecgos arrived to fend them off. As Khadgar prepared to focus on the Primalist threat to the east, he sent adventures to aid Kalecgos in his quest to reclaim the Oathstone. After they claimed the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt; and Kalec sent out a call to the other blue dragons for them to arrive, the pair were approached by Khadgar. He subsequently revealed that the Primalists were on the move and that &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; was personally leading an all-out assault on &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt;. As Vakthros was connected to the major ley lines of the region, its destruction would destroy the Archives and Span itself. Thus Khadgar and Kalecgos headed off to handle the situation from the sky, while directing adventures to head towards &lt;a href=\"Rhonin%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Rhonin's Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven as the pair clashed against the Primalist, something that &lt;a href=\"Drok%20Scrollstabber\"&gt;Drok Scrollstabber&lt;/a&gt; noted was a sight to behold, they sent out mirror images so that they may aid the champions who came to their aid. While they continued their efforts from the sky, they directed their allies with weakening the Primalists ground forces. Khadgar also called upon them to rescue the imprisoned Kirin Tor mages held in the Primalists grasp. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Korthrox%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Korthrox the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar and the adventurer rallied together. Their plan was simple and direct, as Kalecgos faced off against Raszageth who was attempting to rip all the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; out of the tower, Khadgar channeled his magic to replenish the &lt;a href=\"Ley%20line\"&gt;ley energy&lt;/a&gt; within the tower, and the champion would board an arcane disc and fight off the Primalist forces that had came to Raszageth's aid. Though they were able to stop Raszageth from destroying the tower, the trio found themselves wounded and at her nonexistent mercy. However they were quickly saved by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt; and his brood from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and with the additional numbers against her, Raszageth fled.\nWith the Azure Span safe, Khadgar joined the blue dragonflight in venturing to the Archives and witnessing Kalecgos successfully reactive the Oathstone.\nAfter Raszageth broke into the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; to free her fellow &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar, Kalecgos, and adventurers were sent into the Vault to stop her by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, while she and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; planned for whatever was to come. While the group was able to kill Raszageth, they were unable to prevent her from freeing her siblings, and the group was forced to flee, with Kalecgos and Khadgar immediately returning to Valdrakken. After they had shared what transpired, Nozdormu found that his vision was still clouded but sensed a dark future was coming, which causes Alexstrasza to reflect that Raszageth's reckless haste had caused her death and that the other Incarnates would not make the same mistake. Khadgar noticed that they were particularly concerned with &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;'s release over the others, causing the pair to reveal that while &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; were loyal to the Primalists' ideals, it was Iridikron who had truly devoted himself to the war, striking dark bargains to do so. However, Kalecgos rallied them together by reminding them that only together do they have a chance at victory. Thus the group vowed to move forward together, as one, against the Incarnates and were determined to protect Azeroth.\nSometime later, Khadgar and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; joined forces with the blue dragonflight and &lt;a href=\"Iskaara%20Tuskarr\"&gt;Iskaara Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; in combating &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk%20Assaults\"&gt;Suffusion Camp: Frostburn&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Grimtusk%27s%20Hideaway\"&gt;Grimtusk's Hideaway&lt;/a&gt;, he created a barrier that allowed for his allies to be protected from the stronger minions of Fyrakk, while noting that the lack of coordination between the Primalists and &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; helped ensure that they hadn't been overrun, and encouraged adventurers to help where they could.\nQuests.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar is involved in these quests:\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar is involved in many quests, but most notably the legendary ring chain:\nAuthorship.\nAs would be expected from an experienced and powerful mage, Khadgar has written a number of books and essays, including: \nAge and appearance.\nAppearance.\nOriginally, it was said that the spell Medivh used on Khadgar was reversed over time, his ability to use magic returned, as he did his agility, endurance, and strength, but his aged appearance remained. However later sources have changed this slightly. Most recent lore states that the life was literally drained from his body by Sargeras, instantly aging him into an old man. Although his body is now old and fragile, his mind remained that of a teenager.\nIn ' and ', Khadgar appears as a middle-aged man with a trimmed goatee and cropped red hair. Later in the game, he is shown to have a strip of white going through his hair and a longer greying beard (much as in the artwork of the \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20%26amp%3B%20Light\"&gt;Shadows &amp; Light&lt;/a&gt;\" RPG book).\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", Khadgar uses the classic archmage model. The monument erected in his honor in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; thus depicts him as an old archmage with a long, white beard. His appearance during \"\" matches this appearance. He, again, looks this way in .\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Chronicle%20Volume%202\"&gt;Chronicle Volume 2&lt;/a&gt; however, Khadgar looks significantly younger than his \"World of Warcraft\" appearance, and looks closer to his \"Warcraft II\" self. &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; stated that Khadgar had not de-aged, he was just freshly shaven. His age now finally matches his physique, as a man nearing his fifties. The reason the change was made was in order to have him look more like his &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20%28film%29\"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; .\nThis de-aging is referenced in \"\" where &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; notes that when asked about the fact that he seemed younger, Khadgar smiles but never responds.\nKhadgar has pale blue eyes.\nValley of Heroes monument.\nArchmage Khadgar has since been immortalized in stone, along with the other leaders from the expeditionary force, in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nLetters.\nWhen players reach level 100, Khadgar sends them a letter acknowledging this.\nQuotes.\n\"For Khadgar's Warcraft II quotes, see &lt;a href=\"Quotes%20of%20Warcraft%20II%23Khadgar\"&gt;Quotes of Warcraft II#Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe naaru are wise beyond our understanding.

Just a little longer before Kalecgos and I can aid you.\nAt \nIn the RPG.\nPersonality.\nKhadgar was once young and excited to be following the path of magic. Now he understands the dangers; and though he has accumulated incredible magical powers, he has also paid a terrible price that causes him to act as he appears \u2014 old before his time. His words are considered and thoughtful; since the corruption of a man he considered near to a father, his trust must be earned. He continues to accumulate arcane power out of a sense of duty calling him to protect Azeroth against an evil he knows all too well, and his pursuit of both knowledge and his enemies occasionally borders on the zealous.\nKhadgar rarely enters a battle unprepared. He will retreat when needed, only to return with more than enough force to overcome his enemies. In one-on one combat, he will initially probe his opponent while raising his own defenses, then strike decisively. He is driven to utterly destroy demonic and orcish enemies, but often settles combats that arise through circumstance by simply teleporting himself or his enemies far from the field of battle.\nPossessions.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar%27s%20Pipe%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Khadgar's Pipe of Insight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe innovative archmage Khadgar created the first of these pipes while studying with acolytes in Dalaran. Though the pipe of insight can look like any pipe, it is most often made with a stem of gnarled wood and a deep bowl made of yellowed bone. Sometimes the bowl has mystical lettering or runes carved into it.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar%27s%20Gem%20of%20Health\"&gt;Khadgar's Gem of Health&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is a flawless sapphire, set in a platinum circlet, offset by tiny diamonds. The stones seem to glow with their own mystical life. When held or worn by a character, the flickering matches the owner\u2019s heartbeat. The first of these special jewels was created by the archmage Khadgar to help keep him alive during his trials. Since then, others have been able to duplicate the creation.\nStaff of Nethergarde.\nThis simple oak staff is engraved with arcane glyphs and topped by a globe of cloudy crystal 6\u00a0inches in diameter. The staff of Nethergarde was crafted by Khadgar while studying portal magic in the Black Morass and protecting Azeroth against another invasion by the Horde.\nAlternate timeline.\n from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

On a quest to fathom the awesome &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; required to create the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the origins of the gateway with the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar then returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the ongoing study of the ruined Portal.\nSpells.\nThe Mages of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to discharge lightning from their hands when entering into a melee. These swift bolts of energy strike their victims regardless of any armor they may wear. Being the simplest of nature's forces to command, Lightning requires but a fraction of the caster's mana to employ.\n&lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magiks&lt;/a&gt; involving the cardinal elements of the universe are favorites of the Mages. The Fireball is launched from the palms of the Mage and streaks like a comet blazing across the battlefield - slamming its fiery bulk into whatever stands in its path.\nServing as both a weapon and a barrier, the Flame Shield is a binding of the chaotic force of fire to the aura of the chosen target. A twisting helix of fire that whirls about, the Flame Shield accompanies the one so enchanted wherever he may roam. Flame Shield will deliver damage to any grounded barrier that it comes into contact with.\nThe Mages of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; have been able to create a spell that hinders both movement and reflex. By warping the very patterns of time that surround his target, Slow enables the caster to bring an enemy's offensive to a crawl. Time cannot be held in check by even the mightiest of Mages, however, so the effects of this temporal shift cease as the power of the spell wanes.\nGleaned from sacred tomes rescued from the debris of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, this spell grants the ability to cloud the perceptions of others so that they cannot perceive the physical existence of the caster's target. The individual that is rendered Invisible may not perform any tasks such as attacking, harvesting or spellcasting. Should the individual interact with his environment in any fashion more aggressive than simple movement, the Invisibility will be dispelled and their personage shall be revealed.\nPerhaps the most fearsome of the Mage spells, Polymorph alters the physical form of its target. This metamorphosis changes man to &lt;a href=\"Critter%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;, forever warping both mind and body. This sorcery wholly transforms the victim into a creature of the wilds, thus losing their reasoning - making commands for direction or battle impossible. Although there is no counter for this spell, possessing a greater stamina does decrease the possibility of this enchantment taking effect.\nSummoning torrential storms from the frozen Mountains of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;, this potent spell calls down a fierce tempest of ice to assault the enemies of the Mage with a flurry of cold blades. Blizzard can be cast over large portions of the battlefield, making it an extremely powerful spell when facing legions of &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish troops."}

She took part in the Zandalari invasion of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and was a key figure in the revitalization of the Zandalari's &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nShadows of the Horde.\nUpon landing on Pandaria, Khal'ak was dispatched by Vilnak'dor to raid the local &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt;, a job she entrusted to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Trag%27kal\"&gt;Lieutenant Trag'kal&lt;/a&gt;. Her forces suffered heavy casualties thanks to a joint defense force led by &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt;, both seeking refuge at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Khal'ak arrived to inspect the damage afterwards, and was surprised to learn a troll -- and not just any kind of troll -- had aided her enemies. Tracking his footprints, Khal'ak identified them as belonging to Vol'jin of the Darkspear tribe, and plotted a trap to lure him into her grasp in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. To better \"motivate\" her soldiers, she had the corpses of the fallen trolls flayed and displayed around the village.\nAfter Vol'jin saved an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; scouting group from her Zandalari, Khal'ak subdued Tyrathan Khort and held him as a hostage. She promised his safety in return for Vol'jin's cooperation, which he gave. The two took raptors to a house hidden near &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt;, where Khal'ak had her companion groomed and bathed for the evening. She revealed her interest in (and attraction to) Vol'jin, stating that she had traveled far and wide to meet a troll of his caliber; any time she thought she had come close, she was let down. She further remarked that this was not their first encounter: Khal'ak had been present during &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;'s approved gathering by &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; to establish a grand troll alliance, and did not fault Vol'jin for walking away from it in favor of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He had walked past her when he left, and she studied his footprint, wondering if Zul's dream would fade first. Indeed, under Vol'jin's leadership, the Darkspear tribe had thrived -- but this was no longer the case in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s treachery. \nKhal'ak offered him a chance for the Darkspear to join the Zandalari as the first tribe of the empire, a prestige higher than both the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin agreed to consider her offer, and even accompanied her to witness the rebirth of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt;. Khal'ak and Vol'jin traveled across the ocean to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, where she introduced her new ally to Vilnak'dor. Outside, she discussed with Vol'jin the potential need to kill her master to smooth the transition of the Darkspear.\nIn due time, however, this was revealed to be a facade: Vol'jin had come to reaffirm his opposition to the Zandalari empire, and escaped that night with Tyrathan and his Shado-Pan companions. Khal'ak apologized to her master for this betrayal, and was nearly killed for allowing it to happen, but Vilnak'dor instead ordered her to take 500 warriors and obliterate the Shado-Pan Monastery. She also took along two mogu serving under Warlord Kao with her.\nKhal'ak surrounded the temple and saw through several of Vol'jin's ploys, though her army was battered by the traps set nonetheless.

In her mortal life, she was a &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. She plays a prominent role in both the &lt;a href=\"%3ANecrolords%20Campaign\"&gt;:Necrolords Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nMortal life.\nIn life, Khaliiq was a member of a people who were exploited and preyed upon. She asked &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; for vengeance and became a &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, a power that Khaliiq herself refers to as \"the double edged blade\". She subsequently kept her city safe and became known as \"the Blade in the Night\", but the power had a heavy cost. After her death, her soul was sent to Maldraxxus, where she honed herself to perfection. It's not known what world Khaliiq comes from, but she is not from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nAlong with her mistress, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Vashj\"&gt;Baroness Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, Khaliiq survived the near-destruction of the House of Eyes and the death of their leader, &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Akarek\"&gt;Margrave Akarek&lt;/a&gt;. Khaliiq accompanied Vashj in the marsh of &lt;a href=\"Glutharn%27s%20Decay\"&gt;Glutharn's Decay&lt;/a&gt; as the baroness pursued vengeance against &lt;a href=\"Mor%27Bitan\"&gt;Mor'Bitan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; responsible for their house's fall. At the &lt;a href=\"Renounced%20Bastille\"&gt;Renounced Bastille&lt;/a&gt;, the aranakk asked &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s to collect the ritual drafts held by three of Mor'Bitan's &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi%20necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; servants and bring them to her at the &lt;a href=\"Rotting%20Mound\"&gt;Rotting Mound&lt;/a&gt;, where Vashj and the Maw Walkers lured Mor'Bitan into the open and killed him. Khaliiq then followed her mistress to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; to join up with &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt;'s forces and was among those who defended the Seat when it was attacked by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nVashj later devised a plan to permanently bolster the Seat's defenses by stealing a &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; and\u2014with Khaliiq in tow\u2014traveled to the remains of &lt;a href=\"Nurakkir\"&gt;Nurakkir&lt;/a&gt; in the fallen &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Whisperer%20Vyn\"&gt;Whisperer Vyn&lt;/a&gt; and assemble a crew. Since Nurakkir's own helmsman perished with the necropolis, Khaliiq was tasked with finding a new one. With the Maw Walkers' help, she used a method Vashj had taught her to summon &lt;a href=\"Helmsman%20Caliroux\"&gt;Helmsman Caliroux&lt;/a&gt;, a lich of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;, and force her to serve the Eyes. When the full crew was assembled, Khaliiq and the other Eyes took control of Nurakkir by killing &lt;a href=\"Gorgantus%20the%20Gutter\"&gt;Gorgantus the Gutter&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhaliiq later briefly returned to the Seat to inform Draka and the Maw Walkers that the Eyes were ready to put Vashj's plan into motion by stealing the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;' own necropolis, the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;. Khaliiq, Vyn, &lt;a href=\"Navigator%20Xennir\"&gt;Navigator Xennir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ansid%20the%20Mechanic\"&gt;Ansid the Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;, and the Maw Walkers infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Ossein%20Foundry\"&gt;Ossein Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, where the necropolis was moored. The plan was for Khaliiq to regroup with Vyn once their tasks were complete, but when she met Xennir and the Maw Walkers at the rendezvous point, she revealed that Ansid had been captured by the foundry's guards. Khaliiq concluded that the Constructs had been prepared for the Eyes' arrival, and she lamented that Vashj would be disappointed in her lack of foresight. The Maw Walkers quickly freed Ansid, after which the group killed the foundry's overseer &lt;a href=\"Enforcer%20Borgulla\"&gt;Enforcer Borgulla&lt;/a&gt; and captured the mooring platform from which the Maw Walkers could travel to the necropolis' apex and use a keystone to take command of it. The Eyes then steered the Zerekriss away from the House of Constructs to have it patrol around Maldraxxus. Khaliiq returned to the Seat of the Primus to work on establishing a permanent portal connection between it and the necropolis.\nKhaliiq partook in the joint &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and necrolord assault on the House of Constructs, accompanying &lt;a href=\"Xandria\"&gt;Xandria&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Chains\"&gt;Hall of Chains&lt;/a&gt;. She also accompanied the necrolord forces when they prepared to assault the southern entrance to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;, but wasn't present during the assault itself.\nChains of Domination.\nVashj and her devoted were present in the Seat to witness the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; naming Draka the new margrave of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;. Khaliiq reaffirmed that her loyalty was first and foremost to Vashj, not Draka, and told her mistress that the Primus would surely soon restore the House of Eyes with her as its margrave. Khaliiq accompanied the baroness to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; during the mission to recruit &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;. She joined the diplomatic envoy to &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Keep\"&gt;Dominance Keep&lt;/a&gt; and was later among those who witnessed &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;' defeat.\nSome time after this, Vashj gave Khaliiq the mission of helping &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt; clear out &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s remaining loyalists\u2014the last of the traitors who'd been involved in Akarek's death\u2014from the House of Rituals. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;night fae&lt;/a&gt; hunter &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Maldraxxus in search of the souls of former Night Warriors who could save the life of the current Night Warrior, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, by taking on a portion of her power. Huln and a Maw Walker entered the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Sepulcher of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; for information about the Blade in the Night. Khaliiq did not want to be found and tried to waylay them with traps, but they made their way to her at the top of the tower and explained their mission. She agreed to help them, but only after her current task was complete. After getting permission from Vashj back at the Seat, Khaliiq and the Maw Walker headed to the House of Rituals, where they killed a number of Ritualists whom Sin'dane had pointed out as still being loyal to Kel'Thuzad, led by the three &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es &lt;a href=\"Zelmany\"&gt;Zelmany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drava%27ora\"&gt;Drava'ora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fal%27zinge\"&gt;Fal'zinge&lt;/a&gt;. Although it would not bring back her margrave, Khaliiq commented that she was pleased at getting her revenge. She reported the success to Sin'dane aboard the &lt;a href=\"Exoramas\"&gt;Exoramas&lt;/a&gt; and then headed to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; while the Maw Walker went to Revendreth to help Huln recruit another Night Warrior, the aforementioned Stonewright.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, Khaliiq, the Stonewright, &lt;a href=\"Thiernax\"&gt;Thiernax&lt;/a&gt;, and the Maw Walker participated in a ritual to save Tyrande, but Elune's power began to overwhelm the priestess and she was only saved by the interference of the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Khaliiq and the others subsequently joined the queen at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; to witness her restoring the the night fae's lost &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;."}

As such, she is the leader of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Clan Teerai&lt;/a&gt;, the cultural &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt; of all the Maruuk clans, and a direct descendant of &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt; herself. She rules from atop the &lt;a href=\"krutal\"&gt;krutal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; and is protected by the &lt;a href=\"khansguard\"&gt;khansguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSarest grew up with her sister &lt;a href=\"Mariq%20Dotur\"&gt;Mariq&lt;/a&gt;. She was \"quite the troublemaker\" as a child and once let a raft of &lt;a href=\"ottuk\"&gt;ottuk&lt;/a&gt;s loose in &lt;a href=\"Teerakai\"&gt;Teerakai&lt;/a&gt;. Mariq died at some point, but her spirit still watches over Sarest as she leads the centaur clans.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; returned to the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;, Sarest agreed to let one of their emissaries attend the Maruuk clans' &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt;\u2014with &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in tow\u2014reached the city, the dragons' emissary &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt; arrived and met with Sarest and the khans in the krutal. She asked the centaur to honor their ancient pact with the green flight by aiding them against the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; and helping them empower the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;Emerald Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. The Khanam Matra agreed to do so and stated that, if &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; willed it, she would blow the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; the following day to signal their accord with the dragons. The meeting was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt;, who accused Sarest of dishonoring &lt;a href=\"Maruuk\"&gt;Maruuk Thousandbones&lt;/a&gt;' memory by allying with dragons. Sarest ordered him to stand down, but Balakar responded by revealing his allegiance with the Primalists, killing Gemisath, and having his Nokhud attack the other clans in an attempt to take control of Maruukai.\nThe adventurers who'd accompanied the Shikaar defeated Balakar's forces, after which Sarest declared that her promise to Gemisath still stood and that the Maruuk and dragons evidently needed each other's help again. She told Sansok Khan and &lt;a href=\"Tigari%20Khan\"&gt;Tigari Khan&lt;/a&gt; to prepare their clans for war and sent the adventurers to Teerakai to deliver her orders to her lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Khansguard%20Jebotai\"&gt;Jebotai&lt;/a&gt;: to marshal the Teerai forces, send messengers to the other clans, prepare Teerakai's defenses, and ask the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; to find Ohn'ahra so that Sarest could obtain her blessing and blow the Horn of Drusahl, since she knew that she could not win the war against the Nokhud without the dragons' aid.\nThe adventurers later returned and informed Sarest that the Primalists had captured Ohn'ahra. In response, she sent all of her scouts to find Ohn'ahra before the Nokhud could attack Maruukai again, but instead &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tomul\"&gt;Scout Tomul&lt;/a&gt; arrived and reported that Balakar and the Nokhud had attacked the Teerai village at the Horn of Drusahl. Sarest assumed that Balakar intended to destroy the Horn to prevent her from summoning the dragons. Sansok warned that it might be a diversion. Sarest agreed and decided not to commit all the Maruuk's forces, instead traveling to the Horn to confront Balakar herself with only the khansguard, Tomul, and the outsiders as company. She ordered Tigari and Sansok to prepare their clans to march on &lt;a href=\"Nokhudon%20Hold\"&gt;Nokhudon Hold&lt;/a&gt; once the dragons had arrived. On arrival at Drusahl, Sarest found that the Nokhud had massacred her people, and she decided that Balakar was irredeemable. Sarest and the adventurers retook the village from the Nokhud, rescued the surviving Teerai, and killed Balakar's lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Warmonger%20Kharad\"&gt;Warmonger Kharad&lt;/a&gt; to reach the top of the hill, where they discovered Balakar and the Primalist leader &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt; holding Ohn'ahra captive behind a protective wind wall. Using Ohn'ahra, Balakar blew the Horn and lured the green dragons &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solethus\"&gt;Solethus&lt;/a&gt; into a trap that resulted in Solethus' death. Koroleth then forced Ohn'ahra to teleport her and Balakar away.\nSarest ordered Tomul to return to Maruukai and tell the khans about a change of plans: instead of heading to Nokhudon Hold, they would march to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and join the dragons against the Primalists. Meanwhile, Sarest and the adventurers traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Watering%20Hole%20%28Ohn%27ahran%20Plains%29\"&gt;Watering Hole&lt;/a&gt; to help Merithra, explain the Nokhud's betrayal, and tell her that she still had the support of clans Teerai, Shikaar, and Ohn'ir. Merithra accepted Sarest's offer of aid and returned to the Emerald Gardens with the adventurers while Sarest gathered her forces. Upon entering the Gardens, the Khanam Matra's army found Koroleth's Primalists and their Nokhud allies gathering at the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Scar\"&gt;Storm Scar&lt;/a&gt;, and she sent scouts\u2014&lt;a href=\"Aru\"&gt;Aru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belika\"&gt;Belika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boku\"&gt;Boku&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ohn%20Seshteng\"&gt;Ohn Seshteng&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to watch areas around the battlefield. After Merithra's forces arrived, Sarest accompanied the adventurers onto the battlefield to destroy the Nokhud's &lt;a href=\"dragonkiller%20ballista\"&gt;dragonkiller ballista&lt;/a&gt;e so the dragons could join the fray. They then helped Merithra destroy Koroleth's defenses and cut off the Primalist reinforcements by shutting down the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Corridor\"&gt;Storm Corridor&lt;/a&gt;, before engaging and killing Koroleth herself. With the Primalists scattering, Merithra invited Sarest, her fellow khans, and the adventurers to join her at the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, where they held a ceremony to renew the vow Merithra had made with the centaur's first matriarch, &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt;, through an exchange of ceremonial gifts. Sarest's gift, representing Clan Teerai, was &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20the%20Khanam%20Matra\"&gt;a horn&lt;/a&gt; holding a few drops of her blood as proof of her unbroken descent from Teera; Merithra commented that Sarest was very much like her ancestor. Sarest and Merithra vowed that dragons and centaur would work together to protect the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and the Ohn'ahran Plains, causing the dragons' &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;Emerald Oathstone&lt;/a&gt; to reawaken.\nBefore the adventurers left, Sarest asked them to aid the Maruuk again by rescuing Ohn'ahra, who was still held captive by Balakar in Nokhudon Hold, while the centaur held off the &lt;a href=\"Nokhud%20Offensive\"&gt;Nokhud Offensive&lt;/a&gt; across the plains. Following the liberation of Ohn'ahra and the death of Balakar, she announced that his weapon would be broken, denying him a place of honor with the ancestors, and expressed hope that Clan Nokhud would be able to heal now that they were free of his influence. Following this declaration, she returned to Maruukai.\nAfter adventurers reach renown 25 with the Maruuk, Sarest reflects on the aid they have given, how they were no longer an outsider but a familiar face to the centaur, and thus to honor that bound she gave them the title of Khansguard.\nSome time later she was approached by adventures who inquired if she knew anything about &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Windtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Windtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;, on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. She revealed that she knew nothing about the tribe and that she couldn't provide any aid, as despite Balakar's death the plains remained contested territory and her forces were stretched thin. She thus suggested that they turn see if &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt; could provide assistance, which ultimately led to &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tomul\"&gt;Scout Tomul&lt;/a&gt; being sent to aid them.\nShe later led the Maruuk against &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk%20Assaults\"&gt;Suffusion Camp: Cinderwind&lt;/a&gt;, where she was aided by the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; portion:\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Storm%20Scar\"&gt;The Storm Scar&lt;/a&gt; portion:\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;:"}

The town is surrounded by the stark wintry wilds of Dun Morogh, so adventure is a common commodity and some of the less tenacious folk in town might pay good coin to complete various tasks in the surrounding region. Kharanos is home to a large forge, a gnomish &lt;a href=\"workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;, and the famous &lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew%20Distillery\"&gt;Thunderbrew Distillery&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s can sit down and drink some of the best ale available in the world.\nFor all its quaint charm, Kharanos is a hub of military activity, defending against all manner of threats in the region. Directly to the west is a large cavern inhabited by fierce &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt;. To the northwest, the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; have rooted themselves atop &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. Kharanos is where all new recruits fresh from &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar\"&gt;Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; report to begin their adventures in earnest.\nOnce, a giant Frostmane troll attacked the town and almost killed every dwarf. Only &lt;a href=\"Lazlo%20Grindwidget\"&gt;Lazlo Grindwidget&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat the troll and thus was honored as a hero of Kharanos. Shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of the world, earthquakes hit Kharanos. All the citizens were rescued by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and some members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;, the town was invaded by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. It was defended by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, guards, and adventurers of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Several citizens were rescued, while others were inspired to battle as well.\nIn the RPG.\nAside from Ironforge, Kharanos is the largest settlement in Dun Morogh. The town's steep roofs and sturdy wooden architecture are surrounded by a stone wall that keeps monsters at bay. Kharanos' dwarves are expert hunters and take special joy in using their long rifles to bring down timber wolves. This town, in &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt;, is a welcome sight to a weary traveler."}

During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; following the death of High King &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, Khardros went to war for control of Ironforge itself. The Bronzebeards won and banished the other two clans away from Ironforge. Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors traveled north through the barrier gates of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;, and they founded their own kingdom within the distant peak of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Wildhammers thrived and rebuilt their stores of treasure. Khardros defended Grim Batol when &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt; attacked the home of the Wildhammers. Khardros fought his way through her army and eventually faced Modgud herself, killing her. The rest of Dark Irons were completely annihilated. King Khardros joined King &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and led their forces into &lt;a href=\"Redridge\"&gt;Redridge&lt;/a&gt;, but stopped and returned home when &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; was released and &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; killed in the process.\nAfter the war, due to Grim Batol being uninhabitable, the Wildhammers were offered a place to live within the borders of Ironforge by King Bronzebeard, but the Wildhammers steadfastly refused. Khardros took his people north towards the lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Settling within the lush forests of the Hinterlands, the Wildhammers crafted the city of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs High Thane, Khardros had an iron scepter that signified his position. It may have actually been the handle of the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20High%20King\"&gt;Hammer of the High King&lt;/a&gt;, which had disappeared during the War of the Three Hammers. When asked by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, his eventual successor, of its origins, he simply replied that its past was not important; its significance lay only in what it had become. He would not offer anymore than that, and Kurdran had no reason to ask.\nAfter his death, his and Madoran's sons had statues built in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Valley of Kings&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; to honor the late king of the Wildhammers and Bronzebeards and to remind the world of the threat of Dark Iron clan."}

Sacrificial magic was considered the greatest violation of life. \nWhen pushed to the brink, even the wild will make a necessary sacrifice for the greater good. Many &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s sacrificed themselves in order to defeat &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the Third War.\nIt is said that a sacrifice of life is the only way to ensure the saving of another.\nInfluences.\nDemon.\nExperiments require resources. Thorngrin the Tender makes sure that Kael'thas's botanists have the power and essence they need to reveal the naaru's secrets, even if that means untold numbers of living creatures must be sacrificed to obtain it.\nDesperate to show his worth to the Burning Legion, Zevrim Thornhoof told his masters he could enslave the formidable ancients who still roamed Dire Maul. When his own power proved insufficient, Thornhoof turned to other living creatures for additional energy, butchering them atop his sacrificial altar and harvesting their essence in their final, agonizing moments.\nFel magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;Fel magic&lt;/a&gt; requires a sacrifice (e.g. a living fish or two, a few strands of seaweed) to fuel it.\nRedemption.\nStating that it is said that a sacrifice of life is the only way to ensure the saving of another, the demon &lt;a href=\"Avrus%20Illwhisper\"&gt;Avrus Illwhisper&lt;/a&gt; ensured that no matter what, the moonstones will cure Relara. With his razor sharp claws, Avrus dug into his chest and removed his beating heart, placing it with the fallen moonstones. Miraculously, the satyr did not die. Instead he was bathed in a warm light and transformed into &lt;a href=\"Avrus%20the%20Redeemed\"&gt;Avrus the Redeemed&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagecraft.\nIt's typical &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;craft to conjure a thing of such beauty (such as a &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Jade\"&gt;Mana Jade&lt;/a&gt;), only to sacrifice it.\nOrc.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; was the unholy place where Orcs came to make sacrifices to their gods, and the Necromancers of the land gathered to invoke the will of their dark masters.\nPaladins.\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s strongly believe self-sacrifice is a tool to be used for the greater good.\nKnights of the Silver Hand.\nAlthough the act of sacrifice is not exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, they consider it to be a staple of their creed.\nTroll.\nAfter the Great Sundering, famine and violence spread until the jungle trolls begged their gods for aid. One god answered: Hakkar the Soulflayer. He gave the jungle trolls great power, but in return he demanded that they sacrifice trolls in his name. As his hunger for blood grew, he ordered his priests, the Hakkari, to bring him physically into the world of Azeroth so that he could feed directly on his victims.\nSacrifices are common place in Zandalari society and Vilebranch trolls are known for performing sacrifices."}

It consumes a portion of the Voidwalker's health, granting the warlock an absorption shield that is similar to a &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;priest's&lt;/a&gt; ability. The ability consumes 25% of the voidwalker's base health, so as long as the voidwalker isn't near death, there is very little chance that the use of this ability will kill the demon. The duration of the Sacrifice shield is 30 seconds.\nSacrifice is learned automatically by your Voidwalker at level 28.\nTactics.\nIt's very useful when using &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;, making a getaway or to extend your life in PvP combat. Using Sacrifice in &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; is especially useful because when you die and resurrect, you get your Voidwalker back without having to re-summon it. Even if you are not &lt;a href=\"Demonology\"&gt;Demonology&lt;/a&gt; specced, this ensures that'll you be able to sacrifice him at least once without having to re-summon.\nHaving &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Synergy%20%28Wrath%20Classic%29\"&gt;Fel Synergy (Wrath Classic)&lt;/a&gt; will allow you to heal the voidwalker back for the health he loses very quickly and makes the use of the shield a non-issue as long as the pet is in reasonably good health.\nIt is possible to summon another demon while under this shield. In an emergency you can Sacrifice your Voidwalker, resummon it (it will now be at full health), and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Link\"&gt;Soul Link&lt;/a&gt; with it again.\nTrivia.\nThis spell was known as \"Sacrificial\" Shield during the Beta tests."}

She plays a central role in the &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis%20campaign\"&gt;Zereth Mortis campaign&lt;/a&gt;, in which she facilitates the creation of a new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to help the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies restore balance to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early chapters of the campaign, before Saezurah's name is revealed, the game refers to her as simply the Oracle.\nBiography.\nA pattern disrupted.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; was rendered dormant and later destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the Shadowlands and the design of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; fell into disarray. Saezurah set out to restore her masters' design by using the empty &lt;a href=\"vessel\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;replacement Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s arrived to Zereth Mortis, Saezurah and her &lt;a href=\"Automa%20Defender\"&gt;automa defenders&lt;/a&gt; were attacked by &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Cradle%20of%20Nascence\"&gt;Cradle of Nascence&lt;/a&gt;. A nearby Maw Walker and the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; heard her voice call out for help and defended her from a devourer swarm led by &lt;a href=\"the%20Culler\"&gt;the Culler&lt;/a&gt;. However, she was only able to deliver a cryptic message about restoring the Shadowlands before her injuries caused her to fall into a coma. Pelagos brought the unconscious oracle on a gurney to the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; elders in &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, but they refused to help since they didn't believe that an oracle would ever contact Pelagos and the Maw Walker and warned them against meddling with servants of the First Ones.\nPelagos and the hero instead brought the oracle to the exile &lt;a href=\"Firim\"&gt;Firim&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Exile's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Saezurah's presence activated a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Core\"&gt;mysterious core&lt;/a&gt; the Maw Walker had previously obtained for Firim, causing it to awaken into an automa named &lt;a href=\"Pocopoc\"&gt;Pocopoc&lt;/a&gt; who bonded with the Maw Walker and began teaching them how to understand the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Cypher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker subsequently returned to Haven to resume their efforts against the Jailer while Pelagos and Firim stayed with Saezurah in Exile's Hollow.\nRetrieving the vessel.\nSome time thereafter, the energy emanating from Saezurah started gradually increasing until three fractal orbs appeared around her body and a loud clamor began. Firim sent Pelagos to fetch the Maw Walker from Haven. When they arrived with Pocopoc, the latter started reacting to Saezurah's energy. The Maw Walker examined the fractals around the oracle until she suddenly sent a vision into the hero and Firim's minds, telling them of the dormant vessel waiting atop the &lt;a href=\"Resonant%20Peaks\"&gt;Resonant Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. Saezurah then seized control of Pocopoc, taking control of the smaller automa's actions and speaking through it with her voice to tell the Maw Walker to follow before the vessel was consumed by devourers.\nVia Popopoc, the oracle guided the Maw Walker on a trip to the top of the Resonant Peaks and into the chamber where the vessel waited. The activation of the vessel attracted swarms of more devourers, but the Maw Walker used Pocopoc to fend them off until it could teleport itself, the hero, and the vessel back to Exile's Hollow. Pocopoc then released its gathered energy into Saezurah, restoring her to life. She told Firim, Pelagos, and the Maw Walker that more needed to be done and explained how the vessel would be used to create a new Arbiter once her preparations were complete.\nThe new Arbiter.\nWhen the oracle was ready, the Maw Walker was summoned back to Exile's Hollow. Saezurah explained that the vessel needed to be filled with a soul slumbering in the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; in order to become an Arbiter. However, the Crypts had been overrun by the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, so the Maw Walker, Pelagos, and &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt; rounded up the forces of the &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s to breach the entrance. After the forces gathered in the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt;, Saezurah sent the hero to free some imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Automa%20Scryer\"&gt;automa scryers&lt;/a&gt; that were needed for the ritual. Together, the covenants fought their way into the Crypts, where Saezurah had the Maw Walker kill Mawsworn intruders and restore the flow of souls that the Mawsworn had tampered with.\nFinally, they were ready to begin the ritual. However, as the automa scryers channeled on the vessel, one of them revealed itself to be a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; and summoned the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Echo of Argus&lt;/a&gt; to take the vessel, killing the scryers and incapacitating everyone else but the Maw Walker in the process. The hero was able to bring Saezurah and the others back to their wits and defeat the echo, but the vessel was left without a soul and the scryers were irreparable. However, rather than giving up, Saezurah simply and cryptically said that the cycle still awaited a new voice.\nPelagos suddenly spoke up, offering his own soul to be placed in the vessel. Kleia\u2014his &lt;a href=\"Soulbinding\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt;\u2014tried to protest, but he insisted that this was his destiny. Saezurah greeted Pelagos as a \"new voice\" and \"worthy soul\" and placed his soul within the vessel, transforming him into the new Arbiter, who then took his place in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. With this, Saezurah had completed her task of restoring harmony to the Shadowlands. However, the Mawsworn remained outside the Crypts, so the Maw Walker and their allies left through a portal created by Firim before the Mawsworn could find them. Saezurah's subsequent whereabouts are unknown.\nQuotes.\nDialogue.\nWhen approached or interacted with in Exile's Hollow, she may say one of the following:\nAll of these voice lines are shared with her click quotes (see below).\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Now a corpse doll serving the interests of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, his identity was used by the demon to form the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, a fanatical, corrupt and extremist sect dedicated to the destruction of the undead and, after the manipulations of Balnazzar, to the slaughter of anyone who opposes their doctrines.\nIt was only after years of manipulation that Saidan's body was destroyed, after &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s pushed the nathrezim to his limits in an attempt to eliminate him.\nBackground.\nSecond War.\nOriginally a knight of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Saidan Dathrohan was nearly six and a half feet tall. He eventually found faith and got closer to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, studying with Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he was chosen by the Archbishop as one of the four candidates from Lordaeron to start the order of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad&lt;/a&gt;. While traveling with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s army, Saidan and the others were trained vigorously day and night by Faol, who taught them how to use the Light to comfort their allies, to smite their enemies and how to lead by example, as they would be more than weapons but beacons of hope to guide the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As their training progressed, Faol presented each of the paladins with enchanted &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s that were among the church's most ancient relics. Each libram represented a core trait of the Silver Hand that Faol challenged his students to become the living embodiment of, and Saidan was given the Libram of Holiness.\nDuring Tirion's &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand%23Formation\"&gt;ceremony of induction&lt;/a&gt; into the Order of the Silver Hand, Saidan, who was one of his closest friends, was in charge of placing the silver plates upon Tirion's shoulders.\nFollowing the Second War, he, Uther, Saidan, and Tirion were present during the introduction ceremony in the order of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time they had all been together after many years.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nA few years before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Saidan, then Lord Commander of the order, established himself in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. He was the direct superior of his friend &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, who lived in &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and ruled over the province of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. Contacted by the paladin &lt;a href=\"Barthilas\"&gt;Barthilas&lt;/a&gt;, who was suspicious of Tirion's intentions towards an &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; that had been found in the area, Saidan traveled with an escort to Hearthglen to meet his old friend. After a warm reunion, a meeting took place in Mardenholde Keep where Saidan questioned Tirion about the presence of orcs on his lands. Despite Tirion's attempts to assure him that the situation was under control, Saidan explained that a &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;new Warchief&lt;/a&gt; had just manifested, and that he had started the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s in order to create a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nFacing this terrible threat, he ordered Tirion Fordring to escort them to the ruined tower where he fought the old orc, in order to ensure the death of the latter or to hunt him down if not. Hours later, they reached the ruined tower in &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen%20Woods\"&gt;Hearthglen Woods&lt;/a&gt;, and after discovering Eitrigg, Saidan ordered the orc's capture. However, Tirion tried to stop his men, and Saidan was forced to capture Tirion. He tried to bring Tirion back to his senses and asked him to stop opposing them, but faced with the latter's refusal, he had no other choice than to accuse him of treason and to send him to Stratholme to stand trial.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Major%20trial\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, Saidan gave his testimony to the jury, consisting of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, and Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. After being dismissed by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, he was disgruntled by Barthilas\u2019 lack of respect for his former master, being against the latter's attempts to try to impress him by treating Tirion with cruelty as a traitor. When Tirion was asked to reject his vow of honor for Eitrigg, in order to put it all behind him, Saidan implored his friend to accept this pardon from Uther and the jury. But when he refused, Dathrohan sat down heavily on his chair, shaking his head in dismay.\nFollowing Tirion's trial and banishment, Saidan was present at Stratholme when was organized the execution of the orc Eitrigg. He talked for a few moments with the crowd and Barthilas, before withdrawing, as he had no interest in watching the vulgar spectacle so soon after his friend's trial. When Tirion intervened to save the orc, Saidan reappeared and stared at his former friend with grief and revulsion, but could not intervene due to the Horde's attack on the city.\nThe Ashbringer.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, after the purification of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;dark crystal&lt;/a&gt; brought by &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, Saidan arrived to announce that &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; suspended the paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; from service. Soon after Alexandros Mograine went to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to forge a new weapon against the Scourge, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas\"&gt;Sir Thomas&lt;/a&gt; reported to Saidan, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; was a traitor working with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Although Thomas wanted to aid him and the knights, Saidan reminded him that he has a family to take care of and that no one in the order would blame him for spending some time with them in these dark times. As his superior, he ordered the paladin to return home to rest and see his family.\nA few days after the death of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, Thomas returned to Saidan to serve him. Learning that his wife did not want to go to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Saidan comforted Sir Thomas, and explained that he needed to fight more than ever to protect them from the undead.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Saidan and Alexandros led the remaining members of the order to &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, where they were welcomed by &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; to make plans in their fight against the undead. After the Third War, during an assault on the Scourge-held city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, Saidan was separated from the others and captured by the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;. The demon slew him and possessed his body, which he prevented from decaying with his magic. In the guise of such a respected holy warrior, the dreadlord was confident that he could twist most of the remaining paladins into his service. However, Alexandros Mograine was beyond his reach, and the sooner he was gone, the sooner the other paladins would fall under Balnazzar's influence.\nNow a corpse doll serving the interests of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the identity of Saidan Dathrohan was used to manipulate &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, he then turned the young human to darkness and forced him to commit one of the gravest of acts, to murder his own father with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Highlord was killed, and the Ashbringer lost to &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, Saidan became the leader and Grand Crusader of his newly created order: the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. He was later present during the introduction ceremony of Renault as a paladin and blessed him as Commander of the Scarlet Crusade, he also promoted &lt;a href=\"Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Abbendis\"&gt;Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;es to positions of authority in the new organization.\nAmong the paladin, some of the suspected that a dark force had taken hold of Saidan and his closest followers, but they could not prove it. Only &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to survive the ambush at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, blamed Saidan for sending him and Alexandros to their deaths. Pretending to be innocent, the possessed paladin accused the priest of being infected and had him executed.\nFor years, Balnazzar used Saidan's body to slowly transform the Crusade into a fanatical sect dedicated to the destruction of the undead and to the slaughter of anyone who opposes them.\nA Cleansing Fire.\nAt some point after the creation of the Scarlet Crusade, the possessed Saidan recruited &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas\"&gt;Sir Thomas&lt;/a&gt; in their ranks. When Thomas was ordered to kill a \"plagued\" village, he mistakenly killed his own family and went mad from grief. After being knocked out and forced into confinement by his fellow Crusaders, his insanity steadily grew worse and he began muttering demented little rhymes in different pitches and tones. Consequently, Saidan came up with a plan on how to help him - while the nathrezim was in fact responsible - and sent him to fight the undead on the upcoming &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;. However, this only made Thomas' insanity intensify as he slew both friend and foe alike, and the Crusaders were forced to behead him.\nAfterward, Saidan proposed to prepare the body himself for cremation, once alone Balnazzar emerged from Saidan's corpse, and using his own blood, infused Thomas' body with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies to raise the paladin as the &lt;a href=\"Headless%20Horseman\"&gt;Headless Horseman&lt;/a&gt;, in order to spread fear and chaos during the holiday that is meant for giving peace of mind and hope for the future.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nYears later, from the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins of Stratholme, the possessed Saidan led a group of elite Crusade warriors known as the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Legion\"&gt;Crimson Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and continued to manipulate the leaders of the Scarlet Crusade, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; to accomplish his goals.\nWhen Taelan was convinced by his father &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; to leave the Scarlet Crusade, the Grand Crusader heard the news of his betrayal and sent Isillien with assassins to kill the Fordrings.\nUpon the disbanding of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Blade\"&gt;Veiled Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarien%20and%20Sothos\"&gt;Jarien and Sothos&lt;/a&gt; decided to join the Scarlet Crusade, but they were slain by Dathrohan for failing the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20knight\"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; initiation rites inside his chamber.\nAt some point, adventurers attacked the Scarlet Bastion and faced the Grand Crusader. During the fight, the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; revealed his true form, thus destroying Saidan's human remains. They then brought the head of the demon to &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Nicholas%20Zverenhoff\"&gt;Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that the Scarlet Crusade was used by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; as the pawns to a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;greater evil&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Balnazzar released the possessed body of Grand Crusader Dathrohan, slaughtered all the Scarlet Crusaders in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and used his &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic powers&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect their corpses as the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nTo fight back against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; they saw as having corrupted &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed their order, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, Saidan Dathrohan, Scarlet Commander &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Morgraine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after, the paladin Saidan Dathrohan became Grand Commander Dathrohan. He took command of the organization, while Abbendis and Isillien took control of the troops.\nAs the head of the Scarlet Crusade, the Grand Crusader Saidan Dathrohan is served beneath him by the Scarlet Oracle &lt;a href=\"Demetria\"&gt;Demetria&lt;/a&gt;; High General Abbendis; Grand Inquisitor Isillien; Highlord Taelan Fordring; and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Lord%20Valdelmar\"&gt;Crusader Lord Valdelmar&lt;/a&gt;. The grand crusader handles the grisly, prolonged siege of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, but struggles to hold a small outpost known as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt; in the undead-infested city of Stratholme, the Scarlet Crusade\u2019s holiest site.\nGrand Crusader Saidan Dathrohan masquerades as a pious &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, but in reality he is the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;. Balnazzar, an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, manipulates the Scarlet Crusade to war against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, former pawn of the Burning Legion. The heroes may inadvertently intercept missives to Dathrohan that imply he is loyal to a force other than the Scarlet Crusade.\nNo one in the crusade is aware that Dathrohan is a demon \u2014 they simply believe him to be a holy knight obsessed with the destruction of the undead. Balnazzar possessed the body of the paladin Saidan Dathrohan, who then helped found the Scarlet Crusade, an order of knights focused on the singular goal of defeating the Scourge in all its forms, and he uses this fact to his advantage as much as possible, intending not only to defeat the undead but one day to secure his hold on &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nItems.\nWhen he was under the &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;guise&lt;/a&gt; of Saidan Dathrohan, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; kept on him the greatsword &lt;a href=\"Demonshear\"&gt;Demonshear&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Hammer of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. After the fight, the weapons were recovered, along with &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Tyranny\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20the%20Nathrezim\"&gt;demonic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, and sealed by sacred wards in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; under the watch of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral items that dropped within &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; bore the title \"Grand Crusader\" such as &lt;a href=\"Belt%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Belt of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leggings%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Leggings of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spaulders%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Spaulders of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Crusader%27s%20Helm\"&gt;Grand Crusader's Helm&lt;/a&gt; also drops from &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, there is an &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Relic\"&gt;artifact relic&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Dathrohan%27s%20Signet\"&gt;Dathrohan's Signet&lt;/a&gt; rewarded by &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Shackle\"&gt;Mr. Shackle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"A%20Favor%20for%20Mr.%20Shackle\"&gt;A Favor for Mr. Shackle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dathrohan%27s%20Ceremonial%20Hammer\"&gt;Dathrohan's Ceremonial Hammer&lt;/a&gt; drops from &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Skarloc\"&gt;Captain Skarloc&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crusade%20Commander%20Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Crusade Commander Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; rewards &lt;a href=\"Dathrohan%27s%20Mace\"&gt;Dathrohan's Mace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadlord%20Balnazzar\"&gt;The Dreadlord Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;."}

The head cook on a ship is usually called the galley chief. The &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; maintains machines and mechanisms. The leaders of most sailors and the boats they serve on are called &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captains&lt;/a&gt;. The more skilled among them are usually called mates and navigators who serve their captain and act as the captain's lieutenants. The second in command is usually called \"first mate\". Often ships carry soldiers called &lt;a href=\"marine\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt;s who specialize in battle at sea or from a ship. Marines may or may not have specific sailing skills.\nThey tend to operate under standard five-year contracts when signing on with a new crew as evidenced by the crew of the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hatecoil\"&gt;Hatecoil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; have been capturing sailors off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and forcing them to work for the &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s of the coves.\nSailor and crewman are neutral terms, whereas &lt;a href=\"buccaneer\"&gt;buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;, freebooter, and &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; tend to have negative connotations.\nPositions.\nCommon titles among crews are as follows, ranked in order of power:\nThe average crew and ship can operate just fine with one person in each of these positions, excluding deckhands which require around twelve."}
