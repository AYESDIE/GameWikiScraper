It was from here that Doren produced the &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s that struck down &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Hellscream's Fist&lt;/a&gt;, outside of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Hold\"&gt;Thunder Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by Nazgrim captured the airstrip but abandoned it sometime later.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Doren\"&gt;Captain Doren&lt;/a&gt; established the airstrip because &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Hold\"&gt;the ruins&lt;/a&gt; he set himself in and surrounding jungle were too dangerous for the air traffic of the &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s given to him by the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Skyseeker\"&gt;Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Volunteer\"&gt;Pandaren Volunteer&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Honeydew%20Village\"&gt;Honeydew Village&lt;/a&gt;, curious of their new neighbors, agreed to help. They soon realized that the site was a war base, but the soldiers there kept them against their wills. The Alliance also stockpiled fireworks launchers, perhaps to use them as improvised weapons, as they were capable of bringing down gyrocopters. Along with Doren, the base was staffed by a few other personnel of note: a dwarven death knight named &lt;a href=\"Morgus%20Grimhatchet\"&gt;Morgus Grimhatchet&lt;/a&gt;, the famed &lt;a href=\"Corporal%20Jackson%20Silver\"&gt;Corporal Jackson Silver&lt;/a&gt;, and the two engineers responsible for the base's supply of gyrocopters: &lt;a href=\"Master%20Engineer%20Cogswing\"&gt;Master Engineer Cogswing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gyro-Mechanic%20Lavenderp\"&gt;Gyro-Mechanic Lavenderp&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Regroup%21\"&gt;regrouping&lt;/a&gt;, Horde forces struck out from the recently captured &lt;a href=\"Nook%20of%20Konk\"&gt;Nook of Konk&lt;/a&gt;, eliminating the base's soldiers and lieutenants, freeing the workers, and destroying the gyrocopters. Doren was found in his holdout, the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Defiance\"&gt;Den of Defiance&lt;/a&gt;, on the outskirts of the base. After a confrontation with an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, Doren succumbed to the malignant influences of the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;. After his defeat, &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; claimed the airstrip in the name of the Horde, and used it to launch attacks on the nearby &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hozen\"&gt;Forest Hozen&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Horde forces there allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, however, the base was left in flames."}

{"id": "354820", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=354820", "title": "Strongbo", "text": "Strongbo, also known as simply Bo, was the greatest martial arts master on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, holding a position known as Geomaster. Although primarily a melee fighter, Bo seems to have some shamanistic powers, specifically within the element of earth.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nDuring his days training as a fighter, Strongbo was close friends with &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;. Where Chen split his skills evenly among storm, earth and fire, Bo focused solely on earth. The two both knew that some day they would challenge each other to decide who would be the master of the Wandering Isle's martial arts school, taking the position of \"Geomaster\". However, over time Chen grew a sense of wanderlust and would often laze about daydreaming. Bo attempted to tell him that all they would need was at their home. They had an argument, and on the day of their challenge Chen did not appear - he had left the island. Bo grew to resent and remained angry at Chen since that day.\nHe grew to be the Wandering Isle's most successful martial artist. Among his students were &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shisai%20Stormstout\"&gt;Shisai Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;.\nLi Li's Travel Journal.\nStrongbo was teaching a group of young cubs when he noticed Li Li walking beside the pools, and correctly guessed that she was up to no good. He would later catch Li Li as she was exploring the &lt;a href=\"Pei-Wu%20Forest\"&gt;Forbidden Forest&lt;/a&gt; and take her home. &lt;a href=\"Chon%20Po\"&gt;Chon Po&lt;/a&gt; declared that her punishment would be to suffer a full week of training at the &lt;a href=\"Singing%20Pools\"&gt;Singing Pools&lt;/a&gt; under Bo's watchful eye.\nPearl of Pandaria.\nAfter Li Li ruined a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Festival\"&gt;Spirit Festival&lt;/a&gt; performance she was participating in by sleeping behind the curtains, she got into an argument with her father &lt;a href=\"Chon%20Po%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chon Po Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; about how the pandaren of the Wandering Isle had forgotten the lessons of &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt;: that life was an adventure. Chon Po ordered Li Li to never again enter the island's library, but Li Li stormed off and ran away to find her Uncle Chen. Chon Po hired Bo to find her, and he swore on his life that she would not come to harm.\nBo found Li Li in the Salty Sailor Tavern in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and told her to return to the Wandering Isle. Li Li, having expected him, told a pair of goblin bruisers that he took her rocket mount. As Bo fought them off, Li Li ran off into the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; on her way to Stormwind and the ship Chen was on. That night Bo found Li Li by some troll ruins, having seen her fire from town. Bo told her they were going home immediately, but Li Li convinced him to at least try some of the tea she had brewed first. Bo agreed, but after one sip he fell unconscious from something Li Li had slipped in the drink.\nThe next day found Li Li in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, picking &lt;a href=\"Silverleaf\"&gt;Silverleaf&lt;/a&gt; when Bo caught up to her. Li Li said that nothing he did would convince her to go home. As they walked through the fields, she noted the smell of sulfur and fireworks. Focusing on Bo once again, she told him that she wasn't going home and so far hadn't been hiding from him either. What if she actively avoids him next time? What would he tell Chon Po? Li Li told him he'd have to return alone and ran off into &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Bo followed, telling her he'll accompany her until she realizes what a harsh and dangerous place &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; really is and begs him to return home. As the pair made their way to Stormwind, they were watched by the goblin &lt;a href=\"Rumblefitz\"&gt;Rumblefitz&lt;/a&gt;, the source of the smell Li Li had noticed earlier, and his ogre partner &lt;a href=\"Blokk\"&gt;Blokk&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, Li Li was reading up on the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Bo made a joke that perhaps the Light could shine on Thunderbrew so they could leave, catching the attention of a nearby priest. He told them of the Thunderbrew ale and &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;, which was currently going on. While waiting for the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;, Li Li asked Bo why he was always so grumpy, especially whenever she talks about Chen. Bo told her that he and Chen used to be friends, but didn't continue on the subject. As they boarded the tram, Li Li smelled the same scent from earlier, the scent of sulfur and \"the stuff Granny &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; drinks to help her sleep.\" This time, Bo smelled it as well.\nOn the tram, Li Li was preoccupied by how fast they were going though Bo was paying more attention to the scent. He found the source was Rumblefitz, and realized the goblin had been following them all day. Rumblefutz tossed a potion which caused an explosion, sending passengers flying and knocking Bo onto the car behind them. Li Li fought off Rumblefitz, knocking him off the car and onto the tracks. However, Bo told her they should have questioned him. Li Li wanted to know why it matters what he wanted, and Bo said this was just another reason the world was dangerous.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, Bo complained about how the carved out city was harming the earth elementals in the area. Li Li told him how the dwarves evolved from the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;, created specifically to dig out the crust of Azeroth. Bo replied that the earth was in distress, and he could feel the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;pressure&lt;/a&gt; building. Li Li replied that that didn't mean it was the fault of the dwarves. The subject turned more lighthearted as the two of them found a group heading out to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; for Brewfest. Li Li decided that dwarves were suddenly her favorite people.\nAt Brewfest, the two of them ran into &lt;a href=\"Daran%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Daran Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, who was shocked at seeing pandaren and thought they were figments of his grandfather Grimbooze's imagination. He told them the story of how &lt;a href=\"Grimbooze%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Grimbooze Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt; and Chen once had a drinking contest that would be recognized as the original Brewfest. Daran told them that after that day, Chen had moved on to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to find hops for his brews. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; attacked Brewfest then as they always do, and Bo and Li Li aided in the defense of the kegs. &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; himself appeared then, saying that Chen helped him during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and any friend of Chen's was a friend of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Li Li requested transportation from Magni, and he provided them with a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt; mounts.\nLi Li wrote a letter to her father and sent it to the Wandering Isle as a magic-powered origami crane. As Li Li continued to want to know Bo's history with Chen, he told her the story; how Chen and Bo were great friends fated to duel to decide who was Geomaster, and Chen left the island the day of their fight. Li Li thought it was a stupid reason for Bo to hate her uncle. Their zeppelin flew over &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and Li Li told Bo a very brief summary of the story of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe goblin pilot told them that because of &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co.\"&gt;Venture Co.&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Crag\"&gt;Windshear Crag&lt;/a&gt; was cleared out and therefore a nice open spot for them to land. Bo asked for an explanation, and upon finding out that they dealt in natural resources he declared goblins parasites and a disease. Having landed in Stonetalon, Bo used his shamanistic powers to communicate with the earth spirits and find a hidden valley in the north where the plants Chen had looked for grew. Li Li decided to have a race, and Bo's ram grew excited at the prospect, storming off at an incredible speed.\nHowever, the valley was seemingly empty, despite Bo sensing the plant there. &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Orremin\"&gt;Keeper Orremin&lt;/a&gt;, along with two &lt;a href=\"dryads\"&gt;dryads&lt;/a&gt;, appeared and declared that nature's gifts were elusive. Orremin told the two of them his meeting with Chen, working with him to fight off goblins from the valley though in the process the rare &lt;a href=\"indellium\"&gt;indellium&lt;/a&gt; plants were largely destroyed. Orremin removed the illusion on the valley, revealing the hops and offering some to Bo and Li Li as friends of Chen. Orremin pointed them to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; next, saying Chen was going there to reflect on the past.\nOn the road again, Li Li brewed the plants into a beer which she declared her very best work. Bo declined her offer, stating he doesn't drink, and so she saved a large amount in the &lt;a href=\"Jug%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Cups\"&gt;Jug of a Thousand Cups&lt;/a&gt; to give Chen later. The two soon came across the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, where Li Li recounted a legend that once the ancient pandaren delivered a gift to the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; said to contain all the arcane magic the night elves would ever need. Li Li believed it could be found in Eldarath, but inside the temple, the pandaren-made chest she found was empty. Bo commented that that \"was\" the message the pandaren left the elves, all the arcane magic they would ever need... nothing. They didn't need arcane magic. He wondered what Li Li had been expecting, and she had hoped for a clue from her uncle.\nBo asked if she had seen enough by now, but Li Li was determined to find some clue to find Chen. As the two argued about their travel, Bo didn't notice that Li Li had ran from the temple as he spoke and been kidnapped by the fel orc &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt;.\nRahjak left a message carved in stone telling Bo that Li Li had been brought to an island and he was to come alone or she would die. Bo arrived at sunrise, fighting Rahjak to free Li Li. Early into their match, Rahjak's sword shattered Bo's staff. Bo kept one of the broken fragments on his person and tossed the other at Rahjak, but the orc dodged it. However, he gained the upper hand and knocked Rahjak into a rock formation then slashed at him with the broken wood. Rahjak replied with &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and surrounded Bo, catching him off guard and wounding him mortally across the chest. Rahjak prepared to kill him, however at that moment Chen Stormstout arrived on the island upon a &lt;a href=\"X-53%20Touring%20Rocket\"&gt;X-53 Touring Rocket&lt;/a&gt;.\nChen took over the fight from Bo, and was able to steal Rahjak's sword to kill the naga &lt;a href=\"Zhahara%20Darksquall\"&gt;Zhahara Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; who was holding Li Li. With Chen's back turned from Rahjak the orc attempted to kill him, but Bo stabbed him through the torso with the broken piece of his spear he had held on to. Since Bo was dying, he asked Chen to take Li Li home, as he could not do it himself. He wished to watch the sunrise in his last moments, and as Chen and Li Li left on Chen's rocket, his body became one with the earth as he passed away, turning into a stone pandaren figure eternally sitting on the shores of the island."}

This has changed, for they are now rare and the modern Horde seems to favor large towers or &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; as hub for their &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSecond War.\nThe massive, jagged spires of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; stronghold were a constant reminder to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; of their power and dominance. As the center of larger orcish settlements, the stronghold could process resources in the same fashion as a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hall%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt; - and the overseer could induce the production of more &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; from the pitiful worms under his command. These intimidating structures of steel and stone used techniques in their construction that served as strong barriers, greatly reducing the damage inflicted by attacking forces.

Stronghold can also refer to both the building and the community within its walls, and as such many races besides the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s are known to build fortified areas and call them strongholds.\nFor some reason, the orc stronghold design used in \"Warcraft III\" was combined with the Horde &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; design used in \"Warcraft II\" (minus the rear fifth tower) to create the type used in \"World of Warcraft\", though it is notable that barracks and strongholds are sometimes interchangeable in dialogs. Similarly, the human &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; design used in \"Warcraft III\" was combined with the Alliance barracks design of the same game to create the type used in \"World of Warcraft\". It is unknown why the second-level &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;s and barracks of both races were merged.\nConsidering that the &lt;a href=\"Town%20Hall%20%28garrison%29\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; is referred to by &lt;a href=\"Serka\"&gt;Serka&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt;, its level 3 variant could be a stronghold. This would match with &lt;a href=\"Warspear%20Keep\"&gt;Warspear Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which is using the same model and is designated by its name as a fortified military structure.\nOrc keeps.\nDespite being designated as &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt;s, most of these are using a stronghold model instead, though some of them uses a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; model as well.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn \"\", the ruins of a stronghold could be seen in the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;."}

Strov was one of the survivors of the war and served the Alliance through the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt;. He was known to be non descriptive, having average height and average build which made him a very good tracker.

As they were returning, the group of soldiers was attacked by orcish members of the Burning Blade clan. He and &lt;a href=\"Clai\"&gt;Clai&lt;/a&gt; survived and tried to follow their orcish assailants but the orcs teleported out of the location.

He wears a full &lt;a href=\"Battlegear%20of%20Might\"&gt;Battlegear of Might&lt;/a&gt; and wields the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Glaive&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nWhy now, &lt;race&gt;? I just do not understand it. So much work to be done...\nIn the RPG.\nCommander Mar'alith fought many wars in his life. Before long, he realized that the only way to save the world was to safeguard nature from the malevolent forces that sought to destroy it. After long years of tutelage, he learned the ways of the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and was admitted into the Cenarion Circle. He now commands the Cenarion Circle forces in Silithus. Commander Mar'alith's wife, Mistress &lt;a href=\"Natalia%20Mar%27alith\"&gt;Natalia Mar'alith&lt;/a&gt;, recently began to behave strangely, and she went missing shortly afterward. The commander is worried, although in the weeks before her disappearance, his wife steadfastly maintained that she was perfectly well. Little does the commander know that she had gone insane... or perhaps been possessed?...and had voluntarily entered a large silithid hive in the area."}

She is also entrusted with &lt;a href=\"The%20Keystone\"&gt;The Keystone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"When the fallen blood elf leader, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, seized control of the Tempest Keep, he immediately ordered Commander Sarannis to prepare defenses against whomever the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; might send to reclaim the keep.\"\nStrategy.\nCommander Sarannis walks back and forth over a bridge. On the right end of the bridge stands her entourage, which consists of Bloodwarder Protectors and Sunseeker Stewards. The entourage will pull in groups of three (1 Steward, 2 Protectors). It is wise to ensure the Commander is pathing over to the far side of the bridge before you pull.\nThough this is a pretty straightforward fight, the Commander will use Arcane Resonance (magic &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;) that increases arcane damage taken by 1200, which she stacks twice, and then attacks with an arcane damage blast. It can be dispelled, but she applies it often (If you have a back up healer and a priest, dispel it, as damage is nasty).\nAfter 1 minute into the fight (and every subsequent minute the encounter might take) she will spawn four adds that need to be dealt with quickly, 1 elite (healer) and 3 non-elites. It is recommended that you use an AoE Fear when the adds first appear and then continue to keep the healer out of range and feared until the non-elites and the Commander are dead. Note: The healer \"can\" be sheeped. After the boss is killed, any remaining adds do \"not\" despawn. They must be killed.\nThe boss is both tauntable and disarmable.\nA different approach is that of a priest using mind control on one of the Stewards just before the boss. The Steward will be able to easily tank, DPS, and kill the adds with its AoE, making the encounter rather easy. \nYet another approach: since the boss and adds do not really hit very hard on normal, if your group have a pally tank, you can simply have the pally aoe tanks both the boss and adds. The non-elites adds can be killed quickly, followed by the elite add, then back to the boss.\nHeroic: Same fight as before, but the debuff is applied a lot more frequently. The resulting arcane-damage taken is approximately 3-4K with the debuff, so dispel this as fast as possible. She and her adds both hit a lot harder, roughly around 1800~ damage on a well-geared tank from the main-boss. Not much variation from other heroic-instances."}

He will periodically cast Desecration under the tank and the melee which players must move out of. The tank will need to move him away from Desecrate, but due to Shield of the Perfidious he should not be turned to face the group. Therefore tanking him against a wall and kiting him along it is recommended. The boss remains stationary while casting the shield and the tank can move out to avoid damage. Springvale's adds do weak melee attacks so, if needed, a plate-wearing DPS can pick them up while the tank is managing the boss. Both adds cast Unholy Empowerment on him which gives him an extra stack of unholy power, and heal him. These should be interrupted as often as possible, especially the heal. Adds can and should be CC'ed so that only one is active at a time. The achievement To The Ground! requires especially coordinated add management. This fight has a high DPS requirement and groups may opt to skip it and move on, as it is not required to finish the instance.\nIt is also possible to burn cooldowns early and focus fire the boss, while the tank picks up adds. This strategy will be more taxing on the healer and still requires high DPS output. Although just as difficult to accomplish, the primary advantage of this method is that the length of the fight is greatly reduced.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Yet devising battle plans is for the mantid general; Vo'jak craves only blood.\"\nAbilities.\nThe Escaped Prisoners.\nThe mantid captured these three Pandaren during the initial attack on Niuzao Temple, but the prisoners were able to break free of their bindings and fight back. Now they stand ready to do whatever it takes to end the siege.\nStage One: Bring It!\nCommander Vo'jak orders his forces to attack the players.\nStage Two: Your Defenses Did Not Stop Me!\nCommander Vo'jak's enters the battle as his forces near defeat at the hands of the players.\nStrategy.\nThis fight comes in 2 phases.\nPhase 1: \n4 waves of the Sik'Thik army make their way up the platform. You get kegs of tar to defend yourself with. Throw the kegs of tar near eachother and in the path that the army walks through. During the waves a Sik'Thik Amberwing bombards the platform, move out of the yellow circle to avoid damage. You can use the kegs on the adds that reach the top, be carefull not to hit your party members. Take out any of the army that reaches the top of the platform. Demolishers blow up with 1 hit and blow up any enemys that stand near them, shoot them before they reach the top.\nWave 1 = Sik'Thik Swarmers\nWave 2 = Sik'Thiks Demolishers\nWave 3 = Sik'Thik Swarmers &amp; 1 Sik'Thik Warrior\nWave 4 = Sik'Thiks Demolishers &amp; 1 Sik'Thik Warrior\nPhase 2:\nCommander Vo'Jak makes his way up the platform.\nKeep your back towards a wall at all times, he charges for a random party member and does a knock back.\nMove out of his charging path to avoid damage.\nUse a keg of tar on him to remove his Rising Speed buff.\nMove away from Vo'Jak when he casts Thousand Blades (AoE spinning attack)\nReapply the tar debuff once he's done spinning."}

In spite of his impressive firepower, however, he is killed in the melee."}

In-game, all Alliance characters understand Common, and its counterpart for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; language.\n&lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s can understand Common. The &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grizzik\"&gt;Grizzik&lt;/a&gt; could speak Common, having learned it after watching the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; for only a short time. The &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Unng%20Ak\"&gt;Unng Ak&lt;/a&gt; could speak a broken form of Common as far back as during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt; too can speak Common.\nSome &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; find Common to be a crude language, and &lt;a href=\"Conqueror%20Krenna\"&gt;Conqueror Krenna&lt;/a&gt; calls it a \"pig-tongue\".\nCommon primer.\nIn-game parser.\nThis is the list of words created by the in-game language parser for the Common language, which is listed as language number seven (word range 423-546) in the Language text file. In the in-game translator, the language parser for Common shares similar words with Gutterspeak and Gnomish. The parser is used to mask both npc and players that speak \"Common\" when encountered by the Horde.\nNote: The language algorithm used by the in-game \"translator\" merely makes the words look like Common. It does not actually use a specific dictionary. Therefore, translated in-game speech isn't true Common.\nIn the RPG.\nDialects or languages derived or related to Common include &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gutterspeak\"&gt;Gutterspeak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Nerglish&lt;/a&gt;. Common is known by many races, and it is used as a universal language by most members of the races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Most if not all races have at least some understanding and speak some dialect of Common.\nBecause Common is a universal language known by many races, characters that have never had contact with other races are often able communicate with each other on their first meeting. Other racial languages (&lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Gnomish&lt;/a&gt;, etc,) are normally limited to their specific races, but are often learned by races that are most likely to encounter those races or read their language. \nThe modern \"Common\" seems to share words with the English language, mixed with words from an ancient tongue (actually some Welsh, Latin, and other historical languages). For example, &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt; is the Common term for the race that is a mixture of ogre and orc ancestry, whereas &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; (lower-case) is the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; term for the same race. At least two known dialects of true Common exist, a modern dialect, which relies more on English, and the &lt;a href=\"Azotha\"&gt;\"ancient tongue\"&lt;/a&gt;, from which the modern Common is derived.\nHuman names.\nHuman parents grant a child its given name at birth, while its family name has a long history and usually speaks something of its bearer\u2019s ancestry. Some humans change their family names to emphasize their own accomplishments.\nSpeculation.\nCommon may be a universal language as a variety of races speak it with one another in-game, and the language was used to communicate between the tauren and night elves as early as 10,000 years ago.\nAlphabet speculation.\nThe monument behind &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; has Common carvings in it, utilizing a variant of the runic alphabet from ancient Scandinavia. Taking time to match letters with one another and translate the entire tablet showcases a full alphabet. This translation was completed by ."}

This makes it possible to provide default values to nil or false expressions, or implement something resembling the C/C++ ternary expression (A?B:C):\nFor instance:\n print(UnitExists(\"target\") and \"You have a target\" or \"You don't have a target\")\nA notable limitation of using short-cut evaluation as a ternary expression is that the middle expression must not be false/nil. (After all, there is no actual ternary expression; you are simply chaining boolean expressions and must still follow their rules of precedence.)\n function isFrameShown(frame, checkParentFrames)\n -- The expression below returns the wrong value if frame's parent is hidden.\n return checkParentFrames and frame:IsVisible() or frame:IsShown()\n end\nIf you find yourself writing code of the style A and B or C, you may need to rewrite it to ensure that B can never be false or nil.\nColon syntax for defining methods.\nThe colon syntax is used for defining methods -- functions that have an implicit first parameter \"self\". The following function definitions are equivalent:\n function t:foo(bar) end\n function t.foo(self, bar) end\nWhen you call a function using the colon syntax, you implicitly supply the table left of the colon as the first argument to the function. The following two function calls are equivalent:\n t:foo(\"baz\")\n t.foo(t, \"baz\")\nThis notation is frequently used to emulate something resembling objects.\nThe global environment table.\nThe global environment table codice_1 is defined in most function environments. You can look up global variables by using their names as a key in this table. For example:\n -- Suppose MyBar1, MyBar2, MyBar3 are global variables (Frames created in XML, for example)\n for i=1, 3 do\n _G[\"MyBar\" .. i]:Show()\n end\nThe &lt;a href=\"API%20getglobal\"&gt;getglobal&lt;/a&gt;(\"name\") function used to do the same thing, but has now been deprecated and removed."}

However, this title can also refer to other Blizzard employees who posts on forums, such as developers.\nOfficial info.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"http%3A//blue.cardplace.com/newcache/forums.worldofwarcraft.com/1602652671.htm\"&gt;Blue Appreciation Day!&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Nethaera\"&gt;Nethaera&lt;/a&gt;:\nWe also do many other things from contests, contact with Fan Sites, news posts, internal meetings, reading through the forums and other news sites, F.A.Q. information, helping the moderators with moderation as we see it necessary, and we also each have other internal tasks that we handle. Our jobs aren't strictly on the forums. We also did a lot of work on BlizzCon recently. As we've said before, there are many aspects of our job that you don't see or if you do see it, you don't realize it came from us. While it's nice when someone sees our work and appreciates it, we're more focused on just getting the job done and we work with many teams within the company with funneling information. \nFrom &lt;a href=\"http%3A//blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-shaman/669661.htm\"&gt;My Role&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Eyonix\"&gt;Eyonix&lt;/a&gt; (Shaman specific parts in gray):\nOne of my functions a community manager is to provide information as it becomes available and is approved for posting. When I receive information, or am able to extract information from an appropriate source, I begin the approval process to make it public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nI don't have control over the content of the information, nor do I have control over any aspect of the approval process. Also, it's not uncommon for me to post information and due to circumstances well out of my control, a decision is made which makes the information I provided erroneous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAnother purpose I serve is to provide player feedback to the development team. This feedback is gathered from numerous locations, which include but are certainly not limited to these forums, in-game chat, fan sites, guild sites, and third-party discussion forums. Also, it's important to note that I focus on providing feedback concerning all areas of this game, not just that which is offered from a specific class, or that which pertains only to a specific avenue of this game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nI can assure you, I've expressed the feedback of this class to the design team. I've also provided everything that I'm able to in terms of content information and direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBeyond all of this, as a Community Manager I'm also here to moderate discussions, provide personal insight, offer humor, spotlight community related items, and silently absorb much of what our players are expressing and feeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nIn addition, I work very closely with PR and Web on a variety of tasks and projects. Much of my work goes unnoticed to the player, yet its effects are felt and would be missed if I wasn't around to provide it. My team also operates as a source of information for nearly every department within the company, due to our collective knowledge, which is vast as a result of our eyes and ears being allowed in places which are restricted to many others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nI wrote this post primarily because I've seen threads requesting clarification on what my role within the company was, and in general see a great deal of expectation surrounding the opinion of what I should be doing, and how I'm failing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nI also wrote this post to state that if you're unhappy with the game or your chosen class and wish to blame me for some reason -- that's fine. I'm not in the least bit unfamiliar with this type of misdirected emotion, however, if you cross a line in expressing your dissatisfaction, please don't be surprised when you find you can no longer access our boards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWhen new Shaman information presents itself, you'll hear about it. In the meantime, discuss the game and keep matters civil. This is a game, and if you're constantly feeling hostile, I'd strongly recommend a break.\nProviding feedback.\nTo provide feedback on a Blizzard Community Manager, send an email to wowcmfeedback@blizzard.com.\nUS forums (English).\nPast moderators.\nModerators no longer exist - they are now part of the Community Managers\nOther US-based Blizzard posters.\nAlthough not officially CMs, various other Blizzard employees post on the forums, including:"}

Several of these companions have their own characteristic behaviors (see individual descriptions). Companions do not affect combat in any way, and are generally of no direct benefit to your character. Companions can be inspected and summoned through the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Journal\"&gt;Pet Journal&lt;/a&gt;. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%205.3.0\"&gt;patch 5.3.0&lt;/a&gt; the game features 580 different companions.\nWith \"\", a whole new side has been added to companion pets with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Battle%20System\"&gt;Pet Battle System&lt;/a&gt;. Players can battle their non-combat pets against others, with a unique system of turn-based combat. Pets have their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, and gain experience from battling, growing in strength as they increase in level. Players can utilize their current non-combat pets or capture new wild pets to level them and battle them against others, although a select few cannot be used to battle. For more information see &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Battle%20System\"&gt;Pet Battle System&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can collect up to a total of 650 companions, and up to 3 of any one pet. Many companions can be caged and traded to other players. Players are also able to rename their companions.\nOverview.\nYou can own as many companions as you like. Each one you acquire is added to the pets section of your character sheet. You can only have one companion out at a time, and summoning another one replaces the one that's already out. Once summoned, companions will attempt to accompany your player character as you move about the game world. Some appear to be better at this than others. Jumping down from an elevated location will often send a companion off on a circuitous route to reach your new location. If your companion gets left behind, it may catch up and reappear but may have to be re-summoned. There is no penalty for re-summoning. (The &lt;a href=\"Tiny%20Snowman\"&gt;Tiny Snowman&lt;/a&gt; is stationary, and will not follow you.)\nCompanions cannot &lt;a href=\"attack\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; or be attacked in the normal sense, however, some such as &lt;a href=\"Sleepy%20Willy\"&gt;Sleepy Willy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lil%27%20K.T.\"&gt;Lil' K.T.&lt;/a&gt; will kill &lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Rocket%20Bot\"&gt;Clockwork Rocket Bot&lt;/a&gt;s will battle each other, and &lt;a href=\"Crashin%27%20Thrashin%27%20Robot\"&gt;Crashin' Thrashin' Robot&lt;/a&gt;s \"will fight other fighting robot companions\", a PvP game within the game. Companions have a small hidden amount of health and can be killed by the pet swimming in lava, standing on fires, or other environmental means of damage, while some, such as the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Rocket%20Bot\"&gt;Clockwork Rocket Bot&lt;/a&gt;, may occasionally self-destruct. Certain companions such as &lt;a href=\"Winter%27s%20Little%20Helper\"&gt;Winter's Little Helper&lt;/a&gt; are unavailable outside of certain times.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Parrot\"&gt;Blood Parrot&lt;/a&gt;, spawned from the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Admiral%27s%20Hat\"&gt;Bloodsail Admiral's Hat&lt;/a&gt;, and the Coyote Spirit, spawned from &lt;a href=\"Don%20Carlos%27%20Famous%20Hat\"&gt;Don Carlos' Famous Hat&lt;/a&gt;, are exceptions and are summoned from the corresponding item. These are both items of apparel of some value in their own right, and having the item of apparel disappear when the pet is spawned would not be a welcome change. Because these two pets spawn differently, they are not true companions and do not count toward the pet &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Peddlefeet\"&gt;Peddlefeet&lt;/a&gt;, when spawned by being shot with a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Shafted%20Arrow\"&gt;Silver Shafted Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, is also an exception and does not count toward the pet achievements.\nIf you are &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed or use any form of transportation that reloads the environment your companion disappears and has to be re-summoned. The only &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s that don't is the zeppelin \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Zephyr\"&gt;The Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;\" between &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Kalu%27ak\"&gt;Kalu'ak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"turtle%20boat\"&gt;turtle boat&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile some companions can only be purchased by certain &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s, most vended companions and many dropped companions can be traded at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;. Companions obtained through quests are &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be sold.\nOriginally, pets you learned how to summon could not be learned again. However, in the interests of the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Battle%20System\"&gt;Pet Battle System&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to collect many duplicate pets in order to differentiate by &lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt;, and thus battle abilities.\nGame considerations.\nTrading.\nCertain pets can be traded, usually only the ones that can easily be reattained. To trade the battle pet, click right on the pet in the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Journal\"&gt;Pet Journal&lt;/a&gt; and choose codice_1. This option will place them into a Pet Cage - the name of the cage will change based on what's placed inside.\n\"Note: Currently only the player that places the pet into the cage can tell what's inside, everyone else will see the generic cage link.\"\nOther types.\nThere are companions that can be acquired for a time that aren't normally regarded as companions, but pretty much do the same thing as permanent companions. Many of these are in the context of a quest. Some examples are the orphans for &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt;, Peddlefeet from the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Shafted%20Arrow\"&gt;Silver Shafted Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, Nass from &lt;a href=\"Kickin%27%20Nass%20and%20Takin%27%20Manes\"&gt;Kickin' Nass and Takin' Manes&lt;/a&gt;. None of these count toward the pet count achievements. When a temporary companion is spawned your current companion is despawned.\nNote: The might appear to be a temporary companion, but will draw &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; like a &lt;a href=\"combat%20pet\"&gt;combat pet&lt;/a&gt;, even though it does not fight. \nAchievements.\nCompanion-related achievements are awarded for collecting certain numbers of companions:\nThe Raiding with Leashes series reward players for collecting rare companions drops from older raid bosses:\nNumerous achievements also offer new companions as rewards, including &lt;a href=\"Looking%20For%20Multitudes\"&gt;Looking For Multitudes&lt;/a&gt; and many in the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Battles%20achievements\"&gt;Pet Battles achievements&lt;/a&gt; category.\nAPI.\nA number of companion-related functions exist as part of the &lt;a href=\"World_of_Warcraft_API%23Companion_Functions\"&gt;World of Warcraft API&lt;/a&gt;, chief among them &lt;a href=\"API%20GetNumCompanions\"&gt;GetNumCompanions()&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"API%20CallCompanion\"&gt;CallCompanion()&lt;/a&gt;.\nPast bugs.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, Oct 14, 2008, introduced the companion inventory item, the container, as a charged item with a single charge that spawns the companion in your pets section. After the patch was introduced, all existing pet items (i.e. those in the mail, in your bags, in the bank, etc.) were disallowed from being put up for auction. The auction system would see the pet items as \"an item with charges used\" and would not post them. These items are still usable, but simply may not be auctioned. New pet items created after the patch, by purchasing from a vendor or receiving as loot, may be auctioned as before."}

{"id": "65733", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=65733", "title": "Comparison of Aldor and Scryer rewards", "text": "This article is meant to be a side-by-side comparison of &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryer&lt;/a&gt; rewards, two factions located in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. The article aims to make it easier for players to decide which faction they want to side and gain reputation with.\nNote that while gaining reputation for either faction, you will also gain reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; until honored.\nOverview.\nWhen you first reach &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and are level 60 or higher, you are given a choice between two factions: The Aldor and the Scryers. Which you choose will have various impacts on you, not only on which faction rewards you can purchase, but also in which quests you might pursue. And while you can revert from one to another, it is best to avoid making a haphazard choice.\nThis page provides some a quick side-by-side comparison for how each faction may benefit a character. What this page does not do is tell you which faction you need to choose specifically. You are strongly encouraged to look at all the items before you make your choice.\nRep Item Availability.\nOne potential factor to take into consideration is the availability of the items used to raise your reputation with either faction. For the Scryers, the two primary items are &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Signet\"&gt;Sunfury Signet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Tome\"&gt;Arcane Tome&lt;/a&gt;s, while the Aldor use &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Marks of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Armament\"&gt;Fel Armament&lt;/a&gt;s instead.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/toplist/buttons.html\"&gt;Game Statistics posted on the WoW homepage&lt;/a&gt;, players (on the week from July 16 to July 22, 2008) looted Sunfury Signets twice as often as Marks of Sargeras and Arcane Tomes 84% more often than Fel Armament. Similarly, 28% more Sunfury Signets were sold on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; than Marks of Sargeras, and 56% more Arcane Tomes were sold than Fel Armaments. While this does not reveal data for prices, how often they are encountered clearly will affect Auction House prices.\nThus, obtaining rep items for Scryers appears to be easier and/or cheaper than obtaining Aldor rep items. Naturally, one could deliberately farm either faction's items and would likely encounter decent drop rates if farming the appropriate areas, but common player activities (especially &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas%20quests\"&gt;daily quests on the Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;) seem to encourage the acquisition of Scryer items over Aldor ones.\nInn/Tier Position.\nThe Scryers Hearth location on their tier is closer to the ground than the Aldor tier is, meaning that characters can run off it without taking the elevator (death is assured when jumping from the Aldor Tier to the main city ring without protection). The Scryers are also slightly closer to the flight master. Impatient players hence may want to consider the Scryers for these reasons. If you are a keen chef, both inns have fires (or braziers) that can be used for cooking directly outside the entrances. -- As a note, you could theoretically bind at the Scryer inn and then become an Aldor, however, the arcane guardians on the Scryer Tier are actively hostile to Aldor players, just like the Vindicators on Aldor Rise are actively hostile to Scryers.\nThe Aldor Hearth location on their tier is connected via a tunnel directly to Nagrand making it rather convenient at the 64 - 66 range to get to Nagrand (though there is also the flight path). Hunters and those interested in Kurenai/Mag'har faction could find the ease of access convenient - this exit can also be reached by Scryers but you must use the main elevator (not the one between Scryer and Aldor rise) and be careful to not get too close to any Vindicators.\nInscriptions.\nInscriptions are shoulder-slot enchants that can be applied by anybody to their own armor. Both factions' greater inscriptions carry the same stat types, but give higher values to one stat. Aldor items tend towards damage, healing, attack power and dodge. Scryer items tend towards Crit rates, MP5 and defense.\nCrafting Recipes and Trainers.\nBoth factions offer various crafting patterns and plans that are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; which become available to you as your reputation level increases. The items you craft, however, are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20On%20Equip\"&gt;Bind On Equip&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to make them for characters other than your own. However, only the Scryers currently offer an Alchemist recipe.\nOriginally, the only Shattrath jewelcrafting trainer was located on the Aldor Rise. &lt;a href=\"Kirembri%20Silvermane\"&gt;Kirembri Silvermane&lt;/a&gt; and a bookcase in the &lt;a href=\"Seer%27s%20Library\"&gt;Seer's Library&lt;/a&gt; were added later to the Scryer's Tier to provide jewelcrafting training there. However, &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City%20Peacekeeper\"&gt;Shattrath City Peacekeeper&lt;/a&gt;s and even &lt;a href=\"Scryer%20Arcane%20Guardian\"&gt;Scryer Arcane Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s still only direct players to the Aldor Rise for jewelcrafting training.\nThe Scryers' Tier is home to a master enchanting trainer. Enchanting was once only trainable to 300 by going into Uldaman or talking to the Master Enchanter on the Scryers' tier, but it is now possible to train to 300 from any Enchanting trainer in a major city.\nThe tailoring patterns for &lt;a href=\"Imbued%20Netherweave%20Tunic\"&gt;Imbued Netherweave Tunic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imbued%20Netherweave%20Robe\"&gt;Imbued Netherweave Robe&lt;/a&gt; are only sold in &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Sanctum of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; town in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. You can buy the patterns when you are neutral to the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;. Tailors who plan to make the tunic or the robe should purchase the patterns before choosing &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, they will need to find a &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; / neutral player to purchase it for them. (The patterns are not &lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt;.)\nQuest rewards.\nIn addition to faction purchases, Aldor and Scryers also offer different quest lines with different rewards. For example, the quest &lt;a href=\"Shutting%20Down%20Manaforge%20Ara\"&gt;Shutting Down Manaforge Ara&lt;/a&gt; is available for both factions, but offers vastly different rewards:\nEach faction has its own quest chains in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, the item rewards for equivalent quests are the same for both factions. In other cases, there are different rewards.\nShattered Sun Pendant.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; rewards added in patch 2.4, there are four epic neck that have &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt; effects that provide different benefit depending on whether you are exalted with Aldor or Scryer: , , , . Note that you need to be exalted with Shattered Sun Offensive to purchase these and exalted with Aldor or Scryer to have the proc effects.\nAnalysis.\nHealers.\nYou may be in for some tough choices. While Aldor gives more Spirit overall, and more &lt;a href=\"Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; when combined with the robe and staff, Scryers have more crit. The trinket might also be good. The shoulder enchantments are the reverse, Aldor providing substantial &lt;a href=\"Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Power\"&gt;Spell Power&lt;/a&gt; and Scryers providing more &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;.\nCasters.\nThe Scryers appear superior in some ways. They provide a very good &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit\"&gt;spell hit&lt;/a&gt; trinket, shoulder enchants with stats more in favor of crits and an epic caster ring. In contrast, the Aldor provides a spell power staff that has &lt;a href=\"hit\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a robe that is most attractive to priests.\nRogues, Druids and Monks.\n is reward from &lt;a href=\"Turning%20Point\"&gt;Turning Point&lt;/a&gt;, the final quest of a long Scryer chain (and not available from the Aldor). With 23 agi, 21 stam, 20 hit rating and 48 attack power, it is significantly better than anything outside of heroic &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; for sword and mace Rogues. Take this into consideration, because the &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20Armor\"&gt;Assassination Armor&lt;/a&gt; set does not include a belt. However, Sword rogues should notice the , which is comparable to , but can only be bought at Exalted with Aldor for 200g.\nOther factors.\nAnother key factor to consider is your trade. If you are training enchanting or tailoring, you should probably choose Scryer, since you can access all enchanting training on the Scryer's tier, and also more easily purchase the BoE patterns.\n\"In the end, most of the rare and probably epic rewards from the two factions are likely to get replaced by other better raid loots or PvP rewards. Therefore, eventually most people will find that the only differences are the shoulder inscriptions and different proc for the Shattered Sun Pendants.\nArmory trends.\nData from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//okoloth.blogspot.com/\"&gt;Okoloth's blog&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "87924", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=87924", "title": "Comparison of druid healing spells", "text": "Druids have available to them a number of different healing spells, some very mana-efficient, others providing a healing boost when needed.\nMethodology.\nThese tables show untalented healing values. If the druid has the talents for each spell, the relative comparison between the spells will remain similar, and if one is specced and not the other, that will skew the data in the obvious way. To give a feel for the effects of talents some entries contain a second value in parentheses next to them, representing what that entry would be with full talents in restoration tree.\nWe will calculate health restored per mana (HPM) and provide heal per second (HPS) figures for comparison, to give a sense of the use of each of these spells in actual healing.\nLifebloom has two elements: a fast ticking HOT (per second rather than per 3 seconds) and a larger heal as it expires (the bloom). Stacking it (up to three times) increases the HOT, but not the bloom. Consequently, there are several possible strategies. We will evaluate two of them below. One is sequential casts without stacking, while the other involves stacking lifebloom three times, and refreshing the stack repeatedly before the \"bloom\". Since efficiency is mainly a concern in longer fights, all the calculations below assume a long fight, where the mana cost of setting up a stack of 3 lifeblooms becomes insignificant. It assumes the druid using this strategy refreshes lifebloom every 6 seconds.\nComparison.\nOur first table gives the figures for the spells assuming no +heal whatsoever. Time is cast time plus spell duration.\nSo for zero +heal, casting lifebloom every 7 seconds provides the highest heal per mana. The picture changes dramatically when we have +heal, though.\nAs can easily be seen, stacking lifebloom and keeping it stacked not only becomes highly mana-efficient: it's healing per second also rises considerably. In practise, druids will stack 3 lifeblooms and a rejuvenation on the target, providing around 500 HPS, and use regrowth for additional bursts of healing. This is made even more mana-efficient by tree of life form, which reduces the mana cost of all these spells by 20%."}

It is illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Gibbons\"&gt;Mark Gibbons&lt;/a&gt;. The story tells the origin of &lt;a href=\"tossaway\"&gt;tossaway&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; trinkets used to ward from a monster known as the &lt;a href=\"Uninvited%20Guest\"&gt;Uninvited Guest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nThe story opens with a of an old goblin woman at a market warning a group of children not to flaunt their wealth. She recites a familiar nursery rhyme: \"In dark of night and bright of day, / Keep in your hand a tossaway. / Guard your fortune, mind your greed, / Or else the Uninvited Guest will feed.\" The children heed the warning and each throw a tossaway behind them as they run off. It's noted that while every smart goblin carries a few tossaways with them, few know the true story of their origin. The story thus moves into the second, main narrative.\nYears earlier, &lt;a href=\"Klaxz%20Boompowder\"&gt;Klaxz Boompowder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, and his wife &lt;a href=\"Slixi%20Boompowder\"&gt;Slixi&lt;/a&gt; (implied to be the same person as the old woman) attend the funeral of Klaxz's rival, &lt;a href=\"Rikter%20Hogsnozzle\"&gt;Rikter Hogsnozzle&lt;/a&gt;. As is traditional, the funeral attendees place burial gifts in the coffin, and Klaxz impresses everyone by including a &lt;a href=\"Galleon%20%28coin%29\"&gt;galleon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a long-lost and now priceless type of coin\u2014among his gifts. Unbeknownst to to the others, the galleon he gifts is a fake since he does not want to part with the real deal. This display of unbridled greed attracts the attention of an invisible creature which later comes to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Uninvited%20Guest\"&gt;Uninvited Guest&lt;/a&gt;. It follows Klaxz home and starts feeding on his thoughts of greed, growing stronger in the process.\nKlaxz starts to act strange: he forgives debts, offers discounts, and soon begins giving away his and Slixi's valuables, claiming that they have more than they need. Slixi sends the &lt;a href=\"bruiser\"&gt;bruiser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bang\"&gt;Bang&lt;/a&gt; to uncover the source of the prince's madness and hides his stash of real galleons in the woods. Bang returns with nothing but vague tales of an invisible evil that sucks the souls of its victims and can only be seen under a full moon. Klaxz's affliction worsens, culminating in him giving away the last of his belongings and walking away, never to be seen by Slixi again. When she returns to their now empty house, she realizes that the Uninvited Guest is still there and flees into the moonlit woods to dig up the galleons, now the last thing she owns. She trips, drops the coins, and manages to escape from her pursuer after she catches a glimpse of the Uninvited stopping to count the galleons. She settles in a tiny cottage and invents tossaways: painted-gold coins identical to galleons. The tale of Klaxz's fate spreads and everyone who hears it rushes to the market to buy Slixi's new invention.\nThe story ends with a reminder to the reader that the Uninvited still roams &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in search of new victims, Klaxz still wanders around offering gifts to those he meets, and on quiet nights, some say that one can hear an old woman's voice reciting a familiar rhyme."}

This location has the disadvantages that there are fewer NPCs, only two supervisors, and you will still have to enter the mine to do the &lt;a href=\"Supervisor%20Fizsprocket%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Supervisor Fizsprocket (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; quest."}

Owned by &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt;, it acts as one of the main meeting points for citizens in the west of the city. The establishment itself contains an enclosed courtyard with several storerooms and other buildings forming a small compound. It can be found just off the main square of Starcaller Retreat.\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; services operated by &lt;a href=\"Dasdonia\"&gt;Dasdonia&lt;/a&gt;, food provisioning by &lt;a href=\"Joshen%20Lafave\"&gt;Joshen Lafave&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; run by &lt;a href=\"Maribeth\"&gt;Maribeth&lt;/a&gt;, were available in the Waning Crescent. \nLocated in one of the less socially-well-off areas of Suramar City, the Waning Crescent would go on to play a major role in the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a headquarters and important staging area for &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the resistance&lt;/a&gt;. This association, however, would ultimately lead to its destruction at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; later in the conflict. \nHistory.\nThe Waning Crescent is situated in the lower levels of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;'s west, where the majority of the nightborne lower and middle classes reside. \nWith the onset of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were allowed access to Suramar by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for an alliance that would spare the lives of the nightborne people. This decision, however, was fiercely opposed by many members of nightborne society, including the First Arcanist, &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. Thalyssra, after a failed coup attempt, would ultimately form the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen resistance&lt;/a&gt; in opposition to Elisande and her demonic pact, sparking the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn gathering allies for the new cause, the Nightfallen would approach individuals in Suramar City with known sympathy for the insurrection. One such individual proved to be &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt;, the proprietor of the Waning Crescent in &lt;a href=\"Starcaller%20Retreat\"&gt;Starcaller Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. Vanthir was shocked by the harsh policies being inflicted on Suramar's lower classes by Elisande in an attempt to keep them in line, which included the severe rationing of vital &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the Nightfallen, Vanthir transformed his tavern into a distribution center of arcwine to those who were being starved of it and &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;withering&lt;/a&gt; as a result.\nThough its main base remained in the ruin of &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; outside Suramar City, the Waning Crescent soon became the primary headquarters of the rebellion within the city itself, connected to Shal'Aran by a nearby telemancy beacon. From here, the Nightfallen began orchestrating many acts of sabotage and espionage throughout Suramar to strengthen the rebellion. The tavern also acted as a secure meeting spot for high-ranking members of the insurrection, for example serving as something of a campaign headquarters for the double-agent &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; in her bid to win election as advisor to the Grand Magistrix.\nThe Waning Crescent's prominent role in the ever-growing rebellion eventually drew the full attention of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her allies. To send a message, the Grand Magistrix ordered a large force of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; to massacre the population of &lt;a href=\"Starcaller%20Retreat\"&gt;Starcaller Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby &lt;a href=\"Siren%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Siren's Vigil&lt;/a&gt;. The Nightfallen were caught off-guard by the suddenness and brutality of the attack, and were not able to respond in time. The Waning Crescent, the surrounding district, and many &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; civilians, were wiped out.\nThe massacre at the Waning Crescent proved to be one of the most savage acts of the conflict. It did serve to help turn the tide of the civil war, though not in the way Elisande hoped. Instead, the spectacle drove yet more nightborne towards the rebellion; even many of the Grand Magistrix's previously-staunch supporters within the Duskwatch switched sides in horror.\nThe owner of the Waning Crescent, &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt;, survived the slaughter and was captured. As a prominent member of the insurrection, he was subsequently taken to the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Order\"&gt;Terrace of Order&lt;/a&gt; to be made an example of. Before this could occur, however, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; scryed his location and ordered a daring rescue attempt which succeeded in raiding the terrace, freeing Vanthir, and spiriting him to safety.\nThe Nightfallen rebels would also launch numerous attacks on the occupying demon and Duskwatch forces remaining in the district, with the goal of avenging the atrocities committed. Following the events surrounding the Waning Crescent's destruction, the Nightfallen relocated to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Terrace\"&gt;Evermoon Terrace&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Commons\"&gt;Evermoon Commons&lt;/a&gt; district.

The War is mainly fought in the caves of the &lt;a href=\"Magnetic%20Chasm\"&gt;Magnetic Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, below the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Eternium%20Sea\"&gt;Molten Eternium Sea&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"agent\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt;s of iR-T0 have also managed to secure a foothold on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to uncover cryptic messages describing the conflict through the &lt;a href=\"Decoded%20Message\"&gt;decoded messages&lt;/a&gt; obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Blingtron%205000%20Gift%20Package\"&gt;Blingtron 5000 Gift Package&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Encrypted%20Message\"&gt;encrypted messages&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Blingtron%207000%20Gift%20Package\"&gt;Blingtron 7000 Gift Package&lt;/a&gt;s. The Blingtrons seek to keep \"organic awareness\" of The War to a minimum, leading them to increase generosity circuits in all Blingtron units, an effort referred to as \"The Facade\". Despite these efforts, however, organic awareness of the conflict is growing too quickly.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known battle occurred when unidentified threats attacked Peacekeeper 011 units in deepest caves of the &lt;a href=\"Magnetic%20Chasm\"&gt;Magnetic Chasm&lt;/a&gt; below the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Eternium%20Sea\"&gt;Molten Eternium Sea&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the initiation of protocol 54. 121,172 robo-units were assembled and marched to face the unknown threat, while generosity circuits in all Blingtron units were increased in order to minimize organic awareness. The true extent of The War is unknown, but allied destruction total has increased to 64%, and the Blingtrons have requested supplies. A massive shipment of &lt;a href=\"alarm-o-bot\"&gt;alarm-o-bot&lt;/a&gt;s was received, disassembled, and reconstructed as frag grenades.\nAccording to the former Blingtron leader &lt;a href=\"%280x0001%29\"&gt;(0x0001)&lt;/a&gt;, a virus identified as \"a clockwork assembly system hack\" has begun infecting Blingtron units. Because it appears to be beneficial in many ways, the robot will accept it readily, until it begins to corrupt their AI by overloading generosity circuits. There is no known way to nullify the effect without destroying the host, and with \"above-ground units\" possibly infected, the solution by the Blingtrons is to destroy infected units without hesitation.\nA single &lt;a href=\"De-Weaponized%20Mechanical%20Companion\"&gt;de-weaponized companion unit&lt;/a&gt; was fitted with a &lt;a href=\"Stealthman%2054\"&gt;Stealthman 54&lt;/a&gt;z, enabling it to appear harmless and bypass the enemy's significant security systems. It identified the enemy's leader with a 73.4% accuracy, reporting that the enemy called itself &lt;a href=\"iR-T0\"&gt;iR-T0&lt;/a&gt; and was \"monstrous in size\", though no other information was obtained.\nThe Blingtrons have found that organic awareness of the War is growing too quickly, and they seeded plans for a next-gen Blingtron remote to call on veteran units that can assess and destroy. Gift supply is decreasing to inadequate levels, and use of war surplus has been authorized.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, (0x0001) has been captured by hostile &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; and is presumed infected. As a result, &lt;a href=\"%280x0002%29\"&gt;(0x0002)&lt;/a&gt; has assumed command. To minimize the risk of message interception, all further communiques will be triple encrypted. Meanwhile, agents of iR-T0 have secured a foothold on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and orders have been given to distribute updated Blingtron unit schematics in order to minimize organic awareness. Blingtron units who fail to maintain The Facade will be immediately decommissioned.\nAt one point, unidentified threats attacked Peacekeeper 014 units at , and orders were given to once again initiate protocol 54. This was followed by a similar attack at , leading to protocol 54 being terminated in favor of protocol 87."}

The fish went sailing over his head, scales glittering in the afternoon sun, and landed neatly on the huge piscine pile behind him. Whistling through his beard, the dwarf ambled over to his catch, removed the hook, and tied the net around the lot. With calloused, experienced hands, he broke down his pole and line, placing it back in his pack with care. Saegan then swung the full net over his shoulder and limped his way down the dock.\nThe Menethil gryphon master frowned dubiously at the load on his back as he approached. The gryphons themselves, however, perked up at the smell of fresh fish so close. Saegan smiled and winked. \"I'll give a tip to th' gryphon that flies me back home to Ironforge an' keeps this cargo safe.\" Within minutes he was in the saddle, soaring above the mountains, with a content gryphon clutching the net in its claws.\nThe fisherman looked down upon Dun Morogh as it came into view. Armies were practicing and mobilizing. Adventurers and scouts left the city via gryphon or mount, riding hard to get to their destination. All around, the tension of impending war grew in the air. As Saegan's gryphon flew through the gate of Ironforge and into the city, the usual bustling sound assaulted his ears, but with an edge. The clangs from the forge were nearly overpowering. The sharp orders of military groups moving out were unmistakable. Ironforge was the center of the Alliance world as it prepared for war.\nHe dismounted as soon as he landed and gave the fleet gryphon one last fish from his haul. \"No more now,\" he chuckled as the greedy creature clacked its beak toward his net, \"this is for th' war.\" Hefting the load once more, Saegan limped around the Great Forge toward the Bronze Kettle. As he did, he glanced over to the anvil with his good eye. Smiths of all races and creeds toiled over their creations, working as fast as they dared to supply the war effort. He shook his grizzled head as he entered his destination.\nDaryl looked up and grinned as Saegan threw the pile of fish on the table. \"Some haul,\" he remarked. \"Throwin' a party?\"\n\"You know I'm not,\" Saegan replied. \"Help me clean and gut this lot. I would have done it there, but Menethil's just a hop over the mountains, and besides, I needed a bit of company.\" He took out a knife and grabbed one of the fish, starting on the business.\nFor hours, as they prepared and cooked the fish, they spoke about the latest developments. The silithid threat was growing greater with each passing day. Strong adventurers sought the answer to the riddle surrounding the Scarab Gate. The young and the crippled, however, were not idle in the war effort. Supplies were needed on the front lines in Kalimdor: food, metals, herbs, all manner of materials. Orders came in every day, calling for more to be sent across the ocean. Saegan wasn't young, not by any stretch of the imagination; his leg had been badly broken in a skirmish with Tauren some years ago, and he could no longer keep up with the younger, stronger fighters. With reluctance, he'd retired his sword and began fishing in order to supply the fighters with food every night. It wasn't precisely a glorious job, but a necessary one.\nAt last the rations were made and packed. Daryl helped Saegan wrap and pack them in a crate. \"Sure you don't need any help, there, lad?\" Daryl asked as the fisherman limped out the door.\n\"Nah,\" Saegan called over his shoulder. \"I have to do somethin' to help against those damned bugs; this much, at least, I can do on my own.\" Hefting the fragrant crate, the dwarf slowly made his way to the Military Ward; Huntress Swiftriver would have plenty of food to provide for the soldiers today."}

With the help of humanity, the high elves ultimately prevailed against the trolls.\nFurther Conflict.\nUnfortunately this would not be the last time that war would come to the high elves. During the Second War, the Horde burned down the borderlands of Quel'Thalas. The rampaging orcs killed Alleria's parents, but she and her two younger sisters, Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, survived.\nDriven by grief and hatred, Alleria vowed that she would have vengeance. Her pursuit of revenge took her into human lands, where she led an elite cadre of rangers in hunting down renegade orcs of the Bleeding Hollow clan, who had been trapped on &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; after the end of the Second War.\nThe Alliance of Lordaeron had destroyed the Azeroth end of the Dark Portal in order to cut off further orc reinforcements from Draenor. However, the orc Ner'zhul and other Horde spellcasters used magical artifacts on the Draenor end of the Dark Portal, which was still intact. In this manner the powerful warlocks reestablished the pathway between Draenor and Azeroth.\nA Hero's End.\nThe Alliance reacted quickly to the renewed threat and sent an expedition through the portal to Draenor. Having achieved the rank of captain, Alleria was part of the expedition, which succeeded in its perilous mission and destroyed the Draenor end of the Dark Portal. Horde forces on Azeroth were cut off from reinforcements and soundly defeated, and afterwards the Azeroth end of the Dark Portal was destroyed.\nAlleria and the other members of the Alliance expedition shattered the Dark Portal on Draenor just as Ner'zhul opened a series of additional portals from Draenor to other worlds. Already weakened by the orcs' abuse of fel magic, Draenor began tearing apart under the stress of supporting the newly created portals.\nAs the planet shuddered beneath their feet, the members of the valiant Alliance expedition realized that remaining on Draenor would be suicide. Thus, they chose one of the new portals and entered it. They have not been seen since that fateful day.\nGiven the low likelihood of their survival, Alleria and her comrades are presumed dead, killed in the line of duty. They are honored to this day for their sacrifice. A statue of Alleria has a prominent place in the Valley of Heroes, just inside the gates of Stormwind City.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Greatly outnumbered, the elves were losing ground, and the outlook worsened every day as their casualties climbed. Even their most powerful magics were of little use.\nStrange Alliance.\nAnasterian hit upon a radical idea. His scouts had reported that a human nation named Arathor had recently formed to the south. One tribe had risen to dominance through the simple expedient of offering amnesty to the people it defeated. That such a strategy was new among humans was a testament not only to the youth of their race, but also to their willingness to gain strength via clear-sighted pragmatism.\nAlthough the humans had no spellcasters, Arathor had a sizeable population. Anasterian was certain there had to be humans with magical talent. They merely needed training in order to be useful in combat. He therefore dispatched ambassadors to the southlands with all speed.\nKing Thoradin of Arathor greeted the ambassadors with surprise and wary courtesy. He had been hearing rumors of the high elves' plight for months, but he had not suspected that the trolls posed a truly significant threat. The weary elves warned the king that the troll armies were vast. Should Quel'Thalas fall, the trolls would certainly besiege Arathor next.\nThe king was distrustful of magic, but he could not deny that the elves had a point. Further negotiations ensued until at last Anasterian and Thoradin had reached an agreement. Almost immediately, elven sorcerers arrived in Arathor and began to instruct a group of humans in the ways of magic. One hundred men were taught the very basics of the elves' magical secrets: no more than was absolutely necessary to combat the trolls.\nIn addition to these new spellcasters, Thoradin sent his armies to the battlefront. Together, the humans and high elves ultimately achieved victory over the trolls, who would never fully recover from their defeat. Assured that Quel'Thalas was saved from destruction, the elves made a pledge of loyalty and friendship to the nation of Arathor and to the bloodline of King Thoradin. Humans and elves would coexist in peace for over two thousand years.\nConflict in the Borderlands.\nWhen the Horde attacked humanity in the Second War, the high elves had little interest in the conflict, but they felt duty-bound to lend the Alliance of Lordaeron their support. In particular, the commander of the Alliance forces was Lord Anduin Lothar, who was the last descendent of the Arathi bloodline. Lothar's family had aided the high elves in fighting the Troll Wars, and so King Anasterian reluctantly agreed to provide a small number of soldiers and spellcasters who would fight alongside the Alliance.\nThe king and his people would soon see the conflict in a more personal light. Horde forces worked their way north, burned down the borderlands of Quel'Thalas, and slaughtered many high elves. Horrified at the Horde's wanton destruction of life, the high elves officially joined the Alliance and committed all their resources to the war. Ultimately the orcs were defeated, and most of them were rounded up and put into internment camps.\nDownward Spiral.\nIn the aftermath of the war, the high elves began to doubt the value of the Alliance. Humanity seemed to need the high elves, but had little to offer in return, especially now that a large portion of Alliance resources was allotted toward maintaining the internment camps.\nAt last Anasterian rescinded the high elves' allegiance to the Alliance. He stated that the humans' poor leadership had been directly responsible for the burned forests in the borderlands of Quel'Thalas. King Terenas Menethil argued that nothing of Quel'Thalas would have survived if not for the hundreds of valiant humans who gave their lives to defend it. Despite his attempts at reestablishing diplomatic relations, however, the elves opted to remain independent of the crumbling Alliance. Their departure triggered the additional secession of the Gilneas and Stromgarde nations.\nAnasterian was still in power years later when the death knight Arthas Menethil led Scourge forces into Quel'Thalas and defiled the Sunwell. The king and most of his people were slain in battle by the undead. His son, Prince &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, was in Dalaran at the time of the invasion, and so Kael'thas is the last surviving member of the royal family.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is the only world in all of existence to have successfully resisted an invasion from the Burning Legion and has, against all odds, done so twice.\nPopulation.\nMany races have originated upon Azeroth, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, dwarves, gnomes, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/High%20Elves\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, humans, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, tauren, and trolls. It also has a substantial orc population, though the orc race originated on the planet Draenor.\nAlthough they cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered a single race, there are many undead creatures on Azeroth. In recent years their numbers have been increasing at an alarming rate.\nGeography.\nAzeroth can be broken down into several major areas, including the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, and the South Seas.\nIntegrally connected to Azeroth and yet distinct from it, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; is the underlying blueprint of the planet as it was originally designed by the titans. The Dream is a lush and primal forest: the world that Azeroth might have become, had it developed without interference from the sentient races (e.g., technological advances, urbanization, and wars).\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/327.xml."}

Thus, golden eyes were commonly regarded as a sign of future greatness. Indeed, Azshara became the most beloved monarch in all of night elf history. She was also the last. Her reign led to the War of the Ancients and the Sundering, after which night elf society underwent sweeping change.\nIn Search of Ultimate Power.\nStrong-willed, manipulative, and incomparably beautiful, Azshara possessed far more magical talent than almost any other night elf. As one of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and sole heir to the throne, she had long been fascinated with the Well of Eternity. After her coronation, she indulged her interests to the fullest. Soon she ordered the construction of a lavishly bejeweled palace on one of the Well's shores.\nSeeking to please the queen, the nobles proposed that the night elf capital city be renamed in her honor. Azshara graciously accepted, and after much heated debate, the city's name was changed to Zin-Azshari, or \"glory of Azshara\". Night elves everywhere celebrated the city's new name, for they loved their queen as much as they distrusted the decadent Highborne. Such was her charm that her people did not truly consider her one of the Highborne.\nAzshara and her court took up residence in the new palace as soon as it was complete. Many of the Highborne living in the palace devoted themselves to constant study of the Well. As their obsession grew, these Highborne drew magic from the Well's depths at reckless speed and channeled the chaotic energies into ever-greater spells. The Well was thrown into constant turmoil. Dark storms broke out over its surface, and its waters darkened until they became utterly black.\nDreams of Glory.\nSargeras, creator of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, sensed the Highborne's powerful spells and reached out to contact them from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. With little effort he corrupted all of the Highborne in the palace, including Azshara, and bent them to his will. Quickly they abandoned all their previous work and focused on bringing the Legion into &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The mesmerized nobles' primary goal, however, was to widen and stabilize the portal leading from the Twisting Nether to Azeroth, so that Sargeras himself could enter the world. He promised that he would remake the world into a paradise.\nWorking feverishly, the Highborne summoned &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; after demon into their midst. As the storms surrounding the Well grew more violent, a crowd of frightened night elves gathered outside the palace, hoping for an explanation from their queen. When the palace gates opened at last, however, a demonic army poured out and began slaughtering the citizens of Zin-Azshari. Only the Highborne who were serving the Legion inside the palace were left untouched. Firmly in Sargeras' thrall, the palace guards watched the massacre and made no effort to help their dying people.\nThe queen believed that in Sargeras she had at last found a worthy mate, and she was certain that he would be hers once he arrived on Azeroth. As time passed, she grew impatient and suggested restricting the Well of Eternity so that its energies would be available only to the Legion and their Highborne servants. Her chief advisor, Lord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, worked with the rest of the palace Highborne and the Legion to implement her idea, erecting a magical shield around the Well.\nThwarted Plans.\nSuddenly cut off from the Well, the night elf defenders realized that something catastrophic had happened. Refugees from Zin-Azshari brought news of the demonic invasion to Black Rook Hold, home of Lord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;. Kur'talos added the refugees who could fight to his own soldiers, and the army set out for Zin-Azshari. The War of the Ancients had broken out in earnest.\nWith the help of several allies, the druid &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the shield and killed Xavius. Azshara made Captain Varo'then her new advisor and her chief liaison with the Legion. By this time the Legion was divided: many of its demonic minions were out on the battlefield instead of helping to stabilize the portal into the Twisting Nether. The queen blamed Kur'talos' strong leadership of the night elf defenders for delaying Sargeras' arrival. She ordered Varo'then to eliminate Kur'talos, and Varo'then obediently had the valiant noble assassinated.\nBirth of the Naga.\nDespite Azshara's attempts to aid the Legion, the portal to the Twisting Nether was ultimately closed before Sargeras could reach Azeroth. Although the portal's closure saved Azeroth from demonic invasion, the Well of Eternity was unable to withstand the added magical strain, and it began to collapse in on itself. As if struck by a giant hammer, Zin-Azshari and the Well were blasted downward toward the ocean floor. The Well pierced the planet's molten core just before being utterly obliterated.\nAncient Kalimdor was split apart, and the seas rushed into to fill the voids between the new landmasses. The queen, her handmaidens, her guards, and quite a few other Highborne in the palace were caught in the rushing waters. Instead of drowning, however, many were cursed and transformed into &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nWas Azshara, too, transformed? Is there any way she could still be alive after more than ten thousand years? Such questions are almost never asked today. Few outside the naga know the tale of Azshara, and those who do recall it presume her long dead. Regardless, the naga have come to worship Azshara as a &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Later, during the Third War, the Alliance extended membership to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who saw it as their duty to warn their new allies against the high elves. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s part in bringing about the War of the Ancients figured heavily in the night elves' retelling of elven history. It should come as no surprise that humans came to regard the high elves (and, by association, the blood elves) with resentment and suspicion.\nLed by Arthas Menethil, the Scourge recently invaded the kingdom of Quel'Thalas and created the lich Kel'Thuzad, defiling the Sunwell and using the last of its power in the process. Most of the high elf race was slaughtered by the undead. Sylvanas Windrunner's second-in-command, Lor'themar Theron, assumed temporary leadership of the high elves. The few high elves who survived the Scourge's invasion quickly grew ill and apathetic.\nPrince &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; was the last of the royal bloodline and a member of the Kirin Tor. He had been pursuing magical studies in Dalaran at the time of the Scourge invasion. When he heard of the disaster, he hastened to Quel'Thalas and found his homeland in ruins. He realized that the elven survivors were all experiencing the same sickness and lethargy, which had begun when the Sunwell's magics were drained. Determined to salvage what he could, Kael'thas rallied all the survivors he could find and renamed them the sin'dorei, or \"children of the blood\", in honor of those who had fallen to the Scourge.\nJourney to Outland.\nThirsting for vengeance despite their weakened state, the healthiest blood elves, including Kael'thas, departed their ravaged land and joined the campaign against the Scourge in Lordaeron. In the prince's absence, Lor'themar was named regent of Quel'Thalas, and Halduron Brightwing became the new ranger-general of Silvermoon. To this day, Lor'themar continues to serve as the leader of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood elves. He and Halduron safeguard the land while they seek a cure for their people's seemingly insatiable hunger.\nWhen Kael'thas and his suffering people volunteered to fight the Scourge alongside Alliance resistance forces, the blood elves were met with suspicion and outright hostility, particularly from the prejudiced human Grand Marshal Garithos. Garithos assigned the blood elves increasingly difficult missions until Kael'thas was forced to accept the assistance of Lady &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. When Garithos discovered that the blood elves were working with the naga, he felt that his distrust had been vindicated. He imprisoned the hapless blood elf soldiers in the dungeons of Dalaran and sentenced them to death.\nFortunately Vashj arrived in time to free the blood elves, who were suffering terribly from their hunger for magic by this time. Vashj explained that the naga, too, were addicted to magic, and she said that &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; could help the blood elves. She then led them to the portal that Kel'Thuzad had opened during the Third War (so as to give Archimonde entry into Azeroth). With no other palatable choices, Kael'thas and his fighters followed the naga through the portal and into the shattered realm of Outland. There, the elves freed the renegade &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; Illidan Stormrage, who had been taken prisoner by Warden &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the rescue, Kael'thas beseeched Illidan for a cure to the blood elves' addiction to magic. Illidan had a different proposal in mind, though: in return for the blood elves' loyalty, he would teach them to drain magic from powerful alternative sources, including demons. It was an offer Kael'thas felt he had to accept. He was certain his people would die without either a cure or a new source of magic. Kael'thas pledged his allegiance to Illidan, who taught several blood elves the techniques he had offered. These teachings spread to the other blood elves in Outland, who were then able to stave off their painful hunger for arcane magic.\nReconstruction.\nHeartened by their swift recovery, most of Kael'thas' group chose to stay in Outland and further their studies, but Grand Magister Rommath was sent back to Azeroth, bearing a message of hope for the blood elves still in Quel'Thalas. He relayed tales of a glorious promised land, spread the teachings of Illidan--teachings that Rommath smoothly attributed to Prince Kael'thas--and planted the notion that Kael'thas might one day return to lead his people to paradise.\nRommath remained in Quel'Thalas to help rebuild and await the prince's return. Thanks to Rommath, the blood elves on Azeroth learned how to drain arcane magic and feed their addiction. As they returned to health, they praised their absent prince and dedicated themselves to learning more. Rommath and the new order of elven magi made great progress in tutoring their brethren to manipulate arcane energies. Soon the spires of Silvermoon City rose skyward once again, powered by volatile magics. The blood elves have even begun retaking portions of Eversong Woods. Emboldened by the promise of Kael'thas' return, the prince's weary people now focus on regaining their strength and forging a new path into an uncertain future.\nThe Consequences of Addiction.\nBlood elves no longer truly consider themselves high elves, and they tend to have different priorities and behaviors than their high elf kindred. Unlike high elves, blood elves have decided that in the absence of the Sunwell, they will feed their hunger for arcane magic by draining that magic from alternative sources.\nHowever, some basic similarities remain between blood elves and high elves, for both groups belong to the same race. As with high elves, most blood elves are not spellcasters. Blood elves do not drain magic in order to engage in spellcasting, but simply to feed their addiction to arcane magic. Gaining this magic on a reasonably regular basis has not given &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; to the blood elves, who are just as prone to illness, injury, and age as their high elf brethren. To date, there have been no observations of a significant difference between blood elf and high elf lifespans.\nOn several occasions after the Sunwell's defilement, Kael'thas publicly asserted that his people would die unless they found a new source of magic. There can be no doubt that withdrawal from prolonged exposure to arcane magic is a very unpleasant process: to this day it is not impossible that a high elf might choose to give in to the addiction and become one of the blood elves. Technically, though, the prince was mistaken. According to the top priests and medics on Azeroth, the only high elves who perished due to the Sunwell's loss were the very old, the very young, and elves who were already in poor health.\nThis is not to say, however, that withdrawal from magic would leave the blood elves unharmed. On the contrary, permanent mental or physical damage is possible.\nEven so, the prince's relatively quick acceptance of dire measures (e.g., draining magic from demons) is by no means characteristic of blood elves in general. The blood elves of Outland have by now discovered Kael'thas' agreement with Illidan, and they have for the most part become convinced of its necessity. Most blood elves still live on Azeroth, though. Few of these elves know of Kael'thas' pact with Illidan, and many would be horrified if they discovered it. Draining magic from small mana-bearing vermin is a far cry from draining magic from demons. Yet, as their hunger grows, blood elves--particularly those in Outland--are becoming increasingly inured to the things they must do in order to obtain more magic.\nBlood Elves and the Horde.\nApproximately 85% of the blood elves still dwell on Azeroth rather than Outland. Most of Azeroth's blood elves live in Quel'Thalas. For example, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, a small but elite group of blood elf rangers, are fighting to drive the remaining Scourge out of Quel'Thalas.\nIn general, blood elves have negative impressions about much of the Horde. The blood elves' animosity toward trolls, for instance, has been well documented since the founding of Quel'Thalas, and that animosity was cemented by the Troll Wars. Nor do the blood elves have a fondness for orcs, who wrought widespread destruction and burned the borderlands of Quel'Thalas during the Second War. The elves have no particular quarrel with the tauren, but tend to think of them as bestial brutes.\nYet the blood elves remaining on Azeroth are developing a relationship with the Forsaken due to Queen Sylvanas Windrunner, who was ranger-general of Silvermoon until Arthas converted her into undeath against her will. The queen claims that she still considers herself one of the foremost protectors of Quel'Thalas. She has repeatedly offered assistance in the form of supplies and troops.\nThus far, the blood elves seem to fear a trick, or perhaps they are simply having difficulty overcoming their dislike for the rest of the Horde. Whatever the case, blood elves have declined most of Sylvanas' offers, particularly those that would involve stationing Forsaken soldiers in blood elf lands. Yet the beleaguered elves are well aware that they are massively outnumbered by the Scourge, and no one else seems willing to fight for what remains of Quel'Thalas.\nCertainly the Alliance has shown no interest in helping the Azerothian blood elves either reach Outland or drive the Scourge out of Quel'Thalas. Already suspicious of the few scattered high elves who still exist, the Alliance considers the blood elves even less trustworthy. Night elves are particularly hostile toward blood elves: to night elves, the sin'dorei stink of desperation and arcane magic.\nGiven the blood elves' precarious position on Azeroth, it seems increasingly likely that they will form an alliance of convenience with the Horde.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Entire races have joined the Legion for the sake of that compelling promise. Yet not all members of the Legion are sentient. Some are merely beasts unfortunate enough to have caught Sargeras' attention. Although most members of the Legion are &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, there are exceptions, as is evidenced by infernals.\nWhatever the case, willing or not, a creature is transformed into a demon when its body is saturated with fel energy. Not all demons are part of the Legion, as &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; can attest, but Sargeras has created countless demons over the millennia so as to bolster the ranks of his destructive Legion.\nHistory and Organization.\nOnce a noble warrior for order and peace, Sargeras came to believe that there was a fundamental flaw in the universe, a flaw that made his primary purpose an impossible goal. He decided that the other titans were deeply misguided in trying to establish order throughout creation. Under the circumstances, the struggle was futile. The universe had to be destroyed utterly and remade without the underlying defect. Only then could true order be achieved. Thus, Sargeras conceived of a sweeping campaign to bring about the end of all things: the Burning Crusade.\nTo carry out his plan, he created the Legion, whose ranks he bolstered by creating demons: immortal creatures whose hunger, power, and malice made them perfect killing machines. As a result, the Legion has grown immense and consumed countless worlds. To date, the only planet that has managed to thwart the Legion's power is &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a fact which enraged Sargeras and made him all the more determined to bring Azeroth to its knees.\nThe eredar were the first sentient race to pledge their allegiance to Sargeras, and they remain its primary commanders to this day. Knowing that other sentient beings would inevitably join the Legion, the eredar declared that their primary language, Eredun, would be the Legion's common language.\nSargeras was the Burning Legion's creator and its original leader. However, there have been no reported sightings of the titan since the death of the human wizard Medivh, who was possessed by Sargeras' spirit at the time. In Sargeras' absence, the demon lord Kil'jaeden assumed leadership of the Legion.\nA number of demons on Azeroth have survived the Legion's defeat at the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Gathering in small groups throughout Azeroth, they are obviously in communication with one another, for they occasionally act in a coordinated manner. Certain demons are spreading corruption or guarding sites of power; others are assembling in specific locations to further some unknown design.\nThe Legion's most notable activity since the Third War has taken place in the Blasted Lands. Demons under the command of Lord Kazzak have rebuilt the Azeroth end of the Dark Portal on the site that first housed it. Thus far, the demons have only reconstructed the physical structure of the portal; they have not been able to reactivate it.\nBeliefs and Practices.\nAll demons once feared Sargeras' vast might and fury. However, most demons in the Legion served him simply because they enjoy doing so. The highest-ranking and most intelligent demons knew their creator's ultimate purpose. Even today such demons do not fear the cataclysm they work toward, for they have been promised that they will rule the newborn universe to come.\nIn the past, the Legion particularly targeted worlds that had been visited by the titans. Ultimately, though, no world is safe: the Legion works to devour or destroy all life and magic. The Legion will inevitably achieve its terrible goals unless it is vanquished. Such a victory would require an army of comparable size and might. An army fighting for the Light, for hope and peace, for the very fabric of creation...\nAn army that does not exist.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Tightly bound to the plant and animal kingdoms, they are natural shapeshifters, and so they know firsthand the abuse that is sometimes visited upon their wild brethren. In consequence, druids tend to be wary and reclusive; few outsiders have learned anything of their ways. Few druids have risen to prominence in the public eye. Indeed, druids usually settle in locations far from \"civilized\" lands and further their goals in subtle ways.\nUntil the end of the Third War, all druids in the Cenarion Circle were men, and almost all were &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Women druids and druids from other races are not necessarily a recent development, but until the war, such druids were relatively rare and often had no affiliation with the Cenarion Circle.\nDue to the war's heavy casualties, though, the Cenarion Circle has set aside its historical strictures on membership. Thus, most druids today remain night elf men, but the druids have also welcomed women into their ranks. In addition, other races--most notably the tauren--have been permitted to join the Cenarion Circle. Even druids who might otherwise be at war with one another will set aside their disputes in order to work together for the betterment of nature.\nBy definition all druids are currently considered part of the Cenarion Circle. Furthermore, despite the druids' caution toward outsiders, they may permit certain individuals who lack druidic ability to join the Cenarion Circle. Such applicants must prove themselves to the Cenarion Circle, however, and a druid's trust is not easily gained.\nHistory and Organization.\nThe first mortal druid on Azeroth was &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who was trained in the druidic arts by the forest &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. After the Great Sundering, further night elves chose to follow in Malfurion's footsteps, and he gladly taught them what he knew. They made this choice out of reverence for nature and a desire to learn. Impressed by Malfurion's knowledge and conduct, the green Dragon Aspect, Ysera, saw the worth and potential of races other than dragons. She invited the druids to visit her realm, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalfurion's exceptional abilities and intuitive grasp of druidic magic made him the unquestioned leader of the Cenarion Circle. However, Malfurion has recently fallen into a mysterious coma, and so the leadership has fallen to Fandral Staghelm. Malfurion, Fandral, and Hamuul Runetotem all carry the rank of archdruid.\nTo some extent druidism was spread by the night elves, but other races have also made spontaneous discoveries of various druidic tenets. Unfortunately for historians and scholars, further specifics about the dissemination of druidism have not yet been discovered. Druids have little interest in discussing the details of their history with outsiders. Attempts to infiltrate the druids and acquire such knowledge have been met with complete failure: it would seem that deception is of little use against druids.\nWhat is known is that the Cenarion Circle is a small organization that answers only to itself. Although they are highly respected by most mortal societies, druids have nothing to do with creating or enforcing law. The Cenarion Circle has more far-reaching concerns than the politics of any particular government.\nThere are two specialized subgroups within the Cenarion Circle: the Druids of the Claw and the Druids of the Talon. Recently a third subgroup has been reported in the Wailing Caverns: these Druids of the Fang are, however, corrupt and insane. The existence of a fourth subgroup, rumored to be called the Druids of the Antler, has never been confirmed.\nBeliefs and Practices.\nA druid's primary care is to protect and preserve the world. Druids have a deep understanding of how all living things interact with and rely upon one another. By promoting a greater awareness of this interdependency, druids hope to convince others to lead lives that are more in harmony with the natural environment.\nTrained to see truths beyond the physical reality, all druids once spent part of their time monitoring the Emerald Dream, where they restored and protected the planet's health, and eliminated sources of illness, corruption, or exploitation. Many druids have hibernated occasionally so that they can better embrace the Emerald Dream and learn more about the environment. A druid never stops learning: even the smallest blade of grass has many lessons to teach.\nUnfortunately Nordrassil has been in poor health since the Third War, which culminated in the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Although the pact between the green dragonflight and the druids is still in place, Nordrassil's poor health has made reaching the Dream a much more difficult prospect than it was. Even so, there may be many druids visiting the Dream, particularly those with great skill and wisdom.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

The tauren have a myth that purportedly relates the story of Cenarius' conception.\nWhen Cenarius' birth sent a ripple through the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera took an immediate interest in him. Guiding him into the Dream, she taught him much of its secrets and became a foster mother of sorts to him. In fact, the affectionate understanding that she and Cenarius shared has led many of Azeroth's elder races to mistake the pair for mother and son.\nCenarius grew to love the lush forests of Ysera's verdant realm. He could often be found treading its infinite dreamways, either watching over Azeroth and its creatures, or simply hoping for all that they might yet become.\nThe Night Elves.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; first developed around the Well of Eternity, their curiosity led them to meet and befriend a number of powerful entities, including Cenarius. The demigod became fond of the night elves, and he spent a great deal of time teaching them about the natural world. Under his guidance, the night elves developed a strong empathy for the living forests of ancient Kalimdor and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature.\nOver time, however, the night elves were increasingly drawn to the cosmic energies of the Well. Furthermore, the rapid growth of the night elf civilization led inevitably to the creation of new buildings and roads. Large tracts of forest vanished. Tranquil woodlands turned into sprawling cities, and great trees were warped and twisted into shapes that would better serve as night elf dwellings. The night elves were losing touch with nature.\nThe number of night elves pursuing their studies with the demigod dwindled, and Cenarius was grieved to realize that all his work had been for naught. Reluctantly he departed night elf lands. He resolved that he would respect their choice, however much he disagreed with it. From that point forward, Cenarius retreated into the wilds of the world and avoided most sentient races until they came to doubt his very existence.\nThe First Druid.\nMillennia before the night elves' interest in arcane magic led to the Great Sundering, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; came across several legends that referenced the mysterious Cenarius. Malfurion had always had great reverence for the natural world, although the night elves as a race had long since abandoned any interest in such matters. He shared these legends with his twin, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and their mutual friend, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. The three night elves decided that it would be an exciting adventure to search for Cenarius, though in truth they no more believed in the demigod than the rest of their people did.\nIt wasn't long before scattered plants and animals of Azeroth brought tidings of these three night elves to Cenarius. Surprised and intrigued, Cenarius located the night elves and looked into their hearts. He saw great promise in Malfurion, a promise that made up Cenarius' mind.\nThe laughing trio was shocked into silence when Cenarius stepped out of a shadowed thicket. He introduced himself and offered to teach them the druidic arts. They accepted eagerly. Malfurion proved a quick and talented student, but his brother was clumsy and quickly grew impatient. For her part, Tyrande was already a novice in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and so had dedicated herself to the goddess above all others. Cenarius knew that Malfurion alone would go on to become a &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion of the Burning Legion.\nMalfurion made significant progress in his studies before he was assailed by a disturbing vision. He watched helplessly as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; inside the palace abused the Well of Eternity's magics. The vision gave him the strong conviction that Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her high-ranking spellcasters would cause a catastrophe unless someone intervened. Malfurion brought his concerns to Cenarius, who was greatly worried.\nEven so, the night elves realized what was happening too late. &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt; poured out of the royal palace and began to slaughter everything in their path. The War of the Ancients had begun.\nAs the crisis unfolded, Cenarius taught Malfurion all he could and then sought out the other demigods of Azeroth. They were unaccustomed to the idea of working together; as a result, it took no little persuasion from Cenarius before they finally agreed on a course of action. They rode to the battlefront and found that the war was well underway.\nQuickly Cenarius assessed the situation and then led the other demigods to the leader of the night elf army, Captain &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. The astonished captain readily accepted the demigods' offer of assistance, and the tide of battle seemed to shift.\nLoss.\nReacting to the new and powerful threat, the vast demonic army refocused its attacks on the demigods, who were soon overwhelmed. Cenarius was badly wounded and completely surrounded by the time Malorne charged up and drove back his son's attackers with a few sweeps of his massive antlers.\nThe night elves scrambled into action, pulling the unconscious Cenarius to safety. Malorne easily held the demons off for a time. Then Archimonde came forth and engaged the giant stag in single combat, ultimately snapping Malorne's neck. Malfurion was furious and grieved; he called roots out of the ground to attack the demon lord. As the plants tightened their stranglehold on the demon's massive form, Archimonde was forced to teleport away in order to escape.\nYsera was sad to learn of Malorne's death, and her dragonflight carefully helped Cenarius enter the Emerald Dream, where the green dragons ministered to his injuries. Despite his sorrow and the lingering effects of his wounds, Cenarius emerged from the Dream not long after the Great Sundering, for he could feel the land cry out for healing.\nTo his horror, he discovered that Illidan Stormrage had created a second Well of Eternity. Jarod Shadowsong left Illidan's punishment to Malfurion, who felt it would be the height of folly to leave Illidan free to continue his reckless pursuit of power. Thus, with Cenarius' help, Malfurion sealed Illidan within a vast underground barrow prison, there to remain chained and powerless until the end of time.\nSeclusion of the Night Elves.\nTyrande Whisperwind, now high priestess of Elune, implemented sweeping changes throughout night elf society. She organized a new all-female army, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, and decreed that it would be directed by the Sisterhood of Elune. Nobility and sorcery were now considered the relics of a decadent and shameful past.\nNevertheless, a group of Highborne under &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; refused to give up practicing arcane magic. After discussing the matter at length, Tyrande and Malfurion made the difficult decision to exile their defiant kin. In the wake of the group's departure, the remaining night elves deliberately withdrew from the rest of the world. A veil of mist descended upon their entire continent, shrouding its presence from passing sailors.\nMeanwhile, Cenarius remained nearby in the Moonglade of Mount Hyjal. His male offspring, the keepers of the grove, kept close watch on the night elves and regularly helped the Sentinels maintain peace in the land. Even Cenarius' shy female descendants, the dryads, appeared in the open with increasing frequency.\nNew Races Arrive in Kalimdor.\nTime passed, and a new race arrived on Azeroth: the orcs, who originated on the planet Draenor. Under the influence of demons, the orcs had changed from a peaceful shamanic society into the bloodthirsty Horde. They waged war upon the humans of the Eastern Kingdoms and killed countless other creatures during the First and Second Wars. Cenarius and the night elves did not emerge from their seclusion to intervene, for they knew nothing of any events that occurred outside Kalimdor.\nThe Second War ended badly for the orcs, and the Horde was shattered. Just before the Third War, a new orc warchief emerged: Thrall, who reformed the Horde and led his people across the sea to establish their own homeland on Kalimdor. This new Horde had no desire for further warfare. The orcs simply wanted to leave the human lands behind and find a place to call their own.\nA Demigod Slain.\nThe orcs did not receive a warm welcome on Kalimdor. The night elves dispatched a number of scouts posthaste, and the scouts returned with frightening stories of the orcs' past atrocities during the First and Second Wars. In the meantime, the orcs chopped down a great many trees in Kalimdor, clearly intending to establish a settlement. Cenarius became certain that the orcs had returned to their warlike ways. He led a group of night elves and treants against a large group of the orcish intruders.\nThe newborn Horde would surely have been crushed, save for the fact that several agents of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had recently arrived on Azeroth. The Legion had not forgotten the valor and might that Cenarius displayed during the War of the Ancients, and they were determined to see him defeated. At the dreadlord Tichondrius' suggestion, the pit lord Mannoroth spilled his blood into a pool of water, and the resulting corruption was soon detected by the Horde's troll witch doctors.\nLed by Grom Hellscream, the orcs drank of the pool's tainted waters and reveled in the return of their demon-granted power. Overcome with supernatural hate and rage, Grom and his warriors retaliated against Cenarius and his allies. Ultimately the orcs succeeded in killing the demigod. The night elves and many other creatures, including Ysera, mourn Cenarius' tragic death to this day.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/350.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/350.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

His family name was an ancient one, but most &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; had always considered it somewhat odd, given that they were primarily a nocturnal people who worshipped the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Gods\"&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Even his appearance was strange, for his auburn hair bore streaks of gold.\nA Poor Bargain.\nRegardless of Dath'Remar's unusual name and appearance, he, like the rest of his caste, was fascinated by the first Well of Eternity. Over time Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Highborne became obsessed with studying and harnessing the Well's magic. Their abuse of that magic provoked violent storms around the Well and attracted the notice of Sargeras, the dark titan, who quickly enthralled the helpless night elves and bent them to his will.\nHe promised to remake &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into a paradise if the night elves helped him enter their world. Working toward that goal, the deluded Highborne summoned increasing numbers of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; into the palace. Eventually these &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; marched out of the palace and began slaughtering night elves. They quickly leveled most of the capital city, Zin-Azshari. Only the Highborne and their homes were spared.\nThe night elf race scrambled to defend itself, and the War of the Ancients broke out. Even so, the Highborne worked feverishly to widen and stabilize the portal they had opened into the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, so that Sargeras could use it to reach Azeroth. They abandoned all their other studies of the Well; they hardly slept, if at all; and they ate and drank so little that they became skeletally thin. Even so, Sargeras' lieutenants were displeased with the Highborne's slow progress and proved quick to slay spellcasters who faltered in their duties.\nMany of the Highborne broke free of Sargeras' influence and realized that they had made a foolish choice in serving the Legion. Although Sargeras had made glorious promises, he had provided nothing but grueling and thankless work. It seemed likely that instead of rebuilding the world, Sargeras intended to destroy it.\nEscape from Zin-Azshari.\nWord reached Dath'Remar that High Priestess &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; had been captured by the Legion and taken to the palace. He was appalled to hear that the leader of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; had been made a prisoner of the demons. Accordingly he learned the location of her prison cell and paid her a secret visit.\nShe proved a sympathetic listener, and so he found himself confiding in her. Working in secret, he formed a desperate plan. He contacted all the other Highborne who had come to consider the Burning Legion the enemy. Then he went to visit Tyrande one last time.\nHe explained that he and a group of other Highborne were leaving the palace. They had agreed to help her escape if she would speak to the night elf defenders on behalf of the rebel Highborne. She quickly agreed, for she believed in the compassionate teachings of Elune and felt that the Highborne deserved a chance to redeem themselves for their reckless actions.\nDuring the escape, Tyrande was unexpectedly separated from the rebel Highborne when she was snatched into the air by an attacking demon. Nevertheless, Dath'Remar and many of the other Highborne managed to escape the palace and rendezvous with the rest of the night elves. Moments later, the Great Sundering created a new ocean, and both groups of night elves were forced to flee for their lives. The rushing waters pursued the elves all the way to Mount Hyjal before finally subsiding.\nIn the aftermath of the war, relations between the Highborne and the rest of the night elves were strained. The Highborne's abuse of arcane magic had led to the Burning Legion's invasion and the shattering of ancient Kalimdor. Countless night elves had been killed by the demons. Thus, arcane magic was now a crime punishable by death.\nRegardless, Dath'Remar and the rest of the Highborne continued practicing their sorcery. As the highest caste of ancient night elf society, the Highborne had studied arcane magic for more than a thousand years before Queen Azshara came to the throne. Most other night elves had significantly less knowledge and skill at manipulating arcane energies. The Highborne had no intention of surrendering the magic they saw as their birthright. They felt that the lower-caste majority had neither the right nor the ability to judge the safety of arcane magic.\nNor were the Highborne the only ones to maintain that arcane magic was worth pursuing. Dath'Remar and a few other night elves soon discovered that &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had stolen several vials of pure energy from the first Well of Eternity, and then emptied three of the vials into a normal lake. In doing so, he had created a second Well of Eternity. He considered himself a hero, but most other night elves disagreed. They confiscated the remaining vials from Illidan and sentenced him to imprisonment for the rest of his &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt; life.\nThe Highborne were awed by what Illidan accomplished, and they soon grew bold in defying the new laws against arcane magic. They would not bow to the hysterical fears of the lower-caste majority. The Highborne felt they had taken all the necessary precautions by resolving to be more cautious than their predecessors. After all, the Highborne had no desire to bring about another Sundering.\nRather than execute the Highborne, the rest of the night elves sentenced them to exile. The Highborne were thoroughly exasperated by what they saw as a foolish overreaction against sorcery. They were therefore not unhappy at the prospect of exile; on the contrary, they looked forward to it. Thinking ahead, they contrived to steal one of the magical vials that had been confiscated from Illidan.\nFounding of Quel'Thalas.\nThe exiled Highborne then eagerly sailed to the Eastern Kingdoms, still under Dath'Remar's leadership. Gradually the Highborne lost their connection to the second Well of Eternity. Their skin's violet hue faded; they grew shorter in stature; and they lost their immortality. Like modern night elves, high elves have long but finite lifespans.\nAll the same, they struggled onward. Deep within the northern forests of the continent, in the continent of Lordaeron, they founded the magical kingdom of Quel'Thalas and renamed themselves high elves. Using the vial they had stolen, the high elves created the Sunwell, a fountain of magical energy that was weaker than the first and second Wells. The Sunwell was designed to be constantly but exclusively available to the high elves, who chose its name as a further renunciation of night elf society.\nThe high elves crowned Dath'Remar Sunstrider as their first king. Up until the Scourge's invasion of Quel'Thalas, the Sunstrider dynasty continued to hold the throne. The last monarch, King Anasterian, was slain by undead forces during the attack. His son, Prince Kael'thas, is the only remaining survivor of the royal bloodline.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Nevertheless, unlike &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;, most demigods have never been the objects of worship. Few demigods have temples built in their honor. Priesthoods based on the worship of a demigod are extremely rare. Nevertheless, demigods been revered in the past, and some of them continue to be respected today.\nPart God, Part Other.\nDemigods in Warcraft are &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt;, but they are neither omniscient nor omnipotent. Otherwise, among other things, they would have known immediately of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s first invasion, and they would have been able to thwart it with ease.\nSadly there is no question as to whether or not a demigod can be slain. Several demigods were killed during the War of the Ancients, overwhelmed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. In a far more recent tragedy, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; was killed during the Third War by mortals under the influence of demon blood: a group of orcs led by Grom Hellscream.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

They delight in inflicting suffering, spreading corruption, and, of course, destroying all that is good. Most demons were once mortal. Not all demons are sentient: various animals have been transformed into demons, for instance.\nIn order to become a demon, a creature must be infused with fel energy. As the existence of non-sentient demons suggests, a creature's wishes are irrelevant to the process. Willing or not, a creature can be changed into a demon. Such a transformation alters the affected creature on a fundamental level and typically leaves little or nothing of that creature's original personality. Still, at least one demon has thus far maintained much of his original personality: &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo discussion of demons can be complete without mentioning Sargeras, the dark titan. Over the course of millennia, he twisted many creatures into demons so that they would join his &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and work toward his goal: the destruction of the universe, which he believed to be fundamentally flawed. Fulfilling his grim design, the Legion has ravaged innumerable worlds. However, Sargeras was not the sole creator of demons, and there are demons that have no affiliation with the Legion. Again, Illidan is an example of both of these exceptions.\nThere have been no reported sightings of Sargeras since the death of the wizard Medivh, who was possessed by Sargeras' spirit at the time. Even so, a demon's hunger for life and magic can never be sated for long. More to the point, a demon's innate cruelty makes a moot point of whatever temporary satiation a demon can know. As a result, destruction tends to follow demons, whether or not they are part of the Legion.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Secure in his aristocratic lineage, Desdel was proud of his high rank and, in the absence of armed conflict, had formed a high opinion of his combat abilities by the time the War of the Ancients began.\nA Brief and Disastrous Career.\nWhen Kur'talos was assassinated by an agent of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt;, Desdel quickly assumed command of the army. To his shock, the invading &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; proved far more difficult foes than he had anticipated. Desdel began to get the impression that the army he commanded had no faith in his tactics. Abandoning his polite attempts at diplomacy, Desdel did his best to make it clear that he expected both respect and obedience.\nWhen the forces of the Legion began to retreat, Desdel triumphantly ordered the night elves to give chase. He was sure that his strategies had the Legion on the run. Instead, the demons unleashed a deadly trap, attacking the unsuspecting night elves from the air. Desdel watched helplessly as the demons began pouring containers of boiling red liquid over the night elf army. In seconds, hundreds of troops were injured, some mortally.\nCaptain &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; rode to Desdel and asked for orders, but the panicked noble had none to give. Jarod caught sight of another group of demons hovering over Desdel, and so Jarod tried to pull Desdel out of the way. Infuriated at the upstart captain's lack of respect for superior rank and bloodline, Desdel ordered Jarod away on pain of imprisonment.\nIt was the last mistake Desdel would make. Jarod yanked his mount aside just in time to avoid an agonizing death. The demons turned over their container, and boiling liquid poured down on Desdel and his nearby companions. Desdel was burned to death in moments, his face maimed beyond recognition.\nNot long after Desdel's death, Jarod became the new head of the night elf army.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/785.xml."}

Unaffiliated with any specific government, the primary druidic organization on &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, answers to no one save itself. The highest rank that a druid can have is that of archdruid, and there are only a few archdruids on Azeroth. At the moment the Cenarion Circle's leader is Archdruid &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. However, the first mortal druid on Azeroth was Archdruid &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrengths, Abilities, and Underlying Motivations.\nThrough their deep connection to life and nature, druids are able to take on an unusually large variety of roles. Probably a druid's best-known role is that of a healer. Druids are justly famed for their ability to restore life, cure poisonous wounds, and remove curses. Indeed, restoring and protecting the planet is one of the top priorities for all druids. Still, to regard a druid as merely a healer is a dangerously simplistic assumption that has led to the defeat of many an unwary foe.\nA druid's empathy with the creatures of the wild also allows him to shapeshift into the forms of other animals. For example, a wounded druid whose magical energies are running low might abruptly take on the form of a bear in order to better withstand further injury. Alternatively, the druid might shift into the form of some large cat, sneak up behind an enemy, then pounce and deliver a fierce flurry of melee attacks. Even the deepest oceans can be explored by a druid, who can simply shift into an aquatic creature, allowing him to stay underwater as long as needed.\nUntil the end of the Third War, druids periodically visited the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to monitor the ebb and flow of life on Azeroth. Today such a visit has become more difficult due to Nordrassil's poor health. Druids possess a deep understanding of the way in which all living things depend upon one another. Whenever this delicate equilibrium is disrupted, the druid works to restore the balance. To that end, a druid can use his connection with the Emerald Dream to exert a calming influence over animals, even forcing some into a temporary state of hibernation. Just as the druid can wield peace and somnolence, however, the druid can tap into the fury of nature itself. Terrible storms have responded to a druid's call. Thorns have sprouted from the druid's skin to wound his attackers. Even previously harmless roots have grown up out of the soil at greatly accelerated speeds in order to entangle a foe.\nLimitations.\nFor obvious reasons, druids thrive in the wild outdoors. Inevitably, however, they lose some of their effectiveness when they are forced to endure separation from the natural environment. What good is a cleansing rain when a druid cannot even see the sky? How are roots to capture a foe who is standing atop a high tower? Such cases clearly require a druid with the imagination to consider new strategies and the flexibility to carry them out.\nYet this flexibility, too, comes with an underlying negative corollary. The druid tends to be a jack-of-all-trades, but a master of none. An unusual mixture of priest, rogue, and warrior, the druid is therefore not equal to any of these three classes in their particular specialties. Even so, the druids' incredible adaptability serves them well in confronting the challenges that Azeroth has to offer.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/785.xml."}

However, the Mother Moon is not a goddess who advocates peace at all costs. Indeed, one of Elune's aspects since ancient times has been the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, who is said to take the valiant dead from the battlefield and set them riding across the evening sky as stars.\nLong before the Great Sundering, an order of priests had dedicated itself to Elune's service. The highest echelon of this order is known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and as the name implies, membership in this echelon is open only to women. Their battle chants can call down Elune's wrath to smite an enemy, and their prayers can heal even the gravely wounded.\nBeyond Divinity: Woman and Mother.\nElune has never been observed in physical form on Azeroth. Indeed, she is as much a collection of ideals as she is a personality in her own right. A powerful and spiritual deity, she is fundamentally an incorporeal being. Nevertheless, she is often depicted as a beautiful night elf woman crowned with a simple platinum circlet and surrounded by dazzling luminescence. Artists also traditionally portray her with long, white hair, alabaster skin, and eyes of pure moonlight.\nTo the best of anyone's knowledge, Elune has only had one lover: the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. Together they conceived a child, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, who possessed a powerful combination of his mother's love for the creatures of Azeroth and his father's connection to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The tauren have a myth that purportedly relates the story of Cenarius' conception.\nRumors persist to this day on Azeroth that Ysera the Dreamer is the actual mother of Cenarius. The rumors are not true, though the close relationship that has been observed between Ysera and Cenarius has certainly led to some confusion.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070104073706/http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/392.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/392.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Located outside the physical boundaries of Azeroth, the Dream is a lush and primal forest: the world that Azeroth might have become, had it developed without interference from the sentient races (e.g., technological advances, urbanization, and wars). Although the Dream is beautiful, its primal savagery can also be deadly.\nThe Dream's Purpose.\nThe Dream is under the protection of the green Dragon Aspect, Ysera. After the titans had shaped Azeroth, they sent Ysera into an eternal trance and charged her with watching over all of Azeroth from the Dream. As a result, green dragons guard every portal into the Dream, and they always see both the landscape of Azeroth and the corresponding dreamscape. This enchanted vision, known as dreamsight, allows green dragons to perceive their surroundings with perfect clarity despite the dragons' closed eyes.\nUnlike Azeroth, the Emerald Dream is a realm that is primarily spiritual instead of physical. All who enter the Dream can affect it to a minor extent, but only temporarily: the underlying structure of the Dream inevitably reasserts itself. Even Ysera cannot change the Dream permanently, nor, indeed, would she wish to do so. She does not control the Dream; on the contrary, it is closer to the truth to say that the Dream controls her. Using the Dream as her unfaltering guide, she regulates the ebb and flow of nature and the evolutionary path of the world itself.\nPerception of the Self Inside the Dream.\nThe creatures of Azeroth can visit the Emerald Dream either physically or via dreams, as the realm's name indicates. When an individual's spirit visits the Dream, leaving the body behind, that individual will manifest his or her dreamform, which normally looks and behaves much as that individual's physical body might. Hence, for most creatures, moving through the Dream is achieved in the normal fashion, despite the realm's chiefly spiritual character.\nThese rules do not apply to &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Druid\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; of sufficient skill or experience, who are trained to see beyond physical reality. These druids might be capable of abnormal movement in the Dream (e.g., a &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; who can sprint at a greatly accelerated rate, walk through solid objects, or fly). It is quite rare to see such unusual capabilities in non-druids, but it is not beyond the realm of possibility.\nCharacteristics of the Dream.\nThe Dream can be affected by all dreamers to a minor and temporary extent. However, no living creature except the titans has ever been able to permanently change the Dream. Ysera herself cannot control or shape the Dream, which has its own ecology and a variety of inhabitants, both sentient and non-sentient.\nTime is meaningless inside the Dream. As a result, the green dragonflight, which spends the majority of its time in the Dream, is extremely long-lived. Ysera's consorts in particular almost never emerge from the Dream and are effectively &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt;, as are all other permanent denizens in the Dream.\nBecause the titans invested a great deal of work in perfecting their design of Azeroth, the Emerald Dream is not one a single perfect vision of what Azeroth would become. The finished design of the planet was the product of many previous flawed or unfinished models. The Dream therefore has multiple layers, one for each of these earlier incarnations. These older layers of the Dream are often incomplete and therefore limited in scope, relative to the finalized Dream.\nThe First World Tree.\nAfter the War of the Ancients, three of the Dragon Aspects grew a World Tree, Nordrassil, atop the new Well of Eternity, and Ysera linked Nordrassil to the Emerald Dream. Her action was primarily meant to prevent abuse of the Well and to keep the Well's powers from growing. The tempering energies of the Dream act as a calming influence on the Well's chaotic energies. Secondarily, Nordrassil's connection to the Emerald Dream allowed the druids of Azeroth to travel easily to the Dream.\nSince that time, all druids have periodically hibernated while their spirits wandered the dreamways. This hibernation is not some sort of physical requirement for druids, though; rather, the hibernation was a communion with the Emerald Dream. The druids were learning more about the natural world through the Dream. There was always something new for the druids to learn, even in the smallest blade of grass.\nDuring the Third War, the druids empowered Nordrassil with the night elves' immortality and the energies of countless night elf spirits. Nordrassil then gave off a blast of energy that killed the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lord Archimonde, ending the war and sealing the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat on Azeroth. Although Nordrassil was not killed in the process, the night elves' noble sacrifice left them mortal and cost the druids their easily accessible link to the Emerald Dream. Thus, reaching the Dream has become a significantly more difficult prospect, and fewer druids are able to walk the Dream today.\nThe Second World Tree.\nCertain that the night elves' immortality could be restored, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; proposed growing a second World Tree, though the dragons showed no sign of offering their assistance in the process. Archdruid &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; flatly refused; he argued that without the blessing of the dragonflights, the tree would be an abomination.\nWhen Malfurion fell into a mysterious coma, Fandral became the new leader of the druids. His first act was to persuade the rest of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; to grow the second World Tree, which they named Teldrassil. Teldrassil is not linked to the Dream or to the Well of Eternity. Contrary to Fandral's hopes, the new World Tree has not restored the night elves' immortality.\nA Gathering Darkness.\nSomething terrible has entered the Dream: the Emerald Nightmare. Four green dragons, once the proud lieutenants of Ysera, have gone insane, and their noble forms have been warped almost beyond recognition. The powers these ghastly dragons wield are twisted and evil mockeries of their former abilities. Worse yet, these dragons seem to be taking out their rage and frustration on the creatures of Azeroth.\nThus far, neither the druids nor the dragons have been able to discover the Nightmare's origin. Only one thing is clear: as long as the Nightmare continues to darken the Emerald Dream, corrupted green dragons will sew terror and madness throughout the world.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/394.xml."}

His first act was to persuade the rest of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; to grow the second World Tree, Teldrassil. He argued that Teldrassil would eventually restore the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed during the Third War. This claim has yet to be born out.\nFandral's mate died while giving birth to &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;Valstann Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, and Fandral formed a very strong attachment to the boy as a result. Valstann's death during the War of the Shifting Sands left Fandral inconsolable and obsessed with finding a way to restore his son to life. The archdruid swore he would have nothing further to do with the qiraji, the dragons, or Silithus, for he blamed them all for his son's death.\nExperience and Antagonism.\nGrief and bitterness have changed Fandral's personality--some might say for the worse. He has made many hard choices in his single-minded pursuit of his lost son, and each successive choice has proven easier for him to make. He stopped questioning his decisions altogether several hundred years ago. Many night elves regard this attitude as well justified self-confidence, but there are also those who consider him arrogant. Fandral himself has little care for what others think of him, provided that they stay out of his way.\nAlthough Fandral is the political leader of only the small Cenarion Circle, he is convinced that he also understands the best course of action for night elf society to take. He has a relatively low opinion of High Priestess &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who has been sole leader of night elf government since the War of the Ancients. Fandral's disagreements with Tyrande are not a matter of public knowledge, however. Only the highest-ranking priestesses of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and druids know of the friction that has sprung up between Tyrande and Fandral.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/401.xml."}

Based in Silvermoon City, the organization is considered part of the blood elf government, but its members have never been a formal military. The army that currently defends Quel'Thalas is a separate entity from the Farstriders, whose small numbers would in any case make it impossible for them to wage war. The Farstriders have several lodges scattered across Lordaeron and Khaz Modan.\nHistory and Organization.\nThe Farstriders is a small but highly skilled group of rangers. The organization can trace its roots back to the Troll Wars, when a loosely affiliated band of high elf warriors occasionally worked together to defend Quel'Thalas. Roughly five hundred years ago, a group of similarly dedicated fighters formed and officially took on the name \"Farstriders\". Their mandate was to protect Quel'Thalas far beyond its actual borders and look after high elf interests all over &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The commander of the Farstriders was given a unique title: ranger-general of Silvermoon.\nOver time the Farstriders' focus has evolved. Today the Farstriders do not usually range far from home. Instead, they are trying to reclaim the southern section of Quel'Thalas, which has been heavily afflicted by the plague: the southernmost areas have fallen into Scourge possession. The Farstriders are also fighting to hold onto Eversong Woods, which is being threatened by the Amani trolls of Zul'Aman, to the east of Quel'Thalas.\nBeliefs and Practices.\nThe Farstriders have long been considered valiant and honorable elves who regarded the law with deep respect and faith. Indeed, they have long been considered the epitome of selfless dedication.\nSince the Scourge's bloody rampage through Quel'Thalas, the Farstriders have lost some of their optimism. Even so, they are nobly maintaining their role as protectors of blood elf society. Perhaps due to their ties to the land, these rangers tend to be spiritually, mentally, and physically healthier than many other blood elves.\nThey see their mission as a broad one: to seek out and eradicate evil. Their primary focus is on Quel'Thalas itself, but they also occasionally venture abroad, carrying out surgical strikes where they feel their efforts will have the greatest effect.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Gods can be fundamentally incorporeal, like &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, or they may have physical bodies.\nGods are neither omniscient nor omnipotent. Take for example the case of the Soulflayer. Many of the trolls in the Gurubashi empire rose up against his bloody rule. They succeeded in destroying his avatar and banishing him from the world of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the benevolent titans, though not gods themselves, cast a magical slumber upon the Old Gods and imprisoned them far below the surface of the world.\nIt is possible for a god to exert influence over several locations simultaneously. Yet the power of a god is limited. Otherwise, of course, the Old Gods could not have been imprisoned. Nonetheless, an imprisoned, sleeping, or otherwise enfeebled god may still have an effect--conscious or not--on the god's surroundings. The development of the qiraji is said to be the result of just such an incidental influence.\nCan one ever truly destroy a god, putting a lasting end to its existence? Unfortunately that question has departed the realm of philosophy and become a matter of vital concern. Not long ago, the priests of Hakkar the Soulflayer succeeded in summoning their hungry god physically into Azeroth. Worse, C'Thun has awakened, freed itself, and reemerged from the planet's depths. Many valiant heroes are banding together in the hope of defeating these two evil gods.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nAlso known as: quel'dorei\nSingular form: high elf, quel'dorei\nPrimary language: &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;\nLong ago, one caste of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; nobility rose to prominence and eventually became known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;\"Highborne\"&lt;/a&gt;. Their reckless use of magic in the royal palace of Zin-Azshari caught the attention of Sargeras, who easily corrupted them. Captivated by the powerful dark titan, the palace Highborne helped the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invade &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Countless night elves and other creatures died during the resulting War of the Ancients.\nA number of Highborne living in the palace regretted their choice to aid the Legion and, led by &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, managed to escape Zin-Azshari before the Sundering occurred. Afterwards, tensions between the escapees and other night elves came to a boiling point when Dath'Remar and his followers refused to renounce arcane magic. They were certain that arcane magic could be used safely, and they felt that the rest of the night elves had neither the right nor the knowledge to claim otherwise. Sentenced to exile, these Highborne were more than happy to journey over the sea to Lordaeron, where they hoped to establish a home of their own.\nThe Founding of Quel'Thalas.\nGradually the exiled Highborne developed striking differences from the night elves. Cut off from the new Well of Eternity, they diminished in height, and their skin lost its characteristic violet hue. In addition, the elves lost their resistance to injury and illness, and they became mortal. Many of the elves died from exposure or starvation during their long journey. In addition to these hardships, the elves were forced to flee the site of their first settlement, Tirisfal Glades, due to a mysterious evil influence that drove many of their number mad.\nAs they pressed further inland, the elves developed a blood feud with the cunning forest trolls of Zul'Aman, who controlled most of the northern reaches of Lordaeron. Finally the exiled elves reached a region whose forestland reminded them of their distant homeland in Kalimdor. They drove out the resident Amani trolls, founded the kingdom of Quel'Thalas, and began calling themselves high elves. They also crowned Dath'Remar as their first monarch.\nIn spite of the hardship they had endured, the high elves remained determined to continue their spellcasting, for they had come to consider arcane power their birthright. Using a vial of sacred water stolen from the first Well of Eternity, they created a fount of mystical power at a convergence of powerful ley energies in Quel'Thalas. They named this fountain the Sunwell. Although it was weaker by far than the first Well of Eternity, the Sunwell's potent arcane magic fed and strengthened the high elves.\nThus, the city of Silvermoon was established. The power of the high elves grew, and they cast an enchantment on the forest that would keep them bathed in eternal springtime. From that day forward, all high elves were constantly suffused in the Sunwell's energies, and the elves came to regard the Sunwell's waters as holy. Although most high elves were not spellcasters, all high elves had access to the fountain's power no matter where they located on Azeroth.\nElven magi crafted monolithic Runestones along the borders of Quel'Thalas; these massive stones powered a magical shield intended to mask the elves' magic from extra-dimensional threats and protect the land from invasion. The hard-won peace of Quel'Thalas would endure for roughly four thousand years.\nThe Troll Wars: the Defense of Quel'Thalas.\nThe high elves soon learned that the trolls were not so easily defeated. After all, forest trolls had controlled much of Lordaeron for several millennia before the high elves even arrived on the continent. Almost immediately after the high elves founded Quel'Thalas, the trolls began to attack the elven settlements en masse. The stubborn elves, unwilling to give up their new land, fought hard and finally defeated the trolls.\nPeace followed and lasted for several thousand years. Then a mighty army of forest trolls besieged Quel'Thalas. The trolls had regrouped, and they meant to obliterate the elven interlopers. The high elves were hopelessly outnumbered.\nDriven to desperate measures, King &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; appealed to the human nation of Arathor. The high elves offered to teach select humans how to use magic if the humans would use their new powers to help defend Quel'Thalas. Arathor's monarch, King Thoradin, distrusted magic, but the high elves reminded him that if Quel'Thalas fell, the southlands would be the next area to fall before the trolls.\nThoradin reluctantly conceded that the high elves had a point. He agreed to their offer, and soon his armies had joined the war. The united elf and human forces won out over the trolls. History would never see the trolls rise as one nation again. Assured that Quel'Thalas was saved from destruction, the elves made a pledge of loyalty and friendship to the nation of Arathor and to the bloodline of its king. As a result of the alliance between Arathor and Quel'Thalas, the wizard nation of Dalaran was formed, where humans and elves would study magic for years to come.\nThe Second War: Alliance and Secession.\nWhen the Second War broke out, the high elves had little interest in the conflict, but they felt duty-bound to lend the Alliance of Lordaeron their support. In particular, the commander of the Alliance forces was Lord Anduin Lothar, who was the last descendent of King Thoradin. Lothar's family had aided the high elves in fighting the Troll Wars, and so King Anasterian reluctantly agreed to provide a small number of soldiers and spellcasters who would fight alongside the Alliance.\nThen the Horde recruited Amani trolls into its ranks. Shortly thereafter, the Horde burned down the borderlands of Quel'Thalas and slaughtered many high elf civilians. Furious at this wanton destruction of life, the elves officially joined the Alliance and committed all their resources to the war.\nBy the time the Horde was driven back, however, the orcs and trolls had already achieved their true goal: to steal and desecrate many of the Runestones that powered the elves' defensive shield. The warlock Gul'dan then used the pilfered stones to power his devious Altars of Storms.\nNevertheless, the Alliance ultimately won the Second War, and most of the vanquished orcs were rounded up and put into internment camps. In the war's aftermath, the cost of rebuilding was significant, particularly when added to the cost of maintaining the internment camps. Without a common enemy, the human nations began bickering over territorial claims. The high elves began to doubt the value of the Alliance. Humanity seemed to need the high elves, but had little to offer in return, especially now that many Alliance resources went toward maintaining the internment camps.\nAt last Anasterian rescinded the high elves' allegiance to the Alliance. He stated that the humans' poor leadership had been directly responsible for the burned forests in the borderlands of Quel'Thalas. King Terenas Menethil argued that nothing of Quel'Thalas would have survived if not for the hundreds of valiant humans who gave their lives to defend it. Despite his attempts at reestablishing diplomatic relations, however, the elves opted to remain independent of the crumbling Alliance. Their departure triggered the additional secession of the Gilneas and Stromgarde nations.\nThe Third War: Loss of the Sunwell.\nDuring the Third War, Prince Arthas Menethil and the Scourge laid waste to Quel'Thalas, wiping out most of its population and reducing large tracts of the mighty kingdom to ash in his quest to reach the Sunwell. Yet not all who fell before Arthas stayed dead: the merciless prince raised Quel'Thalas' foremost defender, Ranger-General Sylvanas Windrunner, into undeath against her will to serve the Scourge as a powerful, tormented banshee.\nAs the undead armies closed in on the Sunwell, a high elf named Dar'Khan Drathir aided Arthas by lowering the shields surrounding the Sunwell. In betraying the high elves, Dar'Khan hoped to gain the favor of the Lich King. However, the most immediate result of his treachery was an explosion that knocked him unconscious and scattered most of the Sunwell's powers.\nThe wizard Borel sensed the mystical energy being unleashed and succeeded in trapping a portion of it inside an avatar disguised as a young human girl, Anveena. Unaware of Borel's deed, Arthas then used the remaining energies of the Sunwell to reanimate the spirit of Kel'Thuzad in the form of a nightmarish lich. The Sunwell was left defiled and drained of all its magic.\nKing Anasterian was slain in battle, and the sole heir to the throne, Prince &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, had been pursuing magical studies in Dalaran when the invasion occurred. In the absence of other leadership, Lor'themar Theron, Sylvanas Windrunner's second-in-command, assumed temporary leadership of the high elves.\nThe few high elves to survive the Scourge's invasion quickly grew ill and apathetic. It became clear that they had become addicted to the Sunwell's arcane energies. Being constantly suffused in magic had fundamentally changed their race. Now that the source of their magic was gone, they were suffering acute pangs of withdrawal.\nPrince Kael'thas returned home and rallied all the survivors he could find: approximately 90% of the surviving high elves. He declared that these survivors would now bear a new name--the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;\"blood elves\"&lt;/a&gt;--in honor of their fallen people. The blood elves no longer consider themselves high elves, and they have different priorities and behaviors than their high elf kindred.\nIn consequence, there are so few high elves left on Azeroth today that they cannot be considered a race in anything other than the biological sense. High elves do not gather in any significant numbers, nor do they act as a coordinated whole. They are a very small group of individuals scattered all over the world. As such, they do not have common opinions or goals. Indeed, modern high elves cannot even truly be said to have a culture--only a past filled with glory and regret.\nLike blood elves, high elves can use arcane magic, but most do not because most high elves are not spellcasters. Whether or not they are spellcasters, all high elves are suffering acute pangs of withdrawal in the absence of the Sunwell's energies. A few high elves here and there have realized the cause of their distress; others have not. A crucial difference between &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/High%20Elves%20and%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;high elves and blood elves&lt;/a&gt; is that no high elves have decided to feed their hunger for arcane magic by draining that magic from alternative sources (now that the Sunwell is useless). Even today, though, a high elf might still succumb to that addiction and become one of the blood elves.\nA Struggle to Survive.\nOn several occasions after the Sunwell's defilement, Kael'thas publicly asserted that his people would die unless they found a new source of magic. Technically the prince was mistaken. According to Azeroth's top priests and medics, the only high elves to perish due to magical withdrawal have been the very old, the very young, and elves who were already in poor health.\nSuch a low rate of attrition might be considered an argument in favor of simply forgoing magic and suffering through the consequences. Indeed, a few high elves are said to have succeeded in taking this route through sheer willpower: they survived the process, however unpleasant. Apparently certain magical artifacts also ameliorate the symptoms of withdrawal and might, if sufficiently powerful, be able to suppress them altogether.\nThis is not to say, however, that withdrawal from magic would leave the high elves unharmed. On the contrary, permanent mental or physical damage is possible.\nA few high elves have chosen to join the Alliance in recent years, but the Alliance as a whole remains somewhat suspicious of high elves to this day. The high elves' secession from the Alliance during the Second War left bitter memories. Furthermore, the night elves, who became part of the Alliance during the Third War, saw it as their duty to warn their new allies against the high elves. The Highborne's part in bringing about the War of the Ancients figured heavily in the night elves' retelling of high elf history.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Nevertheless, due to their shared history and philosophical differences, the three groups do not share a close relationship. Indeed, night elves regard high elves and blood elves with suspicion, disgust, or outright hostility.\nElves in General.\nElves do have several characteristics in common. All three groups have unusually acute senses and are able to see clearly even in low-light conditions. As a general rule, elves are also slim, athletic, and graceful. Furthermore, they all have large pointed ears that tend to be greeted with admiration or mockery by other races.\nOne similarity between night elves, high elves, and blood elves has only recently come about. The night elves sacrificed their &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; and much of their power at the end of the Third War. Thus, all elves are now mortal and have comparable lifespans that can extend as long as several thousand years.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Most of the Highborne either perished during the War of the Ancients or became &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Satyrs\"&gt;satyrs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/High%20Elves\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory and Organization.\nAt first this caste had no special name and was merely comprised of night elves who had unusual intelligence, strength, skills, or wealth. As time passed, however, the gap between this caste and other night elves widened, particularly as these privileged night elves began using their rank to control who would be permitted access to the Well of Eternity.\nFamilies that belonged to the highest caste were soon arranging marriages so as to maximize the magical ability of their offspring. This selective breeding, combined with frequent access to the Well of Eternity, resulted in night elves with progressively stronger magical abilities and greater understanding of how to use those skills. By the time Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; ascended to the throne, the highest caste of night elf society had come to look and act in a manner distinctively different from lower-caste night elves.\nTheir vast arrogance, unashamed wealth, garish and multicolored clothing, and decadent habits did not endear them to other night elves. In fact, these powerful families became convinced that they were superior to the rest of their race, and so they began to call themselves the Highborne. As a member of the same caste, the queen approved of the term and made it official.\nDuring the War of the Ancients, a number of Highborne were corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and changed into satyrs. When the war ended, Kalimdor was shattered by the Great Sundering, and a new ocean was born. Azshara and other Highborne were pulled beneath the waters, and many were changed into naga.\nA number of Highborne fled the royal palace before the Sundering and rejoined the main force of night elf defenders, fleeing the disaster with them and winding up on Mount Hyjal. Although these Highborne had realized their folly in having aided the Legion, they still did not agree with the majority of night elf society, which had decided that arcane magic was too dangerous to use. These Highborne were eventually exiled for refusing to give up their arcane sorcery. Renouncing their former people, the exiles eventually founded the kingdom of Quel'Thalas and renamed themselves high elves. Today there are very few high elves left on &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, for most of the high elves who survived the Scourge's invasion of Quel'Thalas have since declared themselves to be blood elves.\nNot all the Highborne lived in Zin-Azshari, despite their obsession with the Well of Eternity. For a variety of political or personal reasons, certain members of the nobility opted to live outside the capital city. Moreover, not all night elves (or other races of Kalimdor) joined the main force of night elf defenders. Such holdouts were not necessarily resistant to the idea of joining their compatriots. Indeed, it seems likelier that these small pockets of resistance had heard nothing of the primary defending force and were unaware of the demonic invasion's massive scope.\nThe Shen'dralar were one of these holdout groups. These Highborne defended their city, Eldre'Thalas, as best they could during the war. After the Sundering, the Shen'dralar remained in the shattered city, which has since become known as Dire Maul. In the ensuing years, these Highborne continued to be isolated from the rest of night elf society, and so their subsequent dangerous actions went unnoticed by their distant kindred. They were never exiled from Kalimdor, nor have any Shen'dralar become high elves or blood elves.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "324396", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=324396", "title": "The Warcraft Encyclopedia/Illidan Stormrage", "text": "This article is a copy of \"The Warcraft Encyclopedia,\" an official article by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nAlso known as: the Betrayer\nDemon type: Unique\nAffiliation: Independent\nIllidan is the fraternal twin of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and, like his brother, grew up as the friend of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; millennia before the Great Sundering. Unlike Malfurion, Illidan had no patience for the subtleties of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Druid\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt; and proved to be a poor student despite their teacher, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;.\nYet Illidan was talented at sorcery, which at the time was a staple of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; society. His magical abilities were cold comfort, though, for he had been born with golden eyes, which were quite rare in night elves before the Sundering. Golden eyes were thus commonly regarded as a sign of future greatness, but Illidan showed no signs of achieving anything out of the ordinary. Little did Illidan know that his eyes actually indicated strong druidic potential.\nFascinated with arcane magic, he learned increasingly difficult spells, but to his discouragement, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; did not offer him membership in light of his advanced sorcery. Nevertheless, Illidan remained determined to become the hero his people expected him to be.\nSoon he found another compelling reason to achieve greatness. One day during a festival, he caught sight of Tyrande dancing in the crowd and realized that he loved her. At some point over the years, he had fallen in love with her kindness, her laughter, her beauty, and her faith.\nHis joy was dimmed only by the fact that Malfurion, too, had feelings for Tyrande, although Malfurion was slower than Illidan to recognize them. Illidan could see that Tyrande would inevitably choose either Malfurion or Illidan as her mate. It was simply a matter of which twin would prove worthy in her eyes.\nIllidan redoubled his efforts at mastering arcane sorcery and was elated when chance and quick thinking gave him the opportunity to save the life of Lord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;. The grateful noble made Illidan his personal sorcerer and placed great faith in his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9's courage and magic.\nUnfortunately the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; that had nearly killed Ravencrest was only the first of many to appear all over ancient Kalimdor. The first invasion of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had begun.\nThe War of the Ancients.\nRavencrest organized the night elves into an army to fight the invading demons. When the highest-ranking member of the Moon Guard, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Latosius\"&gt;Latosius&lt;/a&gt;, was slain in combat, Illidan jumped at the opportunity. He took charge of the surviving sorcerers and directed their combined power to noticeable effect, killing many of the Legion's minions. Even so, the war looked increasingly hopeless as further reinforcements arrived from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt a critical point in the war, Malfurion disobeyed Ravencrest's orders and left the night elf army. He had embarked upon a perilous journey: he planned to seek out the dragonflights and appeal to them for help. Impulsively Illidan confronted Tyrande and told her he could no longer remain silent. He confessed his love for her and said that Malfurion had clearly gone mad in his pursuit of druidism.\nWorrying about Malfurion, Tyrande rebuked Illidan, who saw that he had spoken too late. She had already chosen her intended, and it was not Illidan. Once again Malfurion had effortlessly achieved a goal that Illidan could not. This time Malfurion's victory was particularly bitter, for Malfurion had yet to recognize his own love for Tyrande.\nThe pain of Illidan's unrequited feelings haunted him, and he found himself dwelling on dark thoughts. He had no way of knowing that he was being influenced by Lord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Satyrs\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; with the power to spread corruption. At last Illidan, too, left the night elf army, but he embarked on quite a different mission. He sought out Sargeras, creator of the Burning Legion.\nIllidan swore allegiance to the dark titan, who granted Illidan great power in return. Sargeras burned Illidan's eyes to ash and endowed the scorched eye sockets with magically enhanced sight. As further reward, Sargeras marked much of Illidan's body with an intricate pattern of tattoos that filled the night elf with powerful arcane energy.\nFor this apparent shift of loyalties, Illidan would later come to be called the Betrayer. Yet although he did aid the Burning Legion to some extent, he ultimately sided with Malfurion and the other night elves. He and Malfurion closed the portal that the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; living in the royal palace had opened in the Well of Eternity, thus preventing Sargeras himself from entering &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, an outcome that would have spelled doom for the world. Not long before the portal was closed, a group of Highborne rebelled against the Legion and, led by &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, rejoined the main night elf army.\nA Darkening Path.\nThe planet of Azeroth was saved, but the Well's magics had been too badly abused, and so the Well imploded, shattering ancient Kalimdor into several landmasses. A new ocean was born, and the night elf defenders fled before its rushing waves. Reaching Mount Hyjal, the night elves were finally able to rest: the ocean waters had reached their limit.\nJust before the Well imploded, Illidan had filled several vials of its powerful waters. He was certain that despite the night elves' victory, the Legion would one day return. Despite the grueling war that had just ended, he believed that arcane magic alone could save the night elves from a second invasion. Thus, he sought out a secluded lake atop Mount Hyjal and poured three of the vials into its waters, irreversibly changing the lake into a second Well of Eternity.\nHe thought his people would hail him as a hero. He was wrong.\nA small group of night elves, including a few of the repentant Highborne, discovered what Illidan had done, and most reacted in horror. Illidan suspected the Highborne would try to usurp the Well's powers, as they had done with the first Well, and so he attacked the group. Malfurion arrived a few moments later and helped capture his twin.\nAs Illidan's brother and a respected hero of the recent war, Malfurion was permitted to determine his brother's fate. Taken aback by Illidan's power, Malfurion decided that Illidan was too dangerous to be left free. Even so, Malfurion could not condemn his brother to death. Instead, he sentenced Illidan to a fate arguably far worse: Illidan was to be imprisoned for the rest of his &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt; life. As a consequence of Malfurion's so-called mercy, Illidan spent the next ten thousand years in isolation, trapped in a prison far beneath the earth and guarded by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;.\nLost Soul: the Third War.\nProving Illidan's fears correct, the Burning Legion invaded Azeroth again during the Third War. Tyrande, the head of the night elf government, awoke Malfurion from hibernation, and together they ventured underground to awaken the rest of the druids. In the process, Tyrande happened upon the entrance to Illidan's prison, and she decided that he would make a strong ally. Although Malfurion tried to stop her, she led her &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; into the prison.\nThe Watchers would not surrender their prisoner without a fight, and so Tyrande and her soldiers slew the guards who barred the way to Illidan's cell. She told Illidan that his people needed him to help fight the Burning Legion again.\nIllidan consented to join the fight against the Legion. However, his long and unjustified imprisonment had left him bitter. He told Tyrande that he agreed not out of any lingering loyalty toward their people, but for her sake alone.\nFree at last, he followed Tyrande upward into the corrupted forests of Felwood. Tyrande and her soldiers departed in search of Malfurion, who was awakening the last sleeping druids. She felt sure that once confronted with the reality of Illidan's freedom, she could convince her mate to give his twin another chance.\nOnce she had left Illidan alone, he was confronted by the death knight Arthas Menethil, who told him that the demons who had corrupted Felwood were using a magical artifact to do so: the Skull of Gul'dan. Arthas explained that the Lich King would be grateful if Illidan would steal the artifact from the demons. In fact, Arthas invited Illidan to claim the artifact's powers as his own.\nIllidan remained hungry for magic, and he was certain that with the skull's power, he would be able to overcome the Legion forces in Felwood. Despite his suspicions about Arthas' motives, Illidan therefore stole the artifact and consumed it, taking its powers for himself. Already marked by Sargeras back in the War of the Ancients, Illidan was instantly transformed into a demon when he consumed the skull's fel energies.\nUsing his newfound strength, Illidan defeated Tichondrius, leader of the demons who were corrupting Felwood. Not long after Illidan's victory, Malfurion and Tyrande returned to the forest and confronted Illidan. At first neither night elf recognized the powerful demon as Illidan. When they learned what had happened, Malfurion grew furious, dismissed what Illidan had accomplished, and condemned him. Still the arbiter of Illidan's fate, Malfurion exiled him from night elf lands.\nThe new punishment hardly surprised Illidan. Malfurion had always been uncomfortable with any power but his own and Tyrande's. Let Illidan's self-righteous twin limit himself to those so-called \"safer\" magics. Let him walk his precious &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; while life on Azeroth passed him by. Illidan would never have been content with such a living death.\nIf Illidan was to be forbidden from having anything else, he would have power.\nAlliance with the Naga.\nAfter the Legion's defeat at the Battle of Mount Hyjal, the demon lord Kil'jaeden contacted Illidan. He asked Illidan to destroy the Lich King, who had betrayed the Burning Legion by making Arthas his personal champion and the head of the Scourge. In return for the Lich King's destruction, Kil'jaeden promised to reward Illidan with anything Illidan might want.\nIn the face of Kil'jaeden's overwhelming might, Illidan had little choice but to agree. He therefore summoned a large group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; from the depths of the ocean, including Lady &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. The naga, who had once been Highborne, recognized Illidan and respected his magical talent, which was even greater than they had recalled. They agreed to become his allies.\nIn the meantime, Warden &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Illidan had escaped, and so she vowed to recapture him. She and her Watchers pursued him through Ashenvale Forest and followed him over the sea to the Broken Isles, where Illidan and his naga allies entered the Tomb of Sargeras.\nMaiev tracked down Illidan just as he acquired the Eye of Sargeras. Confronted by his former captors, Illidan used the powerful demonic artifact against them. He escaped, but the Watchers were left trapped in one section of the tomb, a section that was quickly filling with seawater. The Watchers had done their best to bury Illidan alive; he was merely returning the favor.\nOut of all the Watchers in the tomb, only Maiev managed to avoid a watery death. Illidan's naga allies sent repeated attacks against Maiev's greatly depleted forces, but Maiev dispatched a runner who reached Malfurion and asked for help. He and Tyrande arrived in time to rescue the warden, but Illidan eluded capture.\nThe three night elves followed Illidan to Lordaeron, where Illidan and several naga spellcasters began channeling a powerful spell through the Eye of Sargeras. Malfurion and Maiev arrived in time to stop the spell before it could be completed. Furious and exasperated, Illidan explained that he had been trying to destroy the Frozen Throne and its occupant, the Lich King. Naturally Illidan made no mention of his pact with Kil'jaeden, for Malfurion would not have understood. In any case, due to Malfurion's interference, Illidan had failed, and so the pact was now void.\nSoon Malfurion and Illidan learned that Tyrande and a small group of her Sentinels had been swept down the River Arevass and were under attack by the Scourge. Illidan still loved Tyrande, and so he was quick to offer his assistance. For Tyrande's sake, Malfurion hesitantly agreed to work with Illidan. Malfurion established and defended a night elf base while Illidan and his naga retrieved Tyrande and her soldiers.\nIn return for Illidan's rescue of Tyrande, Malfurion declared that he pardoned Illidan for his dangerous spellcasting. Even so, he warned Illidan never to threaten the night elves again. Largely uninterested in the race he had left behind, Illidan agreed to Malfurion's terms and opened a portal to Outland, where he hoped to evade Kil'jaeden's wrath. The Burning Legion had little tolerance for failure.\nLord of Outland.\nConsumed by the desire for vengeance, Maiev could not relinquish the hunt. She and a small group of her followers pursued Illidan through the portal. Illidan was outnumbered, and so he was eventually recaptured.\nFortunately he was only outnumbered because he had dispatched Lady Vashj and her naga to recruit further allies: Prince &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. These blood elves soon followed the naga to Outland and freed Illidan, who promised to teach them how to feed their addiction to magic. Kael'thas swore allegiance to Illidan, and the prince helped his new lord close all the portals on Outland. By carrying out this endeavor, Illidan hoped to cut off further demonic reinforcements from the Twisting Nether and block any attempts by Kil'jaeden to locate Illidan.\nThe ruler of Outland at the time, a pit lord named Magtheridon, became a feasible target. Illidan led the powerful army of blood elves and naga against Magtheridon, defeated him, and took possession of his fortress, the Black Temple.\nYet Illidan did not celebrate his conquest for long. In a storm of magic and fury, Kil'jaeden descended upon Outland, regardless of the fact that Illidan had closed all portals on the planet. Illidan had colossally underestimated the demon lord's power.\nThinking quickly, Illidan told Kil'jaeden that he had only come to Outland to bolster his forces before making a final assault upon the Frozen Throne. Kil'jaeden was hardly appeased, but he decided to give Illidan one last chance. He warned Illidan that failure would result in death.\nWith no other option, Illidan led the blood elves and naga back to Azeroth. The Scourge kept Illidan's army at bay until Arthas and the crypt lord Anub'arak arrived. Arthas and Illidan faced off in single combat, and Arthas was the victor. He warned Illidan to leave Azeroth and not return.\nSince that time, Illidan has returned to the Black Temple. While his allies fight to keep Outland's many portals sealed, Illidan is preparing for the day that Kil'jaeden arrives to punish Illidan for failing to destroy the Lich King.\nIllidan the Demon.\nAs is the case with certain demons, Illidan does not consider himself a servant of the Burning Legion. Indeed, Illidan has alternately been the Legion's ally and its enemy at various points in the past. A rarity among demons, he has retained vast tracts of his original personality despite his demonic transformation. As a demon, he is fundamentally evil and often cruel, but he has thus far been able to preserve a few tattered remnants of nobility. Their inevitable conflict with his ambition and his hunger for power makes him a dangerously unpredictable adversary.\nBecause Illidan's case is unique, there is no point in speculating upon how long his divergence from standard demonic behavior will last.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nMany immortal and near-immortal creatures exist in Warcraft. A number of these creatures are fundamentally incorporeal beings, but others lead a primarily physical existence.\nThe Nature of Immortality.\nImmortals in Warcraft are generally resistant to sickness and injury, but immortality does not confer invulnerability. Immortal beings can still be wounded and even killed. Indeed, many immortals have perished over the course of recorded history, particularly during the War of the Ancients. The death of an immortal is just as real as any mortal death and, barring a few extraordinary cases, just as permanent.\nWhat, then, does the term immortality mean in Warcraft? Immortal creatures essentially stop aging when they reach adulthood, and thus, they cannot die merely from old age. In addition, they tend to be more powerful than most mortal creatures, although this tendency does not always hold true. Even godhood itself is no guarantee of superior might. Consider the titans' defeat of the Old Gods. The titans are not &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;, but their vast power allowed them to imprison the Old Gods far below the surface of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurthermore, immortality need not be a lasting state of affairs. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, for example, were immortal for thousands of years, but sacrificed their immortality during the Third War. Today they are a mortal race, and they are accordingly classified as such, rather than listed herein.\nThere are also quite a few races and individuals who have attained immortality after leading a mortal existence. Most &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; were once mortal creatures.\nLast but not least, there are creatures that can be considered nearly immortal. Technically these beings are mortal, but for one reason or other, they have a lifespan that greatly exceeds several millennia. Indeed, these mortal creatures might even be considered effectively immortal due to some external factor, as with Ysera's consorts, who almost never emerge from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "324431", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=324431", "title": "The Warcraft Encyclopedia/Jarod Shadowsong", "text": "This article is a copy of \"The Warcraft Encyclopedia,\" an official article by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nBy the time the War of the Ancients broke out, Jarod Shadowsong had risen to the rank of captain in the Guard of Suramar, and his sister &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; was one of the senior &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadowsong family was not of noble blood, and so both siblings had earned their positions through skill and hard work.\nPatrolling &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; lands for possible intruders, Jarod captured Krasus and made the disguised dragon a prisoner. A strange and extremely powerful phenomenon had thrown Krasus back to a time that contained a far younger version of Krasus, and the overlap had left Krasus weakened and ill unless he was in close proximity to his younger self.\nFrom Jailor to Protector.\nWith magical persuasion from Krasus, the captain began worrying that Krasus might die before being questioned. Thus, Jarod sought out one of the priestesses of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; in the hope that she could heal his prisoner. He happened upon the novice &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and she consented to lend her aid. Although she could not heal Krasus of his malady, she was soon working with him to help her friend, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently fallen comatose.\nThe forest &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; arrived, to Jarod's poorly concealed astonishment, and returned Malfurion's spirit from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion was reunited with his body and made a quick recovery. Then Jarod accompanied Krasus, Malfurion, and Tyrande as they went to speak with Lord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the night elf army that was fighting the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nKur'talos was impressed by Jarod's dedication to duty, and put a group of battle-hardened soldiers at Jarod's command. Jarod and his soldiers were responsible for watching over the four strongest spellcasters of the night elf army: Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the human wizard Rhonin, and Krasus.\nMalfurion and Krasus eventually left the army and sought out the rest of the dragons, intending to appeal to them for help against the Legion. They embarked on this quest against Lord Ravencrest's express orders and without Jarod's knowledge. Yet Kur'talos could not find it in his heart to reproach Jarod for failing to halt the spellcasters' departure.\nThe Assassination of Lord Ravencrest.\nEventually Kur'talos' strong leadership of the night elf army irked Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, who instructed Captain Varo'then to eliminate the noble. The assassination was successful, and Lord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt; became the new leader of the night elf defenders.\nUnfortunately Desdel had no skill at tactics. The invading &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; pretended to retreat and then swiftly attacked the night elves from the air. Desdel watched in horror as the demons began pouring containers of boiling red liquid over the night elf army. Hundreds were injured, some mortally.\nWhen Jarod asked Desdel what action to take, the panicked noble had no useful response. Jarod caught sight of another group of demons hovering over Desdel, and so Jarod tried to pull Desdel out of the way. However, Desdel took offense at Jarod's effort and ordered him away on pain of imprisonment.\nJarod yanked his mount aside just in time to avoid an agonizing death. The demons tipped over their container, and boiling liquid poured down on Desdel and his nearby companions. Desdel was killed in moments, his face maimed beyond recognition.\nUnwilling Hero.\nAfter Desdel's death, the remaining nobles could not agree on a new strategy for the army. Jarod was forced to step into the breach. With his intuitive grasp of tactics and his natural talent at leadership, he quickly found himself appointed the new leader of the night elf army. The relieved nobles eagerly followed his commands.\nJarod continued to doubt his importance to the war effort, but he received a very welcome surprise. Cenarius led a large group of demigods into the midst of the night elf army and humbly knelt before the astonished captain. The demigods had agreed to fight under Jarod's direction.\nAs the captain continued to rally the night elves and turn the tide of battle, he caught the eye of the demon lord Archimonde. Malfurion's absence from the battlefield had frustrated the massive demon, who decided to take out his fury on Jarod. Archimonde was certain that the Legion's victory was inevitable, and so he took his time, sadistically toying with Jarod, slowly beating him to death. Very likely Archimonde took even greater pleasure in the prospect of finally breaking Jarod's iron will.\nBefore Jarod was too badly wounded to recover, though, Malfurion and Illidan Stormrage worked their combined magic on the Well of Eternity. All the demons, including Archimonde, were sucked into the Well and forced back into the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, howling in fury.\nAfter the Sundering.\nThe Great Sundering triggered the birth of a new ocean, and the rushing waters chased the night elves all the way to Mount Hyjal. At last the waters subsided, and Jarod led a group of night elves to scout the area for drinkable water. They discovered that Illidan had created a second Well of Eternity, and with Malfurion's help, Jarod and the others captured Illidan. Jarod gave Malfurion the power to decide his reckless brother's fate, and so it was Malfurion who sentenced Illidan to an imprisonment that would last ten thousand years.\nA reluctant army commander, Jarod was deeply gladdened by the end of the war. He dissolved the makeshift army and continued to serve as a kind of administrator for a short time, but he had never wanted to be a leader. Gradually he directed increasing numbers of petitioners to the new high priestess of Elune, Tyrande Whisperwind, whose compassion and wisdom went a long way toward calming post-war tensions.\nBy the time Tyrande established the night elves' new army, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, Jarod had deliberately faded into the background. He did not think of himself as a hero, and he did not wish others to do so.\nOne day he simply vanished, along with a few personal possessions. He did not say where he was going, nor, in fact, did he bid anyone farewell. Since that time, there have been no sightings of him.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/785.xml."}

He was born into wealth and privilege.\nUnrequited.\nA wizard of great skill and power, he became a high-ranking member of the Kirin Tor. His continuing magical studies brought him to the Violet Citadel, where he met Lady Jaina Proudmoore while she was still an apprentice. He was immediately drawn to the brilliant and lovely teenager, though the difference between their ages filled him with guilt and self-doubt. Eventually he courted her; however, he had little success in winning her regard. She remained dedicated to her craft above all else.\nWhen rumors began to circulate that Jaina had given her heart to Prince Arthas Menethil, Kael'thas was deeply grieved. In time Jaina and Arthas parted ways, but it was all too obvious to Kael'thas that they still cherished feelings for one another. Kael'thas and Jaina would never have more than an awkward friendship.\nLast Scion of the Sunstrider Dynasty.\nYears later, Arthas became a death knight in the Lich King's service and led the Scourge into Quel'Thalas, leaving a swath of destruction in his wake. He defiled the high elves' fountain of magic, the Sunwell, and left it utterly drained of power. The surviving high elves quickly became sick and apathetic.\nKing Anasterian was killed in combat against the undead. Only a few pockets of resistance remained to fight the Scourge. Prince Kael'thas was pursuing his magical studies in Dalaran when news of the invasion reached him. With his father dead, the prince hastened home and took command of all the surviving high elves he could find. He realized that his people had become addicted to the Sunwell, which had constantly bathed them in arcane magic for thousands of years.\nHostility of the Alliance.\nIn honor of their fallen kin, Kael'thas decided that he and the other surviving elves would rename themselves the sin'dorei, or blood elves. The blood elves swore they would have vengeance on Arthas and the Scourge. In spite of this bold resolve, Kael'thas and his people suffered greatly in the absence of the Sunwell.\nThe prince led a group of his healthiest fighters to join the battlefront, where they hoped to fight the Scourge alongside Alliance forces. Yet the blood elves were greeted with suspicion and hostility. When Grand Marshal Garithos ordered Kael'thas and the blood elves to fight local Scourge forces against nearly impossible odds, a group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; led by Lady &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; unexpectedly offered assistance that turned the tide of battle. Unfortunately the Alliance soon learned of Kael'thas' association with the naga and condemned him and his people as traitors.\nJourney to Outland.\nImprisoned and sentenced to death, the blood elves were rescued by Vashj. She claimed that &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; could help the blood elves with their addiction to arcane magic. By this time the elves were suffering greatly, and Kael'thas felt that he had little choice but to agree. He and his followers followed Vashj to Outland.\nThere they discovered that Illidan had been captured by Warden &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. Vashj and Kael'thas worked together to free Illidan, and then Kael'thas beseeched Illidan for a cure to the blood elves' addiction to magic. Illidan had a different proposal in mind, though: in return for the blood elves' loyalty, he would teach them how to drain arcane magic from other sources, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, and thereby feed their painful addiction.\nIt was an offer Kael'thas felt he had to accept. He was certain his people would die without either a cure or a new source of magic. Kael'thas thus pledged his allegiance to Illidan. Today most of the blood elves in Outland have learned of the pact that Kael'thas made with Illidan. The blood elves still on &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, have little knowledge of the agreement and would probably be appalled to learn of their leader's association with Illidan. Largely unconcerned with what their Azerothian brethren might think, the blood elves currently living in Outland serve Illidan.\nMost of Kael'thas' group chose to stay in Outland, but Grand Magister Rommath was sent back to Azeroth with a message of hope for the blood elves still in Quel'Thalas. He relayed tales of a glorious promised land, spread the teachings of Illidan--teachings that Rommath smoothly attributed to Prince Kael'thas--and planted the notion that Kael'thas might one day return to lead his people to paradise. Rommath has since remained in Quel'Thalas to help rebuild and await the prince's return.\nRommath remained in Quel'Thalas to help rebuild and await the prince's return. Thanks to Rommath, the blood elves on Azeroth learned how to drain arcane magic and feed their addiction. As they returned to health, they praised their absent prince and dedicated themselves to learning more. Rommath and the new order of elven magi made great progress in tutoring their brethren to manipulate arcane energies. Soon the spires of Silvermoon City rose skyward once again, powered by volatile magics. The blood elves have even begun retaking portions of Eversong Woods. Emboldened by the promise of Kael'thas' return, the prince's weary people now focus on regaining their strength and forging a new path into an uncertain future.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

On the contrary, Kur'talos, like most of the night elf populace, regarded the Highborne with suspicion and dislike.\nHe was a levelheaded man, a skilled warrior, and an inspiring leader on the battlefield. It was a matter of both honor and practicality for him to fight alongside his soldiers: his presence inspired others to greater feats of courage and skill. Even so, Kur'talos had many of the ancient night elves' prejudices against other races. He rejected any suggestion of asking the earthen or tauren for help. Furthermore, he considered dragons extremely powerful, but he believed they would simply devour any mortal envoys. He therefore refused to permit any night elves to appeal to the dragons for assistance in fighting the Legion.\nUnexpected Treachery.\nKur'talos was deeply loyal to Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and could not believe she had been involved in the Burning Legion's arrival on &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, he led the night elf forces against the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; into battle time and again, shouting the queen's name as a rallying cry.\nIronically it was Azshara who eventually ordered her second-in-command, Captain Varo'then, to eliminate Kur'talos. Having given her loyalty to Sargeras, ruler of the Legion, Azshara was irritated by the night elf army's continued opposition to the Legion, which divided the Legion's forces and delayed Sargeras from successfully entering Azeroth.\nEager to please his queen, Varo'then dispatched a soldier to the battlefront. The orc Broxigar spotted the assassin and tried to warn Kur'talos, but his warning came too late. The assassin stabbed Kur'talos through the back of the neck before attempting to flee. Broxigar swiftly caught up to the assassin and slew him in turn.\nLord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt;, who had been Kur'talos' second-in-command, succeeded Kur'talos as commander of the night elf defenders.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/463.xml."}

An elderly &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;, he had practiced sorcery for a very long time, and he considered himself one of the foremost spellcasters of his order.\nInconceivable Misfortune.\nHe was one of the sorcerers dispatched to Black Rook Hold, the fortress of Lord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, in order to interrogate the prisoners &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Broxigar, and Rhonin. Malfurion told a wild-sounding story about how the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; were abusing the Well of Eternity. Like many lower-caste night elves, Latosius was willing to believe ill of the Highborne. Like most of night elf society, though, he did not regard Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; in the same negative light, despite the fact that she, too, belonged to the Highborne.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and its mortal allies managed to restrict access to the Well, the disruption brought an abrupt end to Latosius' magical interrogation of Malfurion. The Moon Guard tried repeatedly to restart the interrogation, but their spells failed without direct access to the Well's energies. Latosius was frightened and furious.\nA Valiant End.\nMessengers began arriving at Black Rook Hold with even worse news: demonic invaders were attacking Zin-Azshari. Kur'talos and his soldiers were convinced that the queen had become a prisoner in her own palace. They therefore set out for Zin-Azshari to free her and defeat the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Moon Guard's magical abilities were greatly diminished, Latosius and his comrades accompanied the army.\nThe war escalated, and as the highest-ranking sorcerer, Latosius assumed leadership of the Moon Guard and directed their efforts on the battlefield. However, several other defenders later remarked that Latosius seemed to focus too much on minor details rather than the bigger picture. Eventually the elderly sorcerer was caught off guard and killed by an eredar warlock's spell.\nRhonin avenged Latosius' death by killing the warlock responsible. By the time Rhonin had done so, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was already crossing the battlefield toward the remaining Moon Guard. Illidan, though not a member of their order, clearly had superior magical talent, and he proved much better than Latosius at coordinating the Moon Guard's efforts.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/464.xml."}
{"id": "324414", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=324414", "title": "The Warcraft Encyclopedia/Maiev Shadowsong", "text": "This article is a copy of \"The Warcraft Encyclopedia,\" an official article by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nMaiev Shadowsong belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; by the time the War of the Ancients broke out, and her brother, Jarod, had become a captain in the Guard of Suramar. The Shadowsong family was not of noble blood, and so both siblings had earned their positions through skill and hard work.\nThe Fortunes of War.\nLeading the other priestesses into battle, High Priestess &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Dejahna\"&gt;Dejahna&lt;/a&gt; was mortally wounded, and she named &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; as her successor. As one of the senior members of the order, Maiev was bitterly disappointed. Tyrande, who was only a novice at the time, had clearly been gifted with exceptional healing abilities by &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. However, Tyrande lacked Maiev's experience and, in Maiev's opinion, spent too much time meditating on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Gods\"&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt;' loving and peaceful aspects.\nIn a time of war, Maiev felt that Tyrande would have made a far better medic than a leader. Nevertheless, Maiev grudgingly acknowledged the new high priestess and followed her orders.\nNor was this to be Maiev's only surprise during the war. Throughout the course of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' fight against the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, her brother Jarod was unexpectedly catapulted into prominence. When Lord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the night elf defenders, was assassinated, Jarod soon stepped into the breach and displayed an intuitive grasp of tactics. The relieved nobles swiftly made Jarod their new commander, to Maiev's poorly concealed amazement.\nBy the end of the war, Jarod had acquitted himself with honor. Even Maiev, who had been highly critical of her brother in the past, could not deny his heroism. She was furious when she discovered that &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had attacked and injured her brother. Jarod had been leading a scouting party on Mount Hyjal, and they had caught Illidan in the process of creating a second Well of Eternity. Shortly thereafter &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; arrived and captured his twin, putting an end to the combat.\nEnraged, Maiev drew her weapon and went to kill the captive Illidan, but Tyrande stopped her and reminded her that Jarod still lived. Jarod gave Malfurion the right to decide Illidan's fate, and so it was Malfurion who sentenced Illidan to imprisonment.\nFormation of the Watchers.\nAlthough she deeply respected Malfurion, his merciful decision hardly satisfied Maiev. She offered to watch over Illidan, whose attack on his fellow night elves had been the last straw. Most night elves now recognized him as both reckless and powerful. They had not forgotten that he had chosen to serve Sargeras, and they did not believe him when he swore he had done so only to gain sufficient power to defeat the Legion.\nMalfurion agreed that the night elves dared not leave Illidan unguarded in the long term, and so he asked Maiev to gather additional volunteers from the Sisterhood of Elune. Together, Maiev and the other priestesses would guard Illidan and prevent him from escape. Maiev obeyed and established a new organization that became known as the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;\". As the group's leader, Maiev was given the rank of warden, which she later awarded to a select few who had proven their exceptional fighting abilities, tracking skills, and tenacity.\nWhen Jarod disappeared one night, Maiev was surprised and grieved that he had not spoken to her of his impending departure. In his absence, the Watchers became Maiev's sole companionship. As the years stretched into centuries and then millennia, she came to see the Watchers as her family.\nIllidan's Escape.\nSince Illidan's incarceration, the Watchers' primary mission remained their vigil over him. However, the Watchers' duties widened somewhat over time and began to include the capture, imprisonment, and--where necessary--the recapture of all dangerous criminals. These new tasks occasionally took a Watcher far abroad, where she would remain until she tracked down and captured the criminal.\nShortly before the Third War broke out, Maiev departed the barrow prisons in order to accomplish one such mission. She returned to find Illidan missing and a number of Watchers slain. Subsequent investigation led to a shocking conclusion: Tyrande and her &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; had attacked the Watchers and freed Illidan. Even worse, Illidan had turned into a &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, confirming Maiev's worst fears.\nFilled with fury, Maiev gathered what she could of the remaining Watchers and began to track Illidan down. They pursued him through Ashenvale Forest and over the sea to the Broken Isles, then at last caught up with him in the Tomb of Sargeras. By the time they confronted Illidan, however, he had already retrieved a magical artifact: the Eye of Sargeras.\nIllidan had not forgotten his long imprisonment. On the contrary, instead of learning from his punishment, Illidan had come to hate Maiev for enforcing his sentence. He used the power of the Eye to collapse that section of the tomb, flooding the area with water and trapping the Watchers. Maiev alone managed to escape, and she swore that she would avenge her murdered sisters. In one fell swoop, Illidan had wiped out almost all of Maiev's sisters in justice. Staggering back into her small base camp, Maiev dispatched a runner to Malfurion, warning him that Illidan was free again and carrying out dangerous magic.\nForced Cooperation.\nMalfurion and Tyrande immediately hastened to the Broken Isles and helped Maiev fight off Illidan's &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; minions, but Illidan managed to escape to Lordaeron. Although Maiev was grateful for the rescue, she blamed Tyrande for Illidan's escape and his slaughter of the Watchers.\nWhile Malfurion went to commune with the land and discover his brother's whereabouts, Maiev and Tyrande continued the search for Illidan and encountered Prince &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. The prince was leading a large group of his people to safety. Maiev and Tyrande agreed to accompany Kael'thas and guard his people from Scourge attack. In return, the prince and his &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; said they would help locate Illidan.\nScourge forces ambushed the party at the Arevass River. Arrogantly certain that Elune would protect her, Tyrande stood her ground on the bridge and cast a destructive spell on the undead while the blood elves retreated. Then the bridge gave way, and Tyrande was swept into the river and out of sight.\nWith Illidan still on the loose, Maiev refused to spend precious time tracking down the high priestess. Instead, with the blood elves' help, Maiev continued her search for Illidan. Eventually she and the blood elves met up with Malfurion.\nThe Means to an End.\nMalfurion's love for Tyrande was well known and had lasted for thousands of years. Despite his wisdom, in which Maiev had no doubt, she knew that telling Malfurion the truth would lead to a further waste of time. He would opt to try rescuing his treacherous mate, who might already be dead, rather than pursue Illidan, who was clearly a terrible threat to the entire world.\nAccordingly, Maiev told Malfurion that Tyrande had been killed by the Scourge. She blamed Illidan for Tyrande's death. To Maiev's relief, the prospect of revenge sufficed to motivate the grieving Malfurion, just as it kept Maiev herself going. Illidan would pay for all the deaths he had caused.\nNot too much later, Maiev, Malfurion, and the blood elves managed to corner Illidan. Illidan and the naga were channeling a spell through the Eye of Sargeras, a spell whose raw power threatened to tear the planet apart. When the spell was interrupted, Illidan began his usual protests of innocence and self-justification, but Maiev would hear none of it. She sentenced him to death on the spot and went to carry out the sentence.\nUnfortunately the truth about Tyrande's fate came to light just then, and Illidan was damnably quick to offer his assistance in rescuing Tyrande. Unable to refuse the help he might get from the naga and their evil master, Malfurion turned all his fear and rage on Maiev instead of Illidan. He called roots out of the ground to hold her fast while he and Illidan departed to seek out Tyrande.\nMercy or Justice.\nFreeing herself from the grasping plants and gathering her few remaining soldiers took Maiev long enough that Illidan succeeded in saving the high priestess. By the time Maiev caught up with the demon, Malfurion and Tyrande were bidding him a farewell that sounded almost fond.\nThey were letting him go.\nHe was a demon who had murdered countless innocents, spread corruption and madness among the beasts of the forest, and nearly caused irreparable harm to &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Jarod had given Malfurion the responsibility to determine Illidan's fate, but Malfurion was letting the demon go because Illidan had saved Tyrande's life.\nEvidently Malfurion felt that Illidan had been washed clean of the all the blood he had spilled. Maiev disagreed. The Watchers were gone, betrayed by their own government. If that government would not at least avenge their deaths, then by Elune, Maiev would see it done herself.\nThus, when Illidan suddenly opened a portal and stepped through it, Maiev and her soldiers followed him without a second thought. She knew that Illidan placed great value on his life and would never deliberately endanger it.\nNo Mercy, No Surrender.\nEmerging from the portal, Maiev and her soldiers found themselves on the shattered planet of Outland. They soon discovered that Illidan had come alone, leaving his naga servants on Azeroth. Greatly outnumbered, Illidan discovered that his evil powers were of little use against cold steel, and his recapture proved to be fairly easy.\nToo easy. Maiev was bringing the caged demon back to her base when she was attacked. The naga had arrived on Outland, and they had brought new allies: the same blood elves that Maiev had helped escape the Scourge earlier. Maiev and her soldiers fought the naga and their traitorous elven friends, but the new army outnumbered hers, and eventually she was defeated. The naga and blood elves recaptured Illidan and freed him.\nIllidan and his allies have had little or no communication with the living denizens of Azeroth since that time. His brief return to Azeroth and his defeat by Arthas Menethil are, of course, public knowledge, but Maiev's ultimate fate has remained a matter of conjecture. Neither she nor any of her followers have been sighted on Azeroth since they followed Illidan to Outland. Given her unrelenting hate for Illidan, his continued good health is obviously a very bad sign. She is presumed dead, slain during her pursuit of vengeance.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

One day Malfurion came across several legends that referenced a reclusive &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; of the forests. Malfurion had always had great reverence for the natural world, although the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; as a race had long since abandoned any interest in such matters. He shared the legends of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; with Illidan and Tyrande. The three night elves decided that it would be an exciting adventure to search for the demigod, though in truth they no more believed in Cenarius than the rest of their people did.\nIt wasn't long before scattered plants and animals of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; brought tidings of these night elves to Cenarius. Surprised and intrigued, Cenarius located the night elves and looked into their hearts. He saw great promise in Malfurion, a promise that made up Cenarius' mind.\nThe laughing trio was shocked into silence when Cenarius stepped out of a shadowed thicket. He introduced himself and offered to teach them the druidic arts. They accepted eagerly. Malfurion proved a quick and talented student, but his brother was clumsy and quickly grew impatient. For her part, Tyrande was already a novice in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and so had dedicated herself to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Gods\"&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt; above all others. Malfurion alone would go on to become a &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion of the Burning Legion.\nMalfurion made significant progress in his studies before he was assailed by a disturbing vision: the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; were abusing the Well of Eternity's magics. The vision gave him the strong conviction that Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her high-ranking spellcasters would bring about a catastrophe unless someone intervened. The night elf brought his concerns to Cenarius, who was greatly worried.\nEven so, the night elves realized what was happening too late. &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt; poured out of the royal palace and began to slaughter everything in their path. The War of the Ancients had begun.\nIllidan was quickly given increased responsibilities due to his mastery of arcane magic. Even so he seemed increasingly moody and discontent as the war progressed. One day he abruptly left the night elf host and allied himself with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He would later rejoin the night elf defenders, claiming that double-crossing the Legion had been his plan all along. Still, Malfurion and many other night elves would forever afterward doubt his loyalties.\nIn the meantime, Cenarius taught Malfurion all he could of the druidic arts and then departed to seek out the other demigods of Azeroth. He argued that they had a responsibility to save Azeroth from the Legion, but the demigods were unaccustomed to the idea of working together. As a result, it took no little persuasion from Cenarius before they finally rode to the battlefront.\nA Father's Sacrifice.\nThe leader of the night elf army, Captain &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, readily accepted the demigods' offer of assistance, and the tide of battle seemed to shift. Reacting to the new and powerful threat, the vast demonic army refocused its attacks, and soon the mighty demigods were overwhelmed. Cenarius was badly wounded by the time &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; charged up and drove back his son's attackers with a few sweeps of his massive antlers.\nThe night elves scrambled into action, pulling the unconscious Cenarius to safety. Malorne easily held the demons off for a time. Then Archimonde came forth and engaged the giant stag in single combat, ultimately snapping Malorne's neck. Malfurion was furious and grieved; he called roots out of the ground to attack the demon lord. As the plants tightened their stranglehold on the demon's massive form, Archimonde was forced to teleport away in order to escape.\nThe Betrayer.\nYsera's dragonflight helped Cenarius enter the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, where the green dragons ministered to his injuries. In the meantime, the night elves kept fighting. Malfurion played a key role in closing the portal that the Highborne had opened over the Well of Eternity, thereby thwarting Sargeras, the dark titan, in his attempt to enter Azeroth.\nThe Well's magics had been badly abused during the war, and the portal's closure proved too great a strain. The Well imploded, triggering the Great Sundering. Ancient Kalimdor split apart into several landmasses, and a new ocean was born. Its cold waters chased the surviving night elves and their allies all the way to Mount Hyjal before finally subsiding.\nThe weary refugees rested and tended to their wounds. Only Illidan set out immediately to scout the area, and he promptly located a lake and transformed it into a second Well of Eternity. A small group of night elves caught him in the act, and he attacked them. Fortunately Malfurion arrived only moments later and captured his brother.\nIllidan predicted that one day the demons would return to Azeroth, and he claimed that arcane magic was the only effective tool against them. Yet Malfurion feared that Illidan's so-called altruism actually masked his true motive: Illidan hungered for magic and gave little thought to the cost. Jarod left Illidan's punishment to Malfurion, who felt it would be the height of folly to leave Illidan free to continue his reckless pursuit of power. Thus, with Cenarius' help, Malfurion sealed Illidan within a vast underground barrow prison, there to remain chained and powerless until the end of time.\nSeclusion of the Night Elves.\nThe dragons learned of the second Well and grew a massive tree atop it in order to keep its power from being abused. This World Tree prevented the Well from becoming any stronger, and it gave the night elves a number of gifts, including continued &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt;. It also linked the Well to the Emerald Dream, whose tempering influence were intended to protect the Well's powers from being abused, and prevent the Well from growing any more powerful.\nWith the war over, Tyrande and Malfurion reached an understanding. Their deep love for one another gave them solace throughout the long process of restoring order to the devastated night elf populace. Tyrande, now high priestess of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and Malfurion's mate, implemented sweeping changes throughout night elf society. She organized a new all-female army, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, and decreed that it would be directed by the Sisterhood of Elune. Nobility and sorcery were now considered the relics of a decadent and shameful past.\nNevertheless, the Highborne refused to give up practicing arcane magic. After discussing the matter at length, Tyrande and Malfurion made the difficult decision to exile their defiant kin. In the wake of the Highborne's departure, the remaining night elves deliberately withdrew from the rest of the world. A veil of mist descended upon their entire continent, shrouding its presence from passing sailors.\nMeanwhile, Cenarius went to dwell nearby in the Moonglade of Mount Hyjal, and Malfurion continued to study under the demigod's tutelage. A number of night elf men joined Malfurion in studying the druidic arts, many of them former members of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion began teaching them, and he eventually established the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth's druidic organization. He was soon given the rank of archdruid due to his great knowledge and power, and the group chose him to be their leader. The druids spent much of their time walking the wilds of Azeroth, meditating in the Emerald Dream, and trying to heal the damage that the war had caused.\nNew Races Arrive in Kalimdor.\nTime passed, and a new race had arrived on Azeroth: the orcs, who originated on the planet Draenor. Under the influence of demons, the orcs had changed from a peaceful shamanic society into the bloodthirsty Horde. They waged war upon the humans of the Eastern Kingdoms and killed countless other creatures during the First and Second Wars. Yet Cenarius and the night elves did not emerge from their seclusion, for they knew nothing of any events that occurred outside Kalimdor.\nThe Second War ended badly for the orcs, and the Horde was shattered. Just before the Third War, a new orc warchief emerged: Thrall, who reformed the Horde and led his people across the sea to establish their own homeland on Kalimdor. This new Horde had no desire for further warfare; the orcs simply wanted to leave the human lands behind and find a place to call their own.\nA Demigod Slain.\nThe orcs did not receive a warm welcome on Kalimdor. The night elves dispatched a number of scouts posthaste, and the scouts returned with frightening stories of the orcs' past atrocities during the First and Second Wars. In the meantime, the orcs chopped down a great many trees in Kalimdor, clearly intending to establish a settlement. Cenarius became certain that the orcs had returned to their warlike ways. He called an army of treants out of the forests, and he led the night elves and the treants against a large group of the orcish intruders.\nThe newborn Horde would surely have been crushed, save for the fact that several agents of the Burning Legion had recently arrived on Azeroth. The Legion had not forgotten the might of Cenarius, and they were determined to see him defeated. At the dreadlord Tichondrius' suggestion, the pit lord Mannoroth spilled his blood into a pool of water, and the resulting corruption was soon detected by the Horde's troll witch doctors.\nLed by Grom Hellscream, the orcs drank of the pool's tainted waters and reveled in the return of their demon-granted power. Overcome with supernatural hate and rage, Grom and his warriors succeeded in killing Cenarius. With the demigod dead, they went on to corrupt the ancient forests.\nAwakening of the Druids.\nLady Jaina Proudmoore helped Thrall bring Grom back to his senses, and Grom killed Mannoroth, freeing the orcs from their demonic curse. Nonetheless, the damage had been done, and the corruption was spreading. The Legion began invading the forests in greater numbers, and soon Tyrande and her Sentinels encountered the marauding demons.\nThe return of the Burning Legion was the night elves' worst fear. Tyrande and her warriors knew they would need all the help they could get to defeat the demonic army. The women fought their way to the Horn of Cenarius, and Tyrande used it to wake Malfurion from hibernation. He had been walking the Dream for a thousand years.\nMalfurion and Tyrande entered the barrow dens in search of further druids who needed awakening. In the process, they happened upon the door to Illidan's prison. Tyrande said that surely Illidan's long imprisonment had been more than adequate punishment for his past deeds. Moreover, she argued that Illidan's abilities were being wasted in prison when he could be helping fight the Burning Legion, as he had so long ago.\nRise of a Dark Power.\nAlthough Malfurion tried to dissuade her, Tyrande entered the prison and freed Illidan. Unhappy with her decision but unable to stop her, Malfurion went on to wake the rest of the sleeping druids, and then he met up with Tyrande. She told him that Illidan had agreed to help fight the Legion. With deep misgivings, Malfurion followed her to the forests of Felwood, where she had left his twin.\nIllidan had not been idle in Tyrande's absence. He had stolen a magical artifact that the Legion had been using to corrupt Felwood: the Skull of Gul'dan. Rather than simply destroy the skull, Illidan had consumed its power, which instantly transformed him into a demon. He had then used his newfound might to destroy the dreadlord Tichondrius.\nWhen Malfurion and Tyrande arrived, Illidan explained that the forests would heal now that the skull had been destroyed. The demon's weak attempt at self-justification did not deceive either of the horrified night elves. Malfurion, who still bore the responsibility of determining Illidan's punishment, disavowed all kinship with the demon and sentenced him to exile from all night elf lands.\nThe Battle of Mount Hyjal.\nJourneying to Mount Hyjal, the night elves joined forces with Jaina Proudmoore's army and Thrall's Horde. Together the three armies delayed the demon lord Archimonde long enough for Malfurion and the other druids to lay a trap. When Archimonde at last reached the tree and the Well of Eternity it protected, the druids empowered the World Tree with the night elves' immortality and the energies of countless night elf spirits.\nThe tree gave off a massive burst of energy that killed Archimonde instantly. Without their commander, the Burning Legion forces remaining on Azeroth crumbled under the combined might of the Horde, human, and night elf armies.\nPursuit of Justice.\nThe night elves' sacrifice had saved Azeroth, but it had left them mortal. Nevertheless, Warden &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; remained determined to recapture her former prisoner, Illidan, or die trying. She took most of the other &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; with her on her quest, and the group pursued Illidan into the Tomb of Sargeras.\nThe vengeful demon had not forgotten his former jailors. Having acquired the Eye of Sargeras, he turned its destructive power on the tomb's stone walls. The Watchers were trapped in one section of the tomb, with seawater beginning to flood the area. Only Maiev managed to escape and make it back to her base camp. She sent a messenger to Malfurion to ask for help and warn him about Illidan's activities.\nMalfurion and Tyrande both came to Maiev's rescue, and then Malfurion left the two women alone so that he could commune with the troubled land. He was angry and bewildered to find that Illidan and a group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; were channeling a spell that was tearing Northrend apart. Emerging from the forest, he went to warn the other night elves of this calamitous news.\nBrothers Reunited.\nTo Malfurion's anguish, Maiev said that Tyrande had been killed while escorting Prince &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; to safety. She added that Tyrande wouldn't have been in this dangerous situation in the first place if not for Illidan. The reminder filled Malfurion with fury, and he, Maiev, and the blood elves tracked down Illidan and put an end to his dangerous spell.\nIt was then that Malfurion learned two crucial facts. First, Illidan had been trying to defeat a shared enemy: the Lich King. Second, Maiev had lied. Tyrande was likely still alive and, if so, surely in desperate need of aid.\nIllidan volunteered to find and rescue Tyrande. After some argument, Malfurion conceded that the naga would be far quicker to reach Tyrande, given the fact that she had been swept down the River Arevass. Then too, it was obvious that despite having become a demon, Illidan still loved Tyrande.\nWhen Illidan returned from his mission with Tyrande alive and well, Malfurion was overjoyed. Illidan had caused a great deal of destruction and suffering, but his rescue of Tyrande made it impossible for Malfurion to return his brother to prison or sentence him to death. Hence, Malfurion chose to let Illidan go free, though Malfurion warned the demon never to threaten the night elves again.\nIllidan opened a portal to Outland, and Maiev arrived just as Illidan departed. Without hesitation, Maiev and her ragged band of followers entered the portal as well. Malfurion was left to pray that in her fanatical pursuit of Illidan, Maiev would not cause more havoc than the demon himself.\nA New World Tree.\nClaiming that the night elves' immortality could be restored, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; recently proposed growing a second World Tree, though the dragons had refused to assist in the process. Malfurion flatly refused; he argued that without the blessing of the dragonflights, the tree would be an abomination.\nWhen Malfurion fell into a mysterious coma, Fandral became the new leader of the druids. His first act was to persuade the rest of the Cenarion Circle to grow the second World Tree, which they named Teldrassil. Contrary to Fandral's hopes, though, the new World Tree has not restored the night elves' immortality.\nDream Without End.\nThe cause of Malfurion's condition has yet to be determined. Tyrande was the one who discovered his comatose body in his barrow den in the Moonglade. Deeply concerned, she sent for the Cenarion Circle and for several other Sisters of Elune. The druids informed her that Malfurion was last known to be meditating, and that there was no sign that intruders had violated the Moonglade.\nUpon further investigation, the druids remained baffled. Malfurion's dreamform had somehow become separated from his body. The Cenarion Circle has repeatedly tried and failed to call his spirit back to his physical form. The Circle has also attempted to contact him in the Emerald Dream to no avail. At last the druids appealed to Ysera, but even she could not find Malfurion. It seems clear that he is lost in the Emerald Dream.\nThe Sisters of Elune could not lend any further information about Malfurion's condition or a possible remedy for it. They could only determine that his body was perfectly healthy. All they have been able to do for him is place enchantments on his body to keep it in good health while he is comatose.\nThe Cenarion Circle has decided that it would be best to leave Malfurion's body where it was found, in his barrow den in the Moonglade. The general consensus is that Malfurion's spirit has the best chance of locating his body if the body is not moved. Also, of course, the Moonglade is somewhat more conducive to druidic magic than a large city like Darnassus.\nAs ruler of the night elves, Tyrande spends most of her time in Darnassus. Nevertheless, she secretly visits the Moonglade from time to time in order to check on Malfurion. The Cenarion Circle and several priestesses of Elune are tending to his body, but his condition has shown no signs of improvement. For the most part Malfurion's mysterious ailment has been kept a secret, except for the highest-ranking members of the Sisters of Elune and of the Cenarion Circle. Nevertheless, there has been a great deal of speculation regarding his noticeable absence from the public eye.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/474.xml."}

He and the moon &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Gods\"&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; were the parents of the demigod &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. The tauren have a myth that purportedly relates the story of Cenarius' conception.\nBecause Ysera the Dreamer agreed to act as Cenarius' foster mother, she has often been mistaken for the demigod's true mother. As a result, there are also rumors that she and Malorne had a romantic relationship. However, such rumors are baseless, though Ysera had a deep affection and respect for the demigod. He was one of nature's mightiest champions and a frequent visitor to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nPowers of the Wild.\nIndeed, Malorne possessed a strong link to the Dream that was similar to that of a green dragon. He, too, had dreamsight, and so simultaneously perceived both the Dream and the current state of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalorne also possessed healing powers, along with a calming aura that sometimes stopped battles before they began. Furthermore, he was one of the first living beings in the world. By the time of his death, he had become one of Azeroth's most beloved and powerful demigods, and he was renowned for his wisdom.\nRumor has it that a group known as the Druids of the Antler once existed: a collection of people who sought to emulate Malorne and recreate his powers on Azeroth. If &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Druid\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; as a whole are wary of detection, though, this small subgroup, if it exists, has proven even more elusive. No solid evidence of these particular druids has ever been found.\nA Valiant End.\nYet memory is fickle, even for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, some of whom witnessed Malorne's heroic death. In the ensuing millennia, most of Azeroth's denizens have forgotten Malorne. Almost all of those who do remember the tale are druids.\nDuring the War of the Ancients, Cenarius appealed to Malorne and the other demigods of Azeroth to join the battle against the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After much debate, Cenarius persuaded them to unite under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, who was leading a large army of night elves and other creatures against the Legion. When Cenarius was badly wounded in battle, Malorne charged at the attacking &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; and held them back while the night elves dragged his unconscious son to safety.\nIrritated at losing his chosen prey, Archimonde emerged from the demonic host and challenged Malorne to single combat. The other demons cheered Archimonde on, and the White Stag stubbornly fought with all his might. Even so, ultimately Archimonde snapped the heroic demigod's neck.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Moreover, sorcerers who sought to join the Moon Guard were required to demonstrate considerable talent in wielding arcane magic. After the Great Sundering, the night elves dissolved all organizations that made use of such magic, including the Moon Guard.\nHistory and Organization.\nIn ancient times, the rise of magic in night elf society brought with it a variety of new abilities and concerns. Given the power of the Well, it seemed obvious that combat skill alone would not suffice to counteract magical attack. Only a few scattered soldiers were found to possess magical skills, and such abilities were minor at best.\nThus, a number of magic-based fighting organizations sprang up, each of them meant to defend a critical population center. Spellcasters of sufficient strength and ambition sought out the capital city of the night elf civilization, hoping to earn favor with some heroic deed. Eventually this particular group gained the monarchy's official sanction, and they were named the Moon Guard. Loyal only to the ruler of the night elves, the Moon Guard soon regarded other spellcasters with disdain and expected them by default to possess inferior magical ability.\nTheir arrogance received a sharp blow during the War of the Ancients. When the Well of Eternity imploded, the Moon Guard lost the greatest part of its power. In addition, the war and its catastrophic consequences led to widespread condemnation of arcane magic. Thus, the organization was disbanded, and its surviving members renounced the sorcery that had once been their primary purpose.\nSome of them turned instead to &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Druid\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to redress the imbalance their magic had caused. These former sorcerers consequently became some of the first students of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the druidic arts were long viewed as a man's purview.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/481.xml."}

The article is no longer present on the \"World of Warcraft\" site, but can be accessed via archive. See &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nSingular form: naga\nPrimary language: Nazja\nBefore the Great Sundering, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; were the highest-ranking caste of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; nobility. These privileged nobles became obsessed with the Well of Eternity and abused its magics until their activities caught the attention of Sargeras, the dark titan. He promised the Highborne that he would remake the planet &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into a paradise, and that they would be rewarded with great power for serving him.\nFor a time he held the Highborne enthralled and obedient to his wishes. At Sargeras' command, the Highborne created a portal in the Well in the hope that Sargeras would be able to enter Azeroth himself. Such was his might that Azeroth would surely have been consumed, like countless other worlds, had his plan succeeded.\nThe Highborne's efforts brought about the first invasion of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but the ensuing War of the Ancients seemed to do the opposite of what Sargeras had promised. &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt; poured from the queen's jeweled palace and laid waste to most of the city. Death and devastation followed the demonic army as it spread outward. At last a large group of Highborne rebelled and fled the palace, rejoining the night elf host. These rebellious Highborne would later become the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/High%20Elves\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nBirth of the Naga.\nThe remaining Highborne stayed loyal to Sargeras throughout the war, but their hard work came to naught. The other night elves, together with many unlikely allies, put up a surprising defense and managed to close the portal. This added magical stress was too great for the Well of Eternity, which imploded with disastrous consequences. As if struck by a giant hammer, the Well was driven downwards by the impact.\nThe impact shattered the ancient continent of Kalimdor into several landmasses, and a new ocean was born. Much of Zin-Azshari, former capital city of the night elves, was driven beneath the sea. Above the waves, a fierce magical storm now rages: the Maelstrom. Beneath the Maelstrom, the ocean has been whipped into an enormous whirlpool. Once caught in the whirlpool's currents, most creatures have no chance of escaping.\nQueen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s palace was also pulled underwater. In the process, some of the Highborne in the palace drowned, but many were instead cursed for their role in bringing about the War of the Ancients. Transformed into the monstrous naga, the former night elves found they were able to survive the ocean's depths. Even so, the naga knew they had little chance of reclaiming the lands that the Highborne had once dominated. Bitterly resentful at their enforced banishment to the sea, they resolved to bide their time until they could retake their rightful place in the surface world.\nAs it was driven downward into the sea, the Well of Eternity continued to collapse in on itself and was finally obliterated. Its violent destruction has left behind a deep trench on the ocean floor that reaches all the way to the planet's molten core. To this day that core remains exposed and heats the ocean's cold waters. The magical energies that still emanate from the trench have caused monstrous mutations in all nearby living things.\nAlliance With the Betrayer.\nRoughly ten thousand years later, shortly before the Third War, the naga began emerging from the ocean's depths. It was only then that the night elves and the rest of Azeroth learned what had become of the Highborne, who had been presumed dead.\nThe largest observed group of naga is currently under the command of the demon &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the Third War, he contacted a large group of naga and forged an alliance. Led by Lady &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, these naga still serve Illidan today in Outland. Furthermore, he has used Vashj and her brethren to recruit additional allies for him: Prince &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Abilities.\nIn general, naga are scaled humanoids with the lower bodies of large serpents. Naga can breathe water or air, and some naga have recently emerged from the ocean's depths. Yet most naga have continued to dwell in the ocean's depths, beneath the site of the original Well of Eternity. Thus, although the Well itself no longer exists, the naga have experienced a wide range of mutations due to the Well's residual energies.\nAs former Highborne, the naga's past abuse of the Well has not been without additional consequences. The Highborne were obsessed with the Well, and the naga have been exposed to the Well's residual magics for millennia. Consequently modern naga are addicted to magic.\nNaga tend to be long-lived, much like the night elves, blood elves, and high elves. Some naga have even gained &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; as part of their mutations. However, most immortal naga are women rather than men.\nNaga women are tall and slender, with fine scales and angular features, and often have at least four arms. For some reason naga women have proven better than naga men at maintaining pre-Sundering memories and personalities. As a result, naga women are intellectually and magically superior to their male counterparts, and naga society is matriarchal.\nBigger and physically stronger than naga women, naga men are relatively bestial in appearance. A male naga's head resembles that of a dragon, and he has a muscular humanoid torso. The scales that cover his body are larger and thicker than those that cover the body of a naga woman.\nReferences.\nThis article can be viewed on the Internet Archive's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070202023906/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nAlso known as: kaldorei\nSingular form: kaldorei, night elf\nPrimary language: &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;\nTen thousand years before the First War, the world of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; cradled only one massive continent: Kalimdor. At the dark continent's center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies. This lake came to be known as the Well of Eternity.\nDevelopment of the Kaldorei.\nIn time, a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids were drawn by the Well's strange energies and built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the tribe, making them strong, wise, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt;. Their skin turned various shades of violet, and they grew taller in stature. The tribe adopted the name kaldorei, which meant \"children of the stars\" in their native tongue.\nThe kaldorei, or night elves as they would later be known, worshipped &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Gods\"&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt; of the moon, and believed that she slept within the Well's shimmering depths during the daylight hours. The early night elf priests and seers studied the Well with great curiosity, and the ongoing research of the Well became a facet of night elf society.\nThe Well of Eternity also caused the night elves' eyes to glow with a silver or golden radiance. Their vision became preternaturally sensitive to light and motion. Contrary to what a casual observer might believe, night elf eyes still have pupils, just as the eyes of many other humanoid races do. These pupils can be difficult to discern, particularly under certain lighting or from certain angles.\nMore importantly, the night elves learned the art of spellcasting, using the energies of the Well of Eternity. The night elves' magic quickly allowed them to establish a strong empire. As the night elves claimed further territory, they came into conflict with the trolls in the area, who had long dominated much of ancient Kalimdor. Unable to master arcane magic quickly enough to counter the night elves' sudden and fierce attacks, the trolls were forced to retreat. Thus was born the long-standing feud between night elves and trolls, an enmity which persists to this day.\nNight Elves and Trolls.\nAre night elves descended from trolls? The night elf race was formed so long ago that no hard evidence has surfaced to answer this question, although it has been asked many times. All that is known for certain is that a tribe of nocturnal humanoids came to live on the shores of the first Well of Eternity, and the Well's cosmic energies changed them into the night elves we know today.\nCertainly many trolls do believe that the humanoids who developed into the night elf race were trolls. The theory does have some credibility, for there is at least a superficial physical resemblance between trolls and night elves. Furthermore, the troll race dominated much of ancient Kalimdor several millennia before the night elves came into power.\nNevertheless, many night elves find this theory preposterous and abhorrent. They are quick to point out that the first night elves began their rise to power by defeating a number of nearby troll tribes. As a consequence, the trolls came to fear and respect the might of their new rivals. The troll theory of night elf ancestry may have been a direct result of this early conflict. The trolls hated the night elves--a sentiment that persists to this day--and may have wished to marginalize the night elf race and its accomplishments. Also, attributing the night elf race with a troll heritage likely helped the trolls come to terms with their own shocking defeat.\nWithout additional data, there is little point in debating the merits of this controversial theory. No doubt it will remain a matter of contention for years to come.\nArcane Magic and Its Consequences.\nThe night elves studied the energies of the Well for over a thousand years before Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; came to the throne. By that time, one caste of night elf nobility had risen to prominence. Under Azshara's reign, members of that caste began calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;\"Highborne\"&lt;/a&gt;. The name pleased Azshara, for she too was a member of the highest caste, and she approved the term for official use.\nMany Highborne were obsessed with the Well, and with Azshara's approval, they devoted themselves to studying it day and night. Their reckless use of arcane magic eventually caught the attention of Sargeras, who easily corrupted the arrogant Highborne. Captivated by the dark titan, the Highborne helped the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invade Azeroth. Countless night elves and other creatures died during the resulting War of the Ancients. In the end, the remaining night elves managed to defeat the Legion with the help of many allies and several heroes, including High Priestess &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of the Highborne regretted their choice to aid the Legion and managed to escape the capital city, Zin-Azshari, before the Well of Eternity imploded and triggered the Great Sundering. Afterwards, arcane magic was outlawed on pain of death, but the Highborne arrogantly continued their dangerous sorcery. Rather than execute their defiant kindred, Tyrande and Malfurion sentenced the Highborne to exile. The exiles journeyed over the sea to Lordaeron, where they founded the kingdom of Quel'Thalas and began calling themselves &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/High%20Elves\"&gt;\"high elves\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nA New Beginning.\nMost of the remaining night elves had had enough of aristocracy and arcane magic. Such things were seen as relics of a decadent and shameful past. Even so, Illidan created a second Well of Eternity, for he did not believe that arcane magic was inherently dangerous. Most of the other night elves disagreed, however, and so Illidan was imprisoned. Three of the Dragon Aspects grew the first World Tree, Nordrassil, atop the Well so that the tree, which was linked to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, would act as a regulator on the Well's magics. Nordrassil also bestowed a number of gifts upon the night elves, including continued immortality.\nTyrande led the drive to reorganize night elf government. She believed that her order, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, had been too distant from the day-to-day affairs of their people. In her opinion, this distance had been partly to blame for the catastrophic war.\nThe Sisterhood was greatly revered for its combat and healing skills, and its members had trained as warriors and scholars for generations. Furthermore, the Sisterhood was one of the few sizeable night elf groups to survive the war. Better yet, membership and rank among the Sisterhood had never been based upon family bloodlines.\nInevitably Tyrande decided that her order should take on greater societal responsibilities. Never again would the Sisters of Elune fail in their duty to guide their people. Disbanding the former night elf army, most of which had been based on lineage rather than ability, Tyrande organized a new army called the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. This army is still directed by the Sisters of Elune, and thus Tyrande has been sole head of the night elf government throughout the ensuing millennia.\nMeanwhile, Tyrande's mate, Malfurion, taught the druidic arts to other night elves. This small group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Druid\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; dedicated themselves to preserving the balance of nature on Azeroth. Highly respected by the rest of night elf society, the druids are nevertheless outside of it, for they answer to no government. Today the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; welcomes members from a variety of different races, but the organization has no governmental authority over any of these races.\nThe Third War.\nAshamed of the catastrophe their people had brought to Azeroth, the night elves withdrew to their forests and remained isolated there for approximately ten thousand years. Then their solitude was shattered by the arrival of Warchief Thrall and the Horde, along with a large group of human refugees, led by Lady Jaina Proudmoore. Tyrande was infuriated by the intruders, who trespassed upon lands that had belonged to the night elves alone for millennia. The Horde in particular not only chopped down vast stretches of forest, but also slew the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyrande led the Sentinels into battle against the mortal invaders, only to discover that the Burning Legion had followed the invaders to Kalimdor. The Legion had launched a new invasion upon the world. The high priestess and her soldiers raced to waken all the druids slumbering in the Emerald Dream, including Malfurion.\nWith some encouragement from Medivh, the night elves saw the wisdom of uniting their forces with the humans and orcs. The three armies fought the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lord Archimonde and his minions as they advanced on the summit of Mount Hyjal and the Well of Eternity that Archimonde sought to plunder. Together the armies delayed the Legion until the night elves had empowered Nordrassil with the magic of their immortality and the energies of countless night elf spirits. Then the World Tree gave off a massive burst of energy that killed Archimonde instantly.\nWithout their commander, the Burning Legion crumbled and was defeated. Nordrassil and the second Well of Eternity still stand. The night elves' noble sacrifice has cost them their immortality. Under the leadership of Archdruid &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, the Cenarion Circle has grown a second World Tree, Teldrassil, in the hopes of restoring what the night elves have lost. Thus far, those hopes have proven fruitless. Currently the night elves are members of the Alliance.\nSilver Eyes, Golden Eyes.\nBefore the Sundering, golden eyes were extremely rare among the night elves. Golden eyes thus came to be regarded as a sign of future greatness. Both Queen Azshara and Illidan had these unusual eyes. Unfortunately the falsehood of this widespread belief was only to become clear after these two infamous individuals had reached their dark fates.\nIn truth, golden eyes were a sign of strong druidic potential. Little wonder that pre-Sundering night elves, with their emphasis on the arcane, did not understand the significance of these unusual eyes. Simply having this potential did not guarantee that the potential would be sensed or understood, much less wielded with skill and compassion. Despite his golden eyes, Illidan struggled with the druidic arts, though he, like Malfurion, was tutored by Cenarius.\nInnate druidic power does not necessarily lead to becoming a druid, and lacking that innate power does not preclude becoming a druid. Indeed, Malfurion was born with eyes that glowed silver, but he studied druidism, and his wholehearted dedication gave him a power and skill far beyond most druids. As he continued to use druidic magic, his eyes acquired the golden incandescence that had once been so coveted by other night elves.\nGolden eyes quickly became far more common. After the Sundering, night elves abandoned their former obsession with bloodlines, and so the number of night elves born with golden eyes increased significantly. In addition, the night elves resolved to be more respectful of Azeroth, and a number of night elf men followed in Malfurion's footsteps; these new druids eventually also had golden eyes.\nTraditionally night elf women served their people as warriors, hunters, and protectors. Many spellcasting vocations, on the other hand, were generally considered the realm of night elf men. Only since the devastating casualties of the Third War have these conventional gender roles been set aside. Because druids only recently opened their ranks to women, golden eyes remain somewhat more prevalent among night elf men than their female counterparts.\nElves in General.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and high elves are descended from night elves. Nevertheless, due to their shared history and philosophical differences, the three groups do not share a close relationship. Indeed, night elves regard &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/High%20Elves%20and%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;high elves and blood elves&lt;/a&gt; with suspicion, disgust, or outright hostility.\nNevertheless, night elves do share some characteristics with their high elf and blood elf brethren. All three groups have unusually acute senses and are able to see clearly even in low-light conditions. As a general rule, elves are also slim, athletic, and graceful. Furthermore, they all have large pointed ears that tend to be greeted with admiration or mockery by other races.\nOne similarity between night elves, high elves, and blood elves has only recently come about. The night elves sacrificed their immortality and much of their power at the end of the Third War. Thus, all elves are now mortal and have comparable lifespans that can extend as long as several thousand years.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/508.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/508.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Xavius was defeated and slain by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who subsequently destroyed the portal.\nThe First Satyr.\nSargeras, creator of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, was enraged by Xavius' failure and tortured his disembodied spirit for some time before deciding that Xavius might, after all, still prove useful. To that end, Sargeras created a new body for Xavius, who became the first satyr in existence. From the waist up, Xavius resembled his former &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; form, but his fingers now sported a set of sharp claws, and his head bore two horns. His goat-like lower body, however, had hooves and a long leonine tail.\nPleased with his creation, Sargeras sent Xavius back to Azeroth to further the Legion's ends. Xavius spread the demonic curse to other creatures--at first primarily other power-hungry &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; who lived in Zin-Azshari. Despite the fact that Malfurion ultimately destroyed Xavius again, satyrs worship Xavius to this day in the hope that he will again return to Azeroth and lead them.\nNor are the satyrs the only ones who invoke Xavius' name. Scattered individuals venerate Xavius because they hope to become satyrs themselves. Fortunately such practices are not widespread.\nDescription.\nAll satyrs have been transformed into their current shapes by inheriting the demonic curse that originated with Xavius. These &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; delight most in inflicting emotional and physical pain upon their enemies. Both spellcasters and non-spellcasters have joined the ranks of these bestial demons, who have increased physical strength and an incredible talent for manipulation.\nLike Xavius, all satyrs have the ability to pass their curse on, and they have gleefully done so. The curse has therefore continued to spread, although it has weakened over time, and so very few satyrs are still being created. New satyrs can only be created by preexisting satyrs.\nOver time the satyrs discovered that they could pass their curse on to races other than the night elves. Although most satyrs today are former night elves, satyrs have therefore also been created out of other races. According to scattered reports, there are both male and female satyrs; however, researchers have failed thus far to secure irrefutable evidence of female satyrs on Azeroth.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, the Third War resulted in so many casualties that the traditional gender roles of night elf society have been set aside in favor of more practical concerns. As a result, although the Sentinels are still primarily women, there are now also men among their ranks.\nHistory and Organization.\nBy the time of the Great Sundering, military service for the night elves had become more a matter of bloodline than ability. Almost all high-ranking officers were nobles, and the night elves had lived in peace for so long that very few of those officers, however privileged and well educated, possessed even a basic knowledge of tactics. Joining the army, once a selfless choice to defend the night elf people, had been reduced to a status symbol.\nThe War of the Ancients made the army's deterioration all too clear. After the night elves and their allies had achieved victory, High Priestess &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; decreed sweeping changes throughout night elf society. As part of these changes, Tyrande disbanded the old army, most of which had no desire for further battle, and established the Sentinels.\nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few major organizations to survive the war largely intact, and membership in its ranks had never been a matter of bloodline. Furthermore, members of the order had trained extensively in combat, tactics, and healing. Yet in spite of all their knowledge and experience, the priestesses had become somewhat distant from the rest of night elf society.\nTyrande believed that this distance was partly to blame for the cataclysmic war, and she resolved that her order would take up the duty of directing the Sentinels. Never again would the Sisters of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; fail to guide the night elf people. To this day Shandris still reports to Tyrande, who is both the high priestess of Elune and sole ruler of night elf government.\nBeliefs and Practices.\nThe Sentinels are courageous and selfless soldiers whose only goal for the last ten millennia has been to defend the night elf people. New recruits undergo extensive training, and as time permits, the more experienced warriors undergo frequent combat drills. The Third War resulted in many losses for the Sentinels, but the army still boasts a number of battle-hardened veterans.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, after the devastation of the Third War, traditional gender roles were discarded in favor of permitting night elves to choose the vocations they most desired. As a result, although a majority of Elune's priests are still women, the order now welcomes men into its ranks. Since the night elves emerged from their societal isolation, the priests of Elune have also extended membership to a few priests of other races.\nSimilarly the Sisters of Elune have on occasion admitted a priest from outside the night elf race. Yet there is a widespread belief to this day that the deepest mysteries of the changeable moon goddess can only be comprehended by other women. The Sisterhood has therefore remained exclusively female thus far.\nHistory and Organization.\nFor millennia, the priestesses of Elune were both spiritual leaders and powerful fighters for their society. When the night elves rode into battle, the Sisters of Elune fought side by side with the soldiers, singing to Elune and calling upon her power. Oftentimes the lunar goddess responded by visiting her wrath upon the night elves' enemies. It was even said that the priestesses could bring a semblance of the moon into the noonday sky, lending some of Elune's strength to the nocturnal night elves. After the battle was won, the priestesses prayed over the wounded and brought them healing.\nVictory at last brought peace to the night elves, and the Sisters of Elune were content to retreat somewhat from the public eye. As time passed, their combat skills became a distant memory. The priestesses could mend injuries if necessary, but with peace and &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt;, the Sisterhood's intervention was rarely necessary.\nThen the War of the Ancients broke out, and the Sisterhood rode into battle again. The extraordinary combat skills and healing abilities of Tyrande Whisperwind in particular reminded the night elves of what the order had once been--and had, in fact, never ceased to be. After the Great Sundering, Tyrande decreed sweeping changes throughout night elf society. As part of these changes, Tyrande disbanded the old army, most of which had no desire for further battle, and established the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sisterhood of Elune was one of the few major organizations to survive the war largely intact, and membership in its ranks had never been a matter of bloodline. Furthermore, members of the order had trained extensively in combat, tactics, and healing. Yet in spite of all their knowledge and experience, the priestesses had become somewhat aloof from the rest of night elf society.\nTyrande believed that this distance was partly to blame for the cataclysmic war, and she resolved that her order would take up the duty of directing the Sentinels. The high priestess of Elune became both the leader of the Sentinels and the head of night elf government. Never again would the Sisterhood fail to guide the night elf people.\nBeliefs and Practices.\nElune is a being of many different aspects, and so the Sisterhood must provide a wide and varied education. The goddess' teachings emphasize love and tolerance for all creatures of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Many initiates to the order find their faith tested and meditate regularly as they struggle to acknowledge and overcome their prejudices.\nEven so, Elune does not advocate pacifism at any cost. Indeed, novices in the Sisters of Elune are required to train extensively in tactics and combat, for such abilities are essential to military leadership.\nThe Sisterhood never quite approved of way in which higher-caste night elves made use of arcane magic, due to the magic's chaotic nature. Consequently novices must follow a rigorous course of study that delves into both history and spellcasting. The first Well of Eternity in particular was considered a potential source of danger. Indeed, long before the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s abuse of the Well's magic brought about disaster, the Well had become the subject of extensive discussion in the Sisterhood's classrooms.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml."}

Further Darnassian utterances may therefore have been preserved in modern Thalassian, in addition to those that are specified below.\nSo far, linguistic scholars have opted to err on the side of caution in documenting Darnassian terms and phrases that are also considered part of the Thalassian language. Certainly this issue, however delicate, merits further research. Nevertheless, addressing a high elf or blood elf with a Darnassian-specific word or phrase can be considered offensive or at the very least rather foolish, and so the speaker must handle the situation with care.\nReferences.\nThe information could be retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/576.xml."}

One day Malfurion came across several legends that referenced a reclusive demigod of the forests. Malfurion had always had great reverence for the natural world, although the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; as a race had long since abandoned any interest in such matters. He shared the legends of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; with Illidan and Tyrande. The three night elves decided that it would be an exciting adventure to search for the demigod, though in truth they no more believed in Cenarius than the rest of their people did.\nThe laughing trio was shocked into silence when Cenarius stepped out of a shadowed thicket and offered to teach them the druidic arts. They accepted eagerly. Malfurion proved a quick and talented student, but his brother was clumsy and quickly grew impatient. For her part, Tyrande was glad to learn what she could from Cenarius. Nonetheless, she was already a novice in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and so had dedicated herself to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Gods\"&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt; above all others. Malfurion alone would go on to become a &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion and War.\nMalfurion made significant progress in his studies before he was assailed by a disturbing vision. He watched helplessly as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; increasingly abused the Well of Eternity's magics. The vision gave him the strong conviction that Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her high-ranking spellcasters would cause a catastrophe unless someone intervened. The night elf brought his concerns to Cenarius, who was greatly worried.\nEven so, the night elves realized what was happening too late. &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt; poured out of the royal palace and began to slaughter everything in their path. The War of the Ancients had begun.\nIllidan became increasingly moody and bitter when he realized that Malfurion was his unwitting rival for Tyrande's heart. The priestess had always known that she would choose one of the twins for her mate, but she was taken aback when Illidan suddenly accused her of having already made her choice: Malfurion. In time she would realize that Illidan had been right.\nPrisoner of the Legion.\nAs the war progressed, a group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Satyrs\"&gt;satyrs&lt;/a&gt; led by Lord &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped the unconscious Tyrande from the battlefield and imprisoned her in the palace. The goddess &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; shielded Tyrande from harm, and so the demons were unable to torture the high priestess as they might have preferred. Mildly curious, Azshara and one of her handmaidens, Lady &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, paid Tyrande a visit. Perhaps Elune's obvious connection to Tyrande impressed the queen. For whatever reason, the queen idly offered to make Tyrande a handmaiden as well.\nTyrande politely refused and said that she was dedicated to Elune alone. The queen was annoyed and left shortly thereafter, but Vashj later returned and tried unsuccessfully to kill Tyrande. Vashj had become irrationally convinced that Tyrande was trying to replace Vashj in the queen's favor.\nFlight From Zin-Azshari.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, too, visited Tyrande's prison cell, and he began confiding in her. A large group of Highborne had become discontent. The Legion had assumed sole control over the Well of Eternity, and the Highborne were made to work day and night, neglecting food and rest in favor of summoning further demons into &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Their bargain with Sargeras had not paid off, and they were beginning to think that it never would.\nHope filled Tyrande, and she encouraged Dath'Remar as much as she dared. One night he came to her cell and revealed that the rebel Highborne planned to flee the palace. He offered to free her if she would speak to the rest of the night elves on behalf of these Highborne, who knew all too well that their brethren would regard them as traitors.\nShe agreed, for she felt that Dath'Remar and the rest of the rebels deserved a second chance. During their flight from the city, she was snatched up into the sky by an attacking doomguard. Rather than die without a fight, she slew him in mid-air and plummeted toward the ground, resigned to her death. A spell unexpectedly softened her fall: Illidan had saved her life.\nDeeper Peril.\nIllidan pulled Tyrande with him toward the Well of Eternity. He planned to cast a spell that would reverse the portal through which Sargeras was trying to reach Azeroth. Tyrande was not enthusiastic about the dangerous idea, but Illidan refused to listen to her concerns.\nMalfurion and many other heroes soon arrived and combined their efforts with those of Tyrande and Illidan. Together the night elves and their allies managed to close the portal. Unfortunately the Well's magics had been badly abused during the war, and the portal's closure proved too great a strain. The Well imploded, triggering the Great Sundering. Ancient Kalimdor split apart into several landmasses, and a new ocean was born. Its cold waters chased the surviving night elves and their allies all the way to Mount Hyjal before finally subsiding.\nThe reckless Illidan created a second Well of Eternity atop Mount Hyjal. The leader of the night elf army, Captain &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, granted Malfurion the right to determine Illidan's punishment. Malfurion dared not leave his twin free to continue his pursuit of power at any cost, and so Malfurion sentenced his brother to imprisonment for all eternity.\nSeclusion of the Night Elves.\nWith the war over, Tyrande and Malfurion reached an understanding. Their deep love for one another gave them solace throughout the long process of restoring order to the devastated night elf populace. Tyrande, now high priestess of Elune and Malfurion's mate, implemented sweeping changes throughout night elf society. She organized a new all-female army, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, and decreed that it would be directed by the Sisterhood of Elune. Nobility and sorcery were now considered the relics of a decadent and shameful past.\nNevertheless, the Highborne refused to give up practicing arcane magic. After discussing the matter at length, Tyrande and Malfurion made the difficult decision to exile their defiant kin. In the wake of the Highborne's departure, the remaining night elves deliberately withdrew from the rest of the world. A veil of mist descended upon their entire continent, shrouding its presence from passing sailors.\nMeanwhile, Cenarius went to dwell nearby in the Moonglade of Mount Hyjal. A number of night elf men joined Malfurion there and studied the druidic arts, many of them former members of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion eventually established and led the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth's druidic organization. He and the rest of his small group spent much of their time walking the wilds of Azeroth, trying to heal the damage that the war had left behind, and meditating in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Races Arrive in Kalimdor.\nTime passed, and a new race arrived on Azeroth: the orcs, who originated on the planet Draenor. Under the influence of demons, the orcs had changed from a peaceful shamanic society into the bloodthirsty Horde. They waged war upon the humans of the Eastern Kingdoms and killed countless other creatures during the First and Second Wars. Yet Cenarius and the night elves did not emerge from their seclusion, for they knew nothing of any events that occurred outside Kalimdor.\nThe Second War ended badly for the orcs, and the Horde was shattered. Just before the Third War, a new orc warchief emerged: Thrall, who reformed the Horde and led his people across the sea to establish their own homeland on Kalimdor. This new Horde had no desire for further warfare; the orcs simply wanted to leave the human lands behind and find a place to call their own.\nA Demigod Slain.\nThe orcs did not receive a warm welcome on Kalimdor. The night elves dispatched a number of scouts posthaste, and the scouts returned with frightening stories of the orcs' past atrocities during the First and Second Wars. In the meantime, the orcs chopped down a great many trees in Kalimdor, clearly intending to establish a settlement. Cenarius led an army of night elves and treants against a large group of the orcish intruders.\nThe newborn Horde would surely have been crushed, save for the fact that several agents of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had recently arrived on Azeroth. The Legion had not forgotten the might of Cenarius, and they were determined to see him defeated. At the dreadlord Tichondrius' suggestion, the pit lord Mannoroth spilled his blood into a pool of water, and the resulting corruption was soon detected by the Horde's troll witch doctors.\nLed by Grom Hellscream, the orcs drank of the pool's tainted waters and reveled in the return of their demon-granted power. Overcome with supernatural hate and rage, Grom and his warriors succeeded in killing Cenarius. With the demigod dead, they went on to corrupt the ancient forests.\nAwakening of the Druids.\nLady Jaina Proudmoore helped Thrall bring Grom back to his senses, and Grom killed Mannoroth, freeing the orcs from their demonic curse. Nonetheless, the damage had been done, and the corruption was spreading. The Legion began invading the forests in greater numbers, and soon Tyrande and her Sentinels encountered the marauding demons.\nThe return of the Burning Legion was the night elves' worst fear. Tyrande and her warriors knew they would need all the help they could get to defeat the demonic army. The women fought their way to the Horn of Cenarius, and Tyrande used it to wake Malfurion from hibernation. He had been walking the Dream for a thousand years.\nTyrande and Malfurion entered the barrow dens in search of further druids who needed awakening. In the process, they happened upon the door to Illidan's prison. Tyrande was saddened to realize that Malfurion's twin had been a prisoner for ten millennia. She said that surely his long imprisonment had been more than adequate punishment. Moreover, from a practical point of view, she felt Illidan's abilities were being wasted in prison when he could be helping fight the Burning Legion, as he had so long ago.\nA Chance at Redemption.\nMalfurion tried to forbid Tyrande from freeing Illidan, but the decision was hers alone to make, as sole leader of the night elf government. Thus, she led a group of Sentinels into the prison. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; would not surrender their prisoner without a fight, and so Tyrande and her soldiers slew the guards who barred the way to Illidan's cell. She told Illidan that his people needed him to help fight the Burning Legion again.\nIllidan agreed to join the fight against the Legion. However, he was clearly bitter about his long imprisonment. He told Tyrande that he fought not out of any lingering loyalty toward their people, but for her sake alone.\nFreed from his cell, he followed Tyrande upward into the corrupted forests of Felwood. Tyrande and her soldiers departed in search of Malfurion, who was awakening the last sleeping druids. She felt sure that once confronted with the reality of Illidan's freedom, she could convince her mate to give his twin another chance.\nRise of a Dark Power.\nTyrande met up with Malfurion, who had awakened the rest of the sleeping druids. She told him that Illidan had agreed to help fight the Legion. With deep misgivings, Malfurion followed her to Felwood.\nIllidan had not been idle in Tyrande's absence. He had stolen a magical artifact that the Legion had been using to corrupt Felwood: the Skull of Gul'dan. Rather than simply destroy the skull, Illidan had consumed its power, which instantly transformed him into a demon. He had then used his newfound might to destroy the dreadlord Tichondrius.\nWhen Malfurion and Tyrande arrived, Illidan explained that the forests would heal now that the skull had been destroyed. The demon's weak attempt at self-justification did not deceive either of the horrified night elves. Malfurion, who still bore the responsibility for Illidan's punishment, disavowed all kinship with the demon and sentenced him to exile from all night elf lands.\nThe Battle of Mount Hyjal.\nJourneying to Mount Hyjal, the night elves joined forces with Jaina Proudmoore's army and Thrall's Horde. Together the three armies delayed the demon lord Archimonde long enough for Malfurion and the other druids to lay a trap. When Archimonde at last reached the tree and the Well of Eternity it protected, the druids empowered the World Tree with the night elves' &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; and the energies of countless night elf spirits.\nThe tree gave off a massive burst of energy that killed Archimonde instantly. Without their commander, the Burning Legion forces remaining on Azeroth crumbled under the combined might of the Horde, human, and night elf armies.\nPursuit of Justice.\nThe night elves' sacrifice had saved Azeroth, but it had left them mortal. Nevertheless, Warden &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; remained determined to recapture her former prisoner, Illidan, or die trying. She took most of the other Watchers with her on her quest, and the group pursued Illidan into the Tomb of Sargeras.\nThe vengeful demon had not forgotten his former jailors. Having acquired the Eye of Sargeras, he turned its destructive power on the tomb's stone walls. The Watchers were trapped in one section of the tomb, with seawater beginning to flood the area. Only Maiev managed to escape and make it back to her base camp.\nTechnically the Watchers, as agents of the night elf government, fell under Tyrande's authority, but Maiev had come to hate Tyrande for freeing Illidan and killing a number of Watchers in the process. In addition, Malfurion had been the one to sentence Illidan to imprisonment, and so Maiev sent a messenger to ask Malfurion for help and warn him about Illidan's activities.\nDiplomacy.\nTyrande and Malfurion both came to Maiev's rescue, and then Malfurion left the two women alone so that he could commune with the troubled land. The women continued their search for Illidan and came across a band of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; led by Prince &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev demanded that the prince and his people help locate Illidan, but the prince pointed out that first he had to get his people to safety. Tyrande intervened and proposed that she and Maiev escort the blood elves over the River Arevass. In return, the blood elves could assist in the hunt for Illidan.\nThe prince agreed to Tyrande's proposal, but the Scourge attacked in force as the blood elves reached the river. Tyrande rode out onto the bridge and called on the wrath of Elune, hoping to stave off the undead attackers. For a time she succeeded, but then the bridge collapsed, and Tyrande was swept downriver. Later Tyrande would learn that Maiev never considered trying to rescue Tyrande. Instead, Maiev told Kael'thas that they needed to press on.\nMaiev's Betrayal.\nMalfurion emerged from the forest with the dire news that Illidan and a group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; were channeling a spell that was tearing Northrend apart. To his anguish, Maiev took him aside and explained that Tyrande had been killed while escorting the blood elves to safety. She added that Tyrande wouldn't have been in this dangerous situation in the first place if not for Illidan. The reminder filled Malfurion with fury, and he, Maiev, and the blood elves tracked down Illidan and put an end to his dangerous spell.\nIt was then that Malfurion learned two crucial facts. First, Illidan had been trying to defeat a shared enemy: the Lich King. Second, Maiev had lied. Tyrande was likely still alive and, if so, surely in desperate need of aid.\nIllidan volunteered to find and rescue Tyrande. After some argument, Malfurion conceded that the naga would be far quicker to reach Tyrande, given the fact that she had been swept down the River Arevass. Then too, it was obvious that despite having become a demon, Illidan still loved Tyrande.\nUnexpected Rescue.\nThe Scourge was harrying Tyrande and the small number of Sentinels who had jumped into the river after their mistress. Although the fight seemed hopeless, the women built a small camp and stood their ground. When Illidan and a group of naga appeared, Tyrande at first thought that he had come to kill her. What else, after all, could she expect of a demon?\nInstead, Illidan and his warriors fought the undead alongside the Sentinels. The combined forces battled their way free of the Scourge and rejoined Malfurion and the other night elves. Tyrande and Malfurion were overjoyed. Illidan had caused a great deal of destruction and suffering, but his help in saving Tyrande made it impossible for Malfurion to return his brother to prison or sentence him to death. Hence, Malfurion chose to let Illidan go free, though he warned the demon never to threaten the night elves again.\nIllidan opened a portal to Outland, and Maiev arrived just as Illidan departed. Tyrande tried to stop the angry warden, but it was no use. Without hesitation, Maiev and her ragged band of followers entered the portal as well.\nDream Without End.\nNot long ago, Tyrande discovered Malfurion's comatose body in his barrow den in the Moonglade. Deeply concerned, she sent for the Cenarion Circle and for several other Sisters of Elune. The druids informed her that Malfurion was last known to be meditating, and that there was no sign that intruders had violated the Moonglade.\nUpon further investigation, the druids remained baffled. Malfurion's dreamform had somehow become separated from his body. The Cenarion Circle has repeatedly tried and failed to call his spirit back to his physical form. The Circle has also attempted to contact him in the Emerald Dream to no avail. At last the druids appealed to Ysera, but even she could not find Malfurion. It seems clear that he is lost in the Emerald Dream.\nThe Sisters of Elune could not lend any further information about Malfurion's condition or a possible cure. They could only determine that his body was perfectly healthy. All they have been able to do for him is place enchantments on his body to keep it in good health while he is comatose.\nThe Cenarion Circle has decided that it would be best to leave Malfurion's body where it was found, in his barrow den in the Moonglade. The general consensus is that Malfurion's spirit has the best chance of locating his body if the body is not moved. Also, of course, the Moonglade is somewhat more conducive to druidic magic than a large city like Darnassus.\nAs ruler of the night elves, Tyrande spends most of her time in Darnassus, for she knows that her duty to the night elf people must come before the wishes of her heart. Nevertheless, she secretly visits the Moonglade from time to time in order to check on Malfurion. The Cenarion Circle and several priestesses of Elune are tending to his body, but his condition has shown no signs of improvement.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/598.xml."}

It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nAs one of the members of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Vashj considered it her birthright to serve Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Vashj copied the queen's hairstyle and clothing as much as possible. When the queen made Vashj her foremost handmaiden, remaining in the queen's favor became Vashj's sole concern.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the Highborne were contacted by the titan Sargeras, Azshara was enthralled by Sargeras' vast might. Like the queen, Vashj looked forward to his arrival on &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;; both women were certain that he would find Azshara irresistible.\nThe queen did indeed possess amazing charisma, and she doubtless enhanced it with magic. With a quiet word or a mere glance, Azshara could inspire any number of violent emotions; passion and rage were her favorite choices. Driven by sudden outbreaks of jealousy, her subjects occasionally squabbled over her affections and fought duels in the name of her honor. The queen was amused by such displays and did not always intervene to save the combatants from harm.\nIt was precisely this sort of possessive fury that affected Vashj when Azshara and her handmaidens paid a visit to High Priestess &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande had been captured by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned in the palace. On a whim, the queen offered to make Tyrande one of her handmaidens, but Tyrande politely declined, saying she was sworn to &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; before all others. Azshara was irritated by Tyrande's refusal, however diplomatic, and departed shortly thereafter.\nVashj could not forget the queen's offer so easily: the memory became a torment. Despite the fact that Tyrande had refused the queen, Vashj came to see the priestess as a rival for Azshara's affections. Irrationally certain that she had to act, Vashj tried to kill Tyrande, but failed. Vashj then fled the prison cell before her attempt on Tyrande's life could be discovered.\nCursed and Transformed.\nDespite the Highborne's attempts to aid the Legion in summoning Sargeras, the portal to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; was ultimately closed before Sargeras could reach Azeroth. The Well of Eternity was unable to withstand the added magical strain, and it began to collapse in on itself. Under the sudden impact, Zin-Azshari and the Well were blasted downward toward the ocean floor. The Well pierced the planet's molten core just before being utterly obliterated.\nAncient Kalimdor was split apart, and the seas rushed into to fill the voids between the new landmasses. Azshara, Vashj, and quite a few other Highborne were caught in the rushing waters. Instead of drowning, however, Vashj and many others were cursed and transformed into &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite her subsequent mutations, Vashj has managed to retain her memories and personality. She has also become &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Immortals\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt;, and she is not the only naga to receive this unexpected boon.\nServing the Betrayer.\nSeveral months after the Third War, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lord Kil'jaeden went to Outland and contacted &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Although Illidan had worked against the Legion's interests in the past, Kil'jaeden was willing to give Illidan another chance. If Illidan destroyed the Frozen Throne, Kil'jaeden promised to grant anything Illidan might desire.\nAccordingly, Illidan sought out new allies. He cast a powerful spell that reached the depths of the ocean, and a group of naga led by Lady Vashj responded. Vashj and many others remembered Illidan, who had become infamous before the Sundering. The naga respected his power, particularly now that Illidan had become a demon. They agreed to serve him.\nIllidan and the naga retrieved a magical artifact known as the Eye of Sargeras, and they channeled a destructive spell through the Eye in order to destroy the Frozen Throne. However, their attempt was thwarted, and Illidan made a hasty retreat to Outland in the hope of evading Kil'jaeden's wrath.\nFurther Allies.\nAt Illidan's direction, Lady Vashj and her naga sought out the Prince &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Blood%20Elves\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. The desperate prince at first hesitated to accept the naga's aid in fighting the Scourge, but practicality won out in the end. Then Kael'thas' human allies discovered the makeshift alliance, accused the blood elves of consorting with the enemy, and imprisoned them. Again Vashj and the naga came to the rescue and helped the blood elves escape the Dalaran dungeons.\nThe blood elves were suffering terribly from their hunger for magic by this time. Vashj explained that the naga, too, were addicted to magic, and she said that Illidan could help the blood elves. She then led them to the portal that Kel'Thuzad had opened during the Third War (so as to give Archimonde entry into Azeroth). With no other palatable choices, Kael'thas and his fighters followed Vashj to Outland. Together the blood elves and naga freed Illidan from Warden &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nKael'thas swore allegiance to Illidan, and he and Lady Vashj joined Illidan in defeating the pit lord Magtheridon and laying claim to his Black Temple. Yet Illidan and his allies did not celebrate their conquest for long. In a storm of magic and fury, Kil'jaeden descended upon Outland and demanded that Illidan once again try to destroy the Frozen Throne.\nWith no other option, Illidan led the naga and blood elves back to Azeroth. The battle came down to single combat between Illidan and the death knight Arthas Menethil. Arthas won the fight and warned Illidan to leave the planet and never return. Since that time, Illidan and his allies, including Lady Vashj, have inhabited the Black Temple on Outland."}

The rampaging orcs killed Vereesa's parents, but she and her two older sisters, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and Sylvanas, survived.\nVereesa's oldest sister, Alleria, went on to lead an elite cadre of rangers after the Second War and eventually sacrificed herself to destroy the Draenor end of the Dark Portal. Sylvanas later fought the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas and was slain, then raised into undeath against her will. By this time, Vereesa may or may not have heard of Sylvanas' grim fate.\nA Perilous Mission.\nFollowing in Alleria's footsteps, Vereesa too became a ranger. To her disgust, her first major assignment did not involve hunting down the orcs that had been trapped on the planet &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the Dark Portal's destruction.\nInstead, she was asked to escort a human wizard named Rhonin to one of the eastern ports of Lordaeron. She accomplished her mission only to discover that there were no ships available to take Rhonin to his ultimate destination: Khaz Modan.\nRhonin claimed that his mission was minor and only required him to observe the orc presence in Khaz Modan. Yet he remained unusually determined to fulfill it. He even appealed to a group of Wildhammer dwarves, asking them to fly him to Khaz Modan on one of their gryphons. At first the dwarves refused, for they trusted humans little and wizards even less.\nYet Vereesa had grown fond of Rhonin, and she suspected that his mission was more important than he wanted to admit. Appealing to the dwarves, she persuaded them to fly both her and Rhonin to Khaz Modan. Although Rhonin was separated from her along the flight, she tracked him all the way to Grim Batol, which was a Horde stronghold under the leadership of Nekros Skullcrusher.\nThe Demon Soul.\nUsing a magical artifact known as the Demon Soul, Nekros had managed to enslave Alexstrasza and, through her, most of the red dragonflight. Thus, Korialstrasz had sent Rhonin to Grim Batol with instructions to free Alexstrasza. Disguised as a mage named Krasus, Korialstrasz did not truly hope that Rhonin would be able to liberate the Dragonqueen. Rather, Korialstrasz hoped to trick the Horde into believing that a full-scale invasion was about to occur. While the Horde evacuated Grim Batol, Korialstrasz planned to strike and free his queen.\nHis plan backfired when the massive black dragon Deathwing unexpectedly showed up and began stealing Alexstrasza's eggs. In fact, Deathwing had helped Rhonin reach Grim Batol precisely for that reason: the insane Dragon Aspect wanted to bolster his own failing flight by kidnapping Alexstrasza's children and raising them as his own.\nHowever, the other Dragon Aspects arrived to stop Deathwing. With the help of Vereesa and a group of dwarves, Rhonin took the Demon Soul from Nekros and managed to destroy it. Their powers fully restored, Alexstrasza and the other Aspects attacked Deathwing and forced him to flee. Deathwing has not been seen since that time.\nNot long after their adventure, Vereesa and Rhonin were married. Vereesa recently gave birth to their first children: twins.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/611.xml."}

As their duties were broadened, the Watchers accepted night elf women from other professions. A mixture of volunteerism and military promotions caused the organization's size to grow somewhat, although the Watchers remained a relatively small group. &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; killed almost all of the Watchers after the Third War, at which point the group ceased to exist.\nHistory and Organization.\nShortly after the Great Sundering, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sentenced his brother Illidan to imprisonment for having created a second Well of Eternity. In inflicting this punishment, Malfurion hoped to prevent Illidan from continuing his reckless pursuit of arcane power. By this point in time, however, Illidan was already an extraordinarily powerful sorcerer, and Malfurion dared not leave his captive twin to be guarded by only one or two jailors.\nOne of the senior Sisters of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev Shadowsong, had already shown her competence in guarding Illidan before he was brought to trial. Malfurion accordingly asked Maiev to gather additional volunteers from the Sisters of Elune. Maiev obeyed, and Malfurion called this new group the Watchers, for he charged them with ensuring that Illidan never escaped the barrow prison. Maiev, as the Watchers' leader, would answer to the head of night elf government, High Priestess &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Watchers were created specifically and exclusively to be Illidan's jailors, but as further threats came up, Tyrande broadened the Watchers' role to include guarding other prisoners. Maiev took grim pleasure in these added responsibilities. Watchers became jailors and marshals: they policed the barrow prisons and hunted down dangerous criminals.\nOutside of the barrow prisons, members of the Watchers worked alone. These deadly women were not a militia, nor were they considered part of either the Sisterhood of Elune or the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. As the group's leader, Maiev was given the rank of warden, which she later awarded to a select few who had proven their exceptional fighting abilities, tracking skills, and tenacity.\nDuring the Third War, Tyrande realized that Illidan had been incarcerated for over ten thousand years. She felt that he had more than paid his debt to society; furthermore, she felt that he would be a valuable ally against the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, she led a band of soldiers into Illidan's prison. When Illidan's guards would not surrender their charge, Tyrande and the Sentinels fought and killed a number of Watchers. Once freed, Illidan stole and consumed the Skull of Gul'dan, and he was transformed into a &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfuriated by Tyrande's actions, Maiev swore she would track Illidan down and put him back in prison. In light of the demon's undeniable might, Maiev took most of the Watchers with her on the hunt. They pursued Illidan across the sea to Lordaeron and thence to the Broken Isles. When he entered the Tomb of Sargeras, Maiev grew worried that he would retrieve a magical artifact and become significantly more difficult to recapture.\nShe and the other Watchers caught up with Illidan too late: he had already claimed the Eye of Sargeras. He used the Eye's power on the tomb's stone walls, trapping the Watchers in one section of the tomb while seawater flooded the area. Only Maiev was able to escape; her sisters in arms drowned. In one fell stroke, Illidan had all but wiped out the Watchers.\nMaiev swore that she would have revenge, no matter the cost. She abandoned her duties and continued to hunt Illidan until she at last followed him to Outland. Her lengthy absence from &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, together with Illidan's continued freedom, has led the night elves to presume her dead.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "15706", "revid": "38896978", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15706", "title": "Annihilan", "text": "The annihilan, commonly known as pit lords (or pitlords), are a powerful species of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; recruited by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader, the most feared of them all, is &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Demon King of the Pit Lords.\nThese colossal destroyers serve as the Legion's military commanders. They are as cruel as they are powerful - and revel in the destruction of all that exists. They are known to use &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s to sniff out sources of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; wherever they be found.\nHistory.\nThe annihilan are one of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic species that were naturally born from the chaotic astral realm known as the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the cunning &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, who preferred to infiltrate and manipulate mortal civilizations, the pit lords took a more direct approach to conquering worlds. Existing only to brutalize and torture any mortal crossing their path, the annihilan often enslaved the lesser demons of the Nether, using them as fodder to besiege the mortal civilizations of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some unspecified point in time, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; recruited the annihilan into the Burning Legion, an invitation the pit lords readily accepted. Though they were recruited by Kil'jaeden, it was &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; who empowered the pit lords to serve as living siege engines and inspire dread in all those they faced.\nAnnihilan are rarely seen on the battlefield, since they are too important to simply waste in combat. The only two annihilan that entered Azeroth during the War of the Ancients and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt;, so it is presumed that the annihilan are either generals for smaller forces of the Burning Legion or are still on the Legion's homeworld.\nMannoroth's blood was used to forge a blood-pact with the &lt;a href=\"corrupted%20orc\"&gt;corrupted orc&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, making their corruption permanent \u2014 only one clan, the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt;, escaped. During the Burning Legion's second invasion, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; defeated Mannoroth, and broke the blood pact he had forged and thus freed the Orcs from demonic corruption. Hellscream did not survive the encounter.\nDescription.\nThe Pit Lords who serve under &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; the Destructor are some of the most cruel, barbarous butchers to ever roam the trackless wastes of the Twisting Nether. These hulking engines of hate and death love only to kill and bring sorrow to all living creatures. Fanatically loyal to Mannoroth, the pit lords will stop at nothing to see the will of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; upheld. These massive demons take sadistic pleasure from instilling crazed terror, and then slaughtering their enemies.\nAs a demonic species, pit lords, after being defeated, return to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to reconstruct themselves.\nAppearance.\nThe annihilan pit lords are described as engines of destruction. They are driven by pure rage and bloodlust. Their bodies resemble massive lizards, with six powerful limbs (four legs, similar in nature to the &lt;a href=\"Cenarius%27s%20children\"&gt;children of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;), a tail, and wings sprouting from their backs (the wings are vestigial and occasionally used for defense \u2014 even with eredar magic, pit lords are far too heavy to fly, except in the non-canon RPG). Their upper torsos are more humanoid, with a large chest, two arms and a large horned head. Their mouths are filled with rows of teeth, their eyes are on fire and even their tongues are studded with fangs. Two long, &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;-like tusks sprout from both sides of their mouth. The preferred weapon of the pit lords is a massive double-bladed polearm. Though they may look fat and lazy, they are unimaginably powerful. The \"Warcraft III\" model had beards, but the cinematic and \"WoW\" models do not.\nA handful of annihilan, such as Mongrethod or Brutallus, have been shown with a different, more battle-scarred and somewhat corpse-like. They possess no wings or forearms, the former being torn off completely, and the latter being replaced with massive blades in a manner similar to the Shattered Hand orcs. They also feature a broken tusk, and spikes impaling the other tusk, and multiple burning scars. These annihilan seem possibly even more wrathful and murderous, perhaps as a side-effect of their deterioration. This look does appear to be a permanent alteration as well, as Brutallus still features this look when he returns at the end of the Broken Shore.\nAnnihilan blood has been shown to be extremely potent. As noted above, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood was used to seal the pact with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;'s was used to create &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"Aggonar\"&gt;Aggonar&lt;/a&gt;'s corrupted a &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Aggonar\"&gt;sacred draenei area&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Brutallus\"&gt;Brutallus&lt;/a&gt;' raised the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madrigosa\"&gt;Madrigosa&lt;/a&gt; from the dead in the form of &lt;a href=\"Felmyst\"&gt;Felmyst&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe hide of Magtheridon is described as thick, with the Warglaives of Azzinoth wielded by Illidan barely able to penetrate more than a few inches. This, and the portrayals of first deaths of Mannoroth and Azgoth show their bodies are thick and when damaged, cause explosions and they die.\nBiology.\nLike all demons, annihilan blood contains tremendous fel power, and is used to make powerful fel inks, demonic sigils, and is highly valued for &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; rituals.\nAnnihilan hide can be crafted into armor, and their fel glands can be extracted to make a very deadly poison.\nNotable.\nAs with other demonic races, the precise hierarchy of the annihilan is unknown. However, there is information on a few of the annihilan pit lords, as several fought in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and died on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther named annihilan include:\nIn the RPG.\nAfter Mannoroth's death, &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt; became the new general of the Legion's ground forces on Azeroth at &lt;a href=\"the%20Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28History%20of%20Warcraft%29\"&gt;the Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. They are known to be &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPit lord &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s find &lt;a href=\"Felhound\"&gt;fel stalkers&lt;/a&gt; and train them.\nSpeculation.\nName.\nThe term \"&lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt;\" may be a class or rank within the annihilan species or the &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; name for the species.\nCulture.\nNothing is known of the culture of the annihilan, but it is likely one where raw power is valued above all else. While Mannoroth was certainly quite powerful, he probably rose to become their leader through his cunning and magical knowledge \u2014 he is said to have been as skilled as a mid-level &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;. Besides Magtheridon, no other pit lord has shown particular affinity for the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; arts, though many of them know the 'fel firestorm' spell."}

Annora will spawn when the scorpids in her room are dead, although no other mobs in the zone must be dead. \nPrior to patch 2.3, Annora was the only Artisan Enchanting trainer in Azeroth, making her important and necessitating trips to Uldaman for all Enchanters. Since the patch most cities now have Artisan Enchanting trainers, reducing her significance.\nWith the release of and the it seems she has been killed. Her corpse can be found in the hall just before &lt;a href=\"Emberon\"&gt;Emberon&lt;/a&gt; with the spiders and other dead Explorer League members, behind where the &lt;a href=\"Neglected%20Mole%20Machine\"&gt;mole machine&lt;/a&gt; appears.\nQuotes.\nGreetings traveler, you have my undying gratitude for dispensing with those dreadful creatures! I was beginning to think I might have to hide out forever!\nFormer leveling guide.\n Be advised that Annora now teaches enchants all the way to lvl 295. You will likely want to make two trips to the trainer, the first to train to level 255 or so, and the last to get the remaining formulas once you have attained enchanting level 295.\nOne possibly cheaper approach to skilling up with Annora is to use the following formulas: \nThis approach avoids the expensive Greater Nether Essence. Note that when the plus sign is used, the spell has turned from orange to yellow and the results are not as predictable. The &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20Bracer%20-%20Greater%20Stamina\"&gt;Enchant Bracer - Greater Stamina&lt;/a&gt; formula sells at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; for between 3 and 12g, but it is one of the most economical skillup formulas for higher levels and well worth the price. The &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Stamina%20%28shield%20enchant%29\"&gt;Greater Stamina (shield enchant)&lt;/a&gt; formula is available in limited quantity from a vendor in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; (Daniel Bartlett) and &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; (Mythrin'dir).

He came into being when the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20%28Nexus%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; formed due to the high amounts of magical energy streaming through the Nexus daily. He was used as one of the guards to the Nexus and to &lt;a href=\"Keristrasza\"&gt;Keristrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s prison. Now, Anomalus seems to have gone out of control as his Chaos Rifts and lesser Arcane elementals are attacking the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Directing so much of Azeroth's arcane energy through the Nexus has created tears in reality. As Malygos's forces try to drive back invading creatures, the chaotic arcane power has taken form as Anomalus. If the creature is not stopped, it will unmake everything it can touch.\"\nStrategy.\nWhen Anomalous reaches 75%, 50% and 25% health, he creates a Chaotic Rift and uses Rift Shield to become immune to all damage. The Chaotic Rifts themselves can cast spells, which are the &lt;a href=\"Crazed%20Mana-Wraith\"&gt;Crazed Mana-Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s, that the rifts summon, cast &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dps targeting priority is:\n1: Chaotic Rifts\n2: Crazed Mana-Wraiths\n3: Anomalus\nHeroic.\nDo not attempt to kite the boss around\nThis boss is best tanked on the main platform that he stands on. Keep the tank on him and have 2 DPS make macros for \"/target Chaotic Rift\" in order to quickly take out the many rifts he will spawn.\nThe range on the Chaotic Rifts have a very long range of attack that will span from the main platform past the 2nd platform you ran up, to get to the boss.\nAchievement.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Theory\"&gt;Chaos Theory&lt;/a&gt;: Defeat Anomalous in The Nexus on Heroic Difficulty without destroying any Chaotic Rifts.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.2\"&gt;Patch 3.3.2&lt;/a&gt;, He only casts Create Rift once throughout the fight, making this achievement much simpler than before.\nThis achievement is quite tough, definitely the hardest of the instance. To do it, it is a good idea to first clear all trash on the large lower area with the mana wraiths. Your healer's mana is the main issue, as the charged rifts throw off a ton of damage, especially at lower health. When you pull the boss, tank him toward the back of his platform until he forms the first rift. Do not blow cooldowns immediately, save them. When he puts up the first rift shield, everyone runs down to the second platform's far edge to avoid the mana wraiths. Kill any that aggro, and then concentrate on survivability. If you can heal, heal yourself to save your healer mana. When Anomalus' shield is up, he will run down to you. Repeat this technique for every shield, making sure you are out of range of the wraiths. Note that when he puts up a shield, every single rift that is up will become charged, meaning you take far more damage later in the fight. This is why saving cooldowns until at least 50% is a good idea, as your healer will run out of mana very fast. A Paladin healer or a disc priest would probably have a much more difficult time doing this than a druid, shaman, or CoH priest.\nAlternate Strategy:\nSimilar to the first strategy, clear out every trash pull from the lower levels and the platforms leading back to the entrance. His charging (going immune) only occurs when he is near 2 rifts at the same time. The tank should kite him about 20 yards each time he opens a rift. If you keep him away from his rifts, he will not go immune and charge, making it much easier to kill him and the healer less likely to OOM. You can continue kiting him toward the beginning of the dungeon as long as you need to take him down (our group had the tank and healer left alive from 100k to dead, no charging). The adds still spawn and attack, but only the ones from the rifts nearest you. Any healer should be able to complete this strategy, assuming the group has appropriate levels of gear.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

In the event that the facility is contaminated by foreign entities, Anraphet will access programs designed to annihilate the intruders by any means necessary.\"\nStrategy.\nWhen Anraphet casts Alpha Beams, he will create void zones at that player's feet. He will switch through a few players per cast. Everyone must not stand in the void zones as it deals high damage. Stop whatever you are doing and move. This is especially so in heroic mode when a permanent void zone will be created around the target area.\nAbout every minute, Anraphet will channel Omega Stance, dealing damage to everyone. Help your healer by using a damage reducing cooldown or self-healing abilities if he/she is unable to cope.\nIn heroic mode, the void zones created by Alpha Beams will stay on the ground throughout the fight. The tank can kite Anraphet around to ground that is not covered by void zones. Avoid trapping yourselves within a circle of void zones by constantly moving backwards towards the door you first came in.\nWhile survivability is important, this is also a DPS race. You need to kill him before his debuff can reduce your health so much that he one shots you. Each DPSer needs to be doing at least 6kdps.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The plan was for him to distract his former Construct allies with a few explosions, but he ended up being captured by the foundry's guards and had to once again be rescued by the Maw Walkers before the group could proceed with their plan. The Eyes used some of the explosives Ansid had kept on his person to kill the foundry's overseer &lt;a href=\"Enforcer%20Borgulla\"&gt;Enforcer Borgulla&lt;/a&gt; and capture a mooring platform from which they could access the Zerekriss. Once the necropolis was under the Eyes' control, Ansid stationed himself aboard it to serve as its mechanic."}

At the age of 12, Antonidas' thesis, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ramifications%20of%20refined%20Reverse%20Time%20Travel%20Phenomena%20into%20Quantifiable%20Magical%20Practice\"&gt;The Ramifications of refined Reverse Time Travel Phenomena into Quantifiable Magical Practice&lt;/a&gt;\", earned him the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Sash%20of%20Supreme%20Acumen\"&gt;Kirin Tor Sash of Supreme Acumen&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest ever to receive the award. Shortly thereafter the Ruling Council offered him official placement in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Advanced%20Research%20and%20Illumination%20Sect\"&gt;Kirin Tor Advanced Research and Illumination Sect&lt;/a&gt;, also the youngest to receive an official invitation.\nAs the mage grew older, he continued to learn and hone his abilities. His natural talent for defensive magic and wisdom beyond his years made Antonidas an ideal candidate for a position on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, which he eventually attained. Antonidas proved not only wise and fair, but infinitely regimented in goal to become more knowledgeable. He quickly became one of the dominant voices of Dalaran.\nWhen the leaders of Dalaran decided to send an apprentice to &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, Antonidas was among those who argued for their decision to fall on &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, he asked Khadgar to bring a piece of a magical flying disc\u2014the &lt;a href=\"%3AArchmage%27s%20Prismatic%20Disc\"&gt;:Archmage's Prismatic Disc&lt;/a&gt;\u2014that Antonidas had created while studying the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, to see if there were any books on the subject of controlling fire in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. He also entrusted a piece to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Cedric\"&gt;Archmage Cedric&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he had written a ritual to channel frost energy into the disc, but their combined power forced too much energy into it. The third and final piece was infused with Antonidas's own arcane magic at the height of his own power, but he was never able to finish his work on it. It was given to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Celindra\"&gt;Archmage Celindra&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, leaders of each of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Azerothian nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron to discuss the threat of the orc invasion. Archmage Antonidas attended the summit on behalf of the Council of Six, pledging loyalty to the Alliance on Dalaran's behalf. He also monitored the progress of the young but extremely talented mage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who had served as &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s apprentice during the First War.\nIn the aftermath of the Second War, Antonidas promoted Khadgar to the rank of archmage and placed him as the new master of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Antonidas visited the southern fortress himself when the other kings of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; visited. When the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; reopened, Antonidas placed Khadgar in a position of authority over the mission to enter the gateway and investigate &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few months following the war, when &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Antonidas rushed to intercept him. He found the death knights in the Arcane Vault, Dalaran's store for its most precious of relics. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael\"&gt;Kael&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sathera\"&gt;Sathera&lt;/a&gt;, Antonidas battled against the &lt;a href=\"death%20knights\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; who had come to steal the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. Sathera was killed, and the death knights escaped atop the backs of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Antonidas would tell this news to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; through a dream.\nLethargy of the orcs.\nAfter the Second War, many orcs were rounded up and placed into internment camps. Some of the Alliance leaders speculated that it would be best to simply kill all of them off while they were weak. Others concluded the orcs could be kept as slaves. Antonidas posed a different hypothesis. The archmage published several theses on his research: \n\"The Causality of War: A Comprehensive Study on Orc Lassitude.\"\n\"The Contrast of Orc Tradition, Sociology, and Psychological Practices from Before and After the Second War.\"\n\"Empirical Study on the Formulation and History of High Profile Fel Magics, and their Relation to the Orc Race.\"\nResearching what little he could find of orcish history, Antonidas learned that the orcs had been under demonic power and warlock magics for generations, granting the brutes unnaturally heightened strength, endurance, and aggression. He speculated that the orcs had been corrupted by demonic powers even before their &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;first invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Antonidas theorized that the orcs\u2019 communal lethargy was not actually a disease, but a long-term racial withdrawal from the volatile warlock magics that had filled them with bloodlust. Though the symptoms were clear, Antonidas was unable to find a cure for the orcs\u2019 present condition, and many fellow mages and notable Alliance leaders argued that finding a cure for the orcs would be an imprudent venture. Left to ponder the orcs\u2019 mysterious condition, Antonidas\u2019 conclusion was that the orcs\u2019 only cure would have to be a spiritual one.\nBefore the Third War.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and Kael arrived in Dalaran at the same time, Antonidas invited them to a dinner in honor of having two princes in the city. During the dinner, Antonidas spoke about the lethargy of orcs.\nIt came to Antonidas' attention that &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, another member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, had begun to experiment with the arcane art of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. As this threatened the safety and reputation of Dalaran, Antonidas decided to put a stop to it. He had Kel'Thuzad's properties searched, and all items tainted by dark magic were confiscated and destroyed. Antonidas warned Kel'Thuzad that he would be stripped of his rank and holdings, and exiled from both Dalaran and Lordaeron, if he did not abandon that path. Kel'Thuzad chose to leave Dalaran and swore to serve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nAntonidas held the position as one of the four jurors during the court of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Like the other judges, he was shocked when Tirion admitted his guilt, which led the paladin to his &lt;a href=\"excommunication\"&gt;excommunication&lt;/a&gt; and his exile.\nDestruction of Dalaran.\nThough his failing health prohibited him from spending too much time away from his beloved city, his apprentice, Jaina Proudmoore, served as his eyes and ears in the world. Antonidas drummed into her not to be arrogant and told her the stories about Medivh and Aegwynn. Antonidas looked forward to the day when he would hand his power and mantle of leadership over to Jaina, who he felt would make a most impressive archmage.\nUnfortunately, Antonidas grew cautious as he got older; Antonidas, like many prominent figures in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, was met by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt; before the invasion began. When the Prophet warned him about the upcoming invasion, Antonidas did not heed the stranger's advice to personally investigate. When the Prophet warned him that he must journey west, Antonidas was heedless, believing the Prophet to be nothing more than a magical madman. Despite Jaina's instinct about the Prophet, Antonidas instead chose to focus attention on the plague sweeping across the north. He, like many of the Kirin Tor, knew that it was a great threat, and that it should be taken very seriously. Antonidas spent several days examining the infected grain and he found out the goal of the plague - to kill and raise humans. He tested in on a corpse who attacked him thus he was right. However, Dalaran's plea for quarantine went unheard by the ears of Alliance officials.\nInstead he sent his finest pupil &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to investigate, who accompanied the young paladin &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; as he chased after the source of the plague. When Arthas was locked in a battle against undead in Hearthglen, Jaina teleported from the village back to Dalaran and informed Antonidas about Kel'Thuzad and his undead army. He then warned Uther who helped Arthas in Hearthglen. The ensuing tragedy would ravage the mind of Arthas, and destroy the great city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nAntonidas continued to study the plague despite being aware of the undead ravaging the kingdom and then they appeared at his doorstep. Antonidas realized that the mysterious Prophet was right all along but it was too late for him to leave for Kalimdor. As the leader of the Kirin Tor, he had to stay and protect Dalaran. The Scourge, led by Arthas (now a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; (now a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;), had come to claim the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, as it was needed to summon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. Moments before the siege of Dalaran began, Jaina was in the city alongside Antonidas. She wanted to help him defend the city, but Antonidas convinced her that now was the right time to leave for Kalimdor.\nGreeting Arthas and the undead outside the city, Antonidas warned the fallen prince that he and his fellow archmages had conjured a powerful aura which would kill any undead that stepped inside and warned him to pull his troops back or they would unleash their full power. Despite this, Arthas, Kel'Thuzad, and &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; fought their way through the mages' defenses, slowly gaining ground. Antonidas and his remaining men made a final stand against the undead, but the Archmage eventually fell to them. In his dying breath, he told Arthas that it pained him to see the prince fall astray before Arthas slew him. Kel'Thuzad then claimed Medivh's spellbook. Arthas noticed that the book had Antonidas's blood on it and wondered if that would make it more potent. In the meantime, Tichondrius stole the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; from the same vault.\nAlthough the forces of Dalaran fought on even after Antonidas' death, Arthas, the undead and demonic reinforcements were able to hold them long enough for Kel'Thuzad to summon Archimonde.. Moments later, Archimonde crushed the city of Dalaran into rubble.\nAntonidas's spirit lingered for some time after the city's destruction, continuing to fight what he believed to be the invading undead forces. When the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; was fleeing the dungeons, he found the ghosts of Antonidas and several of his kindred, and finally released them, allowing them peace after so many months.\nShadowlands.\nAs a victim of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Antonidas entered the Shadowlands a sundered soul. Its missing fragment, crystallized as \"The Archmagus Mentor\", came into the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s possession after Frostmourne's shattering. \nLegacy.\nWhen the remaining members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; rebuilt &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina created &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20Memorial\"&gt;a memorial&lt;/a&gt; to honor him.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina broke into the Kirin Tor library looking for the book, \"The Sixth Element: Additional Methods of Arcane Augmentation and Manipulation\", so as to learn how to use the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; to enslave elemental beings. It had been discovered long ago by Antonidas and placed in the library with a protective ward. When she pulled it out, Antonidas' visage appeared and warned her about the dangers of its contents. It was later recalling this warning that convinced Jaina not to destroy Orgrimmar.\nLeader of Dalaran.\nHe was the leader of the Kirin Tor. Other sources such as \"Warcraft III manual\" and \"Day of the Dragon\" call Dalaran a \"kingdom\" as well. His leadership is further confirmed in \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\", although he is said to be a non-king. Antonidas was also known as \"Head of the Kirin Tor of Dalaran\", and was indeed head of the conclave of wizards that ruled over the magical nation, and leader of &lt;a href=\"The%20Six\"&gt;The Six&lt;/a&gt;, the highest council in Dalaran whom often met in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Air\"&gt;Chamber of Air&lt;/a&gt;.\nAntonidas was the true ruler of the Kirin Tor and his wise, fatherly countenance became the sect's public face. He was also implied by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to be the monarch, one of the seven \"...human kings...of the Eastern Kingdoms...\", representing Dalaran, who met to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAuthorship.\nAntonidas wrote many books, essays and theses. Known to us are:\nAlternate timelines.\nA version of &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; exists in a &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt; where history turned out completely different and which was entered by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; era.\n&lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He tested the young novice by questioning him regarding the defense of Azeroth, and the use of magics - specifically dark magics. After &lt;a href=\"Finden\"&gt;Finden&lt;/a&gt; has tested the boy's combat readiness, Antonidas branded Medivh with the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Eye of the Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, stating, \"No mage shall be your peer; none, your master.

Only one commander is out of their pod at any given time, and commanders still in their pods attack their enemies using the might of the Legion military. While a commander is attacking directly, their command pod is empty and can be commandeered. After a period attacking their enemies face to face, commanders will Assume Command and return to their pod. On Mythic difficulty, Screaming Shrikes will appear periodically and channel Extract Interloper in an to attempt to remove your allies from command pods they have commandeered. Additionally, the effects of Psychic Scarring last for the duration of combat.\nAbilities.\nIn Pod.\nEach commander has powerful abilities they can only access while they inhabit their command pod.\nOut of Pod.\nWhile out of their command pod, each commander fights their enemies more directly.\nStealing Power.\nWhile a commander is out of their pod and attacking directly, players can commandeer the pod and use its powerful abilities.

He treats these scaled beasts like family, and he is known to strike down anyone--even fellow trolls--who harm his precious children. Rather than give his opponents a proper burial, Antu'sul allows the basilisks to feast on whoever dares cross him.\"\nLocation.\nTo get to his cave, you follow the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; path to the east (killing along the way). You'll notice break in the wall in the scarab room and you'll see a path through the mountains to the south with &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s (see the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwar.net/cartography/instances/zulfarrak.php\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;). Your group should take these out.\nAs you approach the alcove, you'll see a cave set into the side of the hills. The first thing to do to survive this encounter is to NOT get anywhere near the cave. A large circle in front of the cave (which you cannot see) acts as a trigger spot such that if you step on it, Antu'sul will start the fight without you being prepared. \nNote that this is a trigger spot and hence immune to various tactics you might come up with, such as sneaking into the cave, charging in, etc. The first time we tried to fight him, he was &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;ing the whole group repeatedly, so we thought we'd be clever and fight him in the cave (&lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; rooting doesn't work inside caves, so we thought we'd give it a shot). However, as soon as we stepped on the spot, he charged out (in less than a second) and summoned basilisks.\nWhich gets us back to the first tactic. Clear everything outside of the cave, without hitting the trigger spot. Next, when you are prepared, have your &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; hit the trigger to summon.\nCombat Info.\nAt the start of the battle, he will summon several basilisks (which you cannot prevent). As soon as you are about to kill him, he summons several more (and more difficult) basilisks. After you cleared the area without pulling him, have your group stay together on the same spot, then let the tank pull the boss. Six non-elite &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn and run to your group which is on the same place, so area-effect spells will kill them in several seconds. As Antu'sul loses health, he will spawn more elite-basilisk adds. It is important to completely stop damage on Antu'sul and focus on the add until it is dead before you reengage Antu'sul, or you will end up fighting 3-4 adds - with a good group you might get him down, but the 3-4 elite adds will be a certain &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt; - if you focus on the add instead you will have 1 Elite add and Antu'sul only at any time which is very manageable even for a lowbie group, as he will not spawn more Adds if he doesn't get damaged.\nFor a lower level group, the biggest problem you might have is that your primary &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; will run out of mana\u2014especially if you don't all focus your hitting on the basilisks one at a time (because he/she will then have to heal a greater number of people who have less armor). Mana potions are invaluable in this case. Thus, everyone should focus on killing the basilisks one at a time, except the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; who should be trying to keep aggro on everything. Someone should be delegated to protecting the &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; because he/she's bound to draw aggro keeping the tank alive while the rest of the group kills off the basilisks. \nThe other thing to look out for is that Antu'sul drops totems frequently. Someone with a fast attack, such as a rogue, should be on totem duty.\nIt's a fun but challenging fight, and as much of Zul'Farrak shows, group dynamics are starting to play a bigger role in the success or failure of an instance run.\nPet Pull Trick.\nThere is a trick to kill him in an easier way. If you have a warlock with a &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; or a hunter with a pet, have the pet get into Antu'sul's cave first. He can get in the circle of aggro without triggering his attack. Have the pet attack Antu'sul and then get the pet back. This way the Antu'sul will not get those lvl 40 non-elite basilisks and the beginning. Thus, &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s don't have to waste time with &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; spells to take out the non-elites and the tank won't have to waste time getting those pesky basilisks off the casters. If all DPS is concentrated on Antu'sul he will be downed with time only to summon one basilisk. This trick is not yet confirmed to work with other warlock pets then a voidwalker."}

In life, he was one of the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s' most powerful spider lords. Now, he guards the doors of the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Wing\"&gt;Spider Wing&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the book \"&lt;a href=\"On%20Naxxramas\"&gt;On Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;\", a low-level member of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; finds himself distressed by \"the perverse nerubian\" always calling with invitations to its \"parlor.\"\n25-man Abilities.\nCrypt Guards.\nThere will be two adds that start the fight with Anub'Rekhan; each has 521,000 health.\n10-man Abilities.\nCrypt Guards.\nOne of these adds spawns after every Locust Swarm. In addition, one spawns approximately 20 seconds after Anub'Rekhan is pulled. They have around 234,000 health. They have a cleave, a stacking acid spit DoT that ticks for 500 a stack, and a low-hp frenzy that increases damage by 50% and attack speed by 60%.\nStrategy.\nAlthough doable with two tanks, three tanks are ideal for this encounter. One of them should tank Anub'Rekhan, while the others tank the Crypt Guard adds and the Scarabs that spawn from their corpses. In the 10-man encounter, the two Crypt Guards are not present at the start of the fight, making the third tank unnecessary. A hunter is helpful but unnecessary. \nThe main tank engages Anub'Rekhan and drags him back to where he was standing originally (note that tanking him against the wall can cause evade bugs should the tank be impaled). In the 25-man fight, the other tanks pick up their Crypt Guards while the DPS focus them down. These should be tanked and killed relatively close to Anub'Rekhan. Due to the acid DoT the Crypt Guards apply infinitely these should be killed quickly.\nAfter this, the raid should spread out in a semi-circle around Anub'Rekhan to minimize the effects of impale. Mages should be ready near the Crypt Guard corpses to frost nova the Corpse Scarabs as they come out; the offtanks should be on or near these corpses to pick them up. Ranged DPS should focus and kill the scarabs before returning to Anub'Rekhan. You should have a decent amount of time to DPS Anub'Rekhan before the first Locust Swarm. One player\u2014ideally a Hunter\u2014and a healer stand 30 yards from the main tank on the edge of the room past the ring of slime. When Locust Swarm is cast, all players must immediately run from Anub'Rekhan to the other side of the room and remain more than 30 yards from him for the next 20 seconds.\nThe main tank, when he sees the Locust Swarm cast bar, must begin kiting Anub'Rekhan along the edge of the slime to the other side of the room. The hunter should have &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Aspect of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; on. The healer should move with them and avoid getting any stacks of Locust Swarm in order to be able to heal the tank and hunter should they be hit. A warrior tank should use Intervene to gain additional distance. Locust Swarm ends when Anub'Rekhan reaches the other side of the room, where he should be tanked as before, with the raid spreading out in a half circle. Another Crypt Guard spawns during this time; pick up and kill it. Again, Mages should be to be aware of Corpse Scarabs spawning from it. After this, the encounter continues, with Locust Swarms coming every ~90 seconds until Anub'Rekhan is dead.\nAlternate strategy (10 man version).\nThe kiting strategy can be difficult to master for a group with poor coordination. Ranged DPS might get caught in the swarm trying to kill the adds when the tank kites, and cause everything to go wrong. An alternative strategy is to not kite at all, but have the tank stay put and take the full damage of the swarm while the healers spam heals on him. This is entirely possible and will make the fight more of a tank-and-spank with extra healing on the swarm. Death Knights are good tanks for this tactic because they can time their damage reduction ability with the swarm and take less damage. Using &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt; just before Locust Swarm is cast will make you immune to the swarm for 5 seconds (7 if you have the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;). Tanks simply have to make sure that they use their damage reduction ability before the swarm because it silences them. \nOnce you enter the area where Anub'Rekhan is located, have a hunter misdirect (if available) onto the main tank and pull the boss to the actual entrance doorway area and tank it there while the rest of the raid runs forward and splits into a semi-circle roughly in the center of the room. Have your secondary tank behind everyone, where the adds spawn. All ranged DPS should spread around to avoid the impale. The offtank can add some DPS or even some off-healing to the party, but be ready to pick up the adds that spawn in the back, as they can easily one-shot a cloth wearer. Once the add spawns and the offtank picks it up, all the DPS has to do is simply turn around and burn it down. Do the same when the Corpse Scarabs spawn. This tactic is meant to reduce any kind of confusion in the kiting method, so separating the boss and the add makes the fight really simple. Remember that this method only really work if your healers keep the main tank topped up, especially during the locust swarm. Due to the massive damage that tanks take from the end of a Locust Swarm, any off-healers\u2014such as shamans or paladins\u2014should assist in keeping the main tank alive during this phase. \nNote: The adds do not hit the offtank really hard, but with a low-DPS group the damage debuff can stack and be really painful. A nice way to prevent extra damage is to stun, as this prevents them from casting the debuffs at all; these debuffs last for 10 seconds and are reapplied every 2 seconds, so if you can cast a stun (such as &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hammer of Justice&lt;/a&gt;) when your tank has 8 seconds left on the debuff, and add one more at 2 seconds, the debuff will start to 0 again, largely reducing the damage taken. The goal is to have a chain stun ready when the elite is around 50% health to reduce the overall damage taken. The adds are undead, so the paladin undead AoE stun can work for 1 sec. \nExtra Note: The small adds that spawn from the corpse are really fast and can get out of a consecrate.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

After he is pulled into position, the MT should face Anub'Rekhan towards the East, the reasoning for this is explained in the next section. \nThe two Crypt Guards need to be tanked as close as possible to their initial positions, with them facing away from the DPS to avoid cleaves. Since they are very susceptible to stuns, rogues and warriors should be trying to keep him stun-locked in place while DPS takes them down first.\nThe two Crypt Guards need to be tanked orthogonally from Anub'Rekhan, facing away from the DPS. That is to say, if you have plane in three dimensional space, a vector is orthogonal to the plane if it is perpendicular to every vector contained in the plane.\nThe left Guard should be taken out first, and his tank should not be getting more than 3-4 applications of the poison DoT. If he is, then the stuns need to better timed, or a second warrior needs to be taunting. Meanwhile, the two tanks for the right Guard should be bouncing aggro back and forth with taunts to avoid the DoT stacking too high. DPS finishes off the left Guard before coming over to kill the right the same way.\nAt this point the first corpse may have exploded into scarabs. If so, have Mages frost nova them into place before Warlocks/Mages AoE them down.\nAfter the right Guard dies, you should be 60\u201375 seconds into the fight. Only ranged DPS can go onto Anub'Rekhan before the first kite. Melee should stand on the corpse, picking up scarabs if it explodes, they would only have about 10 seconds to do damage before they would need to back out for the Locust Swarm.\nThe Kite and Spawn.\nThe most important part of the fight is the kiting that needs to occur every 70\u2013120 seconds. Keep a timer going after each Locust Swarm cast.\nAs soon as Anub'Rekhan bows at the MT, signaling the beginning of Locust Swarm, the MT must immediately start running around the east side ring of the room, just beyond the poison slime ring. The MT should stop running when he reaches 12/6 O'Clock, depending on where you initially tanked him. Everyone else needs to back out of the 30 yard range of the Swarm, including MT healers.\nAs soon as the MT starts running, the Hunter in his group must also turn on Aspect of the Pack and run ahead of him around the same outer ring and turning off Aspect when the MT is in the 12/6 O'Clock position. If done properly, only 1-2 applications of Locust Swarm should be on the MT, just enough to be healed through.\nReaction time to the tail lift is crucial to surviving each kite, a 2 second delay will spell a wipe for the raid. It is also just as important that the tank avoid stepping into the slime ring, as it will put a debuff reducing all stats to 10% of normal, effectively dropping his max health by 5-6000 points.\nAt the same time the Locust Swarm is cast, a new Crypt Guard will spawn at Anub'Rekhan's initial engage point. This add should be pulled towards the western part of the room, to stay out of range of the Locust Swarm, and is killed identically to how the first two were brought down. After the newly spawned Guard is killed, all DPS can go back onto Anub'Rekhan, again, having 2 mages keep an eye out for scarabs. If done quickly and efficiently, this leaves 45 seconds of straight DPS on Anub'Rekhan before melee must back out and the next kite and spawn occurs.\n70\u201380 seconds after each Locust Swarm cast, all melee DPS needs to back out of range and prepare for the next Crypt Guard spawn. If you are on a relatively lag-free server, you can leave Melee in there a little longer, and have them react similarly to the MT.\nRinse and repeat to bring Anub'Rekhan down and collect your first (probably) Tier 3 quest pieces. As you gain more and more practice on it, you can kill him in as little as one kite phase.\nLoot.\nYou receive 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at all reputation levels."}
