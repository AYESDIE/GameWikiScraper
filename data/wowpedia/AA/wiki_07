Once devoted to protecting his beloved home, Zhu now burns with seething hatred for all life, twisting his perception of everything--and everyone--around him.\"\nStrategy.\nTaran Zhu is a one phase fight, and he will use all of his abilities from the pull until he is defeated. His abilities are exactly the same on both Normal and Heroic, with the only difference on Heroic mode being the increased amount of damage.\nThe main mechanic of this fight is the Hatred bar which appears at the bottom-middle of your screen; the meter ranges from 1 to 100. Various abilities the boss performs will increase your hatred, and once it reaches 100, you will enter a Haze of Hate, reducing your chance to hit by 90%, your healing done by 25% and increasing the physical damage you deal by 20%. As soon as you receive Haze of Hate, you should use your extra action button to Meditate. This will stun you for a few seconds, but doing so will reduce your hatred to 0 and remove the Haze of Hate debuff. Meditate has a very short cooldown, and it is possible (and very likely) for you to reach 100 hatred several times during the fight.\nPeriodically throughout the fight, Taran Zhu will cast Rising Hatred, steadily increasing the hate of everyone in the group. This can and should be interrupted by anyone capable of doing so. This spell can be cast whilst others are in play, leading to large spikes of hate. If other mechanics are in play whilst this is being channelled, it should be last on the priority list; it deals no damage, whilst other abilities, especially the Ring of Malice, can kill.\nTaran Zhu will also cast a combination of two spells; Ring of Malice, and Sha Blast. Ring of Malice is a large circle of shadow bolts that fly around the boss, and will move when he does. It is important for all party members to avoid standing in the ring. Importantly, whilst Ring of Malice is active, Taran Zhu will move 80% slower. This coincides with his next ability, Sha Blast, which will deal roughly 80,000 shadow damage to the tank and knock them back; through the Ring of Malice. If the Tank repeatedly returns to Taran Zhu whilst Ring of Malice is active, they will be repeatedly knocked back and take large amounts of damage (their hate will increase rapidly too). The trick here is to simply kite Taran Zhu for the 10 or so seconds whilst Ring of Malice is active. As a note for warriors or other tanks with quick movement abilities, Sha Blast seems to have a very small range, and if you react quickly enough you can leap outside of the Ring of Malice without taking a single blast.\nFinally, Taran Zhu will periodically summon Gripping Hatred - these are stationary enemies that are attackable, with a moderately sized pool of shadow around them. The shadow deals a small amount of shadow damage (and increasing their hate) per second to those standing within, but more importantly, once summoned each Gripping Hatred will begin to cast Grip of Hate, which, after 10 seconds, will pull everyone in the group to them. This spell cannot be interrupted, but the Gripping Hatreds can be stunned, forcing them to restart the 10 second cast once the stun ends. Taran Zhu will summon three of these, with a 1-2 second break in between each spawning. By stunning the last one to appear - or the one furthest away from the DPS - you will buy time for your group to kill all three without ever being gripped. These must be killed as soon as they appear; however, they don't have a lot of health and shouldn't be too difficult to kill.\nA lot of the abilities in this fight can combine, leading to large spikes of damage and hate for everyone in the group. DPS prioritising the Gripping Hate and everyone avoiding the Ring of Malice will lead to less hate, which will lead to less time Meditating, which will result in a faster kill. Once Taran Zhu has been reduced to roughly 100k health, he will turn friendly and the Sha of Hatred will leave him, ending the fight. The loot for the encounter can be found in a chest which will spawn in the gazebo, just behind where he stands before you engage him.\nQuotes.\nThe Sha of Hatred is mind controlling Taran Zhu and will yell the quotes."}

At a corruption level above 80, the miasma will turn red.\nCorruption effects.\nEvery corrupted item will have one of the following properties. The corruption effect on an item, along with its power level and associated corruption, is determined at random. &lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; sells Preserved Contaminants on a rotating basis that can be used to give items specific corruption effects.\nCertain weapons from &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt; always \"roll\" the same corruption effect every time they drop. Some of them have a unique effect that cannot be obtained on any other item; these are listed at the bottom of the table below.\nConsequences.\nWearing corrupted items raises the level of base corruption, which can be offset by the resistance provided by equipping and upgrading &lt;a href=\"Ashjra%27kamas%2C%20Shroud%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting net total corruption causes harmful effects described in the table below.\nPurification.\nCorrupted items can be purified by MOTHER, removing both benefit and corruption. Purification costs and requires completion of &lt;a href=\"Curious%20Corruption\"&gt;Curious Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, which starts automatically upon obtaining a corrupted item for the first time. A corrupted item that has been purified can be re-corrupted by using a Preserved Contaminant purchased from MOTHER.\nOn the PTR.\nOn the patch 8.3.0 PTR, \"corruptions\" were found on rings sold by the &lt;a href=\"Heartzertauren\"&gt;Heartzertauren&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps as an alternate concept for the system or simply a way to test the effects. While &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ring%20-%20Thing%20From%20Beyond\"&gt;Thing From Beyond&lt;/a&gt; made it to live as a consequence with minor changes and &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ring%20-%20Last%20Grasp\"&gt;Last Grasp&lt;/a&gt; may have inspired Grasping Tendrils, all of the others were scrapped.

The corrupted ones are vicious and cruel, hunting anything they can, even after they leave the Nightmare's affected zone. They appear to be a type of &lt;a href=\"corrupted%20creature\"&gt;corrupted creature&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTransformation.\nThe process can take minutes, hours or days depending on the creature, and some are never affected. Beings that enter the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, either voluntarily or because it sweeps across them, must be careful to avoid becoming corrupted. The energy that causes the corruption takes a full day to fade away.\nThe Nightmare is not a stable place. Occasionally, storms erupt and areas of intense corruption appear. When this happens there is very little that can be done to remove the corruption. Remove curse might help, but if it fails, further remove curse spells are of no use. A heal spell may work as well, but if it fails, further heal spells may actually make things worse until it no longer will help the corrupted individual. Otherwise, the only other means to eliminate corruption is with miracles and wishes."}

It is a land rich in history, having once been the home of the first &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; empire of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, who gave the region its name, and later the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Kingdom of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. The Highlands are sometimes inaccurately described as the birthplace of humanity.\nAfter the death of its king, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, the once-mighty Stromgarde fell on hard times. Under his son, &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom was unable to resist the might of its many foes. The city, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was assailed by a combined force of &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, vengeful &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; who sought to lay low the kingdom, the native &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s that dot the forest to the east, and the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, whose hovels dot the east and central regions of the area.\nThe main hubs of activity became &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;Refuge Pointe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;, which functioned as bases for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The city of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, located in the southwest, fell into disrepair following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, with Galen Trollbane holding but a single section of the city. To the south lies the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;, a massive &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; construction that bridges the canal between Lordaeron and &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, connecting the Highlands with the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrince Trollbane once led the human defenders, until he was slain by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; seeking &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;, later being resurrected to undeath. In the end, he betrayed his new allies reclaiming Stromgarde Keep, but was ultimately killed when he tried to deceive the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, during which it was revealed the prince had murdered his own father, thus robbing the kingdom of its mighty leader. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance and Horde returned to prominence in the region to fight the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, each controlling the strongholds of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ar%27gorok\"&gt;Ar'gorok&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The battle ultimately ended in the Alliance's favor, with Stromgarde victorious, leaving &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; as the new leader of the kingdom.\nHistory.\nArathor.\nThe Arathi Highlands are central to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; history, as they were once the site of the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;Empire of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi tribe&lt;/a&gt; united the human tribes to create Arathor in 2,800 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, he set out to found a new capital. According to one legend, a dream told him to go to an arid land in the southeast where his people would prosper. Thoradin sought out the region known today as the Arathi Highlands and ordered the construction of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, the first human capital. The semiarid terrain acted as a buffer zone between humanity and their enemies, the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;, prohibiting the trolls from launching their feared forest ambushes. Thoradin also ordered the construction of a &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;great wall&lt;/a&gt; near Strom as protection against Amani incursions.\nStrom remained the center of the empire during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, when humans made their first real contact with the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, and for over a millennium thereafter. However, as Arathor expanded across the Eastern Kingdoms and began splitting apart into independent city-states, Strom's power waned. Bound by mountainous terrain and lacking natural resources, it could not compete with the other city-states. In 1,200 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, many of Strom's noble families left the capital for the more fertile &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, Thoradin's last descendants, led by &lt;a href=\"Faldir\"&gt;Faldir&lt;/a&gt;, also left Arathor and traveled south to found the nation of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Strom was left in the hands of a few ruling families and developed into the new nation of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; the forces of Stromgarde ruled by &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, were an instrumental part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s ground forces, spreading the troops between the main Alliance army and the ones guarding Stromgarde. Thoras later ordered any remaining soldiers to come into Alterac Mountains to deal with the treacherous king &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arathi Highlands and Stromgarde itself were overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Horde's southern offensive in the dwarven lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; was initially successful, but after a series of savage battles, Alliance forces pushed the Horde back to the bridges of the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;. From there, the Alliance armies advanced south, forcing the Horde to retreat from Khaz Modan.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the family of &lt;a href=\"Krenna\"&gt;Krenna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorgonna\"&gt;Gorgonna&lt;/a&gt; were exiled from the Warsong clan in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually traveled to Arathi where they were ambushed by human soldiers. While the partens were slain, their children were thrown in Durnholde.\nFollowing the Second War, the former village that was to become Hammerfall was converted into an &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt; to hold the hated &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Years later, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; led a small army into the Highlands and attacked Hammerfall in order to free the captive orcs.\nThird War.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his retinue of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were in the Highlands. Warned by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;a prophet&lt;/a&gt;, they gathered their ranks and marched to the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, fighting wild &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s on the way.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Kingdom of Stromgarde managed to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; from ravaging Arathi, but was soon afterwards overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. The remnant of the Stromgarde army was forced to flee the then recently occupied &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and take refuge in a small canyon to the north, in what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;Refuge Pointe&lt;/a&gt;. Now, four years after the Third War, the area has become a battle zone between many different factions. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fights to aide the former nation of Stromgarde in recapturing its capital and reestablishing control over the region. The Horde, now in control of the internment camp that once held them prisoner (naming it &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the fallen warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;), is attempting to establish a forward base to protect its new allies against Alliance attack. The &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; is also in the area, trying to claim yet another territory for its jealous nobles. Finally, the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s in the region are trying to drive out all others and establish a permanent settlement for themselves.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Courier\"&gt;Forsaken Courier&lt;/a&gt; could be seen roaming from the &lt;a href=\"Go%27Shek%20Farm\"&gt;Go'Shek Farm&lt;/a&gt; in the highlands to &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. She was usually escorted by four &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Forsaken Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Valorcall\"&gt;Lieutenant Valorcall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Cavalryman\"&gt;Stromgarde cavalrymen&lt;/a&gt; also patrolled the region.\nCataclysm.\nUnlike its neighboring regions of Hillsbrad Foothills and the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Highlands were spared during the Cataclysm. Very little has changed. The Horde, flush from victory within Hillsbrad, have pushed slightly into the Highlands and have established a &lt;a href=\"Galen%27s%20Fall\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; near the border. On the Alliance side, the dwarves have burrowed a deep pass through the mountains north into the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, and now a clear path runs from behind &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Faldir%27s%20Cove\"&gt;Faldir's Cove&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;dark iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have abandoned their camp near &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;, retreating within the structure, and now the camp is home to a friendly &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Entrepreneur\"&gt;Dark Iron Entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;. The vile Forsaken, fresh from their conquest of Hillsbrad, now seek to seize control of Arathi as well, aided by the fallen prince of Stromgarde, Galen himself.\nLegion.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruined%20Kingdom\"&gt;The Ruined Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; it is shown that Galen Trollbane and his undead forces has seceded from the Forsaken and taken control of Stromgarde from the Syndicate and the ogres except for areas occupied by &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark&lt;/a&gt; forest trolls. Both forces would eventually be decimated by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; plunging the capital and the entire region into uncertainty.\nBefore the Storm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; took place on the western side of the Highlands, halfway between &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Gathering ended in tragedy. &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; had incited the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; participants of the event to defect to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which elicited &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s slaughter of all the Forsaken participants and Calia to curb any sedition to her authority. While the Alliance buried the Forsaken that were killed at the Gathering at an Arathi &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas has used the failed reunion to further alienate the Forsaken from their human counterparts.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe western region of Arathi Highlands becomes a warfront between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as they fight over Stromgarde. The Horde built a new base, &lt;a href=\"Ar%27gorok\"&gt;Ar'gorok&lt;/a&gt;, north of Stromgarde at the former location of &lt;a href=\"Northfold%20Manor\"&gt;Northfold Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the Alliance renovated &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; to serve as their base of operations. \nThe battle ultimately ended in the Alliance's favor, with Stromgarde victorious, thanks to the leadership qualities of &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, and the tenacity of all the soldiers who fought. This victory apparently left the Horde stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Ar%27gorok\"&gt;Ar'gorok&lt;/a&gt; in ruins, and the various settlements of the kingdom in the hands of the Alliance once more. \nFollowing the Alliance victory, the soldiers returned home, leaving only a few behind as a precaution. When &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; presented himself to Stromgarde during his mission for &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Danath blessed him to inspect the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Crypt&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Danath's &lt;a href=\"outrider\"&gt;outrider&lt;/a&gt;s spotted an armed and cloaked woman traveling with a group of Horde refugees throughout the Arathi Highlands, and the new King of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; subsequently informed his old friend &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, as she and Turalyon were riding through the region searching for the whereabouts of her sister &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Arathi Highlands are a land of rolling green hills dotted with pine trees. The climate is cool but not truly cold, and the terrain is semiarid and lacking in natural resources. In contrast, the nearby valley of &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; is remarkably fertile and rich in gold and lumber, and is home to some of the most arable acres in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable features of the Highlands include the great &lt;a href=\"Circles%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Circles of Binding&lt;/a&gt;, which are protected by elementals and used to keep &lt;a href=\"Myzrael\"&gt;some unknown entity&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned. The region lies just north of the huge canyon running between the Highlands and the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; to the south, which can only be crossed by the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;. The area is home to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which has been overrun by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;. To the west is &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, now collapsed and gaping wide. Mountains to the east prevent easy access to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidding%20Sea\"&gt;Forbidding Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The wildlife of the highlands includes giant &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"carrion%20bird\"&gt;carrion bird&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere is also a &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Coast%20dwarven%20farm\"&gt;dwarven farm&lt;/a&gt; on the southeast coast of the zone, though the location is shown as The Forbidding Sea on the minimap while there. It can only be accessed either by flying mount or by swimming from the Hinterlands or the Wetlands. While there are two Alliance-tagged dwarven farmers and some various critters there--as well as two grain fields, dwarven &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt;, and a small hovel carved into the side of the mountain--the farm appears to serve no purpose other than as a geographical curiosity.\nThere are no instanced dungeons in the Arathi Highlands, though the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most well known &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt; in the game, and the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;Tower of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; micro dungeon can also be found here. The entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; battleground can also be found in this zone.\nNotable characters.\nThe Arathi Highlands are home to several characters of note. At Refuge Pointe, seeks aid in the battle against the Boulderfist ogres. In Hammerfall, attempts to raise the spirits of those who still reel from the loss of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. And in Faldir's Cove, and his trusted crew seek an end to their prime threat - &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nToys and loot.\nAdded in \"Battle for Azeroth\" and tuned for level 120 players in the Warfront phase, a large number of rare creatures (many of which have existed in the game since Classic) drop mounts, pets, and toys. Rares can only be looted once per Alliance/Horde capture cycle.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThe woodlands of the Arathi Highlands were home to &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and ogres, and the rivers were inhabited by &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s by the time of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Exodus%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;exodus&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Golem%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s lurked in the rocky hills.\nThe multiplayer map called &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Wizard's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; is said to be located in the Arathi Foothills.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Arathi Highlands, the southernmost realm in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, are crushed and the people scattered. Three factions battle to control the few settlements that remain in this forsaken land. A small &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; outpost, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;, provides some sanity. The &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; has a large presence here, as do the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. The Highlands' native people are led by &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Prince Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, the rightful heir to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;'s throne and leader of the city's &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Snipers%20Company\"&gt;embattled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Defenders\"&gt;defenders&lt;/a&gt;. All three factions are poor and ragged, and would be easy prey for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOnce upon a time, the Arathi Highlands were home to the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and the city of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, now &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, was its capital city.\nStromgarde's warriors, including &lt;a href=\"Grizzled%20Jopp\"&gt;Grizzled Jopp&lt;/a&gt;, fought valiantly in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; met his end on Arathi soil during the liberation of the orcs from the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces devastated the nearby &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; to the south, indicating that they had attacked and infested Arathi as well. Many of Stromgarde's men and women traveled with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, leaving a tiny band behind. Prince Galen Trollbane is hard-pressed to hold his city against his enemies. Stromgarde's defenders, the Syndicate and the Boulderfist ogres all seek mercenaries to help in their struggles.\nA Syndicate band ambushed a lone wagon, but luckily the driver managed to escape, though the brigands stole the cargo. In it, they found a mysterious black crystal ball which was cursed and transformed those within its radius of effect into bloodthirsty maniacs. The wagon's driver was in reality a disguised &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, and the theft and transformation were parts of his plan to upset things in the southern lands so the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; could gain a foothold. Terrified villagers asked the heroes to slay the raving Syndicate band while the eredar warlock tried to intervene and stop them.\nGeography.\nThe Arathi Highlands, are immediately north of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; and south of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. Its climate is similar to that of the Wetlands to the south, though its higher elevation keeps it free of the bogs and marshy pools that would otherwise form the constant rain, but otherwise the geography is similar. The air is cool and the skies are unvarying gray. The Highlands are bleak and dismal.\nTo the north is &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, now collapsed and gaping wide. South is the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;, which bridges the gap between Lordaeron and Khaz Modan. Mountains to the east prevent easy access to the sea, and the Highlands' western coast is bleak, windswept and cold. Ancient ruins are scattered across the land. &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20ore\"&gt;Bloodstone ore&lt;/a&gt; is found in the deepest mines within the Arathi Highlands.\nSpeculation.\nThe eastern-most areas of the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;) may be considered part of the Arathi Highlands, as \"\" indicates that &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s camp in a forested area west of Durnholde and east of a river (presumably the one east of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\") is within Arathi. The Highlands may, as a region, run up to this river, although due to Durnholde's inclusion Stromgarde's domain is likely still bounded by &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is a flat but craggy region that has traditionally been the home of the humans of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, who gave the region its name. The main hubs of activity are now &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;Refuge Pointe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;, which houses bases for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The large city of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; lies in ruins to the southwest, and pockets of &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; resistance dot the land. The Boulderfist ogres also infest Arathor, and prove to be a constant threat to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; factions vying for supremacy.\nThe Syndicate, Boulderfist ogres and the beleaguered human defenders of Stromgarde battle for supremacy in this gray, dismal realm. Prince &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; leads the human defenders, and his mighty city of Stromgarde is a ruined battleground where the three factions wage guerrilla war. The Trollbane family\u2019s holdings include several ancient human artifacts, and a group called the &lt;a href=\"Caretakers\"&gt;Caretakers&lt;/a&gt; protects and preserves the most important pieces. To the south is the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;, a massive dwarven construction that bridges the canal between Lordaeron and &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Arathi Highlands were once the cradle of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; civilization, as it marks the place where the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;Empire of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; was founded and where the first real contact between elves and humans was made, during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. From the great city of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, the Human Empire controlled nearly all of the eastern lands. After the Empire's collapse, the city of Strom was largely abandoned save for a contingent of the Imperial Guard. These Guardsmen founded a new martial kingdom known as &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, establishing their capital in the old city of Strom. Over time, they also built a village (later known as &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;) further to the east. During the Second War, the forces of Stromgarde, now ruled by &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, were an instrumental part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s ground forces. Despite this, the Arathi Highlands, and Stromgarde itself was overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Second War, Stromgarde was rebuilt, and the former village that was to become Hammerfall was converted into an internment camp to hold the hated &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The nation managed to escape the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; but was soon afterward overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;. The remnant of the army was forced to flee the city and take refuge in a small canyon to the north, in what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe\"&gt;Refuge Pointe&lt;/a&gt;. Now, four years after the Third War, the area has become a battle zone between many different factions. The Alliance fights to aid the former nation of Stromgarde in recapturing its capital and reestablishing control over the region.

The &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; is also in the area, trying to claim yet another territory for its jealous nobles.

They were a race of conquerors, but recognized the wisdom in extending cooperation and equality to the tribes they defeated\u2014qualities which made humanity strong. The &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, the one-time heartland of their empire, are named after them.\nHistory.\nFounding of Arathor.\nFor millennia, the early human tribes flourished in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, constantly warring with one another for land and power. The Arathi tribe lived on the northeastern borders between human lands and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; and had a long history of skirmishes with the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s. They had a reputation as fierce warriors and held to the oldest ways of weaponsmithing.\nIn 2,800 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls began launching more aggressive incursions into human territories. The Arathi realized that the trolls were becoming too great a threat to ignore and that humanity would stand little chance in a true war against the Amani if they remained divided. The Arathi's warlord, &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;, declared himself king and embarked on a campaign to unite all of the tribes under a single banner so that they could provide a unified front against the trolls. Over the course of six years, Thoradin and the Arathi brought the other tribes to heel through political marriages, promises of wealth and land, or conquest. After each victory, the Arathi offered the conquered people peace and equality in Thoradin's envisioned new human nation, thereby winning the loyalty of their former enemies. This strategy was a new one among humans, a testament to both the youth of their race and their willingness to gain strength through clear-sighted pragmatism.\nThoradin recruited the &lt;a href=\"Alteraci%20tribe\"&gt;Alteraci tribe&lt;/a&gt; by besting their leader &lt;a href=\"Ignaeus%20Trollbane\"&gt;Ignaeus&lt;/a&gt; in a duel, and the &lt;a href=\"Lordain%27s%20tribe\"&gt;people of the Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; by appealing to their religious beliefs and promising to spread their ways among the Arathi. He convinced all of the tribal leaders to lend him their weapons and had Arathi blacksmiths add shards from each one to Thoradin's own greatsword, &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt;. This secured the loyalty of the tribes, since the human warlords believed that the spirits of their ancestors lived on in their weapons and none would dare rise up against Thoradin and risk striking the sword that contained their own forebears. Eventually the Arathi tribe came to include many disparate tribes. Thoradin named his new, united kingdom &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and founded a capital, &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, in the region now named the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Arathor went on to ally with the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; against the Amani, ultimately defeating them in the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. The high elves subsequently made a pledge of loyalty and friendship to Arathor and to Thoradin's bloodline.\nLast of the Arathi.\nArathor endured for over a millennium but eventually began to split apart into the modern &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. In 1,200 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, Strom's noble families sought to leave the Arathi Highlands in favor of the more fertile &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Thoradin's heirs, the last descendants of the Arathi, argued that Strom should not be abandoned, but the nobles left regardless. Not long thereafter, the Arathi descendants, led by a member of Thoradin's line named &lt;a href=\"Faldir\"&gt;Faldir&lt;/a&gt;, also left Arathor and traveled south, where they founded the nation of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. In stories among the northern kingdoms, the last of the Arathi were remembered as having disappeared into the southern wilderness of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; after Arathor's collapse.\nThe last descendant of the Arathi bloodline was Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, who, like his ancestor Thoradin, was a great warrior and rose to lead the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the war, he reminded the high elves of Quel'Thalas of the oath they had sworn his ancestor in order to secure their help against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. With Lothar's death at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, the bloodline came to an end.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Arathi were a &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s which founded the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Empire of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. They saw the potential in uniting the individual human tribes, particularly when faced with the increasing danger of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; warbands.\nFor thousands of years after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the human tribes teetered on the brink of extinction as their numbers were winnowed by an ever-increasing struggle simply to gather what was needed for survival. For millennia they persevered, wandering ever further afield in search of food, wood and refuge. Finally, the clouds parted. The sun returned and green sprouts pushed through the ash-fertilized earth of the sere plains. The surviving tribes of humans sent out intrepid bands to explore the reborn world and to find their long-lost brethren. Slowly, trade routes were established across the revitalized world. However, the savage trolls had survived their own hardships and emerged to once again attack the human merchants and travelers. Soon the trolls were bold enough to raid settlements, pillaging the towns and taking away slaves and fodder for their heathen rituals. Around -2,800 BDP, the strongest of the human tribes, the Arathi, convinced the scattered threads of humanity to gather under their rule and wove them together into the empire of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. Though some tribes chafed when their destinies were bound together, the Arathi assured them the land would always belong to all peoples and named the land as a whole in homage to their ancient ancestors: &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;."}

After victory, by offering equality and peace to the people they conquered, the Arathi were able to form a powerful nation, Arathor. The capital of Strom was built, and the humans in the continent that would later become &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; traveled to its protection.\nThe &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, were in open war with the trolls. On the verge of defeat, they sent ambassadors to Strom to plead for assistance from the human king, &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for support, the elves agreed to instruct one hundred humans in the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Through the military might of Strom, and the magic wielded by the elves and new human &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, the trolls were soundly defeated. This great conflict, and first large scale war in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, was later dubbed the \"&lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;\". To thank &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt; for his sacrifice, the humans named the continent &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in his honor.\n&lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; has been the site of one or more human fortifications dating back to the days of the empire.\nFracture.\nFollowing the defeat of the trolls, the human mages that had been instructed by the high elves eventually chose to leave Strom and found their own nation, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to the study and use of magic. 2,600 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; escaped from Dalaran to spread his misery across Arathor. In time, other city-states were founded: &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the nobility decided to move from Strom to the fertile lands of the north, founding &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, while the heirs of King Thoradin traveled far south to form the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The few remaining loyal defenders of Strom renamed it &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; thus creating the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, a shell of what was left of a once-great empire.\nModern ramifications.\nThe human nations that splintered off from Arathor would not be united again until the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, in which the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was formed to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, as the last descendant of the Arathi, was able to call upon the humans of Lordaeron as well as the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; to join this new alliance of many races in payment for the help provided by the humans of Arathor during the Troll Wars.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Empire of Arathor (or the Arathorian Empire) was a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; that existed millennia ago on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

Soon the trolls were bold enough to raid settlements, pillaging the towns and taking away slaves and fodder for their heathen rituals. Around -2,800 BDP, the strongest of the human tribes, the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, convinced the scattered threads of humanity to gather under their rule and wove them together into the empire of Arathor. Though some tribes chafed when their destinies were bound together, the Arathi assured them the land would always belong to all peoples and named the land as a whole in homage to their ancient ancestors: &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nTogether, the humans constructed the fortress city of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; and raised an army that pushed back the trolls. Yet raids by the trolls continued to prevent any large-scale farming and remained a danger to anyone traveling outside the empire's protection. The leaders of the tribes gathered in Strom to try to conceive a strategy when word came of an &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; emissary at the city gates. The stunned humans, who had long believed all the &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; destroyed in the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, were quick to bring the envoy into their council. The envoy explained that long after the destruction wrought by the Sundering, some of the survivors had made their way to northern Azeroth and established a new kingdom, called &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and a new source of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al power, called the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. She also told how the elves were waging their own war with the trolls and how the elven defenses were perilously close to falling under the onslaught. The elves requested assistance from the army of the human empire to stave off an oncoming assault that threatened to shatter the borders of the elven nation. After discussion, Arathor agreed to help Quel'Thalas \u2014 but required that the elves taught humans the ways of magic and sorcery. The elves were quick to agree, and the combined elven and human forces drove back the trolls on both fronts until the bestial tribes held a mere shadow of their former power.\nExpansion.\nWith the threat of the trolls removed, the humans spent the next centuries expanding their borders until the Empire of Arathor nearly covered the continent. As their lust for power pushed them to master the arts of magic they were learning from the elves, so did their lust for land, pulling them southward into the mountains. There, they encountered a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; expedition gathering supplies, and the two peoples met for the first time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and the humans of Arathor met under a bright sun, and soon became close allies. The humans provided the dwarves with a wide array of surface goods, and the dwarves traded the finished goods produced in their underground workshops. Passing through the dwarven lands in peace, the humans expanded their empire into the southern half of the continent. They would also name the northern half of it with a combination of words from the human, elven, and dwarven languages: lorn, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; for \"land\"; daer, the &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;human word&lt;/a&gt; for \"people\"; and ronae, \"peaceful\" in the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;elven tongue&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 hence, &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. All the races thought it was the dawn of a second great age; they would soon learn, to their sorrow, that it was already close to twilight.\nAfter beginning to use &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic, the humans noticed that &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were showing up on their territory, so the humans quietly went to the high elves and told them what was happening. The elves told them about how the use of arcane magic attracted the Burning Legion's attention long ago. Obviously the Legion was still drawn to it, so the high elves explained that as long as humans continued to use arcane magic, demons would keep showing up. The humans and high elves then agreed to create the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the demons that were inevitably going to appear.\nDissolution.\nAs they quickly embraced the ways of magic, human &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s rose in power until they matched and even surpassed their elven tutors. In parts of the empire, human &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s cleared fields, hunted &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and reshaped the earth itself at their whim. To many across Arathor and to some on its ruling council, this seemed at best a too easy path and at worst an abuse of a sacred power. Confronting the &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s took the Empire of Arathor over the brink of civil war as the \"&lt;a href=\"magocrat\"&gt;magocrat&lt;/a&gt;s\" carved out their &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;own territory&lt;/a&gt; where magic could be practiced without restriction. In some places, those fearful or distrustful of magic banded close to one another to prevent the mages from taking power, while others compromised and allowed the free use of magic so long as it was policed by overseers.\nWhen all was said and done, around -1,200 BDP, the sprawling Empire of Arathor had grown too large, and civil unrest had make it to fall apart into seven separate nations: &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;."}

At the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he joined the ranks of the reformed Order of the Silver Hand and pledged his allegiance to its new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt;. As a member of the order's war council, he participated in the meetings for important decisions, and followed the Highlord on their &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to find his parents.\nSince the end of the invasion, he continued his activities as a paladin and was able to take the time to reconnect with his family.\nBiography.\nArator was only a child when Turalyon and Alleria accompanied Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; beyond the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Once, during a frosty winter day, Arator played in the courtyard of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; with a wooden sword, aiming at a &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt; but hitting a pillar instead. His mother watched him sadly and told him war was not glory. He was apparently well-known by members of the Expedition, including &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, who called him \"Little Arator\". Turalyon and Alleria, along with the rest of the Expedition, were believed to have died when Khadgar sealed the Dark Portal. With his parents gone, Arator was raised by his aunt &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; and uncle &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa described him as a blessing in their home and in time, a guide for her own children, &lt;a href=\"Giramar\"&gt;Giramar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galadin\"&gt;Galadin&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen his mother Alleria left, Arator was still very young. A few years later, he was present at a ceremony in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, sitting on the shoulders of a &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knight of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and looking up at the statue of his mother, a face he couldn't remember. Alleria was observing this from aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\", the vessel of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, and sent her feelings to Arator through the Light. When he received her emotions the young Arator looked around, smiled, and then reached out to her statue. He would return again and again to the Valley of Heroes to see her face, knowing she would always love him.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nEighteen years after the Alliance Expedition left, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; reopened the Portal and crossed over into Draenor, now known as Outland. Arator, who has grown up to become a paladin in his father's footsteps, accompanied the Alliance reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde\"&gt;Nethergarde&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where he remains as he searches for his missing parents. There, he met &lt;a href=\"Father%20Malgor%20Devidicus\"&gt;Father Malgor Devidicus&lt;/a&gt; who told him that he and his father were the best of friends, as he was the one who took care of keeping Turalyon healthy, before breaking down in tears, feeling responsible for Turalyon's disappearance. Arator asks the innkeeper &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Limbardi\"&gt;Sid Limbardi&lt;/a&gt; to keep an eye on him and make sure he is sober next time, as he is the only link between him and his parents.\nSince Danath Trollbane was a family friend, he pledged his sword to Danath and the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Arator moves to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; where he attends the rebirth of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the presentation of its new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He can be seen kneeling before a statue of his father &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, that crashed towards the coast of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, and listening to the message of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to save Azeroth by bringing the heart of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, Arator was summoned at the request of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; to be present during the meeting of the Silver Hand, as a leader of the Order, where he says he heard rumors that they have recently found a message from his parents.\nWhen Arator approached the Light's Heart, it felt his presence and revealed a message from his father, he learned that for him it has been \"ages\" that he and Alleria have fought the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; across the stars, and that he had a message for his son: the Legion was coming to Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; had been ordered to destroy everything Turalyon held dear. Turalyon told Arator that he must gather the defenders of the Light and fight, or all would be lost.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and the discoveries on &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; 's &lt;a href=\"Codex%20of%20Command\"&gt;Codex of Command&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of the Silver Hand were mobilized by Arator, &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; to launch an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; and destroy a Legion portal, but they were captured and imprisoned on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. They would be freed by the Highlord of the Silver Hand and the High Priest of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, and learned from a &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Mysterious Stranger&lt;/a&gt; that Balnazzar and his armies were about to attack the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, headquarters of the Conclave, hidden deep within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, he is present with the troops of the Silver Hand who came to support the priests of the Conclave. He fought against the hordes of demons summoned by Balnazzar, until &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; came and helped them to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; for good.\nArator later travels with his aunt &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; aboard the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", to Argus. He reunites with his parents and questions why they did not reach out to their people or to him. His mother responds that every choice they made was to keep him safe, and that it broke their hearts to be apart from him. She vows that, now that they are reunited, she will not let them separate again. He has a conversation with Vereesa regarding the fate of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and what Vereesa will tell Alleria, to which Vereesa responds that the thought of the conversation fills her with dread and the truth will break Alleria's heart.\nArator can also be found at &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Ridge\"&gt;Darkfall Ridge&lt;/a&gt; where he fights demons seeking to reach the \"Vindicaar\".\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; is imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, Arator expresses uncertainty despite his joy of at long last finding his parents. The people who gave him life have been absent for it, and despite their fights to keep him safe they cannot suddenly become a happy family. They know next to nothing about him, and he has only legends of them. Alleria, Turalyon, and Arator have much to learn about one another and many wounds to heal, but at least they will do it together.\nBefore the Storm.\nJust before the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon told &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that he and Arator were very similar, and that he'd ask his son to come to Stormwind soon.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAn alternate version of Arator appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Within the vision, Alleria has fallen to the madness of the void and is orchestrating the downfall of Stormwind from the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. There, Turalyon is killed by Alleria as the former attempts to reason with her, dying just as adventurers enter into the vision, begging them to save his son. The adventurers are ultimately unsuccessful, as Alleria forces Arator into a portal of the void before engaging the adventurers and being ultimately defeated; with no resolution to Arator's fate, though this is inconsequential as it is ultimately not real.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Arator and his family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt;. At some point during the party, he chatted amicably with &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt; under a tree, with whom he developed a friendship, and showed the prince a beautiful ceremonial dagger that he had worn at the wedding.\nQuotes.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nI was only an infant when my father was deployed to this wasteland. All that I have ever known of him is what others have told me. Do your dreams change, &lt;name&gt;? Mine do not. I have one dream: A crimson skyline envelops me as Legion, numbering beyond comprehension, battle in the distance. I kneel before the body of a man, presumably my father, and weep. As he is gasping for air, his body wholly crushed, he whispers something. Despite every effort, I am unable to hear what he is trying to tell me."}

Originally created by the other Eternal Ones in the ancient past to replace &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, the original judge of souls, the Arbiter carried out her duty for most of known history. She and Oribos were served by the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s. The Arbiter herself was ever silent; the attendant &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; served as her Honored Voice to speak on her behalf.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Arbiter was struck dormant by the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;corrupted soul of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, causing all new souls to flow past her into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. She was later destroyed for good by Zovaal, who consumed her essence in order to regain his full power. The &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; later took her place to become the new Arbiter, restoring balance to the Shadowlands.\nBackground.\nOrigin.\nThe Arbiter's existence predates all memory\u2014even older than the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, according to some accounts. The first being to hold the title of &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; was the Eternal One &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, but when he defied the will of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and betrayed his duty as Arbiter, the other Eternal Ones stripped him of his power and banished him to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to make him its Jailer. They then used his &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; to construct a new Arbiter, one that would be dispassionate and just and would take up his role of judging souls. According to Zovaal himself, he was \"torn in two\", and &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; described the Arbiter and the Jailer as \"two parts of a whole\". According to Zovaal, the Eternal Ones designed the new Arbiter to be devoid of will to ensure that she would not defy the design of the First Ones like he had done.\nRegarded as infallible and ever wise, the new Arbiter carried out her duty and kept the Shadowlands in perfect order for countless eons. She and Oribos were served by the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s, who believe themselves to have been created by her. Since the Arbiter (unlike her predecessor) never spoke a single word aloud, the attendant &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; was given the honor of speaking on her behalf.\nThe fact that she'd been created to replace Zovaal was not common knowledge. To most denizens of the Shadowlands, her origin was as shrouded in mystery as that of the other Eternal Ones. The attendants incorrectly believed that she'd always been the one to hold the title and that she'd been created by the First Ones themselves, as well as that she'd voluntarily chosen to live in the heart of Oribos. The attendants also insisted that the Arbiter had always been a fair and implacable judge. However, there are still some very ancient and worn records that reference a time when the Arbiter was \"not quite so benevolent\", implying that they're remnants from Zovaal's time as Arbiter. The Jailer was said to be filled with hatred for the Arbiter, and Tal-Inara believed that if he struck her down, it would cause the end of everything the First Ones made.\nAt some point in the ancient past, the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; infused the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;titan world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; with Death magic in order to turn him into a weapon against the Arbiter: if he was killed, his soul would travel to Oribos and slam into the Arbiter's heart. As she had been made to judge mortal souls and not something as powerful as a mad and broken world-soul, this would cause her to break down.\nMuch later, as part of his alliance with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Jailer had his &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; show many of the afterlives to her. Sylvanas saw countless cases of souls being separated from their loved ones and assigned to seemingly illogical and unfair fates, which led her to conclude that the Arbiter was fundamentally flawed\u2014an uncaring judge who had never been alive and therefore couldn't understand any of the emotions and experiences that make mortals what they are.\nThe breaking.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, mortals in the world of the living killed the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;world-soul of Argus&lt;/a&gt;. As the Jailer and the nathrezim had planned, Argus' soul flew to Oribos and rendered the Arbiter dormant, causing her to cease directing souls to their just afterlives. Instead, all souls entering the Shadowlands began flowing past her to hurtle directly into the Maw. This compromised the very purpose of the Shadowlands as the realms of Death became starved of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the vital resource each soul brings with them\u2014even as the Maw and its master Zovaal grew in power from the influx of souls. The attendants did not understand what had happened and tried in vain to unravel the mystery. When &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s first arrived in Oribos, the Arbiter briefly stirred but then returned to her dormant state.\nAfter claiming four of the five &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;s he was after, the Jailer managed to expand the Maw to envelop Oribos and ascended to the Arbiter's Crucible. While his ally Sylvanas held off his enemies, the Jailer destroyed the Arbiter's defenses and merged with her, absorbing her essence and sigil into himself and causing her physical form to dissolve. With his stolen power reclaimed, he opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; and escaped. Though the four &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s had at this point managed to recreate their respective sigils, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; needed to find something to replace the Arbiter's sigil as well in order to create a key that would allow him and his allies to pursue Zovaal to his destination.\nLegacy.\nAlthough the Arbiter's presence was lost to darkness, her voice continued to \"sing\" within Tal-Inara and the other attendants, allowing them to recreate her sigil with the Primus' help. They then used all five sigils to open a portal of their own to Zereth Mortis.\nNormally, Zereth Mortis would have created a new being to take the Arbiter's place, but the invasion of the Jailer and his &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; forces disrupted the realm to the point where this was no longer possible. The &lt;a href=\"Automa%23Oracle\"&gt;oracle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;Saezurah&lt;/a&gt; set out to manually create a new Arbiter, but her ritual was interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to be transformed into the new Arbiter and took his predecessor's place in the Crucible to once again direct the flow of souls to their rightful afterlives.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

There, all of the soul's contents\u2014deeds, misdeeds, thoughts, accomplishments, and failures\u2014are laid bare, absorbed, and understood by the Arbiter in the merest fraction of a moment\u2014an instant so brief that even the most precise &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; instruments cannot measure it. With this knowledge, the Arbiter then chooses an ideal afterlife for the soul from one of the infinite realms of the Shadowlands, opens one of the gateways surrounding the Crucible, and sends the soul through to their destination. The current Arbiter, &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;, gives each soul a voice in which afterlife to be sent to, unlike the previous two Arbiters.\nIf the Arbiter did not exist to guide souls to their rightful destination, they would be lost forever within the infinite realms. In rare cases, if a soul proves to be unsuited to an afterlife, they can be sent back to Oribos to be reevaluated by the Arbiter and assigned to a different destination. Due to their central role, the Arbiter's decisions affect more than just souls, but the Shadowlands in their entirety.\nThe Arbiter is served by the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s, who tend to the Eternal City so their master can perform the judgment of souls without interruption.\nHistory.\nZovaal, the first Arbiter.\nThe original Arbiter, created by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, was named &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;. However, he at some point came to believe that the divided cosmos that the First Ones had created was flawed and would not be able to survive an unknown threat that he foresaw coming in the future. He believed that the &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;s held by himself and his fellow Eternal Ones were keys to forbidden knowledge locked within Zereth Mortis' &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; that he could use to remake reality, and consequently tried to claim the sigils from his siblings by force. For his crimes, the Eternal Ones stripped Zovaal of his power and used &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic to bind him to the Maw, making him its Jailer.\nAs the Jailer, Zovaal continued to wield the &lt;a href=\"%3AGavel%20of%20the%20First%20Arbiter\"&gt;:Gavel of the First Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, a weapon with the power to send souls to their rightful afterlives when swung.\nThe second Arbiter.\nTo replace Zovaal, the Eternal Ones used his &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; and sigil to construct a &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;new Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, one that would be dispassionate and just. This Arbiter continued carrying out her duty in Oribos, keeping the Shadowlands in order for countless eons. The fact that the second Arbiter was created to replace Zovaal was not common knowledge. To most, the second Arbiter's origin was shrouded in mystery, and the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s of Oribos incorrectly believed that she had been created by the First Ones themselves. This Arbiter was eternally silent, so the attendant &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; was chosen to be her Honored Voice and speak on her behalf.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; in the world of the living, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; slew the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;world-soul of Argus&lt;/a&gt;. As part of a \"gambit\" by Zovaal, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; had secretly corrupted Argus with Death magic in order to turn him into \"a maul with which to crush the Arbiter\". As a result, Argus' soul traveled to Oribos and slammed into the Arbiter, causing her to fall dormant and cease directing souls to their just afterlives. Instead, all souls entering the Shadowlands began flowing past her to hurtle directly into the Maw. This compromised the very purpose of the Shadowlands as the realms of Death became starved of anima\u2014the vital resource each soul brings with them\u2014even as the Maw and its master Zovaal grew in power. Zovaal later managed to engulf Oribos in the Maw and destroy his replacement by reclaiming his sigil from her. This restored him to his full power and allowed him to open a portal to Zereth Mortis.\nPelagos, the third Arbiter.\nWithout an Arbiter to stem the flow of souls to the Maw, the Shadowlands would never be able to be repaired. Zereth Mortis would normally have created a new being to take the Arbiter's place, but the invasion of the Jailer and his &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; forces disrupted the realm to the point where this was no longer possible. Instead, the &lt;a href=\"automa%23Oracle\"&gt;oracle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;Saezurah&lt;/a&gt; contacted a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; and their companion, the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; aspirant &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;, and guided the former into retrieving an empty &lt;a href=\"vessel\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt; which would serve as the body of a new Arbiter. However, to be completed, it needed to be infused with a soul from the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter several trials and tribulations, the Maw Walker and their allies helped Saezurah begin the ritual, but it was interrupted by a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who summoned the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Echo of Argus&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of having Argus take the vessel and become an Eternal One. The Maw Walker defeated the echo, but the vessel was left without a soul. Unexpectedly, Pelagos offered himself up in service to the Shadowlands. Saezurah placed his soul in the vessel and transformed him into the new Arbiter. He then took his place in the Crucible to direct the flow of souls to the afterlives once more; a massive step toward restoring balance to the Shadowlands. Pelagos retained his personality and identity and a desire to judge each soul with compassion. He decided to give each soul a voice in which afterlife they wanted to be sent to, and that no soul would ever again be sent to the Maw since he believed that everyone deserved a chance at redemption."}

{"id": "490277", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=490277", "title": "Arcan'dor", "text": "An arcan'dor (or mana tree) is a type of magical fruit tree that balances &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic by feeding on &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s. It does not require any soil or sunlight, nor does it seem to need water to survive.\nWithout ley line energy, an awakening seed will quickly wither and die. As it is crafted flora which does not naturally occur on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, great hands-on care is required for these trees to grow safely to their true potential.\nLocusts are a pest species to arcan'dor and must be repelled for the trees well being. Its growth is fairly rapid compared to natural trees. The wood is a gleaming white. Even if a piece of its wood is separated from the rest of the tree, the piece will not die, as invisible threads of magic bind all pieces of the arcan'dor together.\nOne of the biggest dangers involved during the growing stage is the arcane energy overwhelming the natural half - the physical tree itself acting as a container, or heart, for the energy. The first sign is the arcan'dor producing a constant manastorm from its crown. When the heart can no longer contain it, the arcane not only breaks free and kills the tree, but will likely kill every living thing in its vicinity. The lesser disastrous outcome is creatures becoming twisted and mutated by the flash of uncontrolled magic, such as humanoids and &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s. The only known procedure to restore balance is to infuse the tree with the essence of life: pure, wild nature magic from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; itself. \nThe time when an arcan'dor is preparing to mature to its final, fruit-bearing stage is critical. The tree begins this by drawing in incredible amounts of leyline energy, which is required in preparation for a final burst of growth. However, if the arcan'dor does not receive all the power it needs to achieve this sudden growth rate, it will die. One way to do this is a massive, if brief, surge in the ley lines it feeds upon.\nOnce mature, the arcan'dor grows long vines from its branches, which hang straight down. On the end of each vine the tree produces a single fruit. Though it takes time to grow, once plucked, the vine will produce another fruit. The fruit itself apparently tastes a little tart.\nAn interesting fact, considering arcan'dor are all about balance, is that a mature tree grows in perfect symmetry: when viewed from the front, back, or side, each half is the mirror image of the other.\nHistory.\nThousands of years ago, as the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; were just beginning to unravel the mysteries of the arcane, a small enclave of \"keepers\" who were not full druids met with the first of the elven magi. In the pale moonlight, they formed an order that would seek to bring the arcane into balance using nature itself as a vessel. Thus the arcan'dor were created.\nMany years ago, exiles from &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Falanaar\"&gt;Falanaar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalker Farodin&lt;/a&gt;, whose masters were part of the long since gone order that created the arcan'dor, took pity on them and gifted them with an arcan'dor. For a time it sustained them and they were safe, but it did not last forever. The arcan'dor became unstable and died, and in a flash of wild magic the elves were twisted, becoming the &lt;a href=\"fal%27dorei\"&gt;fal'dorei&lt;/a&gt;. The remains of the arcan'dor are known as the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Locus\"&gt;Shattered Locus&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarodin kept watch over an arcan'dor seed in the wilds of Suramar for 10,000 years. A &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; who would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Theryn\"&gt;Theryn&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; was exposed to the seed, giving him peace. When &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; sent an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the seed after learning about it through Theryn's memories, the seed was stolen by fal'dorei that intended to use its power to return to the surface. Farodin and the adventurer slew the fal'dorei and took the seed to Shal'Aran, where it could drink of the ley line there and grow. Beneath the arcan'dor, the nightfallen would be renewed. Eventually, the Shal'Aran arcan'dor began to show signs of failing like what had happened to the one in Falanaar, with its arcane and nature magics unbalanced and the arcane threatening to devour it whole. In order to balance them out, Farodin requested the adventurer to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Purified%20Life%20Essence\"&gt;Purified Life Essence&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater when the tree was about to mature, by redirecting energy flows from the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt; and creating a surge of arcane, the nightfallen were able to feed the arcan'dor with enough energy to complete the critical stage, and it began producing magical fruit. Not only did eating it nourish Thalyssra and the other nightfallen refugees of Shal'Aran, but a single fruit also reverses the nightfallen state and restores the individual back into a nightborne. Just as a proper arcan'dor is a balance between arcane and nature, its fruit brings the life essence and the arcane spirit of the shal'dorei into harmony, freeing them from their addiction to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;."}

Arcanagos traveled to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; with Medivh's mother, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, to confront him about it. The tower was crowded with nobles who were expecting a gala, and so Aegwynn entered alone at first, hoping to convince Medivh to give up his power peacefully. After Medivh revealed that said power was that of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, he and Aegwynn began to fight, shaking the tower to its foundations and causing the would-be revelers to flee. When Aegwynn was temporarily incapacitated, Arcanagos joined in.\nHowever, despite being a blue dragon, Arcanagos was severely outmatched. Sargeras struck him down, burning him from the inside out until all that was left was bone. Her friend's death sent Aegwynn further into a rage, and as their duel continued, Aegwynn slowly gained the upper hand.\nThe spell Medivh used against the dragon imparted some of his own essence into Arcanagos, imbuing him with fiery wrath. In order to divine information about Medivh, the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; has adventurers resurrect the dead dragon in order to extract the arcane essence. Arcanagos appears, now as a fiery skeletal monstrosity known as &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt;, and proceeds to attack those who summon him.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentions in his reports that the agents he sent to meet the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Shade of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; had seen Nightbane appear upon their arrival, at least, that's what their charred reports say.\nOld lore.\nArcanagos's story before \"Chronicle Volume 2\" was told in the &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20quest%20chain\"&gt;Nightbane quest chain&lt;/a&gt;:\nArcanagos sensed Medivh was being used by a dark and sinister force, and pleaded with him to abandon the tower before the situation escalated out of control. When Medivh refused to leave his residence, the blue dragon attempted to remove him by force. The two masters of the arcane fought briefly, trading blows, but the blue wyrm met his match in the corrupted Titan-imbued &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Burning from a horrific spell from the inside out, Arcanagos frantically flew off and crashed into the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, dying a painful death, his bones shattering and falling down to scatter the surrounding area."}

{"id": "17654", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17654", "title": "Arcane", "text": "Arcane magic (also called Order magic, arcane energy, or arcana) is a cold and intellectual &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; that warps &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, space, and controls the flow of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, which is just a measure of a fundamental power\u2014if mana were water, then arcane would be steam pressure. Though extremely volatile, arcane is so similar to an element it might as well be one, for all magical intents and purposes. As the manifestation of &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, arcane is the language of order and the opposite end of the spectrum from &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;, which represents &lt;a href=\"Disorder\"&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins and characteristics.\n&lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; is most commonly perceived in reality as arcane magic. Arcane energy is innately volatile, and wielding it requires intense precision and concentration. &lt;a href=\"Disorder\"&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, manifests as highly destructive &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, a destructive and extremely addictive energy originating as a result of the mutual destruction of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; as they collide on a cosmic scale in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Arcane energy counters and is countered by fel energy, its polar opposite. Arcane has been described as the \"base fabric\" of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt;, and like all other types of magic, can be animated, the prime example of this being the &lt;a href=\"arcane%20elemental\"&gt;arcane elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. It can be pulled from &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, channels of immense magical power that course through &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; itself. The ley lines are like blood vessels of the planet, carrying arcane magic instead of scarlet fluid, while volatile arcane energies has been described as the lifeblood of the nascent titan Azeroth.\nIn eons past, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon of Order&lt;/a&gt;, among the most powerful beings in the universe, used the primal \"language of the arcane\" to weave entire worlds into existence. Hailing from the far reaches of the cosmos, they shaped and brought life and order to countless planets across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nPure arcane appears white and/or violet. However, when used to bend other types of magic, it takes on the characteristics and appearance of those magics. Examples of this can be seen with element-based abilities used by mages, or the bronze glow of &lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;chronomancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe successful restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is compatible with arcane magic. The quel'dorei managed to link their &lt;a href=\"Runestones\"&gt;Runestones&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Thas%27alah\"&gt;Thas'alah&lt;/a&gt;, tying the power of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; to their arcane spells. However, life and arcane magics may simply refuse to \"cooperate\" if there is any imbalance between them, which can prevent the intended effect or be dangerous for the spellcasters.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, when a mage creates fire with arcane magic, all they do is concentrate the inherent nature of the fire contained in the surrounding area into one location in order to call it into being. When they run out of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, mages can no longer cast spells. As stated by &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, arcane magic draws its energy from the physical forces of the mage, and the only way to regenerate the body is by consuming food, especially protein. They can also use mana &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s prepared by &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s, or consume the essences of arcane creatures to gain mana.\nUses.\nIn general, arcane magic can be used to do nearly everything and is seemingly limited mostly by imagination, as it can be used to manipulate both space and time, and bend reality. It can be used to create objects such as &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Refreshment\"&gt;food or drinks&lt;/a&gt; or to &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Mana%20Gem\"&gt;conjure mana gems&lt;/a&gt; from nothing, and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Intellect\"&gt;briefly enhance personal intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Arcane can be used to turn yourself &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Invisibility\"&gt;and your allies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"invisible\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt;, to become inaudible, to create &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;multiple images of oneself&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Lan%27dalock\"&gt;other creatures&lt;/a&gt; capable of distracting enemies or assisting you in combat, or to &lt;a href=\"%3Apolymorph\"&gt;:polymorph&lt;/a&gt; objects and people into something else entirely, ranging from a variety of animals, to &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and elemental beings such as &lt;a href=\"mana%20surge\"&gt;mana surge&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"phoenixes\"&gt;phoenixes&lt;/a&gt; as well as to communicate from afar via projections and even &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Linguist\"&gt;enable understanding of other racial languages&lt;/a&gt;.\nWielders of arcane magic are usually called &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, who usually use it to create &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s or teleport people and objects. The magi &lt;a href=\"Umbranse%20the%20Spiritspeaker\"&gt;Umbranse&lt;/a&gt; was notably able to speak to those in the realm of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Tesseract\"&gt;Arcane Tesseract&lt;/a&gt;s to open rifts into other worlds. Arcane magic can be used with other types of magic to reinforce them, such as when &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; summoned an &lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;orb of fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Orb\"&gt;ice energy&lt;/a&gt;, along with an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Orb\"&gt;arcane orb&lt;/a&gt;, and combined them together. Another example is Khadgar infusing ice with arcane, rendering it extremely resilient, so much that it nullified the fel assault of entirely. Some Kirin Tor magi have used &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s in the past, implying the arcane can, under certain circumstances, bind other elements as well. The &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; schools seem to be related to the Arcane, with several of their spells described as \"simple manifestations of arcana\" by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Nakada\"&gt;Archmage Nakada&lt;/a&gt;, and can be even be combined as the &lt;a href=\"Frostfire\"&gt;Frostfire&lt;/a&gt; school. The draenei mage &lt;a href=\"Valaatu\"&gt;Valaatu&lt;/a&gt; has allegedly taught the arcane, frost and fire magics for over a century, feeling them just as strongly on Azeroth as she did other worlds.\nArcane spells can be used for protection. For example, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; have been able to generate larger arcane barriers shielding entire groups of people, and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; is able to maintain city-wide shields capable of repelling the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; night elves of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; were able to use arcane energy to shield their cities from the devastating effects of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Doan\"&gt;Arcanist Doan&lt;/a&gt; was able to temporarily render himself completely immune to all spells and attacks, magical and otherwise, by encasing himself in an arcane bubble. It is also possible for high-level magi to temporarily negate others' arcane abilities, sometimes with inhibitor crystals, even imprisoning them for an extended period of time, and it is not particularly difficult to block unwanted portals, as most civilized cities just use wards to prevent them.\nIn-game, in addition to the usual &lt;a href=\"mage%20abilities\"&gt;mage abilities&lt;/a&gt;, the arcane has been used to &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Shield%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;protect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"knock%20back\"&gt;knock back&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"charm\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"disorient\"&gt;disorient&lt;/a&gt;, bind, suffocate, reflect spells, conjure spellswords, control humanoids, restore health by reversing time, siphon health, drain energy, increase and decrease size, increase movement speed, summon enchanted tomes serving as effective &lt;a href=\"mailboxes\"&gt;mailboxes&lt;/a&gt;, and generate a barrier capable of automatically preventing death and restoring health.\nIt can be used to animate constructs and objects such as &lt;a href=\"arcane%20golem\"&gt;arcane golem&lt;/a&gt;s or brooms, power machinery, manipulate the fabric of &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; (usually by &lt;a href=\"Alter%20Time\"&gt;rewinding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Shield\"&gt;reversing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;slowing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;hastening&lt;/a&gt; its flow), access &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt;s, scry other places and peoples, view the past, sense the future by discerning fortunes, open locked doors, summon objects or individuals from other locations, share visions of others' memories, project visions of past events complete with sound, preserve and record messages inside enchanted crystals, form empathic bonds, &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;strip others of their spells and use them as your own&lt;/a&gt;, conjure illusions by &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;disguising yourself entirely&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Curse\"&gt;remove negative magical effects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erosion\"&gt;erode others' magical resistances&lt;/a&gt;, create &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Power\"&gt;runes of power&lt;/a&gt; capable of greatly amplifying your spells, &lt;a href=\"Supernova\"&gt;knock nearby enemies into the air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"evanesce\"&gt;briefly fade into other realms&lt;/a&gt; such as the astral plane and avoid all attacks, or simply &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blast\"&gt;cause massive destruction&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe individual members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, both past and present, are especially adept at manipulating arcane energies for various potent effects. For example, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; was able to suspend and lapse gravity itself in his immediate surrounding area, and created and enchanted seven &lt;a href=\"legendary\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; weapons able to fight remotely by themselves. &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; enveloped all of Dalaran in auras powerful enough to destroy any &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; which passed through its boundaries, and erected barriers blocking all teleportation into the city. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; once channeled a spell capable of briefly stopping time in his vicinity. &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; was able to awaken and pull the banished &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; from their long seclusion in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to fight for &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, despite having no connection with either them or the druids, and provided his favored servants with a semblance of sanity and human intelligence. &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;The Great Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously opened and maintained eight portals to locations scattered across three continents, and contained a pocket dimension capable of housing animals within his &lt;a href=\"Akazamzarak%27s%20Hat\"&gt;top hat&lt;/a&gt;. The Kirin Tor magi in &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; were able to shunt their town into a nearly impenetrable &lt;a href=\"pocket%20dimension\"&gt;pocket dimension&lt;/a&gt; in order to hide themselves from the Forsaken. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; have been able to &lt;a href=\"%3Ateleport\"&gt;:teleport&lt;/a&gt; the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; across vast distances, notably from &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and from Karazhan to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Blink%20of%20an%20Eye\"&gt;in the blink of an eye&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was able to raise her father's &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20flagship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; from the depths of the ocean, and later flew it into the skies above &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt; to destroy part of the stronghold's defenses using cannons charged with raw arcane energy.\nOlder and more experienced spellcasters are capable of even more extraordinary and formidable feats using the arcane. The &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of Magic &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; was able to channel raw energy allegedly sufficient to destroy his entire planet ten times over through the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The Aspect of Time &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; made the entire &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; race &lt;a href=\"immortal\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt; for 10,000 years through his blessing of temporal magic upon &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Former &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardians of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; were able to permanently bind and tether spirits to the living world, as Alodi did with himself, and even return the dead back to life, as Aegwynn did with &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn was able to extend her natural life span by nearly a thousand years, and created &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; itself by harnessing the full potential of &lt;a href=\"%3AAluneth\"&gt;:Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;'s energies near a confluence of ley lines, causing the great tower to rise from the earth. \nAs the last ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s mastery of the arcane far surpassing and predating even the greatest of the human magi. In \"a frightening display of arcane power\", she notably shatter the &lt;a href=\"%3ATidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;:Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillar of Creation&lt;/a&gt; able to hold &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; at bay, and trapped the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt; in an eternal &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;ly state in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, unable to pass on from the world of the living even after ten millennia spent trying to break her spell. The Highborne of &lt;a href=\"Shandaral\"&gt;Shandaral&lt;/a&gt; accidentally caused an enormous explosion which forever transformed part of their continent &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; bathed their land, including &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, in eternal springtime after creating the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, while their &lt;a href=\"Runestone\"&gt;Runestone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mooncrystal\"&gt;mooncrystal&lt;/a&gt;-empowered barrier &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt; not only masked their magical activities from others, it made their realm nearly impenetrable for millennia. Empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; was able to place an entire invasion force comprised of three elven armies in a long-term temporal stasis or \"time lock\", and could scry countless possible futures to predict likely outcomes; in combat, she was able to stop the flow of time for all but herself and send her enemies back in time, repeatedly saving herself from being killed, although this required a considerable amount of even her energy. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; nearly destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; by tapping into the nexus of potent &lt;a href=\"ley%20lines\"&gt;ley lines&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and unleashing a massive \"tempest of arcane energy\" towards &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, causing fissures to erupt around the world.\nEffects on beings.\nThrough &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; became virtually &lt;a href=\"immortal\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt; by feeding on its potent source of arcane energy. Over their lengthy isolation, the exposure to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; gradually transformed the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; from their original appearance to their present darker, more night-based, form as the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; race was fundamentally changed from being constantly suffused in magic, and became &lt;a href=\"Magical%20addiction\"&gt;addicted&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s energies. With their source of magic gone, they all suffered acute pangs of withdrawal. Only the very old, the very young, and elves already in poor health died from it, however, the withdrawal also result in permanent mental or physical damage. Certain magical artifacts can ameliorate and even suppress the symptoms. The &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt; are those who failed to control their innate addiction to magic. Desperate and demented, they siphoned arcane magic in amounts exorbitant, causing them to physically transform them into emaciated, reckless, black-hearted fiends who would gladly kill for a few mana crystals.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;Demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s embrace &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, believing it necessary to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, they mark their bodies with arcane &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s in order to keep their fel forces in check. On the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt;, a former night elf mage, lost most of his former abilities (aside from occasionally glimpsing into faraway places) after becoming a demon hunter.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart from the magical stress of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s multiple portals, the arcane energies released altered the black dragon eggs left there by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in the &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt;s: ethereal dragons whose bodies are composed of energies from the Twisting Nether.\nThe arcane energies released by the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; dropped on Theramore turned its people purple for a fraction of a heartbeat, before they exploded in a cloud of lavender ash. Those further from the center of the blast were frozen like statues but crumbled into shining violet dust when touched. Saved by a portal of &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina barely surviving the blast and found herself radiating with arcane energy, which turn nearly all of her once golden hair to moonlight white.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Dimensius%20the%20All-Devouring\"&gt;Dimensius the All-Devouring&lt;/a&gt; opened countless gateways into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"K%27aresh\"&gt;K'aresh&lt;/a&gt;, bathing it in arcane and dark energies, the unimpeded flood of arcane energy tore away the then-mortal race's corporeal shells and infused their souls with enough energy so that they could subsist without a body. Members of this race, now called &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, took to binding themselves with enchanted strips of cloth to provide their souls with enough structure to survive.\nArcane-related items.\nIn the ancient past, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; used a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt; to infuse his &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; soldiers with &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; magic, binding them to his will. When the artifact was shattered, their unity was dispelled.\nMages have the ability to store mana into &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Gem\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; for future use without alchemical aid, while &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Bomb\"&gt;Arcane bombs&lt;/a&gt; are weapons designed to fight spellcasters, they drain mana, inflict damage, and prevent spellcasting for a short time.\n&lt;a href=\"Surge%20needle\"&gt;Surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s are massive constructs made of stone and arcane energy used to tap into or manipulate &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; used them to redirect the ley lines of Azeroth to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Manaforge\"&gt;Manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s are arcane machines created by the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in order to harvest the chaotic magics of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; is an orb of immense power, capable of magnifying and focusing arcane energy. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; used it to create and direct &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s. Its energy was used to animate &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; once used it to bind together thousands of &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s into a colossal tidal wave which nearly destroyed &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mana%20bomb\"&gt;Mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;s are powerful explosive devices developed by the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. They are fueled by pure arcane energy and kill instantly. With the Focusing Iris, &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; manufactured a massive mana bomb able to destroy &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;an entire city&lt;/a&gt;'s population and permanently scar the surrounding region, as well as projecting a dampening field disrupting and preventing all magical means of escape.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"demolisher\"&gt;demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s and arcane-enhanced payloads to fire on the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; fleet, and later to shoot from &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, burning it down.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, there are &lt;a href=\"eco-dome\"&gt;eco-dome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s made from the arcane in the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nArcane wells.\nThe Well of Eternity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was made from the very lifeblood of the nascent &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; ripped the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; out from Azeroth, it created a gaping hole in the planet's crust itself from which arcane energy was hemorrhaging. After the war against the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; healed the wound in the form of a lake of scintillating energies that they named the Well of Eternity. Its potent energies would nurture the bones of the world and empower life to take root in the land's rich soil.\nVolatile arcane magic was once concentrated in the Well of Eternity, but its destruction during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; spread arcane power throughout the world. The well collapsed into itself, and became the center of the Great Sea as an immense, violent whirlpool, named the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. Its waters churns constantly in a dizzying storm of tidal and arcane energy that seems to have no end. Before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan had filled several vials with enchanted liquid from the original well. He poured some of them into the lake atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, transforming the idyllic waters into &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;another fount of arcane power&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon Aspect &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; would then plant the world-tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; in the fount to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from using it as an entry to Azeroth.\nThe Sunwell.\nJust before the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; had been exiled from Mount Hyjal, &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; had secretly taken one of Illidan Stormrage's remaining vials from the custody of the night elves. Dath'Remar poured the vial into a small lake at the center of a nexus, and a brilliant fount of energy tore through the skies of Azeroth. The Highborne dubbed this glorious cradle of power \"the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;\", a name chosen in honor of Dath'Remar and his bold quest to reignite their culture. It was destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; sanctified the legendary Sunwell using the spark of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, reigniting it as a fount of both arcane power and &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoonwells.\n&lt;a href=\"Moonwell\"&gt;Moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s are hallowed repositories of a mix between the sacred waters of the Well of Eternity and the magic of nature. The waters were created by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; to maintain and restore their magical powers. Druids also take advantage of the moonwells' properties, which provide growth and protection to their surrounding lands, and the Sentinels revere the wells as shrines to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nightwell.\nFollowing the the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her followers harnessed the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, to create an immense fount of arcane magic. Known as the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, this source of power would nourish the sorcerers for thousands of years, and protect them from future threats. The &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt; is a complex labyrinthine built thousands of years ago that runs beneath the foundations of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s largest buildings, delivering the Nightwell's energies throughout the city. Before the creation of the Nightwell, it was used to deliver the energy of the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s beneath the land of Suramar. &lt;a href=\"Star%20Augur%20Etraeus\"&gt;Star Augur Etraeus&lt;/a&gt;, a skilled &lt;a href=\"astromancer\"&gt;astromancer&lt;/a&gt;, used the Nightwell to directly draw upon the energies of planets he scryed from other star systems.\nThe Shrine of Lost Souls.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Shrine of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; to free demons of their addiction to the Legion's &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic and bind them to his service. &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; believed that this same power source is what Illidan intended to offer the blood elves to free them of their addiction to the Sunwell. Strangely, its properties resembled greatly the Well of Eternity's.\nArcane wielders.\nIn the Warcraft universe, there is an instability, and &lt;a href=\"Arcanist\"&gt;those skilled in arcane magic&lt;/a&gt; have learned how to exploit that instability, being able to control the elements and other forces such as &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; is the elite cadre of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s in the known world, and the ruling conclave of &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; that leads the magical &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Magocracy of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome &lt;a href=\"sensitive\"&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; mortals have the ability to naturally sniff out &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and arcane magic, being able to detect &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s and possessed people on their own.\nMages.\n&lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Magi&lt;/a&gt; (also called magus, magician, &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;) are arcane spellcasters who favor magiks involving the cardinal elements of the universe. Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, most magi wear cloth armor, but arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, magi can summon bursts of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, setting groups of foes ablaze. When mages cast a spell, they employ magic formulas which they pronounce word by word in an intelligible manner, whether aloud or by mumbling like &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, and which according to &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; sound like \"the &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;language of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; spoken backwards, with the wrong syllables emphasized\".\nMages of the arcane are diviners of secrets, balancing the ebb and flow of incredible mystic energies. Unparalleled skill is required to manipulate the volatile forces of the universe. These practitioners push their magical knowledge to its very limits\u2014often to the brink of their own exhaustion, and at great risk to the world around them. Those who master this craft are capable of releasing a barrage of unrelenting power upon their enemies, drawing upon replenishing energies to maintain their assault for as long as the battle demands. Mages are often aged from the stress of the magical energies they wield, causing their hair to prematurely turn gray.\nEvery mage wielded the forces of magic differently, and if one was sensitive enough, one could tell the differences from one mage to the next.\nDepending on their choice of &lt;a href=\"Arcane%23Schools%20of%20arcane%20magic\"&gt;school of arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;, their talent, or the function in which they specialize, the mages may carry different titles: &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist\"&gt;Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyromancer\"&gt;Pyromancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20mage\"&gt;Cryomancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abjurer\"&gt;Abjurer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conjurer\"&gt;Conjurer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diviner\"&gt;Diviner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanter\"&gt;Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusionist\"&gt;Illusionist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Transmuter\"&gt;Transmuter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20mage\"&gt;Battle mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warmage\"&gt;Warmage&lt;/a&gt;, Warcaster, Arcanomancer, &lt;a href=\"Summoner\"&gt;Summoner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mage-Priest&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlue dragons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragons&lt;/a&gt; are the foremost experts on arcane magic. After the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; blessed &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and his flight with immense knowledge and power over the arcane, and the duty of ensuring it would never be abused. Magic is what most concerns the members of the blue dragonflight. Acquiring it, researching it, cataloging it. Blue dragons are masters of the arcane and they wield it with a natural, almost intrinsic, ease. Even the flight's dragonspawn armies are flush with magical aptitude. The blues believe that with this power comes a certain responsibility and so members of the blue flight can often be found in positions policing and monitoring the use of magic by non-dragons.\nSome blue dragons are seemingly immune to arcane magic.\nDraenei.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt;, once known as the &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;Eredar&lt;/a&gt;, are a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of supremely talented &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;-wielders who arose on the &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; countless millennia ago. Exceptionally skilled in magic, their mastery of the arcane arts were renowned throughout the scattered worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. They are extremely intelligent and have a natural affinity for magic in all of its forms. Using their gifts, they developed a vast and wondrous society, in which art, science, magic, and technology were all as one.\nIt was their magical affinity that attracted &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; the Dark Titan, who planned to bolster his ranks by transforming them into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and led to the fall of their civilization. In the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, few draenei wield arcane magic since it was what tempted &lt;a href=\"Man%27ari\"&gt;their brethren&lt;/a&gt; who joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nElves.\nAround 15,000 years ago, a tribe of &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s came to settle near the translucent waters of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Over generations, the Well's cosmic power affected this tribe, and transformed them into highly intelligent and virtually &lt;a href=\"immortal\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt; beings. The tribe gradually abandoned their ancient heritage and tradition. The mystics began worshiping the moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, who they believed slumbered within the fount's depth during daylight hours. The former trolls also discovered the name \"Kalimdor\" and other titan-forged words from communing with Elune, and adopted the name kaldorei, which meant \"children of the stars\" in their native tongue.\nThe early night elf priests and seers studied the Well with an insatiable curiosity. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; shared their curiosity, and ordered the educated &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world. The Highborne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly. In time they developed the ability to manipulate and control the Well's cosmic energies. According to &lt;a href=\"%3AAluneth\"&gt;:Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; purportedly had the potential to rival the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe surviving Highborne were forbidden to practice arcane magic and soon grew bold in defying the new laws. Rather than execute the Highborne, the rest of the night elves sentenced them to exile. The Highborne were not unhappy at the prospect of exile; on the contrary, they looked forward to it. Banished to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Highborne began seeking a new homeland, within which they could practice their magic freely. They founded the nation of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and created the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, a new magical fount, using water from the original Well, and became &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunwell's arcane magic was the heart of high elf society, empowering many of their day-to-day spells. The high elves, some of them eventually renaming themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, retain a deep affinity for the arcane.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt;, arcane magic, along with &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; magic, are used by night elf healers to mend the body of a deceased individual for a final viewing as part of their traditions.\nOthers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, as descendants of &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;'s creation &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, used the arcane to shape and bend rock and stone to their will, coming to prize &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s in particular for their immense potential. The &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic%20breaker\"&gt;magic breaker&lt;/a&gt;s were strong enough to completely dampen, negate and nullify any particular school of magic using their &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Forger&lt;/a&gt; stone, even rendering fel magic useless against them.\nSome &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s were former mages that delved too deeply into the roots of demonic power, while some deliberately chose to follow this path to understand how to fight demons better.\nBy leveraging the sacred powers of the moon, the sun and the stars, balance &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s access arcane and nature magics, made more potent still through shapeshifting into a &lt;a href=\"moonkin\"&gt;moonkin&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently bolstered by the lunar goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can conjure arcane ammunition. They can also tame arcane-related creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"nether%20ray\"&gt;nether ray&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"warp%20stalker\"&gt;warp stalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchools of arcane magic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; have divided the eldritch arts into eight different categories. All schools of magic can be combined to create formidable spells that utilize multiple sources of power. Mages are cautioned about the dangers of combining multiple types of magic. There are also multiple spells and branches of arcane research forbidden to members of the Kirin Tor.\nWhile the Kirin Tor &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;considered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; to be a school of arcane and it has been described as an arcane art, it is in truth a separate branch of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nAbjuration.\nAbjuration is the study of protective magic. The most generalized abjuration spell is the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Shield%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;mana shield&lt;/a&gt;, a spell that transmutes raw mana into a barrier that protects the caster from attacks. Elemental armor spells require far less raw energy than a mana shield and are more easily maintained over time, but lack the raw potency of the mana shield. Ward spells are quick, potent incantations to protect the caster against a form of magical damage, often caused when magic slips out of a mage's control.\nConjuration.\nConjuration is the study of magically creating creatures and objects. There is nothing more enjoyable for a mage than creating a fresh slice of bread or a glass of water. Mages can combine water and air vapors into a &lt;a href=\"Water%20Elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt; for a short time before they deconstruct into their base liquid forms. The elemental attacks that mages use are a form of conjuration.\nDivination.\nDivination is the school of magic dedicated to gathering information. Powerful divinations can allow the mage to see targets from a great distance, or even view what may normally be invisible. One of the most common uses of divination magic is scrying, which is the art of seeing something that may be far away\u2014perhaps even on another plane of existence. Divination spells can be used to counteract Illusion spells.\nEnchantment.\nEnchantment is the process of imbuing an object\u2014or person\u2014with magical power. Some enchantments are temporary, while others can offer permanent benefits. Disenchanting is the process of dispelling or removing magic. The &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;dispel magic spell&lt;/a&gt; is among the most important in a mage's arsenal, as it can potentially reverse the catastrophic effects of a misfired spell. It is also possible to permanently &lt;a href=\"disenchant\"&gt;disenchant&lt;/a&gt; a magical item. This process produces a unique form of crystallized mana that can be used in the process of imbuing another item with magical abilities. Conjured water elementals could possibly be considered to be water animated by enchantment.\nServants of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; study arcane in order to imbue their weapons and armor with unholy power.\nIllusion.\nIllusion is the art of deceiving reality itself. The mists of illusion can make a mage &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt; or inaudible to the world or twist the image of a location into something entirely different. Illusion can be used for disguise or manipulation, but spells to counteract illusions exist in the divination school. Illusions can be used to trick your enemies into fighting each other and be used to display &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;several images&lt;/a&gt; of a mage's body that are nearly indistinguishable from the caster's real form.\nTransmutation.\nThe ninth and final school of magic is transmutation. It is among the most popular and useful of all of the schools, allowing a mage to manipulate time and space. Perhaps the most iconic Transmutation spell is &lt;a href=\"polymorph\"&gt;polymorph&lt;/a&gt;, which allows a mage to temporarily turn something\u2014or someone\u2014into something else. It is possible, but unadvised, to increase the intelligence or power of a creature through polymorph, polymorph into exotic creatures, and polymorph inanimate objects.\nThe second most famous use is &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ation. The most basic teleportation spell is &lt;a href=\"blink\"&gt;blink&lt;/a&gt;. Attempts to cast a teleportation \"on the fly\" often result in one very dead mage inside a wall, chair, or another mage. A properly used portal is just as safe as the average &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; trip, but frequent use of teleportation wears down the infrastructure of the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpells that manipulate time also fall into this category, such as &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Slow Fall (ability)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;, and spells that increase movement speed. This particular arcane art is known as &lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;chronomancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvocation.\nEvocation may be one of the schools of arcane magic. The in-game &lt;a href=\"The%20Schools%20of%20Arcane%20Magic%20-%20Abjuration\"&gt;book on Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; mentions Evocation alongside Abjuration, noting that &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Doan\"&gt;Arcanist Doan&lt;/a&gt; had perfected a spell that combines Evocation with Abjuration to shield himself for a short time while preparing a powerful area-of-effect spell. \nThe non-canon \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;World of Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\" includes Evocation as one of its eight schools. However, its inclusion may be a result of the RPG being based off of \"\", in which Evocation is one of the nine schools of magic.\nThe laws of arcane magic.\nThe four rules.\nThere is a set of rules that governs the destiny of every person that chooses to continue down the path of a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;. These guarantees are:\nLaw of sympathy.\nThe sympathy between a subject and the object used by her becomes stronger with a more constant and thoughtful use. As auras vary with individuals, the vibration makes it possible to connect to the individual by affecting the item, and vice versa. Even before &lt;a href=\"Warp-Scryer%20Kryv\"&gt;Warp-Scryer Kryv&lt;/a&gt; deciphered the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion%20Missive\"&gt;Burning Legion Missive&lt;/a&gt;, he had been able to sense the hatred and urgency woven into the scroll.\nAmong its practical uses, sympathy may allow a lock of hair to be used in a love charm, or a coin to be tracked back to its original owner. Similarly, an expert can read handwritten letters or books without having to actually read them.\nIn the RPG.\nImportant note: While many elements differ between the RPG and game canon, this is especially true for information on arcane and divine magic. Though the origin of the sources of magic is the same, their implementation and effect on the world is wholly different. In the RPG, Divine magic is overall good, while arcane magic is overall bad. In canon, arcane magic still has more corruptive elements than divine magic, but it is not corruptive in and of itself.\nHistory.\nArcane magic is the gift of titans to the world, a gift that comes with the highest price. Thousands of years ago, the titans placed the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in the center of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a source of restoring, life-giving energy. They intended that the Well's energies would empower life of all forms to emerge on Kalimdor \u2014 plants, animals, monsters, races. After a time, the titans left Azeroth, leaving Kalimdor in the hands of the five &lt;a href=\"dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the Well of Eternity proved too great a lure to remain hidden for very long, particularly from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Well was discovered by the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, who were later known as &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Ever eager to uncover secrets hidden in dark places, the Kaldorei listened to the Well as it promised to give them great power. At the Well's behest, the Kaldorei learned spellspeech and used it to weave the first arcane spells. Within decades, Kaldorei mages had attained sufficient mastery over arcane magic that they built a great civilization. They founded the imperious city of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, from which they extended their domination over most of Kalimdor.\nUltimately, the magic corrupted them. The kaldorei had been a simple folk who gazed blissfully at the stars, enjoying the immortality given to them by the Well, but their haughtiness robbed them of that gift forever. Each succeeding generation became prouder and more decadent, and the lust for power only made the Kaldorei more of a beacon to the lords of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Their greatest mage, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, cast a spell in the heart of the Well of Eternity itself \u2014 and a way was opened for evil to invade the world. Through Azshara's breach came the Burning Legion, the most terrifying warriors in existence. This fiendish horde ravaged &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, pillaging entire kingdoms, destroying all that stood in its path, mocking anyone who begged it for mercy.\nWhen the Burning Legion ravaged the land, great heroes recognized that arcane magic posed a continuing threat to all living creatures, so they elected to destroy the Well of Eternity and put an end to arcane magic forever. Unfortunately, among their number was one &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, an arcane spell caster who dreaded the thought of losing his powers. Secretly he stole some of the well's water and used it to create a new Well of Eternity at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, thus preserving the power of the arcane. This theft allowed future elven generations to follow in the footsteps of Illidan and Queen Azshara. These elves called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei\"&gt;Quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, \"the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;\" (for they believed that their mastery of the arcane elevated them to higher status). They also taught the arcane arts to the newly discovered race of humans, who showed a natural aptitude.\nThese human mages, however, were even more reckless than the night elves had been. The high elf mages warned their human pupils that magic was addictive, but the acolytes dismissed any suggestion that the tragedies that had befallen the elves would also afflict them. The humans were no better at resisting corruption than the elves had been, and eventually the arrogance of wizards brought the Burning Legion to Azeroth once more. Once again, great acts of heroism were needed to spare Azeroth from destruction. Elsewhere, on the orcish home world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, arcane sorceries corrupted the once noble race of orcs, transforming them into the Horde, a nigh invincible army. After ravaging their home world, the orcs came to Azeroth; and with their warlocks, they waged two great wars against the races of human, elf, and dwarf. The orcs failed to seize control of Azeroth; during these wars, Draenor itself was utterly destroyed, and the orcs were forced to relocate to Azeroth.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the orc Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has rejected arcane magic and embraced his race's traditional shamanistic ways. Yet orc warlocks still walk the world, and demons whisper in their ears each time they cast a spell. Neither human nor high elves have abandoned the pursuit of the arcane; if anything, the defeat of the Burning Legion at the Battle of Mount Hyjal has fed the arrogance of many spell casters, who believe the world is now protected from demonic influences and that arcane spell casters may practice their art in relative safety. Nothing sows the seeds of the fields of tragedy quite like arrogance.\nThe four laws.\nMagic in Azeroth is the difference between a slave and a master, a foot soldier and king. Few races and nations can operate without powerful mages and warlocks. The use of arcane magic is growing; historically, each time this has happened before, a great disaster shortly follows. However, even though the history of the arcane is well known, mages and their patrons invariably come to the same self-serving conclusion: \"It won't happen to them\".\nMagic corrupts the soul; if the humblest person in Azeroth became a practitioner of the arcane, by the time the practitioner reached the higher levels in their art, all traces of her humble roots would be lost. Magic breeds pride and arrogance. Magic corrupts the body; it ages the caster before their time and hastens the blight that the world inflicts on things fair and beautiful. Those who claim that only necromancy and fel magic have a corrupting influence are fooling themselves.\nWhen one feels the power of an arcane spell coursing through one's body as it's being cast, resisting the urge to cast it again is difficult. Frequent use leads to a desire for more and, eventually, to a desire for the evil fel energy.\nThe Burning Legion has invaded Azeroth three times, drawn by the power of the Well of Eternity and those who employ it. Magic is a literal gateway drug that allows dark titans such as Sargeras to bring evil influences to the world. Those who employ arcane magic must deal with demons and other servants of the Twisting Nether.\n\"Warcraft\" film universe.\nArcane magic has a pale blue color and is used for various purposes including .\nThe young , , and faced against a &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; warlord. He used magic and was invulnerable to arcane magic. However, Medivh used it to cause an explosion and collapse a building on the troll.\nAt some point, shouted a spell, and a blast of arcane lightning shot from his hand. It struck an orc full in the chest and sent him flying."}

It is smart to kill these mobs before working on the &lt;a href=\"Syphoner\"&gt;Syphoner&lt;/a&gt;s, as the effect of Loose Mana will help to counteract the draining ability of the &lt;a href=\"Syphoner\"&gt;Syphoner&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThese mobs are immune to banish and other CC techniques, and life draining effects do not return life while the mana shield is up. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Seed of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; will not properly detonate with the mana shield operational. The Anomalies are also resistant to arcane and nature damage due to their Elemental properties.\nOne of the more effective methods of dealing with these pulls is to have the MT pull the mobs quite far back, and to fear bomb the adds until the Anomalies have been killed, at which point the syphoners can be killed quite easily. The entrance to the room where the first two &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Watchman\"&gt;Arcane Watchmen&lt;/a&gt; are found makes a fantastic choke point to accomplish this.\nPaladins will find it near impossible to tank an Arcane Anomaly. The mana shield soaks all damage, meaning no holy damage taken and no threat generated. A paladin can hold aggro until the first teleport, but will be unable to regain it afterwards.\nWhile the mana shield cannot be dispelled, Anomalies do not start with one. It is activated \"after\" aggroing the group. A mage could pull with a &lt;a href=\"pyroblast\"&gt;pyroblast&lt;/a&gt; (then flee) or a Marksman spec'd hunter could do a misdirected &lt;a href=\"aimed%20shot\"&gt;aimed shot&lt;/a&gt;. Burst damage with a long cast time can be difficult to take advantage of due to &lt;a href=\"LoS\"&gt;LoS&lt;/a&gt; and mob positions. Even if it fails to kill outright, this should get their health down under 20% and allows the raid to activate special abilities like &lt;a href=\"execute\"&gt;execute&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Drain%20Mana\"&gt;Drain Mana&lt;/a&gt; for warlocks will directly drain their mana, Priest's mana burn will not. This has the added benefit of causing negligible threat for the warlock. \nRewards.\nReputation: Provides 15 reputation with &lt;a href=\"The%20Violet%20Eye\"&gt;The Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Clearcasting state lasts 10 seconds, and the next damage spell will cost no mana.\nThis talent is very popular with all types of mages, as it is nearly a 10% reduction in mana usage over time. Reduced mana use means a mage can focus his gear on other stats, such as &lt;a href=\"spell%20damage\"&gt;spell damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spell%20crit\"&gt;spell crit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the situation. In practice, the Clearcasting state can proc just as an enemy dies, meaning the buff will expire before another spell is cast. This makes the talent most useful for longer fights, such as boss encounters, but it still improves efficiency in most all situations.\nTips and tactics.\nOne technique is to use low cast time or high mana efficiency spells such as &lt;a href=\"Scorch\"&gt;Scorch&lt;/a&gt; until a Clearcasting procs. Then use a higher damage spell that has lower efficiency, when the casting cost is free. In instances or solo'ing, you can also cast Scorch until Clearcasting procs, then fire off a &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;. Combined with &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Potency\"&gt;Arcane Potency&lt;/a&gt;, which at max rank gives a +15% crit chance when Clearcasting or Presence of Mind activates, this can be a lethal attack."}

In order to prevent a direct assault on the Vale the mogu magisters of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dojan%20II\"&gt;Emperor Dojan II&lt;/a&gt; set up arcanic oubliettes, or magic traps, inside what were named the Dungeons of Dojani in Krasarang Wilds, for any foolish enough to open a portal directly to the Vale. Thus when the expedition's mage opened a portal, it was automatically redirected to one of these arcanic oubliettes inside a Dungeon of Dojani. Although the dungeon itself is fortunately in ruins, the arcanic oubliettes tap the health of those trapped inside to keep the trap active; only when the prisoners are completely drained of life will it deactivate. Luckily, Vaeldrin is able to contact a nearby Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who was just passing through, and destroys the immediate oubliettes to free them.\nArcanic oubliettes are apparently also designed to be lethal to any mages that enter them, but luckily the young highborne &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Xintar\"&gt;Magister Xintar&lt;/a&gt; survived, though drained and fatigued.\nThe portal itself from Darnassus remains active, but is trapped inside a arcanic oubliette of its own. Thus while the expedition was able to warn the other side to not send anyone else through and are able to receive supplies directly from home, they are now stuck on the wrong side of a one-way portal."}

It was once abundant before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, but after the rending of the world only a single field in Stonetalon remained.\nYears ago, Orremin was awoken from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; by his &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; sisters and found that the field had been ravaged by &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, all but destroying the indellium plants. The &lt;a href=\"brewmaster\"&gt;brewmaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who had heard of a hidden valley in Stonetalon where the rarest hops grew\u2014arrived and helped Orremin fight off the goblins and their machines, but the damage had been done: only two indellium clusters remained. Orremin offered a handful of hops to Chen as thanks for saving them, but knowing their rarity, Chen declined.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; made their way to the valley, which was seemingly empty. However, as a geomancer, Bo could sense that something was there. Orremin appeared and told the story of his meeting with Chen before revealing that he had cast an illusion to hide the indellium from sight. He explained that he soon had to return to the Emerald Dream to confront a &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;growing darkness&lt;/a&gt; and that he had hidden the now-recovered plants in order to prevent any more interference from outsiders. He then asked the two &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; to grant him a wish: to accept the same amount of indellium hops that he had offered to Chen and brew it into a beer as Chen had planned, as his way of saying thank you. Li Li granted his request and included the indellium in a brew of her own, which she believed was the \"best brew on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", and which &lt;a href=\"Blokk\"&gt;Blokk&lt;/a&gt; later stated was the best beer he'd ever had."}

While the Independent prefer the freedom of answering to no one, this also raises suspicion from both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; factions.\nIndependence has its advantages. In most cases, the Independent races won't be attacked simply for their affiliation. Independent races can easily work for either the Alliance or Horde as mercenaries or diplomatic liaisons, and could eventually become regular employees of one or the other. The downside to this is that regular work for one &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; may create animosity with the other. Regular work for both factions could create further suspicion from each side. Independent is the best affiliation, as heroes serve whatever masters they please. If they want no part in a mission, they have no special duty to fulfill it.\nMany races on Azeroth have no interest in the problems of the Alliance and Horde. These races ally themselves with no one and are more concerned with their own problems. Without affiliation to the Alliance or Horde, the Independent races have fewer ties and responsibilities, not to mention fewer obvious enemies. Independent races are frequently affected by the current activites of the two most prominent sides. Therefore, the Independent must always be aware of what's going on within the two affiliations.\nIndependent characters have more freedom when it comes to adventuring, as they have fewer expectations placed upon them. They are not tied to Alliance or Horde laws and can avoid all the tensions therein. However, neutrality can be dangerous. No one weeps for mercenaries' deaths and there are few (if any) allies to send out search parties for missing individuals. It behooves the Independents to foster good relationships with at least one major faction.\nMany of Azeroth's denizens do not owe fealty to the Alliance or Horde. Some races, such as goblins, blood elves and pandaren, are - or were - Independent. Many Independent races live and work in harmony with members of both the Alliance and the Horde, and could conceivably join a party of either.

{"id": "15173", "revid": "4083176", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15173", "title": "Infernal", "text": "Infernals are nearly mindless amalgamations of matter and &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy, created by more powerful and intelligent &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Acting as living siege weapons, these brutes use blazing fists of fel fire and stone to hammer down the defenses of their enemies. Falling to earth as green, molten meteorites, infernals exist only to destroy every living thing in their path. Though their lifespans are limited, the mighty infernals have been known to destroy entire cities before their energies dissipated back into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe infernals are the embodiment of primal force. They are creatures that exist only to crush, pummel, or crash through whatever obstacles-living or not-lay in their path. The spells of the warlocks and other dark sorcerers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; make them a force nigh unstoppable.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s mark the pinnacle of their dark powers with the devastating ability to summon a fiery infernal. At their call, the infernal will streak down from the sky, stunning and wounding nearby enemy forces when it crashes to the earth. The infernal, engulfed in searing flame, will then rise to do the dreadlord's bidding.\nAlthough they are technically constructs, some have been shown to be in possession of hearts that burn with intense heat, and &lt;a href=\"felblood\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt; flowing through their bodies. &lt;a href=\"Minfernal\"&gt;Minfernal&lt;/a&gt;s are ill-tempered constructs of flame and rage that sometimes rise from the remains of larger infernals who fall in battle.\nAlthough often considered mindless, they do have &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s, and some infernals have been known to show a modicum of self-awareness. One of these is &lt;a href=\"Raze\"&gt;Raze&lt;/a&gt; who, during the quest &lt;a href=\"Shadoweaver\"&gt;Shadoweaver&lt;/a&gt;, would eagerly shout out \"RAZE SMASH!\" when fighting enemies, and would even instruct the player in how to make use of its abilities (although it should be noted that these instructions essentially boil down to \"You point, I smash\", further highlighting the limited thoughts of Infernals). Another example is &lt;a href=\"Krosnis\"&gt;Krosnis&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; mentions that it was capable of telling others its name. When &lt;a href=\"Kroshius\"&gt;Kroshius&lt;/a&gt; was originally brought back to life he would yell \"Kroshius live? Kroshius crush!\", and after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm_%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; he will still eagerly shout at any that engage him in combat. Another infernal on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; even decided to keep an elf's heart as a keepsake.\nConstruction.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deathforge\"&gt;Deathforge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; provides some details on how infernals are made. First, warlocks ritualistically summon &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s into pools of fouled water or lava, corrupting them until they turn into demonic &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Soul\"&gt;\"infernal souls\"&lt;/a&gt;. These infernal souls are then fused together with a collection of fel rocks by &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gan%27arg\"&gt;gan'arg&lt;/a&gt; engineers (known in the Deathforge as &lt;a href=\"Deathforge%20Smith\"&gt;Deathforge Smith&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Deathforge%20Tinkerer\"&gt;Deathforge Tinkerer&lt;/a&gt;s). When this process is complete, the end result is a newly-crafted infernal.\nThe bodies of infernals also seem to be centered around an infernal power core. When an infernal is defeated, they can be easily re-summoned by infusing this core with felfire, allowing for the demon's immediate return from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Several such drained cores can also be combined on their own to temporarily summon a single infernal.\nThe stone that infernals are made of still contains large amounts of fel magic even after the infernal's death. If not gathered, the debris left behind from slain infernals will continue leeching corruption back into the ground.\nThese cores can remain dormant, allowing for easy storage when stacked into piles, allowing for the infernals to be summoned from the skies as meteors, or simply picked up by any adventurer that might come across them. &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Brimstone\"&gt;Infernal Brimstone&lt;/a&gt; can also be rarely mined from these demonic corestones.\nSome infernals are made by warlocks infusing pieces of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; with fel energy to create living siege weapons.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Minfernal\"&gt;Minfernal&lt;/a&gt;s can be captured in pet battles in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nInfernals are savage extraplanar creatures that dwell in an unknown, brutal corner of the Twisting Nether. They are a strange combination of demon and construct. Most demons shun them as uncontrollable and savage. Warlocks who summon infernals do so at great risk to themselves, for an infernal that breaks free attacks its former controller with unfettered ferocity.\nUnsummoned infernals arrive through weaknesses in the cross-planar boundaries, crashing to Azeroth in devastating meteoric impacts. The infernal rises from the resulting crater and sets off on an orgy of destruction that can last hours. Fortunately for the rest of the world, an infernal\u2019s time on Azeroth is limited to less than a day, whereupon the Twisting Nether swallows it up once again. Also fortunately for Azeroth, infernals appear only in places where the boundaries between planes are unnaturally weak, and such locales are rare."}

{"id": "94471", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=94471", "title": "Infernal (warlock minion)", "text": "The Infernal is a temporary &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20pet\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt; available to the &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20specs\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, summoned through the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Infernal\"&gt;Summon Infernal&lt;/a&gt; ability. \nThe Infernal deals strong &lt;a href=\"AoE%23Types_of_AoE\"&gt;point blank area of effect&lt;/a&gt; damage and briefly stuns targets hit when summoned, and then does continuous area of effect damage while active, in addition to attacking the warlock's target and passively generating &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt; over time for the warlock.\nAcquiring.\n&lt;a href=\"Summon%20Infernal\"&gt;Summon Infernal&lt;/a&gt; is automatically learned by Destruction warlocks at level 58. Previously, the spell was granted on completion of a quest line from in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, where the warlock had to defeat the Infernal .\nAbilities.\nInfernals have no warlock-controlled abilities. However they do have &lt;a href=\"Immolation\"&gt;Immolation&lt;/a&gt;, a passive ability which deals point blank AoE &lt;a href=\"fire%20damage\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; (42% of the warlock's spell power every 2 seconds). They will also deal melee damage to their current target.\nInfernal tips.\nThe Infernal will persist for 30 seconds. As a guardian pet, it cannot be directly controlled by the warlock, instead automatically attacking the warlock's target. Aside from the quite respectable melee damage it does, it also has a fire aura that will damage all units within melee range that aren't outright immune to fire damage. The Infernal also generates Soul Shards passively over time for the warlock, at a rate of 1 Soul Shard Fragment (1/10th of a Soul Shard) every 0.5 seconds, which is 1 full Soul Shard every 5 seconds and a total of 6 Soul Shards over its 30 second duration. This influx of Soul Shards causes a significant increase in the warlock's own damage, in addition to the damage done by the Infernal itself.\nIf the level 90 Destruction talent &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20Supremacy\"&gt;Grimoire of Supremacy&lt;/a&gt; is taken, Summon Infernal becomes a much stronger cooldown, as the damage of &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bolt\"&gt;Chaos Bolt&lt;/a&gt; continuously ramps up with each successive Chaos Bolt cast while the Infernal is active. With this talent, it is a wise idea to pool Soul Shards before Summon Infernal, and to align it with any other significant cooldowns (such as &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; and ) to maximize the rate and benefits of the ramping Chaos Bolt damage.\nThe Infernal is especially useful in &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;. You can drop an Infernal on a group of players to stun them and deal some AoE damage preceded or followed by &lt;a href=\"Shadowfury\"&gt;Shadowfury&lt;/a&gt;, causing up to 4 seconds total stun time. Alternatively, simply summon it and let it loose; many people overestimate the infernal and will back off. Note, however, that like all warlock minions, the Infernal is vulnerable to being &lt;a href=\"banish\"&gt;banished&lt;/a&gt; by an opposing warlock.\nPrevious versions.\nPrior to a certain patch, the summoned Infernal would roam free. Also, the only way to get the ability to summon an Infernal was to find a Book in Lower Blackrock Spire (LBRS). Subsequently the spell was learnt through a quest chain in Bloodvenom Falls, given by Niby The Almighty. &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Infernal\"&gt;Summon Infernal&lt;/a&gt; is now automatically learnt when the warlock reaches level 58, provided they are Destruction specialization.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the length of time for summoned Infernal was 5 minutes; after this time, the Infernal would become hostile and had to be re-enslaved. \nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, warlocks could also learn the ability from reading &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20Inferno\"&gt;Grimoire of Inferno&lt;/a&gt;, which dropped from s in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"\", Demonology warlocks could talent &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Grimoire\"&gt;Ancient Grimoire&lt;/a&gt; to increase the Infernal's duration by 10/20 seconds.\nAlthough not under the warlock's direct control, it was drawn to attack targets afflicted by the player's &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Bane of Agony&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Bane of Doom&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nIn , Summon Infernal was a standard AoE DPS cooldown available to all 3 warlock specializations, sharing a cooldown with the single-target oriented &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Doomguard\"&gt;Summon Doomguard&lt;/a&gt; ability. The Infernal (or the Doomguard) could instead be summoned as a permanent pet option with the talent &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20Supremacy\"&gt;Grimoire of Supremacy&lt;/a&gt;. As a permanent pet, the Infernal possessed a threat-increasing aura, allowing it to replace the Voidwalker as the warlock's tank pet, and had a 1 minute cooldown AoE stun ability called Meteor. The Destruction warlock's artifact weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, also had a trait &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Flames\"&gt;Lord of Flames&lt;/a&gt; that caused Summon Infernal to also spawn 3 smaller Infernal for 25 seconds, with a 10 minute cooldown on this effect (this was triggered instead by using the Infernal's Meteor ability with Grimoire of Supremacy talented), allowing Summon Infernal to be used even for single-target situations once every 10 minutes for Destruction warlocks."}

They acts as keepers / masters, vendors and trainers. They provide flights for other places.\n&lt;a href=\"Gurlorn\"&gt;Gurlorn&lt;/a&gt; is known as Wind Rider Veteran.\nWindriders.\nGryphon riders.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; long ago befriended the mighty &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s and these Windriders have helped the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in various wars and conflicts, lending their aid to its cause in order to keep the skies free. They are renowned for defeating many mighty &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s during the capture of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, darting around the crimson giants with astounding agility, confusing it and its handler, and finally one dwarf would swoop in and strike a killing blow to the head or skull.\nIn close combat, Gryphon riders wield the legendary Stormhammers, but when taking down a dragon, creatures of thick scale where a hammer would be little use, they have been known to strike with long-handled battle axes with adamantium blades, biting through the scale.\nDragon riders.\nDuring the Second War, &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s captured &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. With her dragons they became dragon riders, and rose them into battle against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It was these dragon riders who revealed Gul'dan's betrayal and who destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;Third Fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nWyvern riders (wind riders).\nThe sapient &lt;a href=\"wyverns\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; were eager to ally themselves with the shamanistic &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' commitment to honor and victory, the wyverns allowed the orcs to ride them into combat against those who would disturb the tranquility of Kalimdor and its denizens. The wyverns, who share a common ancestry with both dragons and gryphons, use their powerful claws and razor-like fangs against both airborne attackers and ground troops, while their riders may hurl envenomed spears at the enemy.\nWyvern riders carry envenomed spears that have been coated with the lethal venom from &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;'s giant jungle snakes. When pierced by these spears, the riders' enemies are weakened and slowly eaten alive as the vile poison courses through their bodies.\nDragonhawk riders.\nSwift flying unit mounted by an Elven warrior. The fierce warriors of the Dragonhawk battalions are often the first into combat, picking apart the enemy ranks and surrounding enemy towers with dense fog so that reinforcements can strike unhindered by enemy defenses. Attacks land and air units. \nBat riders.\nLight flying unit with incredible perception. Good at destroying buildings. The fire obsessed Troll Batriders are often used as reconnaissance for the Orcish Horde.\nHippogryph riders.\nHippogryph riders are &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; female &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s mounted on &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s as a part of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinel Army&lt;/a&gt;. The brave creatures respond to the female riders as if they shared an empathic bond.\n&lt;a href=\"Hippogryph\"&gt;Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s have a keen awareness of aerial tactics. Without riders, they attack in quick dives, striking with their beaks followed by swipes with their talons. Female hippogryphs avoid direct combat. If trapped on the ground, hippogryphs charge, trying to get space to regain the air. Carrying &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; archers, hippogryphs make careful circling attacks, darting within range long enough for a shot before wheeling away.\nIn the RPG.\nWindriders are the knights of the sky, riding their flying mounts into combat. With time and experience, rider and mount move in graceful unison that makes them increasingly formidable opponents. The mount of a windrider is well disciplined and trained for combat. A windrider has a close relationship with her mount similar to the relationship between a spellcaster and his familiar. A windrider can intuitively sense the emotional mood of her mount from a distance. As the bond grows, the windrider and her mount can communicate as effectively as though they shared a common language, though other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical help. In time this bond between the windrider and the mount becomes telepathic - each can see through the other's eyes. As they ride in combat, windriders and their mounts learn to watch for one another's safety in combat.\nWindwarriors.\nThe most elite of windriders become &lt;a href=\"windwarrior\"&gt;windwarrior&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Lireesa as the ranger-general of Silvermoon died during the attack, and Sylvanas became the new ranger-general, but gave &lt;a href=\"%3AThas%27dorah%2C%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Windrunners\"&gt;:Thas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners&lt;/a&gt; to her older sister, Alleria, who was a distinguished &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt;. Alleria would wield Thas'dorah in battle against the Legion for centuries before it was lost on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; and eventually retrieved by a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; and her younger sister Vereesa.\nOnly Alleria, Sylvanas, Vereesa, and &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin&lt;/a&gt; are known to have survived. This prompted Alleria to join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in order to avenge them, which she later disappeared with. The rest of the family was one of the hardest hit by the Scourge invasion into Quel'Thalas. Sylvanas was killed by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and raised as a banshee in his service, later becoming Banshee Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The sisters' grandfather had to battle his own son, their uncle, after he was turned into an undead. A younger brother was torn to pieces by their older brother who was then himself burned with the rest of the Scourge by elven resistance fighters. The grandfather survived the battle and managed to get to Vereesa but his subsequent fate is unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;The Lady's Necklace&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria's last gift to Sylvanas, was found and returned to the Dark Lady years later. Although Sylvanas insisted it meant \"nothing\" to her and dropped it to the floor, she subsequently tenderly reclaimed it with a sigh, and sang &lt;a href=\"Lament%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Lament of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt; to mourn the many losses of her family and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;her homeland&lt;/a&gt;, as well as her people, the &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria Windrunner reunited with her two sisters, Sylvanas and Vereesa (with all three sisters wearing their necklaces), at &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;, where Sylvanas apparently intended to kill both of them but relented at the last moment after hearing Vereesa's genuine apology for abandoning her after their last meeting. Although Alleria and Vereesa, both remaining part of the Alliance, would apparently retain a close relationship, with the two even confronting Sylvanas at the end of the subsequent conflict, Alleria and Sylvanas both considered their reunion a failed one, with Alleria even openly regretting not killing Sylvanas several times afterwards.\nEtymology.\nThe surname Windrunner appears to have been invented by &lt;a href=\"Knaak\"&gt;Knaak&lt;/a&gt; and first used in chapter two of his 2001 novel \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" when &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; addresses Vereesa by her full name: \"You would be &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, I presume\".\nAlthough the first member of the family to be introduced in the franchise was &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; in the 1996 expansion \"\" during &lt;a href=\"Alleria%27s%20Journey%20%28WC2%20Human%29\"&gt;the mission bearing her forename&lt;/a&gt;, she was not given a surname at that time.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; is the third member of the family introduced to the franchise in the 2002 game \"\", which is the second instance of the surname being used. The game does not actually reveal that she is Vereesa's sister, although the shared surname established some form of relation.\nThe third explicit \"Windrunner\" identified was Syvos, a random &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Mage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blood Mage&lt;/a&gt; in the \"\" expansion in 2003. The canonical existence of such random heroes however is not confirmed.\nThe 2004 novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\" (the 2nd by Knaak for \"Warcraft\") is where the two Windrunners (Vereesa and Sylvanas) are established as being sisters, as well as Alleria being a Windrunner and the elder sister of the other two.\nThe 2007 novel \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" is the first novel to feature all three Windrunner sisters together, and is set during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are actually embodiments of the wild side of nature, and so tame ones are very rare. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes they may come from &lt;a href=\"Aessina\"&gt;Aessina&lt;/a&gt;, though when he asked her she simply said, \"maybe\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Grell\"&gt;misty grell&lt;/a&gt; that dwell in the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Valley\"&gt;Misty Valley&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; move as one with the wind and can summon gusts of breeze at their whim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, many grell and &lt;a href=\"grellkin\"&gt;grellkin&lt;/a&gt; moved into &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen\"&gt;Shadowglen&lt;/a&gt; and infested the abandoned &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; camps, threatening Shadowglen's residents. Like the furbolgs, the grell had been corrupted by &lt;a href=\"%3AFel%20Moss\"&gt;:Fel Moss&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreature type.\nThere are some conflicting information regarding the status of grell. According to &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Avuun\"&gt;Anchorite Avuun&lt;/a&gt;, even though grell resemble imps, he found no &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic traces among the ones he had studied. They were, as far as he could tell, uncorrupted.\n\"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", however, generally depicts many grell as having the \"Demon\" &lt;a href=\"Creature\"&gt;creature type&lt;/a&gt;. While some of them could be explained by &lt;a href=\"%3AFel%20Moss\"&gt;:Fel Moss&lt;/a&gt; corruption, even &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Grell\"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; that Avuun refers to as supposedly uncorrupted are classified as demons. It is also not just a matter of in-game mechanics. The novel \"&lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cycle of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" identified grell as demons. In &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thundris%20Windweaver\"&gt;Thundris Windweaver&lt;/a&gt; referred to the grell and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s inhabiting &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; as \"demonic minions\", and after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a number of grell could be found serving the satyr &lt;a href=\"Zenn%20Foulhoof\"&gt;Zenn Foulhoof&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cliffspring%20Hollow\"&gt;Cliffspring Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Demonic grells could also be summoned by the satyr corruptor &lt;a href=\"Alzzin%20the%20Wildshaper\"&gt;Alzzin the Wildshaper&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Grell%20Moss\"&gt;Grell Moss&lt;/a&gt; is obtained from a rare &lt;a href=\"How%20to%20redeem%20a%20loot%20card\"&gt;loot card&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Crown of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt; expansion for the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;World of Warcraft Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn the RPG.\nThis small, skipping creature looks a bit like a thin, gangly, orange goblin. Large ears spread from its bald head. Its pupil-less yellow eyes stare as it raises a clawed paw. Grell are small, playful creatures that can be encountered in wild areas. They are not particularly dangerous individually, but in gangs they can pose a threat to outlying night elf and furbolg communities; they may be small and unimpressive, but their claws are sharp. Scattered groups of them are actively malicious. Some grell wear &lt;a href=\"Grell%20Earring\"&gt;earrings&lt;/a&gt;, which scholars believe may possess magical traits. Grell are fond of &lt;a href=\"Hyacinth%20Mushroom\"&gt;hyacinth mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;. Combat Grell are not particularly hostile; generally, they are content to leave potential dangers alone. If an opponent attacks, however, they defend themselves fiercely. Grell in a gang feel no particular connection to each other, it seems, and are as likely to assist their comrade as to watch the combat idly. They are categorized as small fey creatures."}

Grenda, Vereesa, and what was left of the group was captured by the &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rask\"&gt;Rask&lt;/a&gt;. However, the group was able to escape their capture but while en route Vereesa would end up separated by the group and discovered &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Grenda wouldn't notice until there was no telling where the high elf could be and would make the choice to continue on to ensure the horrors of Grim Batol would not take any unaware.\nShe and her group would eventually come under attack but be saved by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and his surprising alliance with an army of raptors. During the battle that followed Grenda would be overjoyed to see that Rom had survived the fall and would witness that newly freed &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; attack &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. As the two dragons continued to clash Grenda would be ordered to Rom to lead the dwarves into one of the passages out of Grim Batol. However, as Grenda received her instructions, she saw Rask attempting to sneak up on Rom and &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt; and precede to warn Rom of the danger. The fierce fight between Rask and Rom would end with the two ultimately slaying one another in combat and Grenda would deeply mourn Rom's death.\nFollowing the fall of Dargonax and the other dark forces at Grim Batol Grenda led the surviving dwarves away from the mountain in order to report the events that transpired.\nLove for Rom.\nThe novel described her feelings for Rom, which started in respect for her commander but ended up something more."}

His brother &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; also became a member.\nApproximately two years after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Greydon Thorne visited &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; along with his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt;. They entered a newly opened bookstore, run by the goblin &lt;a href=\"Charnas\"&gt;Charnas&lt;/a&gt;. They were one of his first customers. Silverlaine left Greydon and Charnas to talk. The two then became great friends, and Greydon would visit him several times during the next 20 years.\nAn unnamed &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; bestowed Greydon the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; to give to the one he deemed best. However, Greydon kept it for himself, infuriating his brother. To prove his worth, Silverlaine later stole the sword from Greydon's quarters and went to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt; who was capable of summoning the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;. However, the dreadlord convinced Silverlaine to join his side, betray the order and kill the naaru. After killing the naaru and shattering the Diamond Blade, Greydon settled in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe met &lt;a href=\"Ceya%20Northbrooke%20Thorne%20Glade\"&gt;Ceya Northbrooke&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. After they married, they moved to &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; where they had a son named &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar&lt;/a&gt;. On his 6th birthday, Greydon mysteriously vanished, abandoning his family who expected his return but gave up on this two years following the abandonment, after which Ceya got a divorce from &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; and married &lt;a href=\"Robb%20Glade\"&gt;Robb Glade&lt;/a&gt;. His journey during the next years remained, but several events are known - he returned to the sea got hold of a magical compass, and after two years he became the captain of the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\", a vessel which was converted from a &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt; to a merchant vessel. In fact, the naaru survived in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Voice of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and guided Greydon to finding the shards of the Diamond Blade across Azeroth and hiding them in places like Redridge, where he met and befriended a &lt;a href=\"blue%20drake\"&gt;blue drake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Telagos\"&gt;Telagos&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo years after the formation of the ship's crew, the ship sailed near the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; where Greydon and his crew witnessed two &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; ships attacking a sole &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt; ship. While the \"&lt;a href=\"Orca%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Orca&lt;/a&gt;\" left, the other one, the \"&lt;a href=\"Killmonger\"&gt;Killmonger&lt;/a&gt;\" remained to deal with the captured crew of the \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20King\"&gt;Sea King&lt;/a&gt;\". Its captain, &lt;a href=\"Ironpatch\"&gt;Ironpatch&lt;/a&gt; just killed the &lt;a href=\"Flintwill%20family\"&gt;Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; brothers and was about to execute &lt;a href=\"Makasa\"&gt;Makasa&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, Greydon and his crew had silently sneaked into the \"Killmonger\", taking it, and then to the \"Sea King\". As Ironpatch was about to swing his sword, Greydon parried the attack. The \"Wavestrider\" crew attacked the Bloodsails and freed the captured Raiders who joined the fight as well. As Ironpatch and Greydon fought, Makasa took her eldest brother's harpoon, aimed and tossed it at the orc captain, killing him. After the fight, Makasa asked Greydon to took her with him, as she now owed him a life debt. Makasa's fellow &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Barker\"&gt;Joe Barker&lt;/a&gt; approached and told him that it is a custom of her people, so Thorne can't refuse. Seeing as he just lost his second and third mate, having seen Joe and Makasa fight, and conferring with &lt;a href=\"Durgan%20One-God\"&gt;Durgan One-God&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to take them as his new second and third mates respectively. As Joe just failed his own captain, he said that he would join Captain Thorne if he took Makasa as his second and Joe as his third. Greydon agreed. After burying the Flintwill brothers into the sea, he invited her to tell him about her life and Makasa came to knew the love of a father. Greydon promised her that he would not use the life debt she now owed him.\nOver one year later, he visited Charnas in Gadgetzan for the last time. After this, the next known stop was the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\nSix years after he left Redridge, a month after Aram's twelfth birthday, Greydon returned to Lakeshire and asked Ceya for his son to accompany him on a voyage across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for one year, knowing it will be hard. Aram hesitated, resented and didn't want to go with him but went regardless. Setting off from Stormwind Harbor, Greydon used the time and began instructing Aram in swordsfight as well as knowledge about the world.\nSix months later, Greydon and his crew landed in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; where he traded with an acquaintance &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Cackle\"&gt;Cackle&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Grimtail%20clan\"&gt;Grimtail clan&lt;/a&gt;. From there they continued to a secret post named &lt;a href=\"Flayers%27%20Point\"&gt;Flayers' Point&lt;/a&gt; where the ship's cook &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Cobb\"&gt;Jonas Cobb&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the crew to the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; with whom Greydon had had a certain history tied with the compass. Upon learning of a &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;mysterious figure&lt;/a&gt; and Cobb's odd behavior from Aramar, the crew hastily left Desolace hoping they would lose any potential pursuers. Despite this, Greydon and his crew prepared for a fight. Not soon after, an &lt;a href=\"elven%20destroyer\"&gt;elven destroyer&lt;/a&gt; named the \"&lt;a href=\"Inevitable\"&gt;Inevitable&lt;/a&gt;\" gave chase to the \"Wavestrider\" and soon it attacked, boarding the merchant vessel.\nNoticing his former nemesis Malus and realizing the battle lost, he quickly summoned Makasa and Aram. He asked Makasa to fulfill her life debt (which he had claimed would never ask for) and gave Aram the compass to protect at all costs. He pushed them to a boat and loosed them to the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt;'s waters. The two youngsters then just watched as the \"Wavestrider\" exploded. They later encountered Reigol in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; who boasted that Aram would never see his father again in this world. Although Malus stated that he killed Greydon, Greydon was, in fact, imprisoned somewhere on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt;, the master of the Hidden, who has been trying to break him not only for the past two months since he was brought to Outland but in fact, for over 20 years."}

The type of mage may be determined by looking at their self-buff; each uses a damage buff of its particular school, as well as two different AOEs of that school. For example a fire mage has a self-cast buff that grants +350 fire spell power. These buffs may be stolen to boost your mages' damage and reduce the damage dealt by the mob. Furthermore, all Nether-Mages can use Blink to move to a random player, although it does not appear to be an aggro drop. They are vulnerable to sheeping and fear. They are immune to Hammer of Justice and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Tongues\"&gt;Curse of Tongues&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the exception of the channeled &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rain of Fire&lt;/a&gt; none of their abilities have cast times. However, they cannot cast while feared, and can be chain feared rather than tanked to prevent casting.\nThey are also immune to &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nThe arcane mages tend to be the most dangerous.

It is a colossal wall with a substantially sized gate, located at the southern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; (its entrance near &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;) and the northern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilnean peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe controversial edifice led to the rise of tensions among the people of Gilneas, but protected the Gilneans from the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion. During the war across the continent, many &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s that escaped the Plague made camp outside of the wall, but its gates remained closed for years, and the refugees perished at some point.\nFollowing the end of the Third War, the wall sowed civil discord in the isolated kingdom, rising until eventually led to the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;Northgate Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, a devastating civil war that nearly destroyed the nation. Though King Greymane was able to put down the dissenters with the apprehension of the rebellion's leader, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom began to experience other troubles, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was not until the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that the gates were destroyed, giving the chance to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invade the peninsula&lt;/a&gt; from the north.\nHistory.\nFollowing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s that remained behind after the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; closed found themselves &lt;a href=\"prisoner\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt;s. While some wanted to execute them outright, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; showed them mercy and began building &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s for them.\nIn his kingdom, Greymane chafed at having Gilnean taxes pay for orc internment camps and the construction of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. In a discussion with Godfrey, Greymane questioned the wisdom of listening to the advice of Crowley and Godfrey in joining the Alliance, stating that it had gotten them nothing but dead Gilneans. Greymane stated his plans to withdraw from the Alliance and wall off Gilneas from the rest of the world. Upon looking at the map of Gilneas Greymane had in front of them, Godfrey suggested the wall be built through Crowley's lands, in effect cutting off &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of the kingdom, as Crowley's lands had the mountains as a natural barrier the wall could be built into. Greymane agreed and was confident that Crowley would understand his reasoning.\nYears after, the departure of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; who stated that the humans' poor leadership had led to the burning of their forests during the War, coupled with the expenses that led to rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and alongside the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from internment camps&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, led to disagreements between the kings. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; itself crumble, and led to the departure of Gilneas who cut off all military pacts with the Alliance. In order to stop the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or any other enemies from threatening his kingdom ever again, Genn decided to start the construction of his Wall which split his kingdom off from the world, cutting off Crowley's lands located at &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nDespite having managed to isolate his kingdom, Genn had other worries on his mind. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the gates were closed as the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; had devastated Gilneas' neighbors and not long after were outside the Wall. The number of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; was small at first, but it increased over time and they did not flag. Fearing it would break, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; opened the gate and Gilnean soldiers poured from Gilneas into Silverpine Forest. The Scourge, however, defeated the soldiers and raised them into undeath.\nWhile Gilnean soldiers slowly dwindled, King Greymane ordered &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; to summon the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. At first, everything went according to plan until the Scourge were driven off. With no more enemies left to fight, the beasts turned on the Gilnean soldiers stationed beyond the Greymane Wall. Consequently, King Greymane ordered the return of his troops as well as the permanent closure of the Greymane Wall's doors, however, some retreating soldiers were infected and began secretly to spread the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, reports of strange attacks and disappearances rose, fear took root in the hearts of Greymane's people, while the curse continued to spread in the kingdom through the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;, gradually eating away at Gilneas' humanity.\nIn an act of defiance against Greymane, Crowley sent the group of soldiers known as the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; outside the isolated kingdom to assist &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the end of the Third War, Genn's staunch isolationism led &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; to eventually take up arms against his king. Leading his &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebels\"&gt;armed supporters&lt;/a&gt; into Gilneas City in an attempt to depose King Genn, a bloody civil war named the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;Northgate rebellion&lt;/a&gt; erupted between the two factions, and officially ended when Crowley and his leading allies were captured by Greymane's forces.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Haggard%20Refugee\"&gt;Haggard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sickly%20Refugee\"&gt;sickly&lt;/a&gt; refugees from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were stopped from going into Gilneas due to the wall. &lt;a href=\"Dalin%20Forgewright\"&gt;Dalin Forgewright&lt;/a&gt; had dedicated himself to the care of the &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Valdred%20Moray\"&gt;Valdred Moray&lt;/a&gt; was trying to flee into Gilneas after murdering &lt;a href=\"Deliah%20Andrean\"&gt;Deliah Andrean&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wallace%20the%20Blind\"&gt;Wallace the Blind&lt;/a&gt; was also there, as well as &lt;a href=\"Stewvul\"&gt;Stewvul&lt;/a&gt; who was hiding in a &lt;a href=\"Inconspicuous%20Crate\"&gt;crate&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nYears later, to compound the worgen threat, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; started battering at the nation's gates in a bid to &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;conquer Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, but the Gilnean troops defending it coupled with the wall's mighty defenses were easily driving the Forsaken back despite all their efforts and daring attacks. Although the Gilneans' defenses held, the Greymane Wall began to deteriorate.\nThe gates of the Greymane Wall were eventually shattered by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, finally revealing what had happened to the kingdom and its citizens, and allowing the Forsaken war machine to invade the once-mighty nation. With the worgen curse taken hold, the Gilneans found a partial cure, allowing them to retain their human minds even when transformed, and allowing them to transform at will. As the Forsaken invaded the land, the worgen &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt;, the Alpha Prime, also infiltrated the land by using tunnels hidden underneath the Greymane Wall. Allying with the undead, he wanted to get the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the Gilneans evacuated from Gilneas and joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; led a counterattack against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in Gilneas and &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The worgen managed to push the undead out of Gilneas. The &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; made camps just beneath the shadow of the Wall: &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;7th Legion Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken, however, managed to capture &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; used her to bargain a surrender with &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; in front of the Wall's gate. After Darius and Lorna retreated back to Gilneas, Sylvanas was then killed by &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Vincent Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; but was soon resurrected by her loyal &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. After that, battles in the area ceased.\nIn the RPG.\nGreymane Wall is the only evident site in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and his people constructed the wall after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; to isolate themselves. This enormous gray wall marks the boundary between &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. No guards stand at its battlements or man its gates \u2014 the wall seems dead. Nevertheless, &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s from the north camp in the wall's shadow, hope for succor. These unfortunates never see any Gilnean and are easy prey for the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; that occasionally stray this far south from &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Some refugees were sent to &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; when he passed near the wall.\nSpeculation.\nThe massive gate at the wall is probably named \"the Northgate\", as the areas south of the wall are named &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Woods\"&gt;Northgate Woods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20River\"&gt;Northgate River&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; that was against the construction of the wall. The broken area of the gate was also known as \"Northgate Breach\" at some point."}

The keep sits on a large set of mountains that rise high above the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; capital, and which grant it a sweeping view of the surrounding area. Traditionally controlled by &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Greystone serves as the first line of defense for Boralus's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate%20%28Boralus%29\"&gt;great seagate&lt;/a&gt;, and thus the capital itself.\nHistory.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Greystone Keep remained heavily garrisoned by marines and other troops of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Tallis%20Skyheart\"&gt;Tallis Skyheart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hawkmaster%20Lloyd\"&gt;Hawkmaster Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Guard\"&gt;Waycrest Guard&lt;/a&gt; was also invited to the keep to teach some of the garrison the skill of training sea hawks.\nUnbeknownst to the keep's commander, a mutiny began brewing among the troops, as mysterious individuals approached some with offers of increased pay if they revolted. Led by &lt;a href=\"Fernn%20the%20Turncoat\"&gt;Fernn&lt;/a&gt;, the mutineers waited until commander Skyheart was absent on a munitions check and then launched a coup to take over the keep. Though many resisted the mutiny, they were driven from Greystone as Fernn's gang took control of the fortress. Soldiers still loyal to House Proudmoore remained determined to fight the traitors and established a camp in &lt;a href=\"Greystone%20Relief\"&gt;Greystone Relief&lt;/a&gt; just outside the walls. Joined again by Tallis Skyheart, the loyalists initially began losing ground.\nWhen a recently-arrived &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; joined the fight, the tide began to turn. Many of the loyalist injured were recovered from the field, while the local &lt;a href=\"saurolisk\"&gt;saurolisk&lt;/a&gt;s were dealt with. Fernn the Turncoat and his lieutenants were also slain during further attacks on the fort, disrupting their plans to turn the Greystone's &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. Coupled with the decimation of the mutineers, this gave the Proudmoore forces the upper hand in the struggle.\nSpeculation.\nIt is not known which \"questionable individuals\" first approached the mutineers to encourage them to revolt. It is likely that they were agents of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, which is active in eastern &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; in trying to undermine the power of House Proudmoore."}

The camp was set up by the survivors of a mutiny within the nearby keep, and these loyalists continue to seek to defeat the traitors in the name of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFollowing a coup in Greystone Keep while its commanding officer &lt;a href=\"Tallis%20Skyheart\"&gt;Tallis Skyheart&lt;/a&gt; was absent on patrol, mutineers seized control of the fortress and killed or expelled all forces loyal to &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Those who escaped Greystone chose not to flee and, instead, established a camp in Greystone Relief to continue the battle. Over time, the situation in the camp worsened, as the survivors remained too few to take back the keep and found themselves also beset by local &lt;a href=\"saurolisk\"&gt;saurolisk&lt;/a&gt;s. With the aid of an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the forces at Greystone Relief began to push back.\nMany of the wounded in the area were recovered and treated, while the number of saurolisks were thinned to reduce the threat. An offensive against the mutineers also succeeded in killing their leader &lt;a href=\"Fernn%20the%20Turncoat\"&gt;Fernn&lt;/a&gt; and his lieutenants, while also decimating the keep's defenders."}

{"id": "16332", "revid": "51302079", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16332", "title": "Griefing", "text": "Griefing refers to the act of a player ruining the gaming experience of another player, either involuntarily or on purpose (though this is debatable from one server to another - see below). The most obvious form of griefing is constant stalking of a player, by either following him or her for no reason, whispering useless messages, repeatedly sending them invitations after they decline, etc.\nGriefers are those who engage in griefing.\nTypes of griefing.\nGriefing can take numerous forms. Some forms are obvious attempts at griefing, while others may be considered by some to simply be good-natured jokes or even fair play. Bear in mind that the intentions of the apparent griefer may not be what you expect.\nAs griefing is a player-created term, it is not recognized as a behavior or any set of behaviors by Blizzard staff. Most of the time what is termed 'griefing' is simply an inconvenience brought about by interaction with other players. While such behavior may be irritating or obstructive, it is not usually a violation of the Terms of Service, and as such &lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; staff will not intervene in these instances.\nFor a fuller explanation of Blizzard's in-game policies, see the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//us.battle.net/support/en/article/42673\"&gt;Blizzard's In-Game Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; article.\nActionable offenses.\nThough not typically referred to as 'griefing', and not called as such by Blizzard, all these actions are against the ToS (\"Terms of Service\", as in &lt;a href=\"TUA\"&gt;TUA&lt;/a&gt;) and if reported action may be taken against the player or players involved. \nPvP griefing.\nOf the various behaviours open to players, Blizzard is least likely to get involved in disputes involving members of the opposite faction on &lt;a href=\"PvP%20realm\"&gt;PvP realm&lt;/a&gt;s. This is to prevent players who are simply enjoying the rule-set of PvP realms from being punished for doing so. In general, players on PvP realms should expect to experience far more direct and engaging interaction with players of the opposite faction. &lt;a href=\"GM\"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;s will not intervene in cross-faction player disputes on PvP realms, except in cases of extreme or excessive harassment.\nIn these cases, players are encouraged to find their own solutions to conflicts (&lt;a href=\"%23Solutions\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;). This follows the spirit of PvP and PvP realms, and can result in satisfying and even highly enjoyable resolutions to disputes. For example, players being repeatedly killed by others may call guild members or friends to assist them, turning one-sided stalking into full-scale &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;. On &lt;a href=\"PvE%20realm\"&gt;PvE realm&lt;/a&gt;s, many forms of PvP griefing can be prevented simply by turning off your character's &lt;a href=\"PvP%20flag\"&gt;PvP flag&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe actions below, although seen by some as dishonorable, are considered legitimate PvP tactics and will not be addressed by &lt;a href=\"GM\"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSolutions.\nFirst of all, note that just because a player does not follow WoW &lt;a href=\"etiquette\"&gt;etiquette&lt;/a&gt; does not necessarily mean that he or she griefs other players. Griefing is generally always relative and is subject to someone's decision, rather than a granted thing. It is always preferable to let the person know that what they are doing is upsetting to you before considering them potential griefers.\nSome actions to take in response to griefing:"}

More than just an orc now, Teron'gor gave up his old name and has taken a new one: Gorefiend.\"\nDesigner notes.\n\"We laid the groundwork for this encounter in Auchindoun, further reinforcing the rule that if you don\u2019t actually see a boss die, it\u2019s quite possible that you haven\u2019t seen the last of them. Of course, the inverse of that rule isn\u2019t necessarily true\u2014&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael\u2019thas&lt;/a&gt; says \u201chello.\u201d In any case, Gorefiend hearkens back to encounters like &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, where players are devoured and must overcome spirits inside the stomach of the bloated monstrosity to prevent them from escaping to attack the raid.\"\nOverview.\nGorefiend devours the spirits of players who otherwise would have suffered fatal damage. When consumed, players enter Gorefiend's stomach, which is full of hostile Trapped Souls that attempt to escape into the outside world to attack the raid. While inside Gorefiend's stomach, players can damage these Souls to weaken or defeat them before they escape. Each Soul that is released or slain reduces Gorefiend's energy. When Gorefiend reaches zero energy he begins a Feast of Souls, which recharges him to begin his assault anew.\nStrategy.\nGorefiend requires 2 tanks as he will pull one into the stomach to tank the Gorebound Spirit, and one outside to continue tanking the boss. Save &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; for the first Feast of Souls phase as that will be when the raid can do the most damage will minimal distractions. \nAside from the adds (see below), players who are outside the stomach need to worry about two mechanics: Touch of Doom and Crushing Darkness. Crushing Darkness creates a series of easily-spotted swirls on the ground in a spiral pattern that will explode and cause shadow-damage in a few seconds, simply stay away from them. Gorefiend will cast Touch of Doom on several random non-tank players. After the debuff expires, the affected players will drop a Doom Well (a large pool that causes Shadow damage) at their feet. These pools slowly but surely expand over time, making it very important for the affected players to react quickly and drop the pools at the edge of the room. Quick players can even drop pools on top of other ones, allowing for even more room. \nSoon after the battle begins, several players will be afflicted by Shadow of Death, pulling them inside Gorefiend's stomach. Those within the stomach have 40 seconds to do as much damage to Shadowy adds as possible before going to the center of the room to escape before Gorefiend Digests them, killing them instantly. The adds that will attack the raid once they get outside (Shadowy Constructs, Essences, and one Enraged Spirit) move slowly from the edge of the room to the center and can be slowed and stunned (unless they are Essences). \nThe Enraged Spirit (ghostly fel orc) takes priority: Avoid the Felfury it places on the ground, take it down to 50% and it will immediately run out, at which point the tank inside the stomach must immediately exit. The outside tank will take the now-Gorebound Spirit and tank it alongside Gorefiend, swapping with the other tank when stacks of Fel Flames the Spirit inflicts gets too high (typically 4-5 stacks). \nShadowy Constructs are ghostly skeletons and do not attack while in the stomach, so each of the DPS should have no trouble taking several of them down before they exit the stomach (remember to stun and slow). Once they exit, they become Gorebound Constructs and will fixate on a non-tank player, run towards them, and explode on contact for fatal damage. The constructs can no longer be stunned, only slowed, and must be killed before they reach their target. \nShadowy Essences are draenei spirits that must be healed by a healer in the stomach to be stopped, similar to the corrupted oozes in the &lt;a href=\"Immerseus\"&gt;Immerseus&lt;/a&gt; fight. As they are counted as friendly in the stomach, they cannot be slowed or stunned. Once they escape, they become hostile Gorebound Essences that will fire volleys of shadow bolts that will slow those hit and cause raid-wide damage. \nAs the fight progresses, Gorefiend's energy meter will decrease. Once it reaches zero, Gorefiend will enter his Feast of Souls phase. He will not attack, will draw Unstable Souls from the opposite side of the room toward him, will cause massive raid-wide damage over time, and take 100% increased damage from all sources. Finish off any remaining adds, have anyone still in the stomach come out, and have the DPS and healers stack-up to make healing easier and blow all DPS cooldowns including Bloodlust. Meanwhile, the tanks will be blocking the Unstable Souls from reaching the boss by simply running into them, which keeps him from regenerating energy faster. Have one tank take the left and one the right side of the room. Once the boss reaches 100 energy, he will wipe threat and resume attacking the raid. A tank should be in position before then to keep the stacked DPS or healers from getting hit. Spread out and repeat until the next feast phase.\nOverall, the raid must remember that adds always take priority as DPS will not be doing much damage to Gorefiend until the feast phase. Doomwells must be managed well due to how much movement will be happening when the adds come out due to people running away from Gorebound Constructs. Keep the focus on the mechanics and adds of the fight instead of the boss and the raid should be fine. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The weapon was famously wielded by &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, and was later also held by his son and heir\u2014&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\u2014until he discarded it in favor of an &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atoh%2C%20Desecrated%20Image%20of%20Gorehowl\"&gt;Old God replica&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gorehowl%20%28item%29\"&gt;Gorehowl (item)&lt;/a&gt; is also a drop from &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl%2C%20Might%20of%20the%20Warchief\"&gt;Gorehowl, Might of the Warchief&lt;/a&gt; drops in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGorehowl was forged three generations before &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash&lt;/a&gt; inherited it. Grommash's great-grandfather used Gorehowl to kill six legendary &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;. Their hearts were sealed into the blade, granting it untold strength.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Golmash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Golmash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the father of Grommash, was locked in the jaws of a giant gronn, he found the strength to stab Gorehowl into the gronn's eye and kill it alongside him. When they fell, it was the gronn who died first.\nAs a member of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Grom Hellscream took part in the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, Gorehowl in hand. Attacking &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, the axe would have cleaved the paladin's torso in two if the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; had not leaned back. Already sickened by the red mist, Nobundo was able to crush the fingers of Hellscream's right hand with his Light-blessed crystalline hammer. This compromised the orc's grip with Gorehowl and prevented Hellscream from attacking him further with the axe.\nHellscream had been the first to partake of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, eventually coming to regret it. When &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; met him, it was clear to him that Grom had the means by which to liberate his lethargic brothers and sisters. After Hellscream again drank the Blood of Mannoroth in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, in his hands, Gorehowl was the weapon which slew the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the second coming of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Hellscream took his axe to the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; after Thrall was beaten into unconsciousness. With a single blow, Hellscream cleaved his adversary's weapon in two and slew Mannoroth. Hellscream perished shortly afterward, but he had managed to break the curse over his people, freeing their souls and spirits from the demonic curse forever. It seems that afterward, Gorehowl was retrieved by Thrall or the orcs of the Horde in general and kept in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; himself gives Gorehowl to Garrosh, who wields it in the duel resulting in the death of &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh wielded the legendary weapon wherever he went.\nWhen Garrosh foolishly decided to go against the advice of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; and let the tauren solve their &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; problem, Garrosh barreled forward and assaulted &lt;a href=\"Brambleblade%20Ravine\"&gt;Brambleblade Ravine&lt;/a&gt; with fifteen &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron Guard&lt;/a&gt;s. The sole survivor, he nearly lost Gorehowl and his life, were it not for the intervention of Baine, Hamuul, and a handful of &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nGarrosh left Gorehowl behind in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Vault of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;. It was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, although it's unknown what happened to it later.\nThe warchief replaced the original Gorehowl with an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; replica of the weapon named &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atoh%2C%20Desecrated%20Image%20of%20Gorehowl\"&gt;Xal'atoh, Desecrated Image of Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nIn the alternate timeline, used Gorehowl to kill &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; after rejecting the demon's blood. Some time later, he appears to have given his Gorehowl to Garrosh; Grom was not seen wielding the axe in any of his subsequent appearances in Draenor, while Garrosh used it at &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt;. Following Garrosh's death in his &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; with Thrall at the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Stones of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, Gorehowl remained near his corpse where Thrall had deflected it.\n retrieved Gorehowl and brought it to Grommash in another failed attempt to convince him to drink demon blood.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\".\nGorehowl drops from in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. This is presumed to be a non-canon drop, as it turned out &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; kept it following &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash's&lt;/a&gt; demise and ultimately passed it down to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGorehowl is a famous weapon. The sharply curved axe head, with an intricate series of grooves in it, is massive, well worn, and permanently stained with old blood. Its wickedly curved blade has two notches in it, and many small holes in the head near the handle. When swung, the notches causes the axe to \"sing\" its own battle cry, just as Grom once did, which gave the weapon its name. The skull on the blade is believed to be that of a slain &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt;. The leather wrap on the handle would have been made from &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; hides. When it wasn't held in Garrosh's hands, he hooked it onto a brace on his back.\nGrom Hellscream\u2019s axe has a heavy blade that is notched and stained, with sharp, wicked curves. Small holes dot the blade near the handle; when the wielder swings the axe, air whistles through these holes. The sound keens over the battlefield, magically strengthened and imbued with otherworldly power. Gorehowl is one of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s most feared and notorious weapons.\nSpeculation.\nMalchezaar.\nIt has been speculated that Prince Malchezaar may have gotten his &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl%20%28item%29\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; from an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt;, considering his quote during the encounter:\nElaynea.\n&lt;a href=\"Elaynea%20Welton%20the%20Wind%20and%20Sea%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Elaynea Welton the Wind and Sea\u200e&lt;/a&gt; had a weapon with Gorehowl's model. If it is not a mistake, it could be Gorehowl that Garrosh had dropped in Pandaria. After Elaynea died in Tanaan, Garrosh may have retrieved the weapon and used it in Grommashar. Grommash's Gorehowl may have thus still be in the warchief's possession which would explain why he was seen with Gorehowl in Highmaul.\nHighmaul.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; raid, Grommash briefly appears with Gorehowl. It was thought that he might have retrieved it from the Stones of Prophecy. Since the legendary questline proved this wrong, Gorehowl being in Highmaul was probably an oversight and error.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Over its long and infamous history, the weapon has made its demonic bearer extraordinarily powerful.\nDuring the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\", Gorelix is confronted and slain on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; seeking to claim the axe for themselves.\nBiography.\nApprentice to Netrezaar.\nGorelix was once the most devoted follower of an &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; smith named &lt;a href=\"Netrezaar\"&gt;Netrezaar&lt;/a&gt;, who had created the Maw of the Damned with the intention of using it to drain the life essence of the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Netrezaar cared little for the dozens of mo'arg he commanded, and one day he began using a pair of them \u2014 Gorelix being one of the two \u2014 in gruesome experiments, slowly cutting their flesh with the axe to observe its life-draining properties. Gorelix was the only one to survive, but the experiments had left him shriveled and disfigured and the admiration he had once held for Netrezaar twisted into hatred. The mo'arg did not have the physical strength to rebel against his master, and even if he succeeded he would surely be punished with a fate worse than death for defying an eredar \u2014 one of Kil'jaeden's chosen. Thus, Gorelix vowed to find another way to exact vengeance, carefully observing Netrezaar's every action in search of a weakness. Over time, he discovered that Netrezaar refused to use his weapon in battle and kept it hidden from other demons, save his mo'arg servants, and it dawned on Gorelix that his master had no intention of ever using the axe for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the mo'arg heard of a planned meeting between Netrezaar and Kil'jaeden, the last puzzle piece slid into place and he realized the true purpose of the axe. Gorelix warned Kil'jaeden of the impending betrayal, and on the fateful day, the demon lord used his magics to lock the traitorous smith's spirit in place before he had a chance to strike. Gorelix took up the Maw of the Damned and finally exacted his vengeance against Netrezaar, cutting away at the eredar's flesh until only bone remained. Kil'jaeden then punished Netrezaar with a fate worse than death, sealing the smith's spirit inside his own skull before ordering Gorelix to fuse the bone onto the axe. The weapon's metals would constantly drain Netrezaar's spirit \u2014 in this way, the more life energy he consumed, the worse his hunger would grow. Kil'jaeden gifted the Maw of the Damned to Gorelix as a reward for his loyalty and gave him only one specific order: keep Netrezaar's spirit fed to continue his torture.\nChampion of the Legion.\nGorelix learned of the Maw's true power and potential on a small world besieged by the Legion. He and a team of mo'arg had been order to construct a citadel to serve as a base of operations, but during one battle, the world's defenders tore open a massive breach in the wall, and if it was not repaired soon, the entire citadel would fall. Gorelix volunteered to defend the breach while his fellow mo'arg worked. Alone, he defended the breach against hundreds of enemies, gaining greater strength and vitality for every kill. When the last enemy had fallen, the mo'arg found that they no longer needed to repair the breach. Gorelix had filled it with corpses.\nThe more Gorelix used the Maw, the more it changed him. He grew into a hulking mass of taut muscle, dwarfing every other mo'arg in size. His monstrous appearance earned him a new name: the Fleshripper. There were times when Gorelix did not use the axe, despite the power it gave him. Sometimes, he would observe from a distance while the Legion besieged a world, describing the battle and the lives lost in great detail to Netrezaar's spirit to taunt him. When the Maw began to physically tremble in Gorelix's hands, he knew that his former master's spirit was suffering, and he found as much satisfaction from these acts of torture as he did from consuming his enemies' life force.\nThe massacre of Centralis.\nOne day, the Legion set its sights on the world of &lt;a href=\"Centralis\"&gt;Centralis&lt;/a&gt;, which was home to a mighty warrior people that resisted the Legion's attempts at conquest much longer than other races. Kil'jaeden ordered Gorelix to travel to Centralis and march at the head of the Legion's army with the Maw in hand and consume every creature in his path. Not even the smallest wild beast was shown mercy, and when Gorelix's long march ended, only a dead world remained at his back. After this massacre, Gorelix continued learning how to make the most use of the Maw until he became one of the Legion's most invaluable tools, causing Kil'jaeden to save the mo'arg for special tasks rather than waste his talents in minor battles. This also allowed the demon lord to keep a close watch over the Maw of the Damned: though he trusted Gorelix, he could not risk the axe falling into enemy hands.\nLegion.\nDuring the Burning Legion's third invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and a hunter of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; narrowly escaped Gorelix on the portal world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, after retrieving &lt;a href=\"Thas%27dorah%2C%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Windrunners\"&gt;Thas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, a detachment of &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Dhakar\"&gt;Margrave Dhakar&lt;/a&gt; were dispatched to Niskara to kill Gorelix and claim the Maw of the Damned. However, the attempt failed and most of the knights were slaughtered, with the exception of Margrave himself, &lt;a href=\"Dagnar%20Stonebrow\"&gt;Dagnar Stonebrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minerva%20Ravensorrow\"&gt;Minerva Ravensorrow&lt;/a&gt;, who were taken captive. A &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; is sent to Niskara to join &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Sliver\"&gt;Baron Sliver&lt;/a&gt; and succeed where the previous group failed. As the champion and Sliver make their way across Niskara, rescuing one of the captive knights along the way, Gorelix continuously taunts them. As the three knights reach Gorelix's citadel, they find Margrave tied to a rock formation just as the Fleshripper appears, leaps down from a cliff and kills Margrave with a single blow from the Maw. After a vicious battle, the death knight champion succeeds in killing the mo'arg and claiming the axe for themselves, though with his dying breath Gorelix curses them by saying \"Netrezaar take you\".\nObjective of.\nHe needs to be killed for the ninth stage of &lt;a href=\"The%20Dead%20and%20the%20Damned\"&gt;The Dead and the Damned&lt;/a&gt;."}

Sargeras must have cared deeply for his pet, for he sculpted its power, gifting its sharp fangs with enough shadow energy to pierce reality itself. One of the beast's most notable features was a potent withering essence that made its bites extremely deadly. \nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded a new world, Goremaw would often accompany them, tearing enemy soldiers to shreds. Between battles, the felhound's &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; caretakers would collect the shadow energy dripping from its fangs, using it to craft powerful new weapons and reagents.\nOne such world had already been pacified, its leaders corrupted and its heroes slain. However, a lone child crept into the Legion's stronghold and killed several eredar and even Goremaw itself while they rested. When Sargeras saw his slain hound, he was consumed with rage and annihilated the world, scattering it as ashes in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; believed that Goremaw could still serve the Legion. Extracting the beast's fangs, he took them to a demon forge on the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to reforge them into a pair of deadly daggers. Though he dared not handle the task himself, his servants were eager to distinguish themselves. However, the fangs' twisted power often proved too dangerous, piercing their minds and inflicting unspeakable agony. When this happened, Mephistroth simply gave their souls to the forge and found another servant to take their place. In the end, the effort was successful, and Goremaw's teeth had become the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, their shadowy power and deadly withering essence preserved for all time. The daggers were eventually passed to &lt;a href=\"Akaari%20Shadowgore\"&gt;Akaari Shadowgore&lt;/a&gt;, one of Sargeras' deadliest assassins.\nSargeras' own hound was maybe once a felstalker, but over the years the Dark Titan reforged and reshaped his companion into something much more powerful. When, at last, he was pleased with his creation, he set about creating more of the hounds, and imbuing them with shadow and flame. &lt;a href=\"F%27harg\"&gt;F'harg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shatug\"&gt;Shatug&lt;/a&gt; are such examples."}

Goren are related to the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, and they usually eat rocks, &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt;. They are relentless and voracious, and can even overwhelm those who are not prepared to face them.\nHistory.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, goren were encountered mostly in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, with small colonies being present on &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, they participated in attacks on the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn Gorgrond, a group of goren settled in a valuable quarry. The goren and the quarry were targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother group in Talador living in a cavern beneath an inhabited section caused to be unstable due to their appetite. To protect those above the cavern, Alliance and Horde soldiers were sent to deal with the goren.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSome goren were caught in &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;'s teleportation spell, so they materialized in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; along with the . They quickly burrowed their way somewhere south of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of them participated in the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; shape the world through their brute individual strength, the goren are scavenging opportunists who dart unseen between the lumbering feet of their &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;larger cousin&lt;/a&gt;s. Roughly the size of an Azerothian &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;, goren live in massive colonies that burrow through the earth, gobbling up minerals and leaving twisting caves in their wake. They enjoy devouring crystalline minerals, which are digested and extruded through their skin, giving some goren the benefit of an armored crystalline shell. The bane of both &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; miners, goren sniff out and infest mineral-rich burrows. Adventurers should be wary of the gorens\u2019 ability to shoot crystalline projectiles and swarm around unprepared explorers in rolling packs, as well as their impossibly sharp teeth and acidic spit.\nWhile the majority of goren are smaller than &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, some types grow far larger, towering over even the tauren. Rare individuals have been known to grow to monstrous proportions. This is significantly determined by the dietary success of the individual goren - given sufficient sustenance a goren can grow far beyond the normal size for their species. The largest known goren is &lt;a href=\"Oregorger\"&gt;Oregorger&lt;/a&gt;, whose gluttony has led his frame to swell far beyond the size of any other. It is possible goren simply continue to grow throughout their lives without limit, at least as long as they have enough food to satisfy their ravenous appetites. It should be noted that goren (not unlike &lt;a href=\"sprite\"&gt;sprite&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt;) have no love for raw turnips, and are not interested in eating them.\nThe goren of &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt; seem at home in the searing heat of &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Quarry\"&gt;Molten Quarry&lt;/a&gt;, where they apparently subsist upon the iron ore found in the quarry and nearby &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Mine\"&gt;Ogre Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Goren reproduce by laying eggs, hatching small swarms of younglings at a time as seen in Molten Quarry.\nThe goren inherit the powers of whatever they eat. This specifically includes elementals, but may also work for other types of beings or substances. The minerals they eat are metabolized into crystalline structures grown as scales from their arms and back. The matrix of the scales is flawless, as if produced from a forge on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, only natural. The rocky plates the scales form have magical properties. These crystals are used by some as weapons. The acid left behind can be deadly, though, even to the wielder. The putrid-smelling gasses that the goren contain in their gut is extremely corrosive to almost anything, but can't digest valuable gems. This may help them with digestion and is likely a factor related to their acidic spit.\nWhile it appears that goren prefer minerals, they can and will eat flesh, including that of sapient beings.\nGoren are strongly attracted to elemental magic. They may even be able to smell the magic upon shamans.\nAlthough showing little signs of humanoid intelligence, some have been seen using tools like pickaxes."}

He is initially found in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Angerfang%20Encampment\"&gt;Angerfang Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. There, he is described to be the chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Angerfang\"&gt;Angerfang&lt;/a&gt; Dragonmaw.\nIn the Wetlands, he took Nek'rosh Skullcrusher's position as a leader in the area. He later took control of the clan after the death of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, as he represents the Dragonmaw at the prestige ceremony in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. This is later repeated at the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival, where it is definitively stated he is the chieftain. Unlike those that came before him, he seeks to bring the Dragonmaw back to an honorable future; rather than one laiden with subjugation and &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGorfax and the Angerfang were long-time supporters of &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; and his son, &lt;a href=\"Nek%27rosh%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nek'rosh&lt;/a&gt;. Gorfax later found this support regretful, leading to nothing but death and dishonor.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Angerfang are led exclusively by Gorfax; describing him as 'chief' of the Angerfang Dragonmaw. He was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Whelgar\"&gt;Prospector Whelgar&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that the Dragonmaw did not attack them at &lt;a href=\"Whelgar%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Whelgar's Retreat&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Gorfax, the Angerfang joined &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s Horde alongside the rest of the Dragonmaw clan. It is unknown whether or not any of the group sided with Hellscream during the rise of the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; or defected into the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDespite his defeat at the hands of the Alliance adventurer, Gorfax could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde when a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer reached Prestige Rank 2. He was present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulated the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nDragonflight.\nGorfax was present at Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival, where he stood as chieftain of the clan. He lamented the fact that &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has had a bitter experience concerning his clan. He also told the tale of the sad story of his people, chastising his own hand in supporting Nek'rosh Skullcrusher. He stated their legacy has been stained with enslaving or subjugating another race, typically draconic, and he would like to lead them out of this dark legacy on their own merit. He was so vested in this concept; he stated he was willing to redeem the clan, or die trying. Upon orc champions requesting to join the Dragonmaw, Gorfax reaffirmed that it was their wish. He subsequently instructed them with hunting, tracking, and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Gorfax accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of the clan.\nAs the Kosh'harg festival neared its end, Gorfax cheered orc champions as the champion of their people."}
