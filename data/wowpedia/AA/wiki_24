She was among the soldiers saved when her brother selflessly sacrificed himself to hold off an overwhelming force of &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the war ended, Mereldar dedicated her life to caring for humanity's wounded veterans. It was she who first spoke to other humans about visions of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. In her dreams, Mereldar saw &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;five strange, inhuman forms&lt;/a&gt; thrumming with holy power that filled her mind with the wisdom of holiness, protection, justice, retribution, and compassion. When she put their wordless teachings into practice, power seemed to flow through her, miraculously curing wounds and illnesses.\nMereldar met with others who had also reported seeing the visions, and together they codified and wrote down the wisdom of this higher power, based on the tenet of selflessness and a belief that the Light dwelled in all things. The movement sparked widespread faith in the Light and became the predominant human religion, and centuries later the different Light-based traditions and belief systems were codified by &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s leaders into the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;."}

Following her mother's death, she became the \"de facto\" leader of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, until her ascension to Aspect on the Dragon Isles.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Merithra led the green flight in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and forged a pact with &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt;, the matriarch of the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; clans. Millennia later, Merithra played a major role in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, but was taken captive by the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and trapped in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; alongside the red &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt; and the blue &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;. She remained trapped there for a thousand years before she was freed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, following Ysera's death, Merithra stepped forward to represent the green dragonflight and worked with a mortal hero to help save the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; from an &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;infestation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. While not confident she could live up to her mother's legacy, she decided she would do her best to fulfill the task ahead. When the Dragon Isles reawakened, Merithra led efforts to re-empower her flight's &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;oathstone&lt;/a&gt;, and renewed her pact with the centaur clans in order to defend the Emerald Dream from the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; settled on the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, the green dragonflight's home in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Broodlands&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons were initially hostile toward their new neighbors and fought with them over territory, which soon led to a large-scale confrontation. Merithra, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, flew to fight the centaur, but was knocked out of the sky by the centaur matriarch &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt;. The two fought each other across the plains, reshaping the landscape in the process, but they were both evenly matched and neither could defeat the other. When they were both exhausted, hostile &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s took the opportunity to attack. Merithra and Teera realized that both of their peoples would be doomed if they continued to fight, so they allied against their common enemy and destroyed them.\nTeera and Merithra's friendship ended the enmity between dragons and centaur and proved that it would only be beneficial if they laid down arms against each other. They met upon the hill of &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; and made a pact of respect: the green flight and the Maruuk promised to stay out of each other's way but come to the aid of the other when their livelihoods were threatened. The &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; was created as a physical manifestation of their oath.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, the dragon &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and fought alongside the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; against the qiraji. The sheer numbers of qiraji and silithid proved overwhelming, however, and so Anachronos called upon the progeny of the other &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, including Merithra.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, she helped push the qiraji back into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; which allowed Anachronos, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, and the night elves to create a magical barrier to seal the fortress. The three dragons and their companions flew headlong into the insect city as the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; was erected behind them, leaving them imprisoned within the walls of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the betrayal and death of Arygos, and the death of Caelestrasz in the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, Merithra became the last one alive of the three former captives.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Merithra accompanied her mother to a meeting of the former &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. She began to tell them that there were rumors of renewed activity from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested that the Nightmare might be searching for a new Nightmare Lord. Ysera pointedly told her daughter that they'd already discussed the subject and that, with the loss of the Aspects' powers, the protection of the Emerald Dream now fell to mortal &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; was invaded by terrible creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, causing Merithra to call for aid as she was doubtful that she could combat this threat on her own. After entering the Dream, she directed her &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; to combat the Void in order to secure the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;, and to acquire &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Shard\"&gt;fragments&lt;/a&gt; of the dragonflight's power. She became distressed upon learning that &lt;a href=\"Karkarius\"&gt;Karkarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thessera\"&gt;Thessera&lt;/a&gt; chose to give up and embrace death rather than fight for their lives.\nAgreeing to help empower the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Merithra ventured to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;ancient heart of the Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, where she planned on empowering the Heart of Azeroth with the essence of her dragonflight. However, she was surprised to discover that the area was withering in the Void's grasp. She subsequently asked her allies to destroy the Void forces in order to continue with their quest, and personally felt responsible for the corruption that had taken hold. Believing that Ysera would be pleased that some of the green dragonflight's power would go toward saving the world, Merithra had her allies throw the emerald fragments in the lake, where she and other green dragons combined them with their power into a &lt;a href=\"Reforged%20Dreamglow%20Dragonscale\"&gt;powerful dragonscale&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Emerald Dream fighting back against the Void, Merithra directed champions to bring the dragonscale back to &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt;. She subsequently made her way to the chamber as well, where she channeled her power into the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Forge\"&gt;Heart Forge&lt;/a&gt; and expressed pride in standing with the other dragonflights in defense of Azeroth.\nShe later journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; after sensing the distress of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;Azerite elemental&lt;/a&gt;s invading the area.\nMerithra later returned to the Chamber of Heart where she joined &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; in empowering the Heart of Azeroth. In a conversation with her aunt Alexstrasza, Merithra asked what her mother had truly been like before she became an Aspect and expressed doubt that she would be able to live up to Ysera's legacy. Alexstrasza explained that despite appearances, Ysera's strength was subtle yet indispensable for Azeroth, and encouraged her to have faith in herself.\nShadowlands.\nA vision of Merithra appears in Ysera's dreams while still within a wildseed, named as '&lt;a href=\"Daughter%20%28Ardenweald%29\"&gt;Daughter&lt;/a&gt;'.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; gifted &lt;a href=\"the%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;the Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera's soul told Tyrande to bring the tear to Merithra, who knew of a place where it could be protected.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nMerithra was one of many dragons who assembled at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; when they felt a strange longing sensation in their hearts. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; informed them that it was the call of the reawakening &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; which were calling the dragons back home.\nDragonflight.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; awakened, the green dragonflight was in an unstable state. Although Merithra had stepped up as their de facto leader, it is possible that not all of the flight agreed that she should lead them. Upon returning to the Isles, Merithra and the greens entered the Emerald Dream to empower their &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;Emerald Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after they returned to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;, they were attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; army led by &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to reach the Emerald Dream portal on the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;. The greens repelled them, leading to a stalemate. Merithra hoped that the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; clans could help turn the tide and sent an emissary, &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt;, to ask the centaur to honor the pact she had once made with their ancestors. &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; agreed to help the dragons, but the centaur of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; allied with the Primalists and attacked the other clans. The Nokhud provided the Primalists with a new weapon, the &lt;a href=\"dragonkiller%20ballista\"&gt;dragonkiller ballista&lt;/a&gt;, with which they breached the greens' defenses.\nUsing the captive &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, Koroleth and the Nokhud leader, &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt;, then blew the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; to summon Merithra, her son &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solethus\"&gt;Solethus&lt;/a&gt; into a trap. As the dragons approached the Horn, the Nokhud tried to kill Merithra with one of their ballistae, but Solethus sacrificed himself by absorbing the bolt meant for her. Khanam Matra Sarest and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sought Merithra out at the &lt;a href=\"Watering%20Hole%20%28Ohn%27ahran%20Plains%29\"&gt;Watering Hole&lt;/a&gt;, explained the Nokhud's betrayal, and told her that she still had the support of clans &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Teerai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Shikaar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt;. Merithra accepted their aid and flew with Gerithus, the hero, and Solethus' body back to the &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shady Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, where she gave the hero her blessing so they could rally the rest of the green flight.\nMerithra then led her forces to join up with the centaur clans and meet the Primalist army at the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Scar\"&gt;Storm Scar&lt;/a&gt;, where Koroleth was trying to break down the magical shield protecting the Ancient Bough. After Sarest and the hero destroyed the dragonkiller ballistae, Merithra flew into battle with her fellow dragons and destroyed Koroleth's defenses with her poison breath, allowing Sarest and the hero to kill her. With the Primalists scattering, Merithra then invited the centaur &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s and the adventurer to join her at the Ancient Bough, where they held a ceremony to renew the vow Merithra had made with the centaur's first matriarch, &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt;, through an exchange of ceremonial gifts. Merithra and Sarest vowed that dragons and centaur would work together to protect the Dream and the Ohn'ahran Plains, causing the Emerald Oathstone to reawaken. Merithra then sent the adventurer onward to help the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; claim the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyrande and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;The Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt; to the Ancient Bough. Knowing they held the hopes of souls of so many fallen night elves, they asked Merithra if she was sure it would be safe there. Merithra told them to follow her and they stepped into the Emerald Dream portal.\nSometime later Merithra welcomed &lt;a href=\"Rymek\"&gt;Rymek&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; who presented himself as an ambassador of the blue dragonflight, who had arrived to learn and help protect the Emerald Gardens. As she helped educate Rymek on the green dragonflight and the garden, she directed adventurers with waking &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;s so that they may further help keep the garden safe, and with culling the &lt;a href=\"lasher\"&gt;lasher&lt;/a&gt;s, in order to collect their seeds and deliver them to the &lt;a href=\"Sister%20of%20the%20Garden\"&gt;Sisters of the Garden&lt;/a&gt; with the intuition of using them to cultivate the vegetation in the garden. As adventures carried out these tasks, they discovered that one of the ancients had been slain. Merithra was deeply troubled by this and feared that the Primalists were preparing for another attack. Unbeknownst to her, the Primalists had already begun their attack, as Rymek and his companions were in reality members of the Primalists, taking advantage of the trust between her and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nIgnorant of Rymek's true purpose, she sent him with adventurers to help her son with his magical project, which was focused on returning &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to life, and later granted him access to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;. While there, Rymek was able to manipulate his way into gaining access to the Emerald Dream portal, where he used his powers to claim the area for the Primalists. Merithra was stunned by the betrayal and feared that the Primalists didn't just seek to attack the Emerald Dream but to claim the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt;, which was meant to be a new beginning for the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; people. Though Rymek's magic prevented them from entering the grove, Merithra realized that there was a way in from death. However, her first course of action was to gather allies. Thus, sent adventurers to rally the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and Maruuk Centaur within the Shady Sanctuary.\nSoon afterward, she was approached by &lt;a href=\"Somnikus\"&gt;Somnikus&lt;/a&gt;, who informed her that Malfurion had taken &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s place in death, so that her mother may return to life, and that as soon as Ysera reached the Dream, they would make way for the defenders. Following the barrier's destruction, Ysera was reunited with her daughter, Merithra, who noted that she was different, that she had been touched by Death. With Ysera returned to them, the green dragonflight moved as one to save the &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;nascent World Tree&lt;/a&gt; from being destroyed by Rymek. Merithra also revealed to her mortal allies that &lt;a href=\"Lunedane\"&gt;Lunedane&lt;/a&gt; must be secure in order to eradicate the Primalist from the Emerald Dream, and that an ancient artifact within would have the power to expel their enemies all at once. However, she admitted that she didn't know if her mother had the power to use it and command it anymore but that it was something they would have to deal with once Rymek was stopped. For her part, Ysera declared that she was no longer connected to the Dream as she had once been and that someone new must arise to take her place.\nFollowing Rymek's death, mother and daughter turned their attention towards healing the Dream. However when the time came to activate the power within Lunedane, Merithra was caught off guard when Ysera encouraged her daughter to step out of the shadow of her wings and spread her own. Merithra initially refused, pointing out that the Dreamer had always been Ysera and that she wasn't ready for it. In response, Ysera remarked that few ever think they were, when the time came, and gave her daughter one last encouragement. After reflecting on how the Emerald Flight and the Dream had felt different with her mother's death, she admitted that she thought it would return to as it did before with her return. However, she declared that everything had changed, that it was time to accept that change, and to move forward with the power they have. Thus Merithra stepped forward, activating the power within the Lunedane, destroying the Primalists forces, and securing her place as the new Dreamer.\nFollowing this, Ysera admitted that from the moment she reentered the Dream, she knew things were different, and that it was only fitting that her daughter would be the one to ascend after she had taken care of the flight since her death, that she must in fact lead the Emerald Flight. Thus when Merithra offered to return \"The Dreamer\" mantle back to her, Ysera refused, and declared that Merithra was the leader of the green dragonflight and that when they reclaimed their full powers, she would be the Aspect. With that declaration Merithra accepted the position, pledging that she would do her best as leader of the green dragonflight and do whatever it takes. Following this mother and daughter took to the skies and flew together once more.\nBy the time of &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Merithra had taken her place at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Seat of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; besides her fellow &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; arrived and informed the Aspects of what transpired within &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; was selected to be the new Aspect of the flight, Alexstrasza declared that the threat of Aberrus had been quailed and had made them grow stronger, while declaring that soon Azeroth would welcome a &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;s symbol hope&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and that they would protect it. Merithra agreed with her and reflected on how such a small seed fueled by hope and love thrived, with the time nearing for it to return from the Dream to fulfill its purpose. She further admitted that while she had filled the role of Aspects for the green dragonflight, she had been afraid to acknowledge it, because doing so would admit that her mother was truly gone. However, after declaring that she wasn't gone and that she wasn't a child, Merithra vowed that it was her place to lead the flight, and she would gladly do so.\nSpeculation.\nHer father is likely &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; as he was the only dragon explicitly identified as Ysera's consort, though it's possible that Ysera had multiple consorts like &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; did.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

They are mainly known from &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; folklore but have also been mentioned elsewhere.\nKul Tiras.\nDescription.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; folklore, mermaids lived openly near &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; in its oldest days, when it was still only a fledgling town. The people of the town had all seen the beings\u2014mostly by spotting them when they sat on the rocks to watch the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; ships\u2014and knew them to be as real as &lt;a href=\"siren\"&gt;siren&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. They had human-like torsos, webbed hands, fish's tails in place of legs, and beautiful faces and long curly hair that were colored all the shades of seaweed and coral. They hatched from eggs in clutches that could consist of several dozen. Each individual was allotted a certain amount of the &lt;a href=\"Mother%20%28mermaids%29\"&gt;Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s power from birth, and once that power was used up, the mermaid turned into a sizzle of bubbles and died, leaving no trace behind. Because of this, and because they were naturally selfish, they did not like to use their power over rocks and water lightly. Mermaids were still considered young at a hundred years old, and thrifty individuals that conserved their power might live to be five hundred. They were passionate beings who cried easily and did nothing by halves.\nMermaids made their homes in underwater caves and &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; ruins located far deeper than any human could dive. Some human pearl-divers falsely claimed that they lived in palaces filled with treasure from sunken ships, but in truth, their only wealth was pearls, which they considered hardly more valuable than pebbles. They clung to rocks before storms to hunt the boils of fish coming into &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;Boralus Harbor&lt;/a&gt; for safety, and sometimes sat out on the sea ice to plait their hair. They were ignorant or contemptuous of the humans and often competed with fishermen for their catch. While they did cause some human deaths, it was mostly from foolishness rather than malice. Unlike sirens, mermaids did not seek to enthrall humans; on the contrary, they considered sirens lazy and murlocs deplorable.\nHowever, due to the aforementioned behavior, the inhabitants of Boralus came to view mermaids as portents of storms and poor fishing. It was held as common knowledge that the worst storms were presaged by the sight of mermaids on the rocks, and the worst winters by the sight of mermaids sitting on the sea ice. The humans eventually came to believe that the mermaids brought the storms themselves (rather than simply portending them) and that sighting a mermaid on the first day of a voyage doomed the journey to failure. Before long, all of Boralus told tales about mermaids scuttling ships, becalming the waters or making them choppy (whichever one the sailors hadn't wanted at the time), dragging humans down into the water to drown them, or swimming by ships to lure sailors to their doom. If mermaids were spotted near a ship, the sailors usually threw rocks or lanterns at them. The &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt; warned people against these superstitions, but only to a point.\nWhy the mermaids left Boralus.\nThis dim view of mermaids changed as the result of a young mermaid named &lt;a href=\"Halia\"&gt;Halia&lt;/a&gt;, who loved to watch ships go by and fell in love with &lt;a href=\"Ery\"&gt;Ery&lt;/a&gt;, a tidesage serving aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Windward\"&gt;Windward&lt;/a&gt;\". Her dozens of sisters called her a fool for approaching the ships even though she knew that the sailors hated her, but Halia insisted that she had to watch over the humans to see if she could help them. The sailors of the \"Windward\" wanted to kill or scare off the mermaid, but Ery forbade them from doing so. Halia started leaving gifts for Ery when the \"Windward\" was anchored in Boralus Harbor. The tidesage was touched by this and became attracted to Halia's beauty as well, and the two eventually met in the harbor and confirmed their love for each other. Halia asked Ery to come live with her underwater, explaining that if she waited until dawn, slit her feet from the toes to the heels, and then walked into the harbor, the Mother would take pity on her and turn her into a mermaid. Ery refused, citing her duties as a tidesage, and stated that they had to keep their relationship secret or else her crew would reject her.\nOne day a great storm came to Boralus, threatening to destroy the town. Ery and the other tidesages traveled to the river's mouth to try to hold back the water, but they faltered one by one until only Ery was left. Halia vowed to help her beloved by constructing a wall of rocks and mud on the seabed, a task she poured more and more of herself into even though the effort threatened to kill her. This brave intention caused a crest of the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt;'s magic to sweep through the harbor, jolting all of Halia's sisters awake. They shouted at their sister to stop, for while they were not frightened by the storm or concerned for Boralus, they had never conceived that one of their own might pay a price for it. After failing to convince Halia, they threw themselves into her labor and were soon joined by other mermaids who did the same. Together they built the wall higher and higher until it breached the surface and continued to rise under Ery's feet. Some of the oldest mermaids died and turned into bubbles in the process, their power spent, but the rest didn't stop working until the wall towered over the harbor. At this point, Ery collapsed from exhaustion and fell into the harbor. Without her power, the waves crashed into the wall, but it held steady. The crew of the \"Windward\"\u2014who had watched the events unfold\u2014brought Halia and the seemingly-dead Ery aboard their ship. Halia slit her beloved's feet with a knife and then jumped back into the harbor with her. There, the Mother transformed Ery into a mermaid, allowing her and Halia to be together at last.\nAll of Kul Tiras now knows Ery's story. As long as Boralus' seawall has stood, its people now swear on mermaids as symbols of highest honor and good luck, as well as sacrifice, for no mermaids were ever seen in the harbor again."}

He is an incredibly powerful &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; user, with nearly three thousand years of experience, whose purpose has always been the protection of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He was a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, and is the foster father and mentor of &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;'s son.\nBiography.\nTroll Wars.\nMeryl fought in the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; (presumably making him one of the original &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;One Hundred&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;). He was mortally wounded during the wars, but couldn't let himself remain dead as too many lives depended on the completion of his mission. Through his magic, he became undead. As such he is neither one of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, having been undead for roughly 2,800 years. &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; both regarded him as a great hero.\nOver a century after the Troll Wars, Meryl became one of the founding members of the now defunct &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegends: The First Guardian.\nMeryl aided his colleagues against the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to steal the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Waters\"&gt;Amulet of Waters&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nAt an unknown point in time, Meryl befriended the half-orc &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;. After Garona was forced to murder &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, she asked Meryl to take care of her infant son, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, as she believed herself to be a danger to him. She told Meryl to never tell Med'an about his parentage, and she refused to name the boy's father. She also asked Meryl to hide away her daggers, &lt;a href=\"The%20Kingslayers\"&gt;Anguish and Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes that they'd never have to be used again. Meryl went on to raise Med'an like his own son, teaching him that the strong should aid the weak and that, above all, truth matters.\nYears later, when Med'an witnessed his mother being kidnapped by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, he chased after her. When Meryl discovered it, he quickly flew after him, arriving in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; just in time to warn the island of an approaching &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. After fighting off the Scourge, he discovered that &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;'s father was &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, and along with &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, where Med'an was held as a prisoner. They managed to save Med'an but before they were able to leave, they were intercepted by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; who had knocked Meryl out with his incredible power. Valeera tried to fend off Cho'gall while Med'an tried to revive Meryl but Cho'gall was too strong and growing more desperate, Valeera offered herself willingly to the demon within her body in order to obtain the power to fend off Cho'gall. This allowed Meryl enough time to recover and teleport them to safety. When they reached a secure location, Meryl discovered that the demon that had possessed Valeera was none other than &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, a demon whom he and the original &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; banished centuries ago. In order to lure the demon away from Valeera's body, he challenged the demon to possess his body instead and being the stronger of the two wills managed to repress the demon in his body.\nThough he tried to contain Kathra'natir, his will eventually faltered during the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;'s offensive on Cho'gall and his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; Cult. Having lost control, the demon was able to slay the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dalynnia%20Wrathscar\"&gt;Dalynnia Wrathscar&lt;/a&gt; and drain her of her power before Meryl got him back under control. Recognizing that his demonic possession was a liability to those around him, he declined membership in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; and left in self-imposed exile, renaming himself Meryl Felstorm as a sign of his corruption.\nRecent activities.\nMeryl Felstorm has been seen in various ancient libraries researching ancient tomes related to binding, imprisoning, and banishing demons, in hopes that he might one day find a permanent prison for Kathra'natir.\nLegion.\nDespite Meryl's best efforts to subdue Kathra'natir, the dreadlord managed to break free and attacked the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; in Dalaran. With the aid of a mage &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and the spirit of his old student Alodi, Meryl fought Kathra'natir off, but Kathra'natir escaped into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; before he could be killed. Meryl and Alodi gathered the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and brought it to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo obtain &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; that was last wielded by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Scrolls%20of%20Meitre\"&gt;Ancient Scrolls of Meitre&lt;/a&gt; are to be provided to complete the task. He told the mage adventurer to meet with Kalec to obtain the relic while he's tidying up the Hall of the Guardian.\nFinding Ebonchill that was wielded by Alodi himself, to which eventually ended up to archmage Arrexis. After finding information on Arrexis, it was confirmed that the eredar &lt;a href=\"Balaadur\"&gt;Balaadur&lt;/a&gt; ambushed him to take his staff. Alodi panics that it is in the hands of the enemy currently invading Azeroth. Meryl suggests that they should recreate Arrexis's ritual to draw out Balaadur to get Ebonchill back. Felstorm tasks the mage adventurer to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Focusing%20Crystal\"&gt;Ritual Focusing Crystal&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains of Deadwind Pass past Karazhan, and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Stone\"&gt;Demon Stone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Daio%20the%20Decrepit\"&gt;Daio the Decrepit&lt;/a&gt;. Alodi gets his gems from his personal vault in Dalaran and was wondering about &lt;a href=\"Glutonia\"&gt;Glutonia&lt;/a&gt; an old elf woman. Meryl simply says she is a goblin now. The ritual was presented in &lt;a href=\"Faronaar\"&gt;Faronaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; to lure Balaadur into the fray. Ebonchill was then taken from the enemy for the mage adventurer to wield.\nWithin the Hall, Meryl asked the mage adventurer to find a goblin named &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;The Great Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt; to summon mages around Azeroth to come together. Felstorm reformed the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;--a group of magi used by the Council of Tirisfal in the absence of a Guardian--and declared that its goal was to hunt Kathra'natir down.\nLater, Meryl catches a magical sickness marked with violent coughs that forces him out of commission. It is actually a magical attack of fel origin which Kathra'natir is behind, as he is using the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; and the power of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; to drain Meryl's power. After Kathra'natir is imprisoned in the Nightborne Soulstone, Meryl is saved.\nMeryl was one of the order hall champions who met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. Aethas Sunreaver called for help from the Archmage and Meryl can provide any assistance they can.\nAction figure.\nMeryl's first ever appearance was as an undead &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; featured in DC Unlimited's &lt;a href=\"Action%20figures\"&gt;\"World of Warcraft: Series 1\" action figure set&lt;/a&gt;. He was wearing the &lt;a href=\"Corruptor%20Raiment\"&gt;Corruptor Raiment&lt;/a&gt; set.\nSpeculation.\nHow Meryl and Garona became friends is not specified but it is likely that it happened during the course of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;."}

L. McKinney&lt;/a&gt; published in the anthology \"&lt;a href=\"Folk%20%26amp%3B%20Fairy%20Tales%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Folk &amp; Fairy Tales of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\". It is illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Cory%20Godbey\"&gt;Cory Godbey&lt;/a&gt;. It is an expanded retelling of the early parts of &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;Mists of Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20of%20the%20Earthmother\"&gt;Sorrow of the Earthmother&lt;/a&gt; myths, and mainly focuses on the relationship between the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and her children, &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nIn the time before time, the pregnant &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; roams the emptiness of the world and is unswayed by the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old Ones&lt;/a&gt; trapped in the depths. Wanting to create a safe place where she can give birth, she shapes the world, creating, naming, and befriending the four elements and allowing the first wildlife to appear. She gives birth to twins, &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;, whom the elements name Sun and Moon. The twins form close bonds with the elements and grow in power, but their mother remains vigilant against the Old Ones and their &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadows&lt;/a&gt;. She eventually grows tired and presses her children into her eyes so she can keep them safe while she sleeps. In the twins' absence, the elements' behavior changes and causes the first winter. When the Earth Mother wakes, the elements show her how rest has allowed new life to thrive, and she teaches her children how to bring about the changes of the seasons at will from inside her eyes.\nSeeing her children grow fills the Earth Mother with joy, a feeling she wants to share with them. The next time she slumbers, she stretches over the land so that the beating her of heart digs into the earth, saturating it with \"the song of life\". When she awakens, she is surrounded by new life: the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;shu'halo&lt;/a&gt; (tauren). An'she and Mu'sha teach the shu'halo everything they know, including how to care for the land and commune with the elements, and for a time all is peaceful. However, the next time the Earth Mother slumbers, the Old Ones stretch their influence across the land and corrupt many of the shu'halo with their whispers, causing the world to descend into chaos and bloodshed. An'she and Mu'sha wake their mother, who\u2014upon seeing how the world has been tainted\u2014sheds a single tear.\nThe Earth Mother realizes that she is also susceptible to corruption and her children with her, and so rips An'she and Mu'sha free from her skull. Unable to console their mother, the twins set out to hunt down the source of the corruption. They encounter a group of uncorrupted shu'halo, who present a radiant blue infant they found in the fields. The twins realize that this infant is their mother's single tear and therefore their sibling. Suddenly, the shadows attack the group. Sun and Moon hold them off with the elements' aid, but An'she sustains a wound that Mu'sha is unable to heal.\nThe Earth Mother hears of her children's peril and finds them with the help of the elements. She informs Mu'sha that her presence is keeping the bleeding An'she alive. When presented with the infant child, she names them &lt;a href=\"Lo%27sho\"&gt;Lo'sho&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that the shadows will return to take the rest of the shu'halo, the Earth Mother decides to sacrifice herself to contain the darkness. She tells her twins to permanently take to the skies, from where they'll be able to chase away any shadows she cannot hold, and to always stay close to each other so Mu'sha can tend An'she's wounds. She gives Lo'sho to Mu'sha and tells the twins to teach the infant everything they know, and that her love will always be with them and all of her children. The Earth Mother summons the elements and embraces the land one last time, never to rise and walk the land again, so that she can keep the world safe from the shadows. Mu'sha and An'she take their eternal post in the skies with Lo'sho. The story ends with an assurance that the Earth Mother's essence still cradles the world under the now ever-present glow of the Sun and Moons, and that her love and wisdom will always be there to guide her shu'halo children."}

Asking Eyir to explain her the truth, she revealed that it was &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; who had sent the assassins that fateful night, for an ancient &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt; prophecy foretold that she would bring ruins to the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, as described in the &lt;a href=\"%3AScrolls%20of%20the%20Faldrottin\"&gt;:Scrolls of the Faldrottin&lt;/a&gt;. Sigryn, overwhelmed with anger, lost control of the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; inside her, which her father &lt;a href=\"Skovald\"&gt;Skovald&lt;/a&gt; had fed her when she was younger, and stormed the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. She regained her senses thanks to an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and asked Eyir to judge her. Instead of punishing her, the &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; asked her to take on the burden of becoming God-Queen of the Tideskorn for her strength of will, as she proved to be the only vrykul to overcome the fel. Sigryn accepted.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the soul of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the late Warchief of the Horde, sought to find out who it was that had told him on his deathbed to name Sylvanas the new warchief. He had come to believe it was not the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; that did so, but in fact something darker and stronger. Vol'jin, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, and a Horde adventurer traveled to Stormheim to confront Eyir about it. Val'kyr guards initially held them off believing they were minions of Sylvanas, but even after the guards were slain Eyir sensed the presence of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, loa of death on Talanji and refused to allow her entry. She informed the group that Vol'jin's return was not her doing; Vol'jin had been \"touched by the hand of valor\" and become something beyond even her power to forge. She went on to say that whoever it was that had aided him was not the same person who had told him to make Sylvanas warchief. With that being all that she was willing to share, Eyir commanded them to leave and never return."}

See &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20Run%20%28quest%29%23Notes\"&gt;Bombing Run&lt;/a&gt; for help completing the quest.\nNotes.\nCompleting &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20Run%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Bombing Run&lt;/a&gt; will not give you credit. You must complete the daily &lt;a href=\"Bomb%20Them%20Again%21\"&gt;Bomb Them Again!&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you have not already unlocked the &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bomb%20Them%20Again%21\"&gt;Bomb Them Again!&lt;/a&gt;, you will need to complete part the following quest chain:\nFortunately you don't have to do the entire chain. You can avoid the level 70 five-man elite mob fights and jump to step 8. Simply fly to &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; to accept &lt;a href=\"The%20Crystals\"&gt;The Crystals&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Chu%27a%27lor\"&gt;Chu'a'lor&lt;/a&gt;. Grind five &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Shard\"&gt;Apexis Shard&lt;/a&gt;s and hand them in. Then accept &lt;a href=\"An%20Apexis%20Relic\"&gt;An Apexis Relic&lt;/a&gt;, which requires at least one extra shard. Go to the nearest &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Relic\"&gt;Apexis Relic&lt;/a&gt; and play the game with at least six correct steps. Hand in the quest.\nIgnore the quest &lt;a href=\"Chu%27a%27lor\"&gt;Chu'a'lor&lt;/a&gt; offers you, and go directly to &lt;a href=\"Torkus\"&gt;Torkus&lt;/a&gt;, who is nearby. Accept &lt;a href=\"Our%20Boy%20Wants%20To%20Be%20A%20Skyguard%20Ranger\"&gt;Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger&lt;/a&gt;. You need another 10 shards for this. The quickest way is to take &lt;a href=\"The%20Relic%27s%20Emanation\"&gt;The Relic's Emanation&lt;/a&gt; and invest 1 (or more) shards in playing the game with eight correct steps. This will give you 15 &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Shard\"&gt;Apexis Shard&lt;/a&gt;s as a reward. Alternatively, you can grind for the shards. Once you have the ten shards, go to either forge and exchange them for an &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Flask%20of%20the%20Beast\"&gt;Unstable Flask of the Beast&lt;/a&gt;. Go back to &lt;a href=\"Torkus\"&gt;Torkus&lt;/a&gt; and hand it in.\nIgnore the quest &lt;a href=\"Torkus\"&gt;Torkus&lt;/a&gt; offers you, and go instead back to &lt;a href=\"Chu%27a%27lor\"&gt;Chu'a'lor&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyguard%20Outpost\"&gt;The Skyguard Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Take this quest and fly to the &lt;a href=\"Skyguard%20Outpost\"&gt;Skyguard Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Hand it in at &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Commander%20Keller\"&gt;Sky Commander Keller&lt;/a&gt; and go to &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Sergeant%20Vanderlip\"&gt;Sky Sergeant Vanderlip&lt;/a&gt; for the two bombing runs.\nAnd that's all there is to it.

{"id": "46967", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46967", "title": "Facing", "text": "Facing describes a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;'s orientation in relationship to another &lt;a href=\"unit\"&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt;, or simply a given direction. It is almost always phrased as a binary condition - a character is either facing the specified unit or direction, or it's \"facing away\", with 90\u00b0 to either side of the unit's exact front acting as the cutoff. Being front-facing is another way to say the unit is facing what was specified. Facing is variously used to determine whether one unit can attack another, the effectiveness of spells or abilities, and the applicability of defensive statistics.\nThe exact front of a player is the direction the player will go if they press their forward movement key (and no others). NPCs will almost always face exactly in the direction of their current target, especially when they are attacking it. Unit models are also crafted so that the eyes and head aim in the direction of the exact front of the unit most of the time, although occasionally this can be deceptive. Any two &lt;a href=\"unit\"&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt;s that are less than half a yard apart, measured from center to center, are always considered to be facing each other.\nNPC facing can typically change in any direction instantly, while player turning is limited by the speed of the mouse (or the key turn rate). Some channeled spells will automatically and instantly turn a player to exactly face the target, and may continue doing so as long as casting continues. &lt;a href=\"Shadowstep\"&gt;Shadowstep&lt;/a&gt; and other short-range teleport abilities may change the player's facing; these abilities also change a target's facing towards them due to the fact that they are now in a different spot. Teleports are essentially the only way to get behind a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; that is targeting the caster without incapacitating it somehow - the slight delay before it instantly turns to face the player's new location may be enough to take an action, though reflexes must be quick and lag must be low.\nPlayers can only &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; attacks when front-facing the attacker, while &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s can dodge but not parry or block attacks from behind. Therefore, attackers should always prefer attacking from behind, but this is particularly true of melee characters, who are vulnerable to parrying \"and\" can more quickly maneuver to different sides of a target. This also means that melee attackers selecting gear at high levels will want to focus on mitigating bosses' dodge chances with &lt;a href=\"expertise\"&gt;expertise&lt;/a&gt;, on the assumption they'll be able to attack from behind.\nMost &lt;a href=\"attack\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt;s and offensive &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s require that the &lt;a href=\"target\"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; be in front of the attacker to start and finish the attack or spell. If a player is not front-facing a target for an ability requiring it, \"Target needs to be in front of you\" will be displayed as a warning, and the attack or spell will not initiate. After initiating casting, characters \"may\" turn away from the target momentarily and turn back without ruining such a spell cast. Many &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; spells \"don't\" check facing, and may be used while looking or even running away from the target. This more often applies to &lt;a href=\"instant%20cast\"&gt;instant cast&lt;/a&gt; spells than those with a cast time. Nearly all spells targeted at friendly units, particularly , also do not require any facing, nor do most ground-targeted &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; spells, which can target an area behind the caster's back.\nSome abilities not only check the \"caster's\" orientation but also require a certain facing from the \"target\". For instance, &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambush\"&gt;Ambush&lt;/a&gt; can only be used from behind. Slightly less restrictive are abilities that have a greater effect from behind, such as &lt;a href=\"Paralysis\"&gt;Paralysis&lt;/a&gt;. On the flip side are the attacks that have full impact when the target is facing the user, usually involving an attack of some kind on the eyes: &lt;a href=\"Gouge\"&gt;Gouge&lt;/a&gt; can only target someone facing the user, and some boss abilties like &lt;a href=\"Eadric%20the%20Pure%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Eadric the Pure&lt;/a&gt;'s Radiance require players to turn away."}

{"id": "13032", "revid": "168424", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13032", "title": "Faction", "text": "A faction is a group of allies, either &lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; or ideological. Most in-game factions are described in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" lore, but some were specifically introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". The concept of a faction exists primarily in \"World of Warcraft\". The use of factions in other Warcraft games is more for general grouping purposes and not quantitatively tracked like \"World of Warcraft\".\nMost factions are tracked in \"World of Warcraft\" by the &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; that a &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; has with each faction. Some groups that are not tracked as factions appear in the &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; list.\nThe term faction is also used to refer specifically to the two playable factions in \"World of Warcraft\": the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Each playable &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; is specifically aligned with one faction or the other, and all player characters of that race automatically belong to that faction. &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; characters are the exception and must choose a faction to leave the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, at around level 10. Once chosen, a character's faction cannot be changed through in-game means. However, there is a paid &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Change\"&gt;Faction Change&lt;/a&gt; service available that can perform this function. For all races except pandaren, using this service requires also changing your character to a new race, one that is aligned with the character's new faction.\nA character's faction has numerous consequences. Characters can only talk, group, and create &lt;a href=\"guilds\"&gt;guilds&lt;/a&gt; with players from their own faction. Certain zones and cities in the world are also friendly to one faction while hostile to the other. The majority of the leveling experience will be determined by the character's faction, with different &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s and areas for each faction. Faction also determines a substantial amount of play: characters will fight the opposite faction in &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;; work to raise their reputation and earn the praise of the heroes of their faction; complete quests to aid their faction's efforts, and frequently fight against the other faction's NPCs; and generally spend the majority of their time in their faction's cities and surrounded by other members of their faction. Although many choose to play characters of each faction, some players develop a strong sense of &lt;a href=\"faction%20pride\"&gt;faction pride&lt;/a&gt;, often leading to varying degrees of sparring and rivalry between players who identify with each faction.\nAny organization or &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; not aligning to either playable faction are sometimes described as Neutral between the two."}

Most of the fighting would be in western Drustvar, and ultimately center around &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, with the Alliance fortifying the position against a Horde aerial bombardment and siege.\nConflict overview.\nThe assault on &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; was concurrent with other &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, in the wider context of the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Strategically, the darkened region of Drustvar was known to contribute a large amount of ore and manpower to the Kul Tiran and Alliance war effort, and had only recently recovered from a major internal &lt;a href=\"Drust%20incursion\"&gt;struggle&lt;/a&gt; against witchcraft. Despite this, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; judged the Horde's attack to be overextending its forces, despite its boldness.\nThe invasion was spearheaded by a Horde &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Kaldras%20Snape\"&gt;Kaldras Snape&lt;/a&gt;, which stationed itself not far from, and began a bombardment of, &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. Other Horde forces, including the &lt;a href=\"Honorbound\"&gt;Honorbound&lt;/a&gt;, targeted further parts of western Drustvar. To defend against this threat, the Alliance would dispatch a force of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-blessed troops known as the &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt;. Including many &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, the Purified also brought to the battle unique assets such as &lt;a href=\"warframe\"&gt;warframe&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Purified%20Battery\"&gt;Lightforged artillery&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs fighting erupted throughout the area, Horde forces closed off the roads leading to Arom's Stand, creating a stand-off surrounding the settlement. Purified forces established small outposts and camps in the field; in many of these they would open portals back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to keep a steady supply of reinforcements flowing in as the battle progressed.\nKey Alliance actions.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; marshaling grounds in southern &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Duchess%20Fallensong%20the%20Frigid\"&gt;Duchess Fallensong the Frigid&lt;/a&gt; personally attacked the Alliance defenders. Wielding powerful &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20abilities%23Frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; magic, she presented a serious threat to the defense of the area, and was selected for elimination by General &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the southern perimeter of &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; gathered a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Purified%20Battery\"&gt;heavy artillery&lt;/a&gt; brought by the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.

In response, &lt;a href=\"Grumbol%20Grimhammer\"&gt;Grumbol Grimhammer&lt;/a&gt; would dispatch Alliance agents to cleanse the farm and drive out the entire Horde presence, infected or otherwise.\nAt a small bridge just south of &lt;a href=\"Corlain\"&gt;Corlain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27aki%20the%20Headhunter\"&gt;Zul'aki the Headhunter&lt;/a&gt; led a small group of &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20troll\"&gt;Darkspear troll&lt;/a&gt; warriors in waylaying road traffic. Killing townspeople on the road and burning supply wagons, the trolls also battled &lt;a href=\"Purified%20Protector\"&gt;Purified Protector&lt;/a&gt;s who arrived the stop them. Zul'aki himself would ultimately be targeted for assassination by the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; on the orders of General &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Engineer%20Bolthold\"&gt;Engineer Bolthold&lt;/a&gt; along with several &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Lumberjack\"&gt;Goblin Lumberjack&lt;/a&gt;s land in the forests of Drustvar.

Sergeant Calvin sends an adventurer to deal with him.\nBoth the Alliance and Horde would push into &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Arom's Crossing&lt;/a&gt; in order to harvest the rich source of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; present there for the war effort. Even before this current invasion, the Horde had maintained an Azerite mining operation at the Crossing's west, which had been contested by the Alliance.\nThe final assault.\nAlliance.\nAfter dealing with the Horde presence on the ground, the defenders then turned their attention to the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; stationed in the skies above &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to bombarding the Alliance garrison, the airship also carried a large quantity of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;, with the Horde intending to unleash this weapon on the entire region. To counteract this, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; ordered a direct attack on the gunship itself, with Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; boarding the vessel from the air by &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; and overseen by &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce on board, the Alliance attackers detonated the arsenal of Plague bombs scattered throughout the ship, as well as eliminating the captain, &lt;a href=\"Kaldras%20Snape\"&gt;Kaldras Snape&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lifter%20Machock\"&gt;Lifter Machock&lt;/a&gt;. They then proceeded to escape the gunship by gryphon once again, as the explosions from the Plague bombs ripped the vessel's structure apart."}

Players encounter members of the opposite faction in PvP Arena-styled combat.\nMembers.\nMost of the champions have 2,400,000 health in the 25-man version; some have only 1,900,000. In the 10-man version most have 403,200 health and some have 322,600.\nHeroic Mode.\nOn the heroic version of Faction Champions, they have 2.6M or 3.2M health each. Every champion also hits for more damage, is untauntable, and has a PvP trinket at their disposal (with a cooldown of 5 minutes). Crowd control and being alert about being targeted is very crucial to survival.\nThe Opponents.\nThis encounter is much like an arena match vs. 10 (or 6 at 10-man) quasi-player NPCs. The opponents act very much like a good arena team, and some (but not all) PvP mechanics are applied to the NPCs. For example:\nStrategy.\nPrior to the encounter, everybody should switch to PvP mode. Everyone should plan on taking hits, so stamina/resilience gear helps. As always, it is a balancing act between how much pvp and pve gear you should use.\nAs with any arena match, picking a damage target and focusing it down is critical. While one target is picked to be killed, all other enemy combatants should be controlled by whatever mechanics are available, including CC and focused distractions (e.g., keeping a warrior on the rogue NPC to disarm, hamstring, intercept, stun etc.). The NPCs reset their aggro tables every 9 seconds. This frequently leads to the damage dealers ganging up on a single raid member; fortunately, healers do not get disproportionately frequently targeted. The NPCs are generally very difficult to tank.\nThe resulting very chaotic nature of this fight (especially early on when all 10 NPCs are alive), requires fast and smart decision by every single raid member. When one or more of the melee champions targets a soft target, that target needs to run, fear, snare, escape, anything to stay alive. To facilitate these maneuvers, it is best not to clump together. Every second that a champion is traveling to its target is a second that it is not doing damage.\nPvP trinkets are recommended in case you are targeted with blind or have to eat an entire fear. A few seconds of not dispelling/interrupting is all it takes to undo a minute's worth of dps. Tremor totem and fear ward are a must. Hunters should use frost trap to slow the NPCs. Hunter pets should attack the enemy pets - The NPC healers treat pets and summoned pets (Treants and the like) as players, so do not kill those. Merely keep attacking them and the healers will waste heals on them. If you are fortunate enough to have several NPC's pets to attack, the fight will be much easier.\nAnother aspect of this encounter at odds with an arena match is that all opponents and their classes are known ahead of time, so it is possible to create a variety of control macros that target specific roles by name. This is strongly recommended. It is often very difficult to pick a control target from within the crowd while at the same time healing or dealing damage, and evading. Every class with a control ability should be using it as often as possible, including healers. Because of diminishing returns, it's a good idea to regularly switch the control target.\nThe fight becomes exponentially easier as each champion is killed, so getting the first one down quickly greatly increases the odds of winning. All cooldowns, including Bloodlust/Heroism, should be used immediately. The priority of targets is dependent on raid makeup, but usually the most effective strategy is to kill the healers first. The healers and their abilities are:\nThe most effective healer is the restoration druid, mainly because most of his casts are instant and not interruptable. A common strategy is to put interrupters on the other healers and burn the druid down first. If there are competent warlocks dispellers in the raid which can keep the druid banished, and dispel the Hots on the kill target, you can something else first (usually the rogue or warrior). Remember that the banishes are subject to diminishing returns, so this approach should only be chosen if the other focus target dies before the druid becomes immune to banish.\nAfter the restoration druid is dead, one of the other healers is usually chosen next. The shaman uses a powerful earth shield which makes him slightly more dangerous than the priest; in addition, he casts Hex and powerful totems. Fortunately, he has no self-ressurrection.\nAfter all the healers are dead or locked down by rogues/warriors, the next highest priority should be the melee DPS. The rogue is the most dangerous followed by the warrior, the retribution paladin, and the death knight. \nOnce the first couple are dead the fight becomes several orders of magnitude simpler and boils down to a burn phase. Keep the DPS champions chasing and the raid healers alive. Players assigned to distraction on various enemies should continue distracting until their target is picked for the kill. Distraction players must watch their target's target and call out who they're pursuing.\nTwo of the most important abilities in this encounter are offensive dispelling and spell interrupts. All of the champions are susceptible to spell interrupts, and offensive dispel is critical to cut through the healers' effects. Another strong ability to remember is mass dispel, which can remove Divine Shields and Ice Blocks, both of which are used by enemy champions. &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; also help a lot. The death knight and rogue use disease and poison effects so &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Totem%20%28shaman%20ability%29\"&gt;Cleansing Totem&lt;/a&gt;s should be down.\nClass roles.\nIf a raid finds that they're having trouble surviving, it might be best to save all forms of crowd control for self defense. The first two minutes or so of the encounter are usually the most critical. Once the first healer is down (usually the Resto Druid) the fight becomes significantly easier.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

This service is being offered in response to player requests. This service has been designed carefully to avoid disruption of the current gameplay on the realm, so certain restrictions will apply. The current cost is $30 USD, \u20ac25 Euros, or \u00a320 GBP per character to switch. The change is permanent, however, after a cooldown period, you can purchase an additional change to go back to the player's original faction. This service is also available to &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt; branch characters.\nThe initial release was made available to US players on September 2, 2009, and to EU players on September 17, 2009.\nIf you completed &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Blink%20of%20an%20Eye\"&gt;In the Blink of an Eye&lt;/a&gt; on at least one character, you can skip to the beginning of \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\" on your new faction by talking to &lt;a href=\"Recruiter%20Lee\"&gt;Recruiter Lee&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Holgar%20Stormaxe\"&gt;Holgar Stormaxe&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaction and Reputations.\nWhen a character changes factions, their home city &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; level translates into the same level as the home city of their new opposite faction race. For example, a &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; turning into a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;Blood Elf&lt;/a&gt; would see his &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; reputation become his new &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; reputation.\nThen, reputation with the default counterpart of the new race converts into the counterpart of the original race. Using the previous example, since the default counterpart of Blood Elf is &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; and the default counterpart of Gnomes is &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;, the gnome's &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; reputation would become the new blood elf's &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; rep.\nReputations with the remaining home cities will then convert to their opposite-faction counterparts according to the default pairs.\nMounts.\nWhen a character changes factions, the mounts associated their original race automatically convert into those of their new opposite faction race. For example, a &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; turning into a &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf\"&gt;Night Elf&lt;/a&gt; would see his &lt;a href=\"Raptor\"&gt;Raptor&lt;/a&gt;s turn into &lt;a href=\"Nightsaber\"&gt;Nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThen, the mounts associated with the default counterpart of the new race convert into those of the counterpart of the original race. Using the previous example, since the default counterpart of Night Elves are &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; and the default counterpart of Trolls are &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, the troll's &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Horse\"&gt;Skeletal Horse&lt;/a&gt;s would become the new night elf's &lt;a href=\"Ram\"&gt;Ram&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe mounts associated with the remaining home cities will then convert to those of their opposite-faction counterparts according to the default pairs.\nOther Mounts.\nThe following mounts will always convert to a default opposite-faction counterpart.\nAchievements.\nFaction-specific achievements include several in the Player-vs-Player category (such as those to defeat the racial leaders and enemy players in their capital cities), and are included in certain world events like &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Fire%20Festival\"&gt;Midsummer Fire Festival&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of these achievements follow a 1-to-1 conversion to an opposite-faction equivalent.\nThe achievements relating to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, including becoming a champion for each home city, will not translate in a faction change.\nItems.\nSome items will automatically convert into the corresponding items of the opposite faction. These items include Insignias of the Alliance/Horde, and PvP weapons and armor such as the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Claymore\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Claymore&lt;/a&gt; (which will turn into the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;High Warlord's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, and vice versa).\nIf an item has an opposite-faction counterpart, that information will be displayed on those items' information page as displayed by the Armory.\nItems that do not have an opposite-faction equivalent, such as faction-specific quest starting items, will be turned in to &lt;a href=\"Solid%20Gold%20Coin\"&gt;Solid Gold Coin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNotes.\nAll achievements and quest lines related to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Vault\"&gt;Shadow Vault&lt;/a&gt; are reset after using the Faction Change service.\nAdditionally, due to the manner in which Argent Tournament character information is saved, reputations with Sunreavers and Silver Covenant are reset (0/3000 in Neutral) during a faction change and do not translate."}

Garithos informed Kael of a large &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army approaching the city. The Undead had split their forces, attacking the city from the mountains to the south whilst a second army got into position to the east. Garithos rallied his men to meet the Scourge to the south, whilst assigning Kael and his Blood Elves the humiliating task of repairing the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Observatory\"&gt;Arcane Observatories&lt;/a&gt; within the city, to spy upon the Undead movements to the east.\nThe Battle.\nKael began the repairs of the first &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Observatory\"&gt;Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, he fought his way through Dalaran where he had to defeat mutants, bandits, dark and renegade wizards, and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; spawn. Kael remembered that he had buried four treasures in that area, so he defeated some dark wizards and bandits and claimed his treasure. When he reached the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shipyard\"&gt;Goblin Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; for ships, however, he found that some ghouls had destroyed the shipyard but was aided in crossing &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt; outside Dalaran by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;, who, sensing kindred spirits, had been watching the Blood Elves' affairs. Finally Kael reached the island and secured a gold mine killing some crabs, then he vanquished a small Undead vanguard to the west of the island and some forest trolls to the north claiming a goblin shipyard and a goblin merchant. He repaired the Observatory of the island and sailed away to his next destination. He searched the rest of the hidden treasures, one was warded by ogres, and completed the repairs of the third Observatory that was warded by gnolls. In a lull in the fighting to the west, Garithos reappeared and warned Kael against consorting with the Naga, whom he considered \"inhuman\".\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nObservatory Repair.\n\"The Observatories in this area served Lordaeron well when they were in operation.

It is 5% if the Attack Rating is equal to the Defense Skill. If a player is &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;Dual Wielding&lt;/a&gt;, they inherit an additional 19% miss chance. This applies to mobs, as well. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezzar\"&gt;Prince Malchezzar&lt;/a&gt; crushes so often in Phase 2 because the additional miss chance pushes non-crushing attacks much further off of his attack table.\nThe Base Miss Rate for Yellow Attacks is at a maximum 5%, not including any debuffs. The Dual Wield Penalty does not affect the miss rate for yellow attacks.\nPlayer/Mob vs Player.\nWhen a player or mob attacks a player, the base miss rate is 5%.\nFor each point of the defender's defense skill over the attacker's attack rating, the base miss rate increases by 0.04%.\nFor each point of the attacker's attack rating over the defender's defense skill, the base miss rate decreases by 0.02%.\nPlayer vs Mob.\nIn PvE, a player's chance to miss is determined solely by the difference between the defending mob's Defense Skill and the player's Weapon Skill. There are actually two formulas to determine miss chance against a mob:\nIf the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is less than or equal to 10 then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is: \nIf the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is: \nThese data show that a level 80 character with maximum base Weapon Skill (400) will need a Hit Rating of 263 (8.00%) to theoretically never miss a Level 83 mob (or skull boss). It is possible to completely negate melee and ranged melee miss. (There used to be a hard floor of a 1% Miss chance on spells, but this was removed in 3.0).\n\"Level is not a factor except when attacking a mob level 9 or lower.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Miss chance against a low-level mob is a percentage of normal equal to the mob\u2019s level divided by 10.\"\nCalculating a mob's Defense Skill or Attack Rating\nThis is a rather simple formula. It is the Mob's level multiplied by 5.\nFor Skull Bosses, the formula is your level plus 3, multiplied by 5, with a minimum based on when the Boss was introduced (Bosses introduced in 1.x have a minimum level of 63, those introduced in 2.x have a minimum level of 73, and those introduced in 3.x have a minimum level of 83).\nOther ways to miss.\nA ranged attack can display a result of Miss if the target leaves range, breaks line of sight or uses &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; while it's in the air."}

The only official editor ever released was a &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Unit%20Editor\"&gt;unit editor&lt;/a&gt; that came with of the game.\nWarcraft II.\nThe Warcraft II Map Editor allows users to create their own scenarios by editing the map, &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II%20units\"&gt;units&lt;/a&gt;, and even sound effects. Custom scenarios are called PUDs, and can be exchanged from system to system.\nThe player is able to alter all unit stats, except for speed, including range. The mana stat is able to be increased from the default of 200 mana all the way up to a unit having 500 mana. \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II%20units%23Heroes\"&gt;Hero units&lt;/a&gt;\" count separately from their base unit of origin and can have entirely separate stats. The editor is able to place nearly all units in the game and put enemy-exclusive units under player control.\nRestrictions.\nAs map editors were still an early concept at this point, the editor in \"Warcraft II\" is not as advanced as its successors.\nMission objectives cannot be altered and all mission objectives are \"destroy all enemies\" to complete. Voices and graphics cannot be changed. The editor cannot change unit upgrades or what units are produced by buildings/spells. Similarly, spells cannot be re-arranged, for example, an &lt;a href=\"Ogre-Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Ogre Mage&lt;/a&gt; will always have the same three spells to learn and a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; can never cast bloodlust. Similarly, non-magical units cannot be given spells of any kind, even though they can be assigned the mana stat, this doesn't do anything because they learn no spells.\nDefenseless units like the &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Flying%20Machine%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Gnomish Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt; can be given damage stats, but they will still not be able to make usage of this stat due to their lack of the ability to attack.\nThough most units are able to be placed, there are a few campaign and summonable units that cannot be placed by the editor.\nWarcraft III.\nThe Warcraft III World Editor is a powerful tool that allows manipulating almost every aspect of the game. It can be used to edit existing maps or to create custom maps and campaigns.\nAn alternative to the official editor would be a third-party software such as &lt;a href=\"HiveWE\"&gt;HiveWE&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard uses a in-house editor called &lt;a href=\"Wowedit\"&gt;Wowedit&lt;/a&gt; for \"World of Warcraft\". Though inaccessible to the public, Blizzard has discussed it and shown screenshots of its user interface at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;."}

The effect is canceled after the user attacks or casts offensive spells.\nSource.\nThis item is created with &lt;a href=\"Gnome%20Engineering\"&gt;Gnome Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (260); taught by .\nNotes.\nNotes: As of &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.7%20%28Release%20Notes%29%23Items\"&gt;Patch 1.7&lt;/a&gt; multiple transformation aura effects no longer stack and the last one applied is the one that is shown.\nBackground.\nWhile the original designers of the gnomish shrink ray intended to use it to cut enemies down to size, the technology suggested another application: personal use. Gnomes are already small and naturally stealthy; they reasoned that if they could be made even smaller, they could get into places no one would ever expect. Naturally, the tinkers who originally came up with this concept were thieves.\nThe world enlarger is a compact chaos engine contained within a flat, disk-shaped slab of truesilver. In fact, it really doesn't look all that useful at all, until the user twists the top to one side and shrinks in size.\nTypically, a world enlarger is used to increase a user's stealth, or to allow entry into tiny gratings and passageways, that one couldn't otherwise squeeze into. It can also be useful for amusement purposes - there are few things funnier than a doll-sized gnome under the effects of &lt;a href=\"Noggenfogger%20Elixir\"&gt;Noggenfogger Elixir&lt;/a&gt;, a shrink ray, and a world enlarger all at the same time. Only gnomish technology could invent a device that affects the entire world!"}

They appear as a cylinder of colored light topped by a symbol that players will recognize from the &lt;a href=\"Target%20Marker\"&gt;Target Marker&lt;/a&gt; set. Unlike Target Markers, World Markers are not available to individual players. They are available during raids via the raid functions panel in the default UI. They are usable in a 5-man party (by any member) via add-on modules and through the &lt;a href=\"MACRO%20worldmarker\"&gt;/wm&lt;/a&gt; command added in patch 4.3.\nIn a raid, markers can only be placed by the raid leader or raid assistants. Players using the default raid interface must open up the pop-out raid settings panel and look for the flag icon. Clicking that button pops up a menu of symbols. Selecting a symbol activates a tiny AoE symbol on the player's cursor that enables him to target a section of floor and click to place the beacon.\nBeacons are usually used to designate places for specific groups or players to stand, or where to place a monster.\nNotes.\nUse of the world markers (through the default raid interface or add-ons) can sometimes trigger an add-on data tainting error dialog (and prevent the player from placing any beacons). It might be a flaw in Blizzard's data tainting system, or it could be bad behavior by widely-used add-ons. If codice_1 does not solve the problem, promote someone else in the raid to assistant and have them place the beacons."}

{"id": "46209", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46209", "title": "World PvP", "text": "World PvP refers to &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player\"&gt;Player vs. Player&lt;/a&gt; activities taking place in the wider game world, rather than in a &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt;. World PvP may refer to organised or spontaneous activities, but does not refer to &lt;a href=\"duel\"&gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;s. \nWorld PvP usually refers to spontaneous combat between two or more players, simply for the thrill of battle. However, certain zones feature specific objectives which encourage world PvP, either through their placement or through offering bonuses to players of the faction which currently controls those objectives, or even by directly rewarding PvP kills. Some zones even focus exclusively on world PvP, featuring powerful NPCs and capturable Towers and bases, and offering rewards similar to battlegrounds for defeating the enemy faction in battle.\nIn contrast to the ordered, structured experience of arena or battleground play, world PvP is unpredictable, unbalanced and usually unprovoked, and can offer some of the wildest and most unfair PvP to be found.\n&lt;a href=\"War%20Mode\"&gt;War Mode&lt;/a&gt; is an open-world PvP option.\nAlternate PvP item levels.\nAll PvP gear automatically scales up to a higher item level as soon as the player engages in PvP combat. This gives players in PvP gear and advantage in PvP combat including world PvP, above the stats available while tackling PvE content. Each piece of PvP gear has its alternate PvP item level displayed on its tooltip.\nCommentary.\nWorld PvP covers a wide range of potential activities, but primarily refers to spontaneous &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat between two or more players within the normal game world. World PvP is therefore far more common on &lt;a href=\"PvP%20server\"&gt;PvP server&lt;/a&gt;s, where all players are automatically enabled for PvP combat in most zones. The free occurrence of world PvP is the defining difference between PvP and &lt;a href=\"PvE%20server\"&gt;PvE server&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWorld PvP tends to be the most unbalanced of all PvP, and frequently features players of far larger numbers or higher level on one side than the other. Characters may be set upon by a group of opposing players, or levelling players may be ganked repeatedly by a max level player. Gearing differences also impact world PvP far more than other forms of PvP, as many players who find themselves being engaged in world PvP will be wearing PvE gear.\nAs such, world PvP is also to some the most natural and most enjoyable of all forms of PvP. In contrast to the structured encounters of other forms, world PvP is entirely unrestricted, unbalanced and often unplanned. It features some the of most spontaneous PvP in the game, with players finding themselves up against unknown opponents of unpredictable strength and numbers. World PvP lacks the objectives of battlegrounds and PvP zones, and lacks the balance and fine-tuning of Arena compositions. It is the most simple and unfair of all PvP, into which the player may be thrust without warning, at any time.\nWorld PvP is frequently non-consensual, with unwilling participants ganked by more combative players. A typical example of world PvP might see one player ambushing another as they go about other activities, such as questing or gathering resources. As such, the attacked party is frequently unprepared for combat, and may lack the gear, specialization, talents and glyphs, playing experience and/or simply the inclination to participate in PvP combat. Conversely, the attacker is usually a player who enjoys PvP combat, frequently engages in it, and likely has appropriate gear and customisations in place. Since initiating such combat is entirely optional, participation in world PvP tends to be skewed heavily toward PvP players, often those with substantial experience and powerful PvP gear.\nA large factor in the enjoyment of world PvP is the thrill of attacking an unprepared opponent, or of spotting a nearby player stalking you, and wondering if they are about to attack. Many players choose to play on PvP servers for precisely this reason: the ever-present threat of attack, the need for constant vigilance in case of ambush, and the potential for unplanned mayhem at any time. This can add a whole extra level to the game when exploring the world and engaging in mundane tasks such as farming dailies, bringing a genuine sense of danger and surprise to the otherwise fairly safe and predictable world zones.\nWorld PvP most often occurs either solo or in small pre-formed groups. Players may find themselves banding together with nearby allies, or suddenly assaulted by a passing player of the opposing faction, just when victory was within their grasp. Smaller instances of world PvP can spiral into wide-scale faction battles if friends and guild-mates are called upon to join the fray. However, the majority of spontaneous world PvP features only a few players.\nMotivations for world PvP vary. While all honorable kills reward players with &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt;, these rewards are generally minuscule in comparison to those readily obtainable through means such as &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. Within special world PvP-oriented zones (&lt;a href=\"%23Specific%20zones\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;), specific objectives are often the reason for engagement. However, outside of these situations, the most common motivation is simple enjoyment, at least from the perspective of the attacker.\nCivility.\nJust how far to take world PvP is an individual choice which must be made in each encounter. Some players will attack a target once, and if they defeat them, move on. However, the defeated player may well consider themselves entitled to a rematch, and seek out their attack to exact revenge (successfully or not). In other cases, a player may pursue a single target repeatedly, especially when there is a specific objective to be achieved, and especially if the attacked party has little or no chance of defending themselves. In these cases the attacker may follow their prey to the graveyard, and immediately attack them as soon as they respawn. Graveyard and &lt;a href=\"corpse%20camping\"&gt;corpse camping&lt;/a&gt; is generally frowned upon, but is still commonly observed. \nFor many, determining how keen the target is to engage in PvP is key to deciding how far to press the attack. Some players can enjoy engaging in tit-for-tat PvP encounters for protracted periods, while some opponents will seek to flee such encounters as soon as possible. Common courtesy dictates that if a player appears to genuinely wish not to engage in world PvP, the player should leave them alone. However, others may consider any PvP target fair game. Similarly, if the opponent simply stands and offers no opposition, some will take it as a sign of surrender, and leave without claiming a kill, while for others, this simply represents an easy victory. Each player must decide for themselves how far to take each encounter.\nAs an unbalanced and spontaneous form of PvP, world PvP also features the largest possibility for &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt; and harassment of players. This may be intended or unintended, or for some may simply be considered part of the experience. Solutions to graveyard camping and prolonged one-sided pursuit include waiting for the attacker to leave (or simply log an alt, or engage in another activity for a while), and contacting friends or guild-mates to even things up a bit. Players can also avoid world PvP by staying near guards where possible, not leaving their characters unattended in contested zones, or simply by choosing to play on a &lt;a href=\"PvE%20server\"&gt;PvE server&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that Blizzard makes a specific distinction between same-faction &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt; and disputes involving members of the opposite faction on PvP realms, in order to prevent players who are simply enjoying the ruleset of PvP realms from being punished for doing so. In general, players on PvP realms should expect to experience far more direct and engaging interaction with players of the opposite faction, and GMs will not intervene in cross-faction player disputes on these realms, except in cases of extreme or excessive harassment.\nHowever, world PvP need not be an exercise in conflict and aggravation. Some opponents in world PvP will part amicably, with a /wave or /salute, and some friendships have even started through a little mutual ganking. Since direct communication is prohibited cross-faction, players may use opposite-faction alts to later communicate with their sparring partners, although disgruntled players may sometimes use such means to verbally abuse their attackers.\nWorld PvP is most productive when both parties are enjoying the encounter. As such, revenge through inviting allies to join the battle is a solution commonly offered by Blizzard representatives to the problem of uninvited world PvP.\nRoleplay.\nSometimes &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"guilds\"&gt;guilds&lt;/a&gt; may schedule events as part of a &lt;a href=\"roleplay\"&gt;roleplay&lt;/a&gt; event or a friendly PvP match. These events are typically seen only on &lt;a href=\"RP-PvP\"&gt;RP-PvP&lt;/a&gt; servers where such roleplaying events may lead to war or a skirmish between guilds, resulting in an attack on an opposing town or stronghold. Then, &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; groups on both sides may take part in the battle to defend against or overrun their opponent. Naturally, these sieges are organized by the &lt;a href=\"guild%20leader\"&gt;guild leader&lt;/a&gt;s and/or officers of both sides. This helps to prevent confusion and let both sides know that the battle will be &lt;a href=\"In%20Character\"&gt;In Character&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe battle usually ends when one side refuses to &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt; or retreats from the area under siege. Generally, roleplay etiquette has the attacking force withdraw with their victory and leave the vanquished defenders to resurrect and carry on with business or launch a counterattack.\nSpecific zones.\nCertain world &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s feature special objectives which encourage combat between players, or even provide specific incentives for engaging in world PvP. PvP activities in these zones may be part of dailies and reward structures, or may offer special bonuses to all players of the faction which controls certain objectives. In some cases these zones bring max-level players close to a levelling area feature lower-level characters, while others are specifically designed as a boost for levelling characters passing through the zone, and have no benefits beyond that area.\nWhile these zones add structure to the generally free-form pursuit of world PvP, participation is still characteristically unbalanced, with players regularly joining and leaving the zone, and participating in objectives as they wish. Larger numbers of players of one faction can easily swing objectives to their favor, and players may return to participate when the population is more to their advantage. \n&lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt;s provide a cross between &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and world PvP-related zones. While similar to these zones' objectives, PvP zones feature specific time constraints, player number balances, level requirements and specific win conditions, and are participated in separately from the rest of the game world. See &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nAshran.\nComing in \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt; represents the most developed form of structured world PvP yet. A &lt;a href=\"cross-realm%20zone\"&gt;cross-realm zone&lt;/a&gt; with up to 100 players on each side, Ashran features a balance of PvP and PvE ranging from traditional world PvP-style skirmishes and huge central zergs to raid boss-style PvE encounters and mob farming similar to daily quests. A maximum level zone dedicated to PvP, the zone features far more extensive objectives and rewards than any other world PvP development to date, but retains the freedom, lack of time limit or ultimate win condition, and unending, unpredictable battle typical of world PvP.\nTimeless Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4.0\"&gt;Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; added another world PvP element on the newly-found &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;. There, if players use a &lt;a href=\"Censer%20of%20Eternal%20Agony\"&gt;Censer of Eternal Agony&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Fire-Watcher%27s%20Oath\"&gt;Fire-Watcher's Oath&lt;/a&gt;, players may turn themselves hostile to members of both factions. Should turned players land killing blows on unturned players, they will gain a &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Coin\"&gt;Bloody Coin&lt;/a&gt;, of which hundreds are required for rewards.\nKrasarang Wilds.\nWorld PvP extended its reach to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.1.0\"&gt;Patch 5.1: Landfall&lt;/a&gt;, as the main Alliance and Horde fleets landed on opposite ends of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. At either faction's newly-constructed base, players can capture a graveyard and a forward base location, granting the holding faction buffs while in the general vicinity. This is largely useful for the new daily quests added at the same time.\nHellfire Peninsula.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; quests for this are named &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Fortifications\"&gt;Hellfire Fortifications&lt;/a&gt;. The object of the quest is to gain control of three fortifications in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Overlook\"&gt;The Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Stadium\"&gt;The Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Hill\"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Upon gaining control off all 3 fortifications, the members of your &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; gain the &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Superiority\"&gt;Hellfire Superiority&lt;/a&gt; which boosts damage dealt in the zone by 5% and carries over into the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; instances. Each fortification takes 2 min 10 sec to capture once you wrest it from the opposing faction's control. Also, upon turning in the quest, you are rewarded with 3 &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Mark of Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; or 3 &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Thrallmar\"&gt;Mark of Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; as determined by your faction. These marks can later be turned in to the quartermasters in &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP rewards&lt;/a&gt;.\nZangarmarsh.\nThe world PvP content in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; is slightly different than those previously described in that there is no &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; associated with it. The object is for your &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; to gain control of both beacons at &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Spire%20Ruins\"&gt;Twin Spire Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. When both beacons are controlled by your faction, the tower in the center becomes available for capture as well. To capture the tower, a player must go to their faction's local city (&lt;a href=\"Zabra%27jin\"&gt;Zabra'jin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt;) and obtain a flag from an officer there. If the player successfully runs that flag to the tower, the tower is captured and the &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the zone becomes available for use by that &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the members of the controlling &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; also gain the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Spire%20Blessing\"&gt;Twin Spire Blessing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; which increases damage output by 5% and carries over into the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; instances. In addition, each &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; kill awards a player with 1 &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Thrallmar\"&gt;Mark of Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; or 1 &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Mark of Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; which can be collected and turned in for &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP rewards&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerokkar Forest.\nWorld PvP content in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; includes the quest &lt;a href=\"Spirits%20of%20Auchindoun\"&gt;Spirits of Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;. The objective is to gain simultaneous control of the five towers stationed around &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;. When your &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; gains control of these towers, the &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Auchindoun\"&gt;Blessing of Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; is gained that increases damage output by 5%, experience gain by 5% and the ability to collect &lt;a href=\"spirit%20shard\"&gt;spirit shard&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; instances for six hours. &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20shard\"&gt;Spirit shard&lt;/a&gt;s can be collected and turned in for &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP rewards&lt;/a&gt;.\nNagrand.\nWorld PvP content in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; has the Alliance quest called &lt;a href=\"In%20Defense%20of%20Halaa\"&gt;In Defense of Halaa&lt;/a&gt; (obtainable from Talaar) and Horde Quest quest called &lt;a href=\"Enemies%2C%20Old%20and%20New\"&gt;Enemies, Old and New&lt;/a&gt; (obtainable from Garadar) associated with it. The objective is to siege, capture and hold a single plateau named &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt;. There are 15 NPC guards based in &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; that must be killed before the city becomes available for capture. The guards have one million hit points each and although they can be brought down through traditional combat, it's far more effective to bomb them from the air. There are four \"roosts\" surrounding the plateau from which a bombing run may be launched. Launching from a roost gives the player 10 bombs that can be fired for an areal damage at the NPC guards. Once the guards are removed, capture of &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; merely requires occupying the area near the central flag for some time as a traditional capture progress bar slowly fills towards your &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;'s side. Capture of the city awards your faction with the &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Strength%20of%20the%20Halaani\"&gt;Strength of the Halaani&lt;/a&gt; which gives a 5% damage output boost. During the capture of the city, each &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; kill awards a &lt;a href=\"Halaa%20Battle%20Token\"&gt;Halaa Battle Token&lt;/a&gt; which can be collected and turned in for &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP rewards&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, there are vendors in &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; that can only be accessed while your &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; has control of the city.\nSilithus.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; quests for this are named &lt;a href=\"Scouring%20the%20Desert\"&gt;Scouring the Desert&lt;/a&gt;. The object of the quest is to collect &lt;a href=\"Silithyst\"&gt;Silithyst&lt;/a&gt; from the geysers around the zone and deliver them to your respective base. Upon picking up the Silithyst you are flagged for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat and receive a &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; that slows down your run speed. The &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; drops once you turn in the Silithyst. You are also unable to carry Silithyst while mounted - the act of mounting will drop the Silithyst that you are carrying.\nRemoved.\nEastern Plaguelands.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolstering%20Our%20Defenses\"&gt;Bolstering Our Defenses&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; version of this quest while &lt;a href=\"Establishing%20New%20Outposts\"&gt;Establishing New Outposts&lt;/a&gt; is the corresponding &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; version. The point of the quest is to gain control of all 4 towers in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Guard%20Tower\"&gt;Crown Guard Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastwall%20Tower\"&gt;Eastwall Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northpass%20Tower\"&gt;Northpass Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood%20Tower\"&gt;Plaguewood Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Upon gaining control of all 4 towers, the members of your &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; gain a &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; that boosts spell and melee damage against &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures in the zone, including &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. A Game of Towers was removed with the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, as Eastern Plaguelands was completely revamped."}

After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; was created by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to seal the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Through it, they blessed the night elves with many gifts such as immortality. &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and his closest followers would later secretly cut six branches from Nordrassil to grow five &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s and the greatest branch to grow the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt;, but they were forced to fell it when the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; tried to corrupt it, renaming it &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil\"&gt;Vordrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Nordrassil burned during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; led by Fandral Staghelm grew a new world tree named &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Ancients\"&gt;Circle of Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, though it would not receive the blessing of the Aspects. The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; and the druids eventually managed to heal Nordrassil as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; now on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; is known to have existed since before the Sundering, and an &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Emerald%20Nightmare%29\"&gt;unnamed world tree&lt;/a&gt; exists in the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; as well, though their origins are unknown.\nWorld Trees.\nNordrassil.\n&lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, which means \"Crown of the Heavens\", was the original World Tree planted on the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, grown from a seed of the Mother Tree &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;. Nordrassil's roots grow deep into the earth, spreading life-giving energy across the world. It was blessed by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to grant immortality to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and to allow their druids to enter the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The power was unleashed after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and Nordrassil was devastated by this event. By \"\", Nordrassil has regrown, but &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s lost blessing never returned.\nTeldrassil.\nLocated on an island of the same name, off the coast of &lt;a href=\"northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the giant tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 which means \"Crown of the Earth\" \u2014 was an unsuccessful attempt by Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and his compatriots to restore the night elves' immortality, lost with the near destruction of Nordrassil. Teldrassil was eventually blessed by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; years later, but not by Nozdormu. It was the youngest of the World Trees until it was &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;attacked and destroyed&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, which also apparently destroyed most of the night elf population.\nAndrassil / Vordrassil.\n&lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Crown of the Snow\", was a World Tree located in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; of southern &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. It was grown from a branch taken from Nordrassil by Fandral Staghelm and his druids in order to stop the spread of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend. Without the blessings of the &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; however, it was vulnerable to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;' corruption. The ancient druids were forced to fell the tree, which they renamed Vordrassil, the \"Broken Crown\". It has since become the site of the furbolg city of &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt;. The tree's roots had pierced the prison of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the corruption of the furbolg. Andrassil allowed the Old Gods access into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, from which they created the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the Emerald Dream, Andrassil still stands tall, even as the Emerald Nightmare corrupts the rest of the area.\nShaladrassil.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; is a World Tree situated in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. It has been corrupted by the Emerald Nightmare and also serves as a gateway into the Emerald Dream. After the War of the Ancients, many surviving &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s were rounded up. &lt;a href=\"Thaon%20Moonclaw\"&gt;Thaon Moonclaw&lt;/a&gt; argued to execute them all but was overruled, and they were placed in an eternal sleep deep beneath the roots of the tree. With the return of &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, the satyrs have broken free.\nUnnamed tree.\nThere is a world tree in the Emerald Dream's &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Emerald%20Nightmare%29\"&gt;counterpart&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; that has been taken by the Emerald Nightmare and is now home to &lt;a href=\"Il%27gynoth\"&gt;Il'gynoth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nA seed of the World Tree, formed by the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, was planted by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;. Crafted from the souls of deceased night elves who perished from the Burning of Teldrassil, it is currently guarded by the green dragonflight, but Merithra states the time will come when it must leave the cradle of the Dream, and take its place in the physical world.\nGreat Trees.\nIn an effort to stop the spread of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; throughout the world, Fandral Staghelm and his closest followers took six enchanted branches from Nordrassil and planted them in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s successfully scoured the saronite deposits from their respective regions and, heartened by their success, the druids planted the last and greatest bough in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where it grew with astonishing speed into the World Tree known as Andrassil."}

They are also known as world raid bosses, outdoor bosses, or outdoor raid bosses, and the phrase raid encounter may be used in place of \"raid boss\". These bosses were designed to be fought by one or more raid-sized groups of max-level characters, although lower level characters may be brought along.\nWorld bosses were phased out of Blizzard's design philosophy starting with \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\". \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" did introduce some small group mini-bosses, but nothing that required a serious raid. With the release of , world bosses returned in the form of new encounters on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. This page contains a short overview of all world bosses, both current and removed.\nHistory.\nOriginally, &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; were added early in WoW. They were two of WoW's greatest promotions of intraguild cooperation and interguild rivalry, as killing them required tracking their spawn, forming a raid, and beating the encounter and the opposing faction (and at times same faction griefers). Their loot was also among the best at the time of their popularity. \nShortly before the Ahn'Qiraj event, the four &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; were created, and added an entire new round of World Raid bosses. They were initially killed for having the best items for their slots, and later farmed for their nature resistant gear when it became apparent that some Temple of Ahn'Qiraj encounters required it. They were also involved in the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; green piece questline.\nAs time passed, and Naxxramas came out without accompanying world raid bosses, the popularity of the world raid bosses began to fade.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0\"&gt;patch 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt; began to terrorize Azeroth, in place of Lord Kazzak (and his Azeroth loot table). After the Burning Crusade came out, two new world raid bosses were introduced, Doom Lord Kazzak and Doomwalker (there were others initially shown in databases as ?? bosses, including a rare spawn from a quest in Blade's Edge in which you can spawn a raid boss who flies away, but is unaggro-able. But currently it is accepted that there are 2 BC world raid bosses). The popularity of the two was short-lived. After a couple months it became apparent that loot off of Karazhan was on par or better, while not having the additional faction vs. faction griefing factor. \nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%202.2\"&gt;patch 2.2&lt;/a&gt;, world bosses were often left untouched for long periods of time. There were occasional guilds that use them as either practice for raiding, or undergeared guilds trying to gear up. But with the announcement by &lt;a href=\"Community%20Manager\"&gt;Community Manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bornakk\"&gt;Bornakk&lt;/a&gt; that they did not plan to add additional world raid bosses, the days of a world raid boss came to an end.\nBlizzard did not add any world raid bosses for \"Wrath of the Lich King\". \"Cataclysm\" does contain some small group mini-bosses though. True world bosses were reintroduced with \"Mists of Pandaria\" and each of them using the new &lt;a href=\"personal%20loot\"&gt;personal loot&lt;/a&gt; system.\nWith \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\", there was only one world boss available per week with a &lt;a href=\"world%20quest\"&gt;world quest&lt;/a&gt;. This was carried over for the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20Point\"&gt;Invasion Point&lt;/a&gt; world bosses in &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3\"&gt;patch 7.3&lt;/a&gt; and for \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\".\nSince &lt;a href=\"WoW%27s%2013th%20Anniversary\"&gt;WoW's 13th Anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, the Classic world bosses return each year for the duration of the event, along with their original loot.\nList.\n&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne Broken Isles boss spawns per week with an associated &lt;a href=\"world%20quest\"&gt;world quest&lt;/a&gt;, defeating most of them is required for &lt;a href=\"Unleashed%20Monstrosities\"&gt;Unleashed Monstrosities&lt;/a&gt;. The more powerful &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; bosses each spawn with mutually-exclusive world quests that have a chance of happening each day. They are required for &lt;a href=\"Terrors%20of%20the%20Shore\"&gt;Terrors of the Shore&lt;/a&gt;."}

Its format is information-based and covers news and feature segments on a variety of World of Warcraft topics, including both game basics and end-game raiding, class features, and technical topics such as discussions about &lt;a href=\"mods\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;. Guests appear on the show occasionally to discuss their own areas of expertise. There are also recurring features, such as the Class Round tables and Mod of the Cast.\nThey maintain a website and forums (links below) and the show is distributed through iTunes and by RSS feed. The show has been featured on the front page of iTunes and is currently one of the most popular World of Warcraft podcasts, with six-figure downloads for individual episodes.\nWorld of Warcast, unlike many gaming podcasts, steers clear of explicit language and topics that would jeopardize a \"PG\" type rating.\nAbout the Hosts.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/%23%21/starmike\"&gt;Starman&lt;/a&gt; is the host of the show and has been since the first episode. He has an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; perspective; his main is a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; who is on the &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; server . He also has played on &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; servers, and for a year ran a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; on . He has experienced the game to the highest levels and has more of a raiding perspective. He is the editor of the podcast, drawing from a long background in radio.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/%23%21/Lindyen\"&gt;Lindyen&lt;/a&gt; In the early days of Warcast, Lindyen and Starman met each week to record the podcast at Starman's house. In those days Lindyen had a segment called the Mages Tower. Because both Lindyen and Starman played it was decided that the create a joint guild with the Taverncast podcast and World of Warcast called the Pod People that would also be on Whisperwind; however, since it was on the horde side everyone could start anew. Lindyen left the show after episode 10. Lindyen was also co-host of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//worldofpodcast.org/\"&gt;World of Podcast&lt;/a&gt; for a time. In episode 104 he returned to Warcast as a co-host.\nFormer Co-hosts.\nRenata is the more recent former co-host from December 2005 through August 2009, and was cohost for episodes 11 through 89. She had a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; perspective; her main was an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; who is a member of a &lt;a href=\"casual\"&gt;casual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; guild on . Renata also had a large number of &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s and brought this breadth of experience to the podcast. Her perspective was more from the viewpoint of a \"casual hardcore\" gamer -- one who plays a lot but does not do much raiding. Renata's real-life husband, Cryler, was a frequent guest on the podcast. She also produced a series of minicasts devoted to the various in-game holiday achievements. She left the podcast in late 2009 to concentrate on real-life projects. She continues to do WoW Podcast called &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.citizen-azeroth.com/\"&gt;Citizen Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; until April of 2011 &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.citizen-azeroth.com/%3Fp%3D171\"&gt;when she ended her podcast&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlachia became the official co-host of World of Warcast starting with episode 90 and ending in episode 104. She is the long time host of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowcast.weebly.com/\"&gt;WoWCast&lt;/a&gt;. A World of Warcraft podcast that focuses on the meta parts of Warcraft as well as Alchia's personal journey through the game. Alchia has spent most of her time in game focusing on the Alliance side playing on the &lt;a href=\"pvp\"&gt;pvp&lt;/a&gt; Server . While she has level many characters to max level she decided to focus on her &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; through wrath. She helped with the original launch of Blindpoint chat tool. Left the show after her interest in Warcraft waded and reviews of the podcast became increasing negative. Alchia still does a podcast called &lt;a href=\"http%3A//metatalks.blogspot.com/\"&gt;Metatalks&lt;/a&gt; \nHistory.\nWorld of Warcast first aired as a &lt;a href=\"podcasting\"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in July 2, 2005, with two hosts, Starman and Lindyen. They produced the first ten episodes together until October, 2005, when a dispute between the hosts temporarily closed the show.\nOn December 24, 2005, Starman resurrected World of Warcast with the former co-host, Renata. They produced their first show together starting with Episode 11 on January 5, 2006, and the podcast has continued without a break since.\nAs of episode 89 released on August 21, 2009 Renata announced that she would be leaving the show to to focus more on her businesses. Renata has said that she will still come back from time to time to do mini-casts. \nIn episode 104 brought the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//worldofwarcast.com/%3Fp%3D175\"&gt;Return of Lindyen&lt;/a&gt;. The change from Renata to Alachia has shaken of the format of the show which has resulted is negative feedback as well as poor reviews. Alachia stepped aside in the interest of the show. \nParticipation in the \"Second Skin\" project.\nOn March 15, 2007, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.pwdocs.com/secondskin/\"&gt;Pure West Documentaries&lt;/a&gt; filmed Starman and Renata's first in-person meeting at Starman's home in New Jersey. They also filmed the two hosts recording Episode 37 of World of Warcast, as well as some other segments for inclusion in their documentary about virtual worlds, \"Second Skin.\" Unfortunately, only about twenty seconds of filming actually made it to the screen."}

With a peak of 12 million monthly subscribers in October 2010, \"World of Warcraft\" remains among the most popular MMORPGs and holds the for the world's most popular subscription-based MMORPG. Though World of Warcraft had dropped to 7.4 million subscribers as of the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, when the \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion released a few weeks later it briefly jumped all the way back up to 10 million before settling back down to 7.1 million. In the final report in October 2015, there were 5.5 million subscribers. \nIn January 2014 it was announced that more than 100 million accounts and 500 million characters had been created over the game's lifetime, with players in 244 different countries.\nIn November 2015, Blizzard announced that they would no longer give regular updates of subscriber numbers, as they felt there were better performance metrics they could use. For a graphical representation of subscriber numbers up to November 2015, click &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mmo-champion.com/content/5225-WoW-Down-to-5-5-Million-Subscribers-Warcraft-Movie-Trailer-at-Blizzcon\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of Q2 2021, \"World of Warcraft\" is among the three largest franchises of Activision Blizzard, alongside \"Call of Duty\" and \"Candy Crush\".\nDevelopment.\nNomad.\nThe history of \"World of Warcraft\" has its origins in Project Nomad. Accounts differ as to the timing of this project, some stating that work began on it after the release of \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\", others that development on the game had begun prior to the \"crunch period\" of \"StarCrafts development, and as a result, developers were transferred to work on the RTS game. \"Nomad\" itself was to be a sci-fi squad-based shooter, some of its developers taking inspiration from ', others from \"\". Those in the former camp conceptualized a squad-based game where players would build up squads of soldiers, upgrade their abilities, find new guns, and go online to challenge other players' armies. Its gameplay would be similar to that of the \"X-COM\" games. Those in the latter camp wanted an adventure/RPG game.\nThe lack of direction didn't help and the game was scrapped in favor of \"World of Warcraft\". During development, Kevin Beardslee and Bill Petras wanted to make something else entirely different from what \"Nomad\" was, specifically a more accessible version of \"EverQuest\". \"Nomad\" was scrapped and development on \"World of Warcraft\" began two days later.\nPre-release.\nDevelopment of \"World of Warcraft\" was first announced in September 2001 at the ECTS tradeshow. There was little fanfare in the original announcement, and the original development team consisted of around fifty individuals. Inspiration was taken from other MMOs such as ' and ', using the lore and characters of \"Warcraft\" as the basis for the setting. It would be a risky venture, as the company had grown used to games passing the 1 million sales mark, whereas \"EverQuest\" had peaked at the 500,000 subscriber mark. While a subscription fee would help recoup costs, there was unease as to whether the game's reception would be as positive as Blizzard's previous games, and it was thought that the game would only appeal to pre-existing \"Warcraft\" fans. Furthermore, few members of Blizzard had experience in developing MMOs, and while they enjoyed playing them, there was fears that the game would be overshadowed by \"Star Wars Galaxies\" and \"EverQuest 2\". When the game was first announced, members of the press often asked Blizzard as such, seeing them as \"the RTS company.\" By 2002, the game's visual design was being worked on. There was initial pushback in Blizzard as to the Alliance/Horde faction divide, as some feared that some players wouldn't like it because they couldn't play with friends (if they chose different factions).\nDevelopment of \"World of Warcraft\" led to the solidification of the \"Warcraft style\" (of artwork), according to &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt;, though the first shift towards said style occurred in-between \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20I\"&gt;Warcraft I&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe game originally had a true to life day-night cycle, which dictated when events and spawns would happen. This idea was scrapped so that players wouldn't have to disrupt their real lives to do these time-specific activities.\nThe game had a significant \"crunch period\" of development.\nPost-release.\nThe game released in late 2004. Surpassing expectations, the game had reached 5 million subscribers by the end of 2005. Blizzard had to develop tech and customer support on the fly in order to keep up with the demand. Not only was it well received by the critics, but it also became the best selling PC Game of 2005 and 2006. It was recognized at the 2005 Spike TV Video Game Awards where it won \"Best PC Game\", \"Best Multiplayer Game\", \"Best RPG\", and \"Most Addictive Game\".\nIn 2007, Blizzard predicted that the game would last for five more years, which spurred them to develop \"Titan\" as their successive MMO.\nAs of 2014, Blizzard's intended development pattern is to keep content at a relatively steady pace\u2014still producing expansions, but with shorter gaps between content implementation. The game has been likened to a sandbox with content being added over time. Expansions are planned out in advance, with narrative threads in one expansion leading to events in the next.\nOn October 30, 2014, lead designer &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt; stated that \"World of Warcraft\" will still be around at its 20th anniversary, in 2024.\nAs of June 2016, the \"World of Warcraft\" team comprises around 235 people.\nSystem requirements.\n\"The system requirements for the game evolved a lot from its original version. Details of this evolution, and the current requirements, can be checked on &lt;a href=\"System%20requirements\"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nCreatures.\nWorld of Warcraft is inhabited by a large number of creatures. The following creatures were added in Vanilla \"World of Warcraft\" before the release of expansions:\nAnd many creatures are added in each World of Warcraft expansion:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nNotes.\nThe gameplay video displayed is the first, released on November 23, 2004. Other videos were also made before the European release."}

Its most active years were from 2004-2011.

Furthermore, it enables a &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt; for the deceased Highlord Mograine to whisper one of twelve sayings to the wielder:\nMograine's whispers may also be heard by directly entering the following code:\nHis whispers recount the tale of his war against the Scourge, his betrayal by his son and the Crusade, and his resurrection as a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. He describes how his son, Renault, is blind to the truth that the Scarlet Crusade has become a vehicle for the Burning Legion's vengeance against the Scourge through &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, he asks you to kill them all, but it's unknown whether he means the Scarlet Crusade, the Scourge, or both.\nThere is also a second voice in the background, which is that of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, but it is more difficult to discern what is being said. However, in the final clip both voices are united in saying \"Kill... them... all!\"\nThese whispers may also be heard if you stand near &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; in the Hall of Command before finishing the Death Knight starter quests.\nScarlet Monastery event.\nA scripted event can be triggered upon entering the Cathedral wing of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; with Corrupted Ashbringer equipped.\n&lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; welcomes the player as the crusaders bow before him or her. Unexpectedly, the spirit of his father, &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, appears in full &lt;a href=\"Dreadnaught%27s%20Battlegear\"&gt;Dreadnaught's Battlegear&lt;/a&gt;, and smites and kills the son for his betrayal and murder. The Highlord frees &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;High Inquisitor Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;' spirit from his undead form and disappears. Fairbanks proceeds to tell the story of Renault's betrayal and that the Corrupted Ashbringer is beyond redeeming. Luckily, Mograine has another son who resides in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and has the ability to forge a new Ashbringer. Fairbanks does not give any quests.\nIn \"\", the true tale of the sword is told, and it is revealed that the second son of Alexandros, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, comes into possession of the Corrupted Ashbringer after killing his father in Naxxramas, as part of a failed rescue mission carried out by a small party of &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; members. Spurred on by his father, speaking through the cursed blade, Darion enters the Scarlet Monastery and confronts his brother Renault, who lashes out and attempts to kill him. Before Renault is able to deal the final blow, the Corrupted Ashbringer acts on its own, emitting an aura of green flames which take on the form of Alexandros, garbed in Dreadnaught armor. Renault begs for forgiveness and is quickly decapitated by his father, who then says he is forgiven. The spirit of Alexandros then retreats back into the blade.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", Darion Mograine is revealed to have killed himself with the Corrupted Ashbringer in order to free his father's spirit, an act which leads to him becoming a death knight of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and Highlord of &lt;a href=\"Acherus\"&gt;Acherus&lt;/a&gt;. He carries the Corrupted Ashbringer, which can be heard whispering when players approach him.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King's&lt;/a&gt; command, Darion launches an attack against the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. In the battle that ensues, the Corrupted Ashbringer begins to act on its own and fight against Darion's control. When the death knights are forced to surrender, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; knowingly sent the death knights into a trap to draw him out. Shortly thereafter, the Lich King himself appears and easily defeats Darion, who in anger and desperation, throws the Ashbringer to Tirion. The blade is purified in his grasp and the Lich King is forced to retreat, leading to the founding of both the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;."}

It caused direct damage to the target and all nearby enemies, as well as applying a &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe notable aspect of the debuff was that it would spread to nearby allies. Due to its contagious effect, when it was taken out of Zul'Gurub and into the larger game world, it became the first virulent epidemic to affect entire &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;s. The resulting epidemic was named after this ability.\nEpidemic.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.7.0\"&gt;Patch 1.7.0&lt;/a&gt;, released 13 September 2005, saw the opening of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, the game's first 20-player raid dungeon where players faced off against an ancient &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s under the sway of the ancient Blood God, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; encounter, players were occasionally afflicted by Corrupted Blood, which would cause 263 to 337 damage every two seconds over four seconds (compared to the average health of 3000-4500 for a level 60 player at the time). The effect would also spread to other players who were simply standing in close proximity to an infected person. Originally, this malady was confined within the Zul'Gurub instance, but made its way into the outside world by way of &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;warlock minion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDue to its brief duration, players normally could not bring Corrupted Blood outside of Zul'Gurub. However, by spreading the debuff to a hunter or warlock pet and then dismissing it before it expired, the pet would retain the debuff at its remaining duration when re-summoned. Whether by accident or by malicious intent, when infected pets were re-summoned, the debuff immediately spread to nearby players and NPCs.\nWithin hours, Corrupted Blood had infected entire cities, most notably &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, which, at the time, acted as central hubs and featured the majority of player concentrations. Low-level players were killed in seconds from its damage. Higher-level players had enough health to survive an initial application, allowing the debuff to continuously spread and re-infect those who survived. Those who died and revived in populated areas often found themselves quickly re-infected. Corrupted Blood was also one of the only effects that could be contracted and spread by &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, causing them to unintentionally act as carriers and further amplifying the rate of infection. When spread, Corrupted Blood would always apply at its full duration, regardless of its remaining duration on the player who spread it. Confusion and panic initially took hold, as a large portion of the playerbase had not yet participated in or were familiar with the Hakkar encounter, and may have not realized they were spreading the contagion when attempting to flee while afflicted, while others played with the intent to spread the disease further. All of these factors allowed the normally brief debuff to spread and persist far beyond what was intended.\nInitial efforts were made by some to prevent further infection, primarily by fleeing from densely populated towns and capital cities to sparsely populated areas, or by logging out of the game for long periods of time. Some players flagged themselves for PvP, which would prevent non-flagged players from infecting them, though this was quickly countered by malicious players who started flagging themselves as well. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; responded with temporary countermeasures, including rolling restarts to realms and a voluntary quarantine for players.\nA permanent set of fixes were made in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.8.0\"&gt;patch 1.8.0&lt;/a&gt;, rendering pets ineligible for Corrupted Blood and restricting its effects to the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; instance. Following these changes, &lt;a href=\"patch%201.9.0\"&gt;patch 1.9.0&lt;/a&gt; redesigned the mechanic and removed its ability to spread.\nLegacy.\nDespite its crippling impact on realms and the playerbase, fan reaction to the epidemic was strangely positive. The event's popularity directly influenced Blizzard in designing the &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Infestation\"&gt;Zombie Infestation&lt;/a&gt; pre-release world event for \"\".\nIn late April 2009, Reuters published an article discussing the causes and effects of the Corrupted Blood outbreak, and its relation to the . University researchers studied the Corrupted Blood progression, and, through it, could more easily understand the spread of real-life diseases.\nAlthough mechanics similar to the original Corrupted Blood were later used for other encounters, the original fight disappeared when &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; (the pre-\" patch) removed the Zul'Gurub raid instance from the game.\n\" introduced the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;plague of corrupted blood&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;'s backstory as a possible nod to the incident, where a plague caused by Hakkar led to the deaths of thousands.\nThe incident is referenced in one of &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;' poke quotes in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\": \"\"Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of the work I did with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. But Hakkar the Soulflayer's Corrupted Blood? Now THAT was a plague!\"\"\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion \"\", Hakkar appears as with the ability to shuffle damaging, self-copying spells into both players' decks when he dies. In addition, his flavor text reads: \"ATTENTION: Do not enter any major city while infected with the Corrupted Blood!\" &lt;a href=\"Team%205\"&gt;Team 5&lt;/a&gt; tried a variety of different designs for Hakkar's ability and considered basing the card on some of the other abilities from the Zul'Gurub boss encounter. However, when they asked people what they thought of when they thought of Hakkar, the answer was always Corrupted Blood. In February 2019, a few months after the launch of \"Rastakhan's Rumble\", Blizzard released the \"Mark of Hakkar\" , which can spread from player to player as another nod to Corrupted Blood. Any time a player faces off against another player with the card back equipped, their opponent will also automatically unlock and equip it. The card back was initially given to 200 players globally. In less than 24 hours, it had spread to the majority of the playerbase.\nIn March 2020, \"PC Gamer\" published an interview in which the authors of a 2007 research paper on the Corrupted Blood incident discussed how the research from the incident was helping them understand the spread of the , specifically in terms of social behavior. One of the authors, Dr. Eric Lofgren, stated that one of the critiques the original study got was that &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt; (in the form of players intentionally infecting others) isn't analogous to any real-world behavior. However, Lofgren added that while people in real life might not intentionally get others sick, \"wilfully ignoring your potential to get people sick is pretty close to that. [...] Epidemics are a social problem... Minimizing the seriousness of something is sort of real-world griefing.\""}

{"id": "12917", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12917", "title": "Tailoring", "text": "Tailoring allows players to cut and weave various pieces of cloth into armor, bags, shirts, and other cloth items. Tailors play an especially important role in guilds because they can create bags for the entire guild, provided the guild members gather the proper ingredients. Tailors are responsible for creating cloth items for cloth-armor wearing classes: &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s. They occasionally make items for other classes, such as cloaks or spellthread for pants. They also make decorative shirts. Tailors are also able to make special cloth equipment which requires that the user have a high level tailoring skill in order to use the item as well as a special Tailoring Mount.\nFrom the official site.\n\"Tailors take simple cloth and weave wonders out of it; cloth armor and robes, shirts, bags and other creations are the purview of the tailor. The benefits are diverse - lightly armored classes can wear mystic robes, all types of heroes can benefit from a variety of bags, and everyone can appreciate the decorative shirts and outfits springing from the tailor's loom.\n\"Tailoring doesn't rely on a gathering profession - cloth is found in chests and on defeated foes, as well as purchased. As such, Tailoring is paired with a variety of professions, though Enchanting is common.\n\"Most Tailoring can be done anywhere, provided that you have the necessary materials.\"\nGetting started.\nThe first staple for tailors is &lt;a href=\"Linen%20Cloth\"&gt;Linen Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Wool%20Cloth\"&gt;Wool Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Cloth\"&gt;Silk Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mageweave%20Cloth\"&gt;Mageweave Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Runecloth\"&gt;Runecloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netherweave%20Cloth\"&gt;Netherweave Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostweave%20Cloth\"&gt;Frostweave Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Embersilk%20Cloth\"&gt;Embersilk Cloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Windwool%20Cloth\"&gt;Windwool Cloth&lt;/a&gt;. Humanoid monsters typically drop these items, although most &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; do as well, while demons drop &lt;a href=\"Felcloth\"&gt;Felcloth&lt;/a&gt; (used in high-level pre-BC patterns). Recipes usually require thread and occasionally colored dye, both of which are purchased from NPC trade merchants. Additionally, tailoring recipes sometimes call for leather, gems, potions, or other special ingredients created by other professions. Leather is gathered by &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;skinners&lt;/a&gt; and must be purchased from other players. Gems are found from monster drops, treasure chests, &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, prospecting ore, &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, and rogue pick pocketing. Potions will need to be purchased from an &lt;a href=\"Alchemist\"&gt;Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;.\nRequirements.\nTailors no longer require any special equipment or location to process their materials into finished products. As long as the tailor has all of the required materials for the creation of an item, it can be made anywhere in the world at any time. \nOnly creating &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Bag\"&gt;Glacial Bag&lt;/a&gt; has a 7 day cool-down.\nSuggested second profession.\nTailoring does not require a gathering skill to acquire materials, unlike &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; (which needs &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; (which needs &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;). This gives tailors a lot of freedom when selecting their second profession.\nTypes of crafted items.\nCloth armor.\nTailors can create many pieces of &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth armor&lt;/a&gt;, appropriate for &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s. Other caster classes, like Holy &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and Balance or Restoration &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, may sometimes opt to wear cloth gear due to the pieces' greater bonuses to caster related attributes - this is however not optimal due to &lt;a href=\"Plate%20Specialization%20%28paladin%29\"&gt;Plate Specialization (paladin)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Specialization%20%28druid%29\"&gt;Leather Specialization (druid)&lt;/a&gt; respectively. In addition to making stand-alone cloth armor pieces, tailors can also craft multi-item collections, sets of gear that share a name and visual design. Some of the collections give a set bonus.\nBags.\nThe most popular tailored item is bags, which can only be made by tailors and &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;leatherworkers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;engineers&lt;/a&gt; can also make engineering bags). Players without these skills can acquire bags from loot drops, quests, or from merchants, but tailors can sell bags in larger quantities and for lower cost. This provides an excellent opportunity to make money, especially from players looking for large 18- and 20-slot bags. Make sure to get the bag patterns as soon as they are available.\nTailors can also craft four types of specialty &lt;a href=\"Bag%23Craft_bags\"&gt;craft bags&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20Bag\"&gt;Enchanting Bag&lt;/a&gt;s for Enchanters, &lt;a href=\"Herb%20Bag\"&gt;Herb Bag&lt;/a&gt;s for Herbalists, and &lt;a href=\"Gem%20Bag\"&gt;Gem Bag&lt;/a&gt;s for Jewelcrafters. Such bags are larger than the generic non-specialty ones, but are only allowed to carry a certain type of item. If an item is collected that is of the correct type, it's automatically placed into the special bag.\nShirts.\nTailors can create a wide array of &lt;a href=\"shirt\"&gt;shirt&lt;/a&gt;s in different colors and styles. Although shirts have no stats and provide no gameplay benefits, they can sometimes show prominently on a character, depending on what equipment they are wearing. A shirt has the potential to make a character look much better. Tailors can sell shirts to players looking to improve their appearance.\nSpecial clothes.\nTailors can create special outfits, such as dresses and &lt;a href=\"tuxedo\"&gt;tuxedo&lt;/a&gt;s, that have no stats and are merely decorative. These can impress other people in town or be used for special occasions. These clothes are most of the time bought by people who are &lt;a href=\"roleplay\"&gt;roleplay&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nFaction recipes.\nSome recipes are only learnable after achieving a certain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; level with a particular faction. These are listed at the &lt;a href=\"Tailoring%20faction%20recipes\"&gt;faction recipes&lt;/a&gt; entry.\nSummary of skill levels and training requirements.\n\u2020 &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20Mastery\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; proficiency is only available after purchasing the &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nTailoring in The Burning Crusade.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; introduced &lt;a href=\"Netherweave%20Cloth\"&gt;Netherweave Cloth&lt;/a&gt; as the primary material for tailoring; as in Classic WoW, netherweave cloth drops primarily from humanoid monsters. For higher level patterns, tailors must craft &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Imbued%20Netherweave\"&gt;Bolts of Imbued Netherweave&lt;/a&gt; from normal cloth bolts and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Dust\"&gt;Arcane Dust&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Loom\"&gt;Mana Loom&lt;/a&gt;s were once required to craft these (requirement removed with &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;), and can still be found either in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. To advance beyond 300 tailoring players originally needed to head to the Hellfire Peninsula in Outland, but now can learn the skill from the trainer in any major city.\nSpecialization.\nTailors of level 60 or higher with a skill of 350 or greater can choose a Tailoring Specialization \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Mooncloth%20Tailoring\"&gt;Mooncloth Tailoring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadoweave%20Tailoring\"&gt;Shadoweave Tailoring&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Spellfire%20Tailoring\"&gt;Spellfire Tailoring&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 by completing a quest from one of the neutral specialists in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;. These specialists also sell patterns relating to their specialty. Specializing allows the tailor to make two pieces of &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Mooncloth\"&gt;Primal Mooncloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowcloth\"&gt;Shadowcloth&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Spellcloth\"&gt;Spellcloth&lt;/a&gt; (respectively) per cooldown instead of just one, and from a single set of mats.\nThe three types of specialty cloth in \"\" originally had an unshared 3 day 20 hour cooldown, so specializing was vital; with &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt; the cooldown was removed, but being able to make items with essentially half the mats is still a major advantage. More importantly, the specialty you choose in Outland carries over into Northrend where &lt;a href=\"Tailoring%23Specialization_2\"&gt;new cloths&lt;/a&gt; became available in the same specialties.\nEach cloth must also be crafted at a specific place.\nSpecialization provides access to recipes for highly desirable epic cloth gear. Each specialization is associated with one epic 3-piece gear set. The recipes and pieces for each set are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt; and are tailor-only. Furthermore, the set can only be worn as long as the tailor retains its particular specialization.\nThe boosts spirit and intellect; boosts hit and intellect; and boosts crit and intellect. Previously, the three sets boosted Healing Power, Shadow and Frost spell damage, and Fire and Arcane spell damage respectively. However, the WotLK expansion brought an end to school-specific spell damage buffs on gear, and ushered in the unification of healing power and spell damage into a single stat. The bonuses on these TBC sets were altered to reflect those changes while retaining the sets' benefits for particular specs.\nTo re-specialize, you may return to the cloth merchants in lower &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; to unlearn your old specialization. It will cost to unlearn the current specialization at level 70 and to learn a new specialization. At level 63, the cost to learn another specialization remains the same but the cost to unlearn is only , so it seems to scale with the character level. WARNING: Unlearning a particular specialization will disable your ability to use the items previously crafted under that school.\nNote that all tailors can make &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Mooncloth%20Bag\"&gt;Primal Mooncloth Bag&lt;/a&gt; (20 slot bag), &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Shadowbag\"&gt;Ebon Shadowbag&lt;/a&gt; (28 slot soul bag) and &lt;a href=\"Spellfire%20Bag\"&gt;Spellfire Bag&lt;/a&gt; (28 slot enchanting bag). The recipes are bind on pickup, but the bags are not.\nSpellthread.\nSpellthreads are tailor-crafted &lt;a href=\"augments\"&gt;augments&lt;/a&gt; that grant caster-class bonuses to leg armor. Applying a thread will overwrite another augment or enchant on the item. The recipes require gaining reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Scryer\"&gt;Scryer&lt;/a&gt; factions. As these two factions are at war, tailors who wish to learn all four recipes must grind to exalted with one faction, then drop it and grind to exalted with the other.\nNotable resistance sets.\nTBC tailors can create two epic resist sets that are useful for level 70 raid encounters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Soulcloth%20Embrace\"&gt;Soulcloth Embrace&lt;/a&gt; 3-piece set provides a total of +110 Arcane Resistance and is useful for players attempting &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Soulguard 4-piece set (plus cloak) provides +260 Shadow Resist and is required for attempting &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shahraz\"&gt;Mother Shahraz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nTailoring in Wrath of the Lich King.\nTrainers may be found in the starting zone areas &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;). A trainer is also located in the &lt;a href=\"Magus%20Commerce%20Exchange\"&gt;Magus Commerce Exchange&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. At Tailoring 325, tailors may learn &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Cloth%20Scavenging\"&gt;Northern Cloth Scavenging&lt;/a&gt; from a Northrend trainer (this skill may also be taught from the book &lt;a href=\"A%20Guide%20to%20Northern%20Cloth%20Scavenging\"&gt;A Guide to Northern Cloth Scavenging&lt;/a&gt; which drops randomly in Northrend). This allows them to loot additional &lt;a href=\"Frostweave\"&gt;Frostweave&lt;/a&gt; cloth off humanoids in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. This works much like skinning: after other members of the party have looted their mobs, tailors will see newly lootable corpses that contain ~3-7 pieces of additional cloth. If there are multiple tailors in the group, they will all see the mob as lootable.\nSpecialization.\nThere are three types of rare specialty cloth that become available at Tailoring 415: &lt;a href=\"Ebonweave\"&gt;Ebonweave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonshroud\"&gt;Moonshroud&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spellweave\"&gt;Spellweave&lt;/a&gt;. These are used to craft high-end items, such as epic robes and 22-slot bags. Tailors that specialize in one type of cloth will receive 2 pieces every time they use their cooldown; however, this is tied to the \"Burning Crusade\" decision to specialize in &lt;a href=\"Shadowcloth\"&gt;Shadowcloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mooncloth\"&gt;Mooncloth&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Spellcloth\"&gt;Spellcloth&lt;/a&gt; and is not a separate choice. To respecialize, tailors must travel back to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; and speak to the cloth trainers there. You must first speak to your current specialty cloth trainer to unlearn your current specialization before you can learn a new specialty. At level 80, the cost to unlearn your old specialization is . You will be charged to learn your new specialization. You do not unlearn recipes specific to your old spec when you swap, nor do you have to relevel Tailoring.\nThe Tailoring 440+ epic crafted cloth pieces are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt;. They do not require a particular specialization or profession, and can be sold to and worn by non-tailors. (The TBC Tailoring 375 sets such as were formerly &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;, but have also been changed to Bind on Equip.) Prior to Patch 3.3.2, creating \"Wrath of the Lich King\" cloths gives tailors a 30-minute buff. These buffs have since been removed from the game.\nAs of Patch 4.0.1, tailors who have specialized in one of the three kinds of cloth will only generate one piece now instead of two in that specialization.\nRare bags.\nAs of patch 3.2.2, there is no equivalent Jewelcrafting bag. The largest tailored gem bag is the 24-slot &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Jewels\"&gt;Bag of Jewels&lt;/a&gt;, a TBC pattern available via &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; rep.\nNotable resistance sets.\nAt levels 420 and 425, tailors learn the recipes to craft the 3-piece Glacial Set. This cloth frost resist gear is useful when attempting &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; in both 10- and 25-man &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. However, few people choose to wear the chest piece as the DPS loss is too great. The mats are relatively easy to come by, so making the belt and boots for yourself and for friends by request provides nice skill-up points.\nEmbroidery.\nSpellthread.\nAs in \"Burning Crusade\", tailors may craft thread that adds stats to leg items. The rare versions provide buffs similar to the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryer\"&gt;Scryer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spellthread\"&gt;Spellthread&lt;/a&gt; recipes, but require Wrath-specific materials. The epic thread comes in two versions. &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Spellthread\"&gt;Master's Spellthread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctified%20Spellthread\"&gt;Sanctified Spellthread&lt;/a&gt; require modest mats and can only be applied to the tailor's gear. Their &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;BoE&lt;/a&gt; cousins, learned from faction reputation-dependent recipes, require much more expensive mats to craft.\nCloak embroidery.\nAt 420, tailors are able to craft embroidery threads that are BoP and can be applied only to the tailor's cloak. The three thread types are &lt;a href=\"Swordguard%20Embroidery\"&gt;Swordguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightweave%20Embroidery\"&gt;Lightweave&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darkglow%20Embroidery\"&gt;Darkglow Embroidery&lt;/a&gt;. These add melee, spell damage, or mana over time effects respectively and require a single piece of &lt;a href=\"Spellweave\"&gt;Spellweave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonshroud\"&gt;Moonshroud&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Ebonweave\"&gt;Ebonweave&lt;/a&gt; to craft. The tooltip for the embroidery states that these threads can be used only by tailors of at least 400 skill, but as of patch 3.0.3 the recipe cannot be learned until level 420.\nAchievement cloaks.\nUpon reaching 420, tailors unlock two cloak recipes that can be learned from the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; trainer once the proper &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s have been completed. (Note that this information appears in the trainer's gossip text window, rather than the normal training screen) To learn the &lt;a href=\"Deathchill%20Cloak\"&gt;Deathchill Cloak&lt;/a&gt;, players must complete the &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20of%20Northrend\"&gt;Loremaster of Northrend&lt;/a&gt; achievement, which requires you to complete the majority of quests in every Northrend zone. The &lt;a href=\"Wispcloak\"&gt;Wispcloak&lt;/a&gt; requires the achievement &lt;a href=\"Northrend%20Dungeonmaster\"&gt;Northrend Dungeonmaster&lt;/a&gt;, which requires you to complete every 5-man dungeon in Northrend. Both cloaks are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt; and can be sold.\nMounts.\nTailors with a skill of 310 and higher can craft flying carpet mounts for themselves. Riders appear to \"surf\" on the carpet as it moves along.\nTailoring in Cataclysm.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion introduced &lt;a href=\"Embersilk%20Cloth\"&gt;Embersilk Cloth&lt;/a&gt; as the primary material for tailoring; as in Classic WoW, this cloth drops primarily from humanoid monsters. Five pieces of cloth yield one &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Embersilk%20Cloth\"&gt;Bolt of Embersilk Cloth&lt;/a&gt;. For higher level patterns, tailors must craft &lt;a href=\"Dreamcloth\"&gt;Dreamcloth&lt;/a&gt;, this is made from 8x &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Embersilk%20Cloth\"&gt;Bolt of Embersilk Cloth&lt;/a&gt; and 30x &lt;a href=\"Volatile%20Water\"&gt;Volatile Water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Volatile%20Earth\"&gt;Volatile Earth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Volatile%20Life\"&gt;Volatile Life&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Volatile%20Fire\"&gt;Volatile Fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Volatile%20Air\"&gt;Volatile Air&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Orb\"&gt;Chaos Orb&lt;/a&gt;.\nTailors with 400 skill or higher receive additional cloth drops 50% of the time from anything that drops cloth.\nEmbroidery.\nPants.\nAt 475, tailors are able to craft spellthreads that are BoP and can be applied only to the tailor's pants. The two thread types are Rank 2 versions: &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Spellthread%20%28Rank%202%29\"&gt;Master's Spellthread (Rank 2)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctified%20Spellthread%20%28Rank%202%29\"&gt;Sanctified Spellthread (Rank 2)&lt;/a&gt;. Both can be made with just 3x &lt;a href=\"Eternium%20Thread\"&gt;Eternium Thread&lt;/a&gt;.\nCloak.\nAt 500, tailors are able to craft embroidery threads that are BoP and can be applied only to the tailor's cloak. The three thread types are Rank 2 of Swordguard, Lightweave, and Darkglow Embroidery. These add melee, spell damage, or mana over time effects respectively and require a 3x&lt;a href=\"Eternium%20Thread\"&gt;Eternium Thread&lt;/a&gt; and 3x&lt;a href=\"Volatile%20Fire\"&gt;Volatile Fire&lt;/a&gt; for Swordguard, 3x&lt;a href=\"Volatile%20Life\"&gt;Volatile Life&lt;/a&gt; for Lightweave, or 3x&lt;a href=\"Volatile%20Water\"&gt;Volatile Water&lt;/a&gt; for Darkglow to craft.\nTailoring in Mists of Pandaria.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion introduced &lt;a href=\"Windwool%20Cloth\"&gt;Windwool Cloth&lt;/a&gt; as the primary material for tailoring; as in Classic WoW, this cloth drops primarily from humanoid monsters. Five pieces of cloth yield one &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Windwool%20Cloth\"&gt;Bolt of Windwool Cloth&lt;/a&gt;. For higher level patterns, tailors must craft &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Silk\"&gt;Imperial Silk&lt;/a&gt;, which is found inside &lt;a href=\"Silkworm%20Cocoon\"&gt;Silkworm Cocoon&lt;/a&gt; crafted from 8x &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Windwool%20Cloth\"&gt;Bolt of Windwool Cloth&lt;/a&gt;; the cooldown can be bypassed by using 5x &lt;a href=\"Windwool%20Cloth\"&gt;Windwool Cloth&lt;/a&gt; and 3x &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Harmony\"&gt;Spirit of Harmony&lt;/a&gt;. One of the biggest differences compared to previous expansions is that no thread is required for regular patterns.\nEmbroidery.\nPants.\nAt 550, tailors are able to apply spellthread to the tailor's pants. The two thread types are Rank 3 version: &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Spellthread%20%28Rank%203%29\"&gt;Master's Spellthread (Rank 3)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctified%20Spellthread%20%28Rank%203%29\"&gt;Sanctified Spellthread (Rank 3)&lt;/a&gt;. Both can be made with just 3x &lt;a href=\"Eternium%20Thread\"&gt;Eternium Thread&lt;/a&gt;.\nCloak.\nAt 575, tailors are able to apply embroidery to the tailor's cloak. The three thread types are Rank 3 of &lt;a href=\"Swordguard%20Embroidery%20%28Rank%203%29\"&gt;Swordguard Embroidery (Rank 3)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightweave%20Embroidery%20%28Rank%203%29\"&gt;Lightweave Embroidery (Rank 3)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darkglow%20Embroidery%20%28Rank%203%29\"&gt;Darkglow Embroidery (Rank 3)&lt;/a&gt;. These add melee, spell damage, or mana over time effects respectively and require only 3x&lt;a href=\"Eternium%20Thread\"&gt;Eternium Thread&lt;/a&gt;."}

I have males of both the frost leopards and icepaw bears, but I need females!\nToo bad that my trapper was killed in a most unfortunate accident. Perhaps you would be willing to fill in for him?\nPut the leopards and bears to sleep with this blowgun then lift their tails and return with some females if you would be so kind.

The area between the altars of Har'koa and Quetz'lun has both bears and leopards.\nYou shoot the blowgun while not in combat. This immediately makes the animal , and after a short pause the animal will go to sleep. As one might guess, you have about even odds, with any bear or leopard you use the blowgun on, of getting a female, or an \"angry male\" who you then have to fight.\nAfter you identify a female, it will follow you around for a while. When you complete the objectives and return to &lt;a href=\"Zim%27Torga\"&gt;Zim'Torga&lt;/a&gt;, all the female leopards and bears following you will disappear (before you actually turn in the quest). If you have not actually filled the objectives when you return, the animals will continue to follow you."}

The victims must drink of the demon\u2019s blood. This act begins a transformation, taking anywhere from years to generations to millennia, that converts the creatures and their descendants into demons. Those who have begun but not completed this process are tainted creatures. Tainted creatures typically serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in one fashion or another. Tribes, nations, and species that accept a demon's pact become tools. Individuals worthy of personal recruitment often become the lieutenants to powerful demons, experience compensating for their innate inferiority. Tainted creatures have a demonic awareness of the physical world, giving it blindsight out to sixty feet. In addition, tainted creatures who have recently consumed the blood of a very strong demon gain the ability to cause fel damage: All of a tainted creature's attacks do fel damage, including attacks made with weapons.\nTainted is a template that can be used on many creatures. &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20orc\"&gt;Tainted orc&lt;/a&gt;s are the most famous example of them."}

At first, it was a success and the forest was restored, allowing the refugees to build &lt;a href=\"Surwich\"&gt;Surwich&lt;/a&gt; where the Tainted Scar was once present.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;residual demonic powers&lt;/a&gt; left on the land began to take their toll, and while Wormthorn's attention was drawn to fighting back the demonic taint, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who had formerly resided there took the opportunity to infiltrate Maldraz. Once inside, they corrupted Wormthorn's trance, making him lose his mind in the process, and used his body as a weapon to corrupt the great tree and the forest.\nAt some point, fel-corrupted &lt;a href=\"fungal%20giant\"&gt;fungal giant&lt;/a&gt;s started to appear from a small pool (beginning to form large mushrooms for unknown reasons), possibly due to the demonic energies left by the Tainted Scar.\nInterested in the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic artifacts once hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Sunveil%20Excursion\"&gt;Sunveil Excursion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rohan%20Sunveil\"&gt;Rohan Sunveil&lt;/a&gt;, led his subordinates of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; to practice an archaeological study in the Tainted Forest, where they focused their work in the acquisition, cataloging, and preservation of any and all magical artifacts. However, the unnatural forest threatened the Reliquary excursion's progress, as its trees' roots broke their picks, its moss grew over their excavation sites, and its animals attacked their men.\nIn order to halt the corruption, both the worgen of &lt;a href=\"Surwich\"&gt;Surwich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sunveil%20Excursion\"&gt;Sunveil Excursion&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to reduce the number of demons, and to kill the corrupted druid.\nYears later, when the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; began to claim the wood from the forest, but were eventually repelled along with the rest of their army by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, leaving their lumber camp abandoned."}

Following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, it became the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demonic&lt;/a&gt; domain of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; and his army until the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Tainted Scar has been greatly transformed by the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Forest\"&gt;Tainted Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOnce a part of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;, the area became a completely waterless and treeless wasteland, caused by the corrupting energies of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which transformed the region into barren soil the color of blood, teeming with strange and demonic beasts.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the colossal &lt;a href=\"Ered%27ruin\"&gt;Ered'ruin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; led many of the remaining Legion forces on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the Tainted Scar, which served as a demonic domain, similarly to the demons in the scorched and twisted &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. He subsequently ordered his most fearsome lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Razelikh%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Razelikh the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; to secure the land.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn the year 25 &lt;a href=\"ADP\"&gt;ADP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; and his forces were still located in the Tainted Scar. They &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;faced&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; sent to eliminate them.\nAt some point, an elderly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Daio%20the%20Decrepit\"&gt;Daio the Decrepit&lt;/a&gt; went into the Tainted Scar, and settled at its altar to perform rituals with the demons and train young recruits in the infernal arts.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; remained dormant for twenty years, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; found an unknown artifact of incredible power and used it to reopen it. Therefore, Lord Kazzak and a large part of his troops left the Tainted Scar to reach &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, where he was promoted as a \u201cDoom Lord\u201d for his success. In his stead he left his most powerful lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;, to take control of the Scar and to sow fear and confusion among the defenders.\nWhen the defenders of Azeroth pushed the demonic forces back through the Dark Portal to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, Kruul left the Tainted Scar leaderless and joined his forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; to fight them.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marl%20Wormthorn\"&gt;Marl Wormthorn&lt;/a&gt; and his people of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the Blasted Lands, he attempted to reclaim and bring back the Tainted Scar to its former, greener self, by creating the great tree &lt;a href=\"Maldraz\"&gt;Maldraz&lt;/a&gt; with his immense power. From underneath its trunk, he entered a druidic trance and began to bring life back to the area, allowing the &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s to build &lt;a href=\"Surwich\"&gt;Surwich&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;residual demonic powers&lt;/a&gt; left on the land began to take their toll, and while Wormthorn's attention was drawn to fighting back the demonic taint, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who had formerly resided there took the opportunity to infiltrate Maldraz. Once inside, they corrupted Wormthorn's trance and used his body as a weapon to corrupt the great tree, leading to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Forest\"&gt;Tainted Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterested in the demonic artifacts once hidden in the Tainted Scar, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Sunveil%20Excursion\"&gt;Sunveil Excursion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rohan%20Sunveil\"&gt;Rohan Sunveil&lt;/a&gt;, led his subordinates of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; to practice there an archaeological study.\nWhile most of the Scar has been taken over by the forest, a small part of the area still remains intact, mostly around the altar where Daio the Decrepit decided to stay. Occasionally the &lt;a href=\"Eredar%23Demonic%20eredar\"&gt;Man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Narixxus%20the%20Doombringer\"&gt;Narixxus the Doombringer&lt;/a&gt; will appear behind it.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; went to the Tainted Scar to meet &lt;a href=\"Daio%20the%20Decrepit\"&gt;Daio the Decrepit&lt;/a&gt;, in order to learn about &lt;a href=\"Arrexis\"&gt;Arrexis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebonchill\"&gt;Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;'s fate at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; mage-hunter &lt;a href=\"Balaadur\"&gt;Balaadur&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were discovered, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Banehollow\"&gt;Lord Banehollow&lt;/a&gt; disguised as &lt;a href=\"Madam%20Shadow\"&gt;Madam Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and set up a camp at the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; in order to harvest warlock souls. However, a warlock &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; exposed his true appearance and managed to stop his plans. Afterwards, Lord Banehollow retreated to the Tainted Scar where the adventurer defeated him with the help of &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Oman\"&gt;Initiate Oman&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Tainted Scar is covered with a thick, vile mist that chokes mortals stupid enough to venture close. &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s dwell here and pervert the already taxed land with their energies. Many people believe that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; resides in a tower hidden in the poisonous fog, but few have returned to give details."}

After approximately 5 minutes, Major Mills respawned and this author was able to start the quest. If Major Mills cannot be found, it's possible a previous player catastrophically failed moments ago; be patient, he'll show up where he should be."}

The robe\u2019s wearer, if an arcanist, gains several powers. Including armor bonuses and magic resistance. If an evil character dons a white robe, she immediately loses power. The reverse is true when a good character dons a black robe. If a good or evil character wears a gray robe, or a neutral character puts on a white or black robe, she loses some power. The loss of power lasts as long as the robes are worn and disappear when the robe is removed.\nNotes.\nSince it is &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt; and only wearable by Mages, there's little point in learning the pattern or crafting the robe unless the tailor is also a Mage.\nThe Robe of the Archmage granted a relatively large &lt;a href=\"Spell%20damage\"&gt;Spell damage&lt;/a&gt; bonus to casters playing prior to the release of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\". The mana clicky was extremely effective for mana conservation; using that, than a gem, could get the mage through several thousand mana before needing to use &lt;a href=\"Evocation\"&gt;Evocation&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Robe is not without it's downfall; it has relatively low stats compared to other similar-level Mage chestpieces such as the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Illusionist%27s%20Robe\"&gt;Zandalar Illusionist's Robe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Netherwind%20Robes\"&gt;Netherwind Robes&lt;/a&gt;. However, the five-minute ability to restore 375 to 625 mana effectively grants the robe an additional 25 to 41 &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt; as far as its effect on the wearer's max mana is concerned. This robe was easily the best until upgrading to &lt;a href=\"Enigma%20Robes\"&gt;Enigma Robes&lt;/a&gt; or another higher tier robe."}

Beginning with Lucasfilm's \"Red Tails\" in 2012, Kazinsky has portrayed supporting roles in feature length Hollywood productions, including \"Pacific Rim\" and \"Hot Pursuit\". He portrays &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20%28film%29\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" movie&lt;/a&gt;.\nKazinsky is a dedicated \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" player and was thus extremely enthusiastic about having a role in the film, especially as he considers Orgrim to be \"the best character in the lore\". His first \"World of Warcraft\" character was a &lt;a href=\"human%20%28playable%29\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; as he wanted to play \"the hero\", which he assumed would be the humans. He continued playing warrior all the way through vanilla and ', but when he joined a top raiding guild he had to reroll to a different server and faction. He has played &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; ever since. Since &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt; he's played a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. He mained &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Blood\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt; DPS up until &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;3.2&lt;/a&gt; but has played &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;3.3&lt;/a&gt;. Kazinsky was formerly a very competitive raider, but due to his career he no longer has as much time to spend on the game. As a result, he's been an \"&lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;LFR&lt;/a&gt; hero\" since halfway through '.\nHe is a longtime regular reader of &lt;a href=\"MMO-Champion\"&gt;MMO-Champion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;, and formerly Tankspot. &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; has always been one of his favorite areas in the game, while &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; is one of his favorite raids. He generally doesn't read &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; text. He cites his proudest moment in WoW as being when he finally assembled &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury%2C%20Blessed%20Blade%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt; after running &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; solo every week for two years."}
