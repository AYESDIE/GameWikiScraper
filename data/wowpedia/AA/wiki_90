{"id": "14694", "revid": "36744766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14694", "title": "Reputation", "text": "You can gain or lose favor, otherwise known as reputation, with many of the several different factions in Azeroth. Higher reputation gives access to special rewards or new quests to accomplish. You can increase reputations using several methods, including:\nReputation levels and points.\nReputation is very similar to experience. Reputation is divided into a number of different levels for which players must earn reputation points to progress through. Higher reputation levels generally require more points than the previous level to progress. The exception is , which spans a very large number of reputation points. Reputation points, just like experience points, are gained through quests and killing various mobs. Unlike experience, it is possible to lose reputation points with some factions, either by killing members of the faction or by assisting rival factions. For rival factions, gaining reputation with one will normally decrease reputation with the other, but at a greater rate. For instance, if you kill a Booty Bay Bruiser, you will gain 25 points of reputation with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, but lose 125 reputation with Booty Bay. Currently there are 4 of these rival-faction pairs: &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; (Draenei) vs. &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; (Blood Elves), &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; (Goblins) vs. &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; (pirates), &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; (rogues) vs. &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; (Thugs), and &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracles\"&gt;The Oracles&lt;/a&gt; (Gorlocs) vs. &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt; (Wolvar).\nVarious quests and faction-specific rewards are available across the levels, but the player must be able to interact with the faction NPCs to gain access to these rewards. An NPC's faction is shown under their name. This usually requires or better standing. \nHated.\nThe reputation level is the lowest reputation level possible, a level below . Any player who comes close to anyone of this &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; will be attacked on sight.\nPlayers start off at Hated with the &lt;a href=\"Brood%20of%20Nozdormu\"&gt;Brood of Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Therazane%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; factions, having 0/36000 reputation with these factions, the lowest reputation possible in the game.\nWhile not shown in the character window, the output of &lt;a href=\"API%20UnitReaction\"&gt;API UnitReaction&lt;/a&gt; suggests that &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players have a Hated reputation with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; factions and vice-versa.\nHostile.\nThe reputation level is just below and above . This level spans 3000 reputation points. NPCs belonging to factions with which a player is Hostile will themselves act hostile towards that player.\nUnfriendly.\nThe reputation level just below and above .\nUnfriendly &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s will not interact, talk, buy, sell or trade with you. When you click on unfriendly mobs or NPCs, their name and highlight will be . Unfriendly creatures will not generally attack unless attacked. Opening a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; or healing other players who are in combat may provoke nearby unfriendly NPCs to attack.\nThe core race &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, upon entering the city (&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;), will have all the NPCs show their displeasure and call for a rope, spit or throw rotten food at that player.\nNeutral.\nThe reputation level is just below and above .\nWhen you click on Neutral &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, their name and highlight will be . Neutral NPCs will not attack you unless attacked first. Reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; starts at Neutral, so most goblin NPCs encountered outside Horde territory are neutral to most newer players.\nFriendly.\nThe reputation level is just below and above .\nWhen you click on friendly &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, their name and highlight will be . You cannot attack creatures who you are friendly with (or have a higher level of reputation with) unless you specifically toggle \"At War\" on the item for said creatures' faction in the reputation pane. Being Friendly with a faction will grant you a 5% discount on items they sell. Certain factions in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; sell &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt;s for players who become friendly. These allow the player to gain reputation for that faction while running non-raid instances at level 80.\nHonored.\nThe reputation level is just below and above .\nWith this reputation level, you will get a 10% discount on items.\nRevered.\nThe reputation level is just below and above .\nWith this reputation level, you will get a 15% discount on items.\nExalted.\nThe reputation level is the highest reputation level possible, just above .\nWith this reputation level and additional restrictions (see &lt;a href=\"Mount%23Purchasing%20other%20mounts\"&gt;Purchasing other mounts&lt;/a&gt;), you can purchase and train to ride mounts of another &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;. It also gives a 20% discount on items. Certain factions sell &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt;s for players who become exalted.\nGaining reputation with a Faction City you are already exalted with will cause 25% of the reputation to \"bleed over\" to your next-highest city reputation. This does not happen when you gain reputation with all cities at once (ie, \"Horde +250\")- in this case, the reputation that would go to already-exalted cities is simply lost.\nIndividuals.\nIntroduced with , some &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s have their own reputation standing that uses a new set of reputation levels. Some NPC factions, such as &lt;a href=\"Wrathion%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, may use a different set of names but still work the same way. Unlike the standard reputation levels, the amount of reputation required for each level remains the same up to the last one.\nThe individuals reputation levels are as follows:\nParagon.\nParagon is an additional reputation level introduced in \"\". After reaching with an eligible faction, a bag icon will appear on the faction's reputation bar. Hovering over this icon displays an extra reputation bar that can be filled repeatedly.\nFilling the Paragon bar will trigger an &lt;a href=\"emissary%20system\"&gt;emissary quest&lt;/a&gt; which gives resources and rewards depending on the faction and expansion. Each cache has a chance to contain an exclusive &lt;a href=\"toy\"&gt;toy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; or even a &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;.\nRenown.\nBased on the &lt;a href=\"Renown%20%28Shadowlands%29\"&gt;Renown (Shadowlands)&lt;/a&gt; system, Renown used for the factions replaces the general reputation system with rewards that come with every Renown level, with each point needing 2,500. At \"Maximum Renown\", that cap is then increased to 7,500 which works just like the &lt;a href=\"%23Paragon\"&gt;Paragon system&lt;/a&gt; above.\nReputation sheet.\nYou can check your reputation with all factions by pressing the \"u\" hotkey or by going to the Character window (\"c\" hotkey) and clicking on the Reputation tab along the bottom. You can also enable or disable various options:\nGaining and losing reputation.\nCompleting non-repeatable &lt;a href=\"quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; will usually increase your reputation with the quest giver's faction(s) by a fixed number of points. Many of the factions also have special repeatable quests that give reputation when completed, or special mobs that give reputation when killed. If the faction has a &lt;a href=\"Championing\"&gt;Championing&lt;/a&gt; tabard (which will be available from the faction's &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster\"&gt;Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt;), you can gain reputation with that faction by wearing the tabard in dungeons. These dungeons must be either at your level or at the level indicated on the tabard to give reputation gains. Often the &lt;a href=\"Championing\"&gt;Championing&lt;/a&gt; tabard requires reputation with that faction to purchase. If that is the case, you will be able to get to with them by doing quests given by questgivers belonging to that faction (as indicated under the questgiver's name).\nReputation with certain factions can also be gained by turning in writs, which can be gotten as rewards from quests in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; or purchased with currency at the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrey mobs used to give 20% of the normal reputation until the release of Patch 3.0.8. Now any mob will give full reputation. See the &lt;a href=\"mob%20difficulty%20colors\"&gt;mob difficulty colors&lt;/a&gt; chart for when mobs transition from green to grey. \nAs noted above, killing certain mobs and doing certain quests will increase your reputation with one faction but decrease it with another. Currently there are 4 rival faction pairs, listed above.\nFor a few factions, there are limits on the methods to gain reputation. For instance, for &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, killing certain mobs in Zangarmarsh only gives reputation until reaching . At or higher, the mobs give no reputation and alternative methods must be used to gain further reputation. For best results when trying to reach Exalted with a faction, see the page of the relevant reputation before completing quests for them.\nReputation bonuses.\nVarious items, buffs and one &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;, provide bonuses to reputation gains.\nRacial Specific:\nHoliday Specific:\nGuild Rewards:\nZone Specific:\nAccount-wide buffs\nCrafted Items\nRemoved:\nGaining reputation with the Horde or Alliance factions.\nEvery playable race has a home faction, for example Darnassus for night elves, Orgrimmar for orcs, etc.\nGaining reputation with your home faction provides access to discounted prices at their vendors, and certain reputation &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s. However, gaining reputation with other factions may provide additional benefits, such as specific items, patterns, spells etc which can be purchased from vendors of that faction at certain reputation levels. In addition, if you want a mount of a faction that is not your own, you must be with them. For example, if you are a troll and you want to buy a wolf mount, you must be with Orgrimmar.\nMost quests for an Alliance or Horde faction will give full reputation gain for that faction, and one quarter of that reputation gain for the other factions on that side. For example, a quest completed for a Stormwind NPC will give 250 Stormwind reputation and 62.5 reputation for the other Alliance factions. This \"spillover\" reputation gain is capped at \"friendly\" (5999/6000);&lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1232869\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that is, if you complete a quest for one Alliance or Horde faction, you will gain spillover reputation for every other faction with which you are friendly or below, but this spillover reputuation gain will not give you the last point to tip any of those reputations over to \"exalted\".\nWhen you are friendly or better with any of your home factions, you can purchase a tabard from that faction's quartermaster. Wearing the tabard allows you to gain reputation by &lt;a href=\"championing\"&gt;championing&lt;/a&gt; in any dungeons which are near your level (the exception is Burning Crusade dungeons, where you will gain Burning Crusade reputations instead). \nAt level 77 and above, characters can also gain reputation with their faction's races by completing quests for the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Each Valiant quest rewards 250 reputation points for the appropriate race, and 62.5 for each of the other races in the faction. (e.g. Completing a daily quest as a Valiant of the Undercity gives 250 Undercity reputation, 62.5 Orgrimmar, 62.5 Thunder Bluff, etc.) In addition, the Champion daily quests can optionally award a &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Writ\"&gt;Champion's Writ&lt;/a&gt;, which can be exchanged for 250 reputation with any of the home cities. Similarly, at level 85, Writs of Commendation from the major city factions can be bought at the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy default you are the equivalent of with the opposite team (&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; if you are &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; if you are &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;). There is no way to increase or even view your reputation with factions of the opposite team (ex: You cannot increase your Undercity reputation while playing an Alliance character).\nList of factions and rewards.\nFor a list of recipes available grouped by tradeskill, see these pages:\nMost factions listed below have itemized lists of reputation rewards at their respective entries.\nIn Wrath of the Lich King.\nFor the most part, the reputations from Classic WoW and from Burning Crusade are not re-used in the Wrath of the Lich King. In the same way that &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth turned into &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in Outland, several old factions have new reputations. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; made its way to Northrend, but since it has allied with the Knights of the Silver Hand, they are called The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, for &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s, many old reputations received new attention. Nearly all factions have an achievement tied to them, and there are even additional achievements for pairs or groups of factions. For instance, acquiring with both &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; will get you the title of &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Guardian of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=\"Achievement\"&gt;Achievement&lt;/a&gt;s for more details.\nIn Cataclysm.\nSome of the reputations from Classic WoW have been redone. &lt;a href=\"Championing\"&gt;Championing&lt;/a&gt; tabards have been added for the main &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; factions, from Quartermasters available in the main cities. \nAdditionally, writs for reputation gain are accessible from the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Mists of Pandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Commendation\"&gt;Grand Commendation&lt;/a&gt;s are can be purchased for most Mists of Pandaria factions that provided a +100% reputation bonus once one character on that account had reached revered. \nIn Warlords of Draenor.\nBuilding a level 2 &lt;a href=\"Trading%20Post%20%28Garrison%29\"&gt;Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; will grant access to the access to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Defense\"&gt;Sha'tari Defense&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt; factions.\nA level 3 trading post Increases reputation gain in Draenor by 20%.\n&lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20the%20Legion\"&gt;Medallion of the Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which provide a reputation gain for all Draenor factions, can be found on some rare elite mobs in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"garrison%20missions\"&gt;garrison missions&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Legion.\nInsignia for reputation gain are accessible from the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20Missions\"&gt;Class Hall Missions&lt;/a&gt; while bonus reputation can be earned for most reputation to obtain additional rewards with the &lt;a href=\"emissary%20system\"&gt;emissary system&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Battle for Azeroth.\nBonus reputation can be earned for the reputations to obtain additional rewards with the &lt;a href=\"emissary%20system\"&gt;emissary system&lt;/a&gt;."}

Historians keep track of what Blizzard decides is &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;, they do not make the calls.\nSean closed his Twitter in late December 2014 after a period of inactivity.

It is home to a group of exceptionally stout &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, who have split from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nJust as &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies dominate &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; in modern day, so Dark Iron dwarves dominate this dark, mountainous area, alongside their &lt;a href=\"war%20golem\"&gt;war golem&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; masters.\nThe Searing Gorge was presumably once a verdant valley, but the landscape was obliterated in a massive explosion over 200 years ago. In the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Dark Iron dwarves, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, sought to summon a supernatural minion that would turn the tide of the war back to his favor. He and seven of his most trusted and powerful dwarves called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world. To their surprise, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare they could have imagined: The ancient Firelord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Firelord's awakening a new volcano, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, erupted out of the mountain ridge, forever blackening the surrounding lands and reducing the Dark Iron capital of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; to rubble. The steppes to the south came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and the ravaged valley to the north the Searing Gorge.\nUpon completion of their new &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Iron sought control of land for their filthy, industrious works. They looked directly to the gorge north of their mountain: The Bronzebeard clan's low military presence, scarce population, few settlements, and high vulnerability made the valley a clear choice. The Dark Iron army soon invaded the Searing Gorge, overrunning the Bronzebeard's garrisons and forcing them to retreat to Loch Modan and seal the &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Pass\"&gt;Stonewrought Pass&lt;/a&gt; behind them. The Dark Iron turned their focus to a very large scale digging operation at the bottom of the blackened valley. The giant excavation site came to be known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Cauldron\"&gt;the Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Cauldron is the &lt;a href=\"Slag%20Pit\"&gt;Slag Pit&lt;/a&gt;, an underground mining site rich with multiple &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s. The labor is mainly done by slaves, who are for the most part of captured enemies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Pass\"&gt;Stonewrought Pass&lt;/a&gt; remained locked down for many years, guarded by one &lt;a href=\"Mountaineer%20Pebblebitty\"&gt;Mountaineer Pebblebitty&lt;/a&gt; in recent days. The mountaineers turned away anyone seeking passage, so adventurers trying to enter the gorge could only come by way of either the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; trail south of &lt;a href=\"Kargath\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt;. Records show that one adventurer was indirectly rewarded a &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Key to Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Curator%20Thorius\"&gt;Curator Thorius&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge for killing a kodo named &lt;a href=\"Margol%20the%20Rager\"&gt;Margol the Rager&lt;/a&gt;, the bane of every archaeologist that ever set foot in the Searing Gorge.\nMore recently, the events of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; prompted the mountaineers to unlock the passage and begin allowing adventurers to travel at their own risk... Mountaineer Pebblebitty remains, still trying to turn adventurers away.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Searing Gorge was invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nDungeons and raids.\nThere are actually no instances in the Searing Gorge. However, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; lies between it and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. It is home to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; (level 52-60 dungeon), &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; (level 54-60 dungeon), &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; (level 60 raid), &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; (level 60 raid), &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Caverns\"&gt;Blackrock Caverns&lt;/a&gt; (level 80-83 dungeon), and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt; (level 85 raid).\nNotable characters.\nSearing Gorge is home to several characters of note. At Thorium Point, &lt;a href=\"Hansel%20Heavyhands\"&gt;Hansel Heavyhands&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in the battle against the golems, spiders, and incendosaurs of the region. &lt;a href=\"Master%20Smith%20Burninate\"&gt;Master Smith Burninate&lt;/a&gt; attempts to create fiery flux with the help of trustworthy individuals. And from his guarded spot nearby, &lt;a href=\"Velarok%20Windblade\"&gt;Velarok Windblade&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers into the holdings of the Dark Irons in an attempt to burn down all of their sentry towers.\nCataclysm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge%20storyline\"&gt;storyline&lt;/a&gt; covers the Dark Irons' involvement with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAreas affected:\nBefore \"Cataclysm\".\nPrior to \"\", the Alliance entrance to the Searing Gorge in Loch Modan was locked. Players had to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Key to Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; via a questline culminating in &lt;a href=\"At%20Last%21\"&gt;At Last!&lt;/a&gt;, although rogues with lockpicking of 225 could simply pick the doors, and players (especially Horde) could always enter through the Badlands. With the Cataclysm, the key and the quest to obtain it have been removed, and the entrance is now unlocked.\nThe zone was also changed from a level 43 - 52 zone to one suited to level 47 - 51 characters.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Searing Gorge might be a poor first sight for visitors to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. A shattered, desolate area, the Searing Gorge is the northern equivalent of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. The only road connecting Khaz Modan and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; passes through here, so those wishing to make the journey must trek across this barren landscape.\nNo government holds sway in the Searing Gorge and no settlements exist within its confines. The area has no resources, so no armies have bothered with it. Nevertheless, the land can be interesting for an explorer who leaves the road. Many beasts hide in the surrounding rocks and crags, waiting to ambush the unwary traveler. The weary traveler can instead ambush them.\nDesolate but not lifeless, the Searing Gorge hosts dangers and secrets aplenty.\nHistory.\n300 years ago when the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; summoned &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; it caused a volcanic explosion that devastated the surrounding land, including the Burning Steppes to the south. Since that time, the region has been the wasteland that it is today.\nNo people call the Searing Gorge home, though the land falls within Khaz Modan and therefore is under the purview of the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves have many other worries at the moment, so odds are the Searing Gorge will remain untamed for years to come, especially since there is little to no reason to reclaim it.\nA group of &lt;a href=\"Stonegullet\"&gt;Stonegullet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s barricades the road leading south to Blackrock Spire, demanding tribute from all wishing to pass \u2014 and the three &lt;a href=\"black%20drake\"&gt;black drake&lt;/a&gt;s with them ensure that all travelers pay the toll.\nGeography.\nThe Searing Gorge is barren and hot. The ground is scarred with fissures and dotted with broken rock, the weather hot and dry. It lies south of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, west of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, and immediately north of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Shattered crags and jagged chasms are the only features of note, and few landmarks exist off the road to guide a straying traveler. &lt;a href=\"Rock%20golem\"&gt;Rock golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; roam it.\nNo settlements stand here, and few important sites exist. The journey from Khaz Modan to Azeroth (and vice versa) is long and dangerous."}

However, any Rogue with lockpicking of at least 225 can pick the doors. An alternate path can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; just south of &lt;a href=\"Kargath\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt;.

A large population of Dark Iron dwarves, War &lt;a href=\"Golems\"&gt;Golems&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elementals\"&gt;Elementals&lt;/a&gt; resides in this dark, mountainous area.\nThe climate is very similar to Burning Steppes, as it was the same catastrophe that blackened both: the summoning of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. The Searing Gorge is a part of Khaz Modan. Before being shattered by the summoning it was a mountainous region, part of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarge &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; operations take place in &lt;a href=\"The%20Cauldron\"&gt;The Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, a giant excavation site forming a huge rift in the middle of the Searing Gorge. The &lt;a href=\"Slag%20Pit\"&gt;Slag Pit&lt;/a&gt; lies within &lt;a href=\"The%20Cauldron\"&gt;The Cauldron&lt;/a&gt; and is an underground mining site rich with multiple types of &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;. The mining work is mainly done by slave labor, which consists for the most part of captured enemies.\nEver since the Dark Iron dwarves' capital, &lt;a href=\"Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, was destroyed by the summoning of Ragnaros, they have searched for a landmass to control for their filthy, industrious works. The Searing Gorge was the obvious choice due to a low military presence, scarce population, few settlements, and high vulnerability. The dwarven garrisons were soon overrun by a massive Dark Iron invasion which forced them to retreat to Loch Modan and seal the passage.\nThis area was normally sealed, and adventurers could only enter by traversing through &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; or by obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Key to Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, which follows a series of quests. Recently, however, the Horde garrisons stationed at &lt;a href=\"Kargath\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, have grown curious about the use of the area for tactical purposes, and have cut a narrow pass through the mountains south of their encampment.\nRecently, the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; built a settlement in this area called &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Point\"&gt;Thorium Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nDungeons and raids.\nThere are none actually located in the Searing Gorge.

He was possessed even before birth by the spirit of the lord of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Under his influence, Medivh contacted the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and together they opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He was slain some time after by a party led by his best friend, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;.\nResurrected by his mother &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh returned as a mysterious prophet shortly before the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, manipulating events in order to arrange the formation of a last-ditch alliance between the mortal races of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, guiding them to victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, Medivh's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; remains within the haunted tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Fragments of his soul have been known to &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; or provide guidance to those who brave the tower's dangers. \nMedivh was the wielder of &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; after his mother passed it on to him. The staff is now wielded by his former apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedivh was the main antagonist in ' and returns as a redeemed supporting character in ' and \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". \nBiography.\nBirth and childhood.\nMedivh's mother, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, served as the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; before him. Eight centuries before the coming of the orcs, she fought and seemingly defeated &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. This was according to the demon lord's plan, as he used the opportunity to transfer his essence into her body, where he would lay in wait.\nSargeras, now within Aegwynn, was slowly twisting her thoughts. She became more distant from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;; rarely being seen by them. Sargeras amplified fears she had already had about the Council. The Council had been using its powers to manipulate the politics of the Eastern Kingdoms. They believed they had the power to prevent war suffering, for the greater good. Aegwynn believed the constant manipulations would end in disaster. She decided to not relinquish her role as Guardian, for fear that the Council could elect a new weaker Guardian they could control and manipulate. They did not completely approve of her decision to stay on as Guardian but they allowed it for the moment.\nHer relationship with the Council would become more distant over the centuries. Hidden from the Council's watchful eye, Aegwynn constructed the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. The tower acted as a siphon for ley lines Aegwynn could gain power from if needed. She would also use the Tower as a refuge when avoiding the Council of Tirisfal. As older members of the Council passed new younger ones would join. These new members wanted to force Aegwynn to give up her powers. They formed the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, an order of magi armed with ancient relics they could use to subdue Aegwynn. For years the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; had searched for Aegwynn till they found her refuge at Karazhan. She sealed Karazhan so the Council could never gain control of its secrets and fled to the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; where she would hide for hundreds of years; all the while keeping an eye on the Council of Tirisfal.\nAegwynn would on occasion leave Suramar to watch the Council. It was one of these times that she was finally caught by the Tirisgarde mage, &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt;. Aran would use various artifacts at his disposal to nullify her magic and slow her down. Over the course of several months, the two came at odds. However, the fighting would end when both realized each other's true nature. Aran learned that Aegwynn was not the traitorous rebel the Council made him think she was. And she learned that Aran also loathed political manipulations the Council had been carrying out.\nIt was not long before the two fell in love. They agreed they must work together to prevent the Council from controlling another Guardian. They decided to create an heir and pass on the title of Guardian to. She gave birth to a son she named Medivh. She locked her powers and knowledge of the Council within Medivh where they could manifest upon maturity. Aegwynn soon left Medivh in Aran's care. She went into hiding watching her beloved Medivh from afar.\nMedivh had a happy childhood under his father's care close to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom's&lt;/a&gt; royal court, primarily spent with friends Prince &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. One day, while out on the road in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh and his friends were ambushed by three &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s. None were hurt badly, however, Medivh fainted after casting several spells. He would succumb to a coma on the eve of his &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;fourteenth birthday&lt;/a&gt;, awaking in the middle of the night from evil dreams, where he pictured figures giving chase through deep chasms. In a sweat, he stumbled into his father's room, and when his father touched his brow, the power his mother had given him awoke. No less than one hundred &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s had to combine their talents with his father's to contain the powers. By the time the force had subsided, Aran was dead and Medivh nearly so himself. Spanning almost ten years in a coma caused by stress and Sargeras spirit inside his body, Medivh was tended by his friend Lothar, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;clerics&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedivh awoke a decade later under a facade of control and assured the clerics and the court that he was fine.\nThe Gurubashi War.\nYears after the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind's farmers and settlers would increasingly push southward claiming territory close to the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Skirmishes would erupt between the Gurubashi and Stormwind forces but the elderly &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen&lt;/a&gt; would refuse to order an invasion into Stranglethorn and was focused on fighting a defensive war, much to the outrage of his son Prince Llane. While King Barathen's strategy against the Gurubashi was effective it would be unable to stop every attack, one which saw slow, barbaric, and gruesome deaths delivered to the villagers of three towns in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. This would ultimately prove to be the final straw of Prince Llane, Anduin Lothar and Medivh, who in defiance of his father's continued de-escalation, journeyed south to bring war to the Gurubashi. Though initially shielded by Medivh's magic the three friends would end up in the fight for their lives when they battled &lt;a href=\"Jok%27non\"&gt;Jok'non&lt;/a&gt;, a Gurubashi Warlord empowered by &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the three friends would prove victorious and return to Stormwind, shaken by Medivh's powers.\nWhile none of the Gurubashi who witnessed Jok'non's death survived, it took very to the imagination for the trolls to see who was responsible. Rallying under Jok'non's son, &lt;a href=\"Zan%27non\"&gt;Zan'non&lt;/a&gt;, the Gurubashi launched &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;an invasion&lt;/a&gt; intent on destroying Stormwind. In the face of the troll onslaught, Barathen recalled all his forces to the stronghold's gate, believing that the survival of Stormwind would depend on one colossal battle. As the death toll mounted on both sides Barathen mounted a desperate counterattack against the Gurubashi. Though almost succeeding in claiming Zan'non's head, Barathen would die on the field of battle. Llane, driven by guilt, would plead with Medivh to unleash his power on the Gurubashi as he done against Jok'non. Though frightened of his power Medivh would accept Llane's request and destroy the Gurubashi forces (Zan'non included), an act that would ultimately avenge Barathen. After the conflict was over Medivh would be seen as the realm's greatest defender.\nFrightened by his powers Medivh would later journey to Karazhan and learn from his mother how to control his powers. He would gain a friend and ally in &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt;, who disapproving of Aegwynn's habit of shutting people out, would encourage Medivh to reach to invite local lords for a party after the young guardian spoke of his darkening thoughts.\nThe fallen Guardian.\nUnknown to Medivh and Moroes, his darkening thoughts belonged to the dark spirit of Sargeras who began twisting his thoughts and emotions towards an insidious end. In time Medivh would become determine to stop the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at all costs and under Sargeras' influence would discover &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing that the Horde had been abandoned by the Legion Medivh felt that it would be a perfect irony to use the Horde against the Legion. Thus bargaining with the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; from his chambers in the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh promised to provide Gul'dan the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; if Gul'dan would bring the Horde to Azeroth. And so, aided on the other side by Gul'dan's &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh opened the Dark Portal between Azeroth and Draenor.\nWhen the Dark Portal was opened by him, almost every creature attuned to magic on Azeroth felt ripples as the gateway flared to life. Aegwynn could not fathom what had happened, but she sensed the presence of fel magic and knew Medivh must have somehow allied himself with the Legion. Aegwynn traveled to Karazhan with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt; to confront Medivh about it. The tower was crowded with nobles who were expecting a gala, and so Aegwynn entered alone at first, hoping to convince Medivh to give up his power peacefully. It was then that Medivh revealed that, as he died in battle before her, Sargeras had spirited his essence into Aegwynn's own body like cancer, lying in wait for her to conceive as he knew she would. Sargeras later stitched himself into the fabric of Medivh's unborn body so that when he awoke and realized the power of Tirisfal he would also manifest his unholy, demonic heritage.\nAegwynn was stunned as the truth set in, but she did not lose herself to despair. Instead, Aegwynn became angry and knew she would defeat Sargeras there and then, even if it meant striking against her beloved son. The battle between the two shook the tower to its foundations and sent the would-be revelers fleeing. When Aegwynn was temporarily incapacitated, Arcanagos joined in. However, despite being a blue dragon, Arcanagos was severely outmatched. Sargeras struck him down, burning him from the inside out until all that was left was bone. Her friend's death sent Aegwynn further into rage. Sargeras may have had the full weight of a Guardian's power, but she had centuries of experience. As their duel continued, Aegwynn slowly gained the upper hand, until Medivh resorted to draining the life of nearby all occupants of the tower in order to fuel his strength. Now stronger but still unable to kill Aegwynn, Medivh instead banished her from his sight.\nTo prevent the Council of Tirisfal from meddling in his affairs, Medivh secretly began killing its members in demonic \"accidents\". These victims included &lt;a href=\"Hugarin\"&gt;Hugarin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huglar\"&gt;Huglar&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedivh's gaze also fell upon &lt;a href=\"Arrexis\"&gt;Arrexis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AEbonchill\"&gt;:Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt; who set up a &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Kirin%20Tor%20Camp\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Arrexis and his followers experimented with their warding magics outside Karazhan, attempting to neutralize the tower's strange powers. The records indicate that Guardian Medivh visited the magi at this time and offered his advice. He suggested that Arrexis could apply his warding spellwork in new ways, specifically to prevent demons from clawing into the world. Arrexis heeded Medivh's advice which would eventually be his downfall.\nAt some point, Medivh hosted some traveling &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s who attempted to cheat him by selling him counterfeit artifacts. Medivh cursed them and today they are known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was shortly after this time that the mages of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; sent Medivh an apprentice. The Magus had already rebuked dozens of failed apprentices, but something in this &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, a name which among the dwarves meant \"Trust\", caught his attention. Time passed as \"Young Trust\" studied under Medivh. He lived within Karazhan with a few others: Medivh studying, &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt; serving as his aide, and &lt;a href=\"Cook%20%28character%29\"&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt; making meals.\nAround this time, the war began picking up between the orcs and the humans, as the orcs increasingly struck out of &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Morass\"&gt;the Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh was sober about this, even remarking that it was happening as planned. Soon after the Horde's emissary, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, came to Karazhan. The Magus thought that with her conflicting heritages, she would understand what he was going through. Unbeknownst to anyone Medivh and Garona had a brief affair which later resulted in a child, the mixed race &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedivh and Khadgar soon crossed paths with the King's Champion &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers on a scouting mission to the Black Morass. Lothar had encouraged his friend to rejoin Stormwind's defense, though understood that Medivh struggled with the power he unleashed on the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; years ago. The Guardian played along and feigned a fear of tapping into unwieldy magical powers, though his true intention was to buy time for the Horde to boost its strength. Lothar also spoke with Khadgar, telling him about Medivh's troubled past and asking him to act as a caretaker in addition to an apprentice. Medivh became more erratic afterward, disappearing for days at a time and being exhausted when he finally returned.\nKhadgar would be the first to discover that it was Medivh who brought the orcs upon the lands of Azeroth. During this time, Khadgar and Garona had an audience with &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; and Anduin Lothar, where Lothar was convinced of Medivh's corruption. Lothar, one of Medivh's best friends, led a troop of human forces, which included Khadgar and Garona, to deal with the crazed Guardian. In the meantime, the Guardian killed Moroes and the Cook. During the battle with Medivh, Khadgar\u2014magically aged by Medivh's spellwork\u2014held Lothar's blade to the Guardian's chest, and finally ran it through Medivh's heart. The demon within him awakened at that point, right up until Lothar delivered the mercy stroke, decapitating the Guardian and banishing Sargeras into the Nether. At the same time, Gul'dan was trying to probe Medivh's mind for the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The warlock was still deep within the Guardian's thoughts when Lothar and Khadgar killed him, ending Medivh's treachery and forcing Gul'dan into a coma.\nMedivh was the first Guardian to be killed in combat in centuries. As a consequence of the killing, the pure, virtuous spirit of Medivh was allowed to live on and wander the &lt;a href=\"astral%20plane\"&gt;astral plane&lt;/a&gt; for many years to come. His body was buried in &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;Morgan's Plot&lt;/a&gt; in Deadwind Pass.\nAt the height of his powers, Medivh worked his magics and struggled with Sargeras in his tower of Karazhan. His powers were such that the trauma of his death laid a curse on his once wondrous tower and the surrounding area that became Deadwind Pass. The tower has become such a dangerous and accursed place, that those that venture in never return (&lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; chain).\nResurrection.\nThough he had died years ago, Medivh's spirit drifted beyond the borders of reality, and he watched as the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; started to spread in the &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;. He wanted nothing more than to warn the world of what was coming, but he had no way of communing with the people of Lordaeron. There was only one person he could reach on Azeroth, his mother Aegwynn. She had a strange dream, where she saw Medivh dressed in a cloak lined with raven feathers, telling her that he had a message for the world, and pleading with her to help bring him back to Azeroth. Though initially suspicious, Aegwynn did feel Medivh's soul drifting beyond the veil of reality, and she also sensed that it was free of Sargeras' touch.\nAegwynn spent years building up the power to bring him back to life and she was successful. She revived him by summoning him to Azeroth. He explained that while his spirit was wandering beyond the physical realm, he had witnessed many things. Medivh's vast power had allowed him to glimpse into the Twisting Nether and touch the minds of the Legion's demons, allowing him to learn of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedivh, described as a trespasser, briefly returned to Karazhan. The trespasser, muttering some words, entered Karazhan through the main entrance. Once there he found a crushed &lt;a href=\"astrolabe\"&gt;astrolabe&lt;/a&gt; and when he picked it up he began to see memories of the past and in particular another man just like the trespasser holding the same astrolabe. He interacted with a past version of Khadgar (though it was a future version of Medivh from Khadgar's perspective). He explained to his erstwhile apprentice that with his burial in the past by Khadgar and his current return to life, the good (the Guardian) and the evil (Sargeras) battling within him had been destroyed, and that he was, perhaps for the first time, only Medivh. He then collected the energies and visions from Karazhan to be prepared for the next battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, indicating the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nReign of Chaos.\nLong after the Second War, a strange prophet appeared to various denizens of Azeroth, delivering a warning of a looming apocalyptic threat. He was able to appear as a supernaturally-large &lt;a href=\"raven\"&gt;raven&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh chose not to reveal his true identity, as he would've been recognized as the evil sorcerer who brought the orcs to Azeroth. King &lt;a href=\"Terenas\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; both consequently dismissed the Prophet as nothing more than a madman.\nHe then appeared to the young &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 had a dream where the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s were fighting against each other while &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s rained from the sky. He awakened and the Prophet told him it was a vision, and that he must go to the ancient lands of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; if he wished to save his people. Thrall consulted with the elemental spirits, which quickly advised to trust the stranger's words, and set sail to Kalimdor in the far west beyond the sea. \nAfter this, Medivh approached Terenas' son, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to leave his beleaguered people. Only the young daughter of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and apprentice of Antonidas, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, sensed that he was perhaps right. When he appeared to her after the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, she heeded his warning and prepared to leave for the west. She set sail with a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;group of her people&lt;/a&gt; just as the invasion began. Thrall arrived to Kalimdor looking for his destiny, and his new acquaintance &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 suggested him to go to the Oracle. Thrall fought his way through the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; until he arrived at the Oracle, but he found Jaina and some humans. As they prepared to battle each other, the prophet appeared. He told them that they must cease hostilities if they ever hoped to defeat the Burning Legion and escape its corruption. They reluctantly agreed.\nFinally, the Prophet revealed his identity when the time came to rally the forces. Appearing in a dream to Thrall, the night elf &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and Jaina, the Prophet told them that they must form an alliance to battle the common enemy. He told them that he was, in fact, Medivh, the Last Guardian of Tirisfal, and that it was his doing that brought the orcs, and, in turn, the Burning Legion, to Azeroth. Jaina, Thrall, and Malfurion became convinced that victory could only be achieved through an alliance, and they rallied together to defend the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. In the final hour, nature's spirits, called into action by the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;' clarion call, swarmed around &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, and destroyed the demon once and for all.\nConfident that the world was safe for now, and that he had repaid a fraction of debt for his terrible sins, Medivh vanished, to take his place \"amongst the legends of the past.\" More specifically, Medivh's powers were waning and his time on the physical plane had come to an end. Hoping that the people of Azeroth would continue fighting together as they had at Hyjal, the Last Guardian vanished to places unknown.\nCycle of Hatred.\nThree years after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh's image among the humans had improved. He was now revered as a hero despite what the demons had done to him, presumably for guiding the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Jaina found &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Magna Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, she was confused, because all the Guardians were supposed to be dead by then, including Medivh himself.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nMedivh is involved in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; dungeon, the second instance within the caverns opened after Thrall's &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde\"&gt;Escape from Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;. It is set in the Black Morass just as Medivh prepares to open the Dark Portal, and the player group must protect him from members of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; attempting to kill him and stop the opening of the Portal, which would prevent the Horde from crossing into Azeroth.\nMedivh is also involved in the attunement process for &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. After obtaining the fragments of Khadgar's key from instances in Outland, Khadgar sends you to the Black Morass to speak to Medivh to enchant it so that it will open the locked gates of Karazhan; Medivh will instead give you &lt;a href=\"the%20Master%27s%20Key\"&gt;the Master's Key&lt;/a&gt;. However, you must have completed the instance (Medivh must survive to open the Dark Portal) before you can speak to him and gain his key.\nHe shows up twice more in his old tower of Karazhan in Deadwind Pass which has been abandoned since Medivh's death at the hands of Khadgar and Lothar, shortly before the end of the First War. An \"Echo of Medivh\" is seen where players play a &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;game of chess&lt;/a&gt; against him in the &lt;a href=\"Gamesman%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Gamesman's Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and an \"Image of Medivh\" is seen in a flashback on the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Master's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; fighting off the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nIn spite of his unknown fate, he left an avatar of himself in Karazhan to give a message of knowledge and power to his son, Med'an, so that Med'an could decide his own fate. The avatar commented himself as being gone from Azeroth.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nWhile chasing an image of the lost Dragon Aspect &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; in the Caverns of Time, Thrall encountered Medivh in the form of a black raven, who somehow knew that Thrall was from another time and that he was looking for Nozdormu. It's unclear whether that Medivh was from an alternate timeline or the main timeline.\nLegion.\nHarbingers.\nWhen Khadgar searched &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; for information that could aid him against the Legion, an apparition of Medivh appeared, offering to bestow the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; upon his former student. However, when Khadgar refused the offer, the image was revealed to actually be a gargantuan &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, whom Khadgar then destroyed with &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-launch questline.\nA vision of Medivh made a cameo in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; when Khadgar reminisced about his apprenticeship, calling &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; spy, just like he did when they first met. An echo of Medivh then said that that which was foreseen had come to pass and the circle neared completion. It ordered Karazhan's sentries to \"attend\" to the tower's guests, and his magic thwarted Khadgar's safeguards on the tower. According to &lt;a href=\"Thar%27zul\"&gt;Thar'zul&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh had opened the way to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s victory.\nReturn to Karazhan.\nWhen Khadgar and various &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, alongside the Kirin Tor, breached the Legion's defenses in Karazhan, Khadgar found himself unable to undo the Legion's magic that was binding the Legion worlds to the tower. At that instant, Medivh appeared, commenting on the many fragments of himself that he had left in the tower. Khadgar questioned his master's sudden, real, appearance, only to be told that they had to undo the binding first.\nAfter the forces defeated the Legion in the &lt;a href=\"Netherspace\"&gt;Netherspace&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh spoke with Khadgar, telling him that he couldn't stay to fight the Legion and that he was needed elsewhere. When questioned further, Medivh told Khadgar he was Azeroth's new Guardian, prompting Khadgar to deny the power as he had already done before. Medivh corrected him, stating he possessed all the power necessary to defeat the Legion, and that power was his will, heart, and courage to face the Legion. Medivh called Khadgar Azeroth's guardian once more and stated that while it may be simpler to shut &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;a door&lt;/a&gt; than pass through it, sometimes a step into &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;the unknown&lt;/a&gt; is required to break the bonds of fate. With that, he flew off as a raven towards the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, at the end of the Legion's invasion, Sargeras was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; but not before he managed to mortally wound &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth's world-soul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. As the Alliance and Horde began to fight over &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;her blood&lt;/a&gt; as a powerful resource, Khadgar instead returned to Karazhan to confer with Medivh. He hoped that somewhere in Medivh's ancient tomes there was an answer on how to heal the world.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to find a way to counter the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. While there, he encountered the shade of Medivh, who encouraged him that while Wrathion could not change the past, he could forge a new legacy to leave for the future. The Last Guardian also recounted his struggles under Sargeras' influence as the dark titan twisted his soul from within, about his spirit's return to the mortal realm, and how it guided Azeroth's champions in the fight against the very forces that once corrupted him.\nWorld of Warcraft Anniversary.\nMedivh and Wrathion were found partaking in the festivities of &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%27s%20Anniversary\"&gt;Warcraft's Anniversary&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nMedivh's death has been portrayed in at least four different sources. \nIn \"\", the player had to enter his lair and slay him. His lair was filled with summoned and cave beings: &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"daemon\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Lothar\"&gt;Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; are all absent.\nMedivh's death was clearly described in \"The Last Guardian\", where it is established that he was slain by the three listed above \u2014 with Khadgar wielding the blade that was run through Medivh's heart (and Lothar then decapitating him); this version is supported by various sources.\nIn the interlude \"The Last Guardian\" in the \"&lt;a href=\"Eternity%27s%20End%20%28WC3%20campaign%29\"&gt;Eternity's End&lt;/a&gt;\" campaign in ', Medivh is shown in a flashback being killed by 5 human footmen and a captain. Though the captain figure in the scene could be Lothar, Khadgar and Garona are nowhere to be seen. In \"The Last Guardian\" it is, however, described that Khadgar and Garona were wearing &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; garbs, which would explain why they could be displayed as normal footmen. In ', Medivh is shown being killed by a captain and an apprentice wizard, who could be Lothar and Khadgar.\nFinally in \"&lt;a href=\"Flashback\"&gt;Flashback&lt;/a&gt;\" we see Medivh being stabbed through the heart by Khadgar with Lothar standing just behind.\nThe idea that there were more involved than just Lothar, Khadgar, and Garona is supported by \"Shadows &amp; Light\" (\"...a squad of human warriors...\") and \"Horde Player's Guide\" (\"A group of human heroes slowed the invasion by slaying Medivh\"). However, both sources also confirm that Lothar, Khadgar, and Garona were involved as well. In \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" it is explained that Lothar was with Garona, Khadgar and a handful of men when they defeated Medivh.\nAtiesh.\nThe most powerful mages focus their powers into magical staves, and Medivh was no different. His staff, , was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%20%28demon%29\"&gt;the eponym demon&lt;/a&gt;, agent of Sargeras, thus boosting Medivh's already-immeasurable powers. When Medivh was killed, Atiesh was taken to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, where it was revealed that the demon within killed anyone who dared try to wield it. It was locked away in a secret and secure vault for nearly three decades following Medivh's death, until Dalaran was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, along with the staff.\nAtiesh was shattered into 42 pieces\u2014the 40 splinters of the shaft, the base, and the headpiece. The base was found by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; through his exploration of Azeroth, and ended up in &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;'s possession in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; when the dwarf adventured there. The headpiece was located by the archlich &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who was responsible for summoning Archimonde in the first place. The 40 splinters of the shaft were given to Kel'Thuzad's lieutenants, spread out across his citadel of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the staff were restored, it would need to be exorcised of the dark taint.\nThe base was retrieved by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; from within the corpse of C'Thun. The staff was purified and restored by Medivh's son, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh had poured a large amount of power into the base as Med'an's legacy that would only answer to his touch.\nIn the RPG.\nMedivh is categorized as a &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Brighteyes\"&gt;Brighteyes&lt;/a&gt; is rumored to be the blood of Medivh.\nPersonality.\nMedivh\u2019s soul constantly struggled with that of Sargeras for control of his body and mind. The fight between them was constant, and resulted in Medivh shifting periodically between stretches of calmness and lucidity and bouts of strangely incomprehensible behavior. To outsiders, he often seemed to make abrupt decisions or reverse his position on issues. When the struggle between the two souls became too great for Medivh's body to handle, he sank into a catatonic state and became completely unresponsive. These periods varied greatly in duration and could range from a matter of minutes to months.\nWhen Medivh was in control of his body and mind, he was a friendly and wise individual. He cared deeply for a number of the high-ranking human leaders and put the needs of the kingdom above almost everything else. He had defended Lordaeron from attack many times throughout the years and has built a great reputation as a staunch defender of the land. He was not naturally biased against any of the races, and displayed a fair amount of interest in people who brought to him stories of distant lands or cultures.\nHowever, when Sargeras was in control, Medivh\u2019s personality shifted dramatically. He became sullen and distant, barely acknowledged the presence of close friends, and practically ignored strangers. He was secretive and often traveled to faraway places abruptly. In private, Medivh would not hesitate to do away with annoying visitors by using his spells to kill or incapacitate them. However, he was moderately concerned about his cover being blown with the Lordaeron leadership and would not act out of character in public.\nMedivh's tactics were often erratic, depending upon which personality was in control at the time. Nonetheless, the common theme with both personalities was to stay at range and harass enemies with potent spells. He often cast only a few spells and then retreated for a few rounds to strike again later from another direction.\nMedivh, the Prophet, chose to remain uninvolved directly in the upcoming war (leading some to suspect he had remained a ghost).\nStatus as an Eternal.\nMedivh is classified as an &lt;a href=\"Eternal\"&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt; in the legends chapter of \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20%26amp%3B%20Light\"&gt;Shadows &amp; Light&lt;/a&gt;\", but the book is not specific as to how or when he reached that status. The article is mostly concerned with the period in history when he was possessed by Sargeras. This likely means that he was an Eternal only because he was possessed by one. It doesn't seem to be related to the fact he was a guardian, as other guardians are not Eternals, for example &lt;a href=\"Aranda\"&gt;Aranda&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the article does make a brief reference to his period as the legendary Oracle, it is not likely the reason for his Eternal status. The majority of the article concerned with the period when he had dual personalities where he struggled with Sargeras for control of his body, this includes the role-playing notes and combat section. It explains how others might react to his mood swings and personality changes. His abilities are also a combination of a guardian and Sargeras' abilities.\nThe book is also pretty clear that no new Eternals have appeared in modern times.\nWhen Khadgar killed Medivh and destroyed the spirit of Sargeras, Medivh's spirit escaped. The spirit of Medivh foresaw the eventual downfall of Lordaeron, and with his mother's help his spirit attained form.\nIt should be noted Medivh considers himself no longer a human as he was before referenced by his quote in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\": \"I left my humanity behind long ago. I am something...different now.\"\nAge.\nThe game manuals for \"Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans\" and \"Warcraft II\" stated that Medivh was born 45 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Copeland\"&gt;Sean Copeland&lt;/a&gt; later stated that the Guardian was born in the year -44. returns to the -45 version, meaning that Medivh was killed at the age of 48 in the year 3 &lt;a href=\"ADP\"&gt;ADP&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nMedivh is a playable character in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". Among his abilities, he can create little &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;s."}

He proves to be the most powerful unit and should be approached with caution, as he has extreme attack speed and the same range as your &lt;a href=\"Archer%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Archers&lt;/a&gt;. He will also summon monsters to defend him - a &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; if his Magic bar is full, or &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt; otherwise.\nWhile his \"natural\" Armor and basic attack values are 0, he receives a +4 upgrade, like all other enemy units in the mission where he is encountered.\nSpells.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; calls forth hordes of deadly, poisonous spiders to aid him. Several spiders come at any one summoning, and will swarm over the enemy as the caster directs. They crawl through gaps in the enemies armor and bite them with their poisoned fangs, injecting their deadly juices into the bloodstream. As the enemy falls to the ground, he literally burns from within.\nThe most powerful spell ever rumored to exist. Legends say that the caster would have the ability to summon forth a &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt; by allowing his body to be sacrificed to enable its existence in this plane. The daemon would then be guided by the spirit of the caster to do his bidding, but should the daemon be destroyed, the warlock's life would be forfeit. The truth to this tale is questionable, but the incantations and rituals used to summon the creature may lay in some lost runic writings. The dream of every follower of the underworld is to rediscover these incantations and be able to command the power of the Daemon.\nNotes.\nMedivh is given a cost of 2500 gold within the game's data, even though he cannot be built or created, like the other hero units.\nResearch for Minor Summons and Poison Cloud has been unlocked for Medivh to use. Since there are no buildings to target, Poison Cloud is never used against the player. Curiously, Major Summons has not been made available, even though Medivh is able to summon a Daemon should his Magic bar fill up. It is possible the Medivh unit ignores what research is available and has it's own fixed set of spells.\nIf the player casts Far Seeing on Medivh's starting point, this will trigger him to attack and/or summon enemies to attack. If this is done fairly early on, he will spend the entire mission summoning a single Spider at a time. If the pathing allows, the Spider will attack the player's party, otherwise, it will be trapped in the same room with Medivh until it dies. This will help to limit how many Daemons the player must face prior to slaying Medivh. Keep in mind that at least one unit is positioned within Medivh's attack range, so the player should move their units around before casting Far Seeing at his location.\nMedivh's fireball attacks costs 1 MP to cast, unlike the usual 5MP the other casters require. The cost is so low, it will reduce Medivh's attack speed to 40 frames, which is on par with MP recovery.\nMedivh is one of two units in the entire game that does not come with any buttons on their command bar (The other is the &lt;a href=\"Wounded\"&gt;Wounded&lt;/a&gt; unit). To use Medivh, the player must temporarily use another unit's command bar (The Warlock's bar is an ideal candidate, given they share the same spells). Unfortunately, this has a limited duration and the game will eventually revert to Medivh's default command bar.\nIn older builds of the game, Medivh was called \"Klaron\" and had far different stats. No unit sprite or portrait are included, the unused cost for the unit is 100 gold and his basic attack required 5MP to cast, instead of 1."}

After unwittingly opening the and inviting the to Azeroth, Medivh was fought by and Lothar, and eventually killed. \nDespite his actions while possessed, Medivh remained a defender of Azeroth, and before dying was able to briefly assist the army of Stormwind in their assault on the orc encampment. Khadgar would later discover that it was the burden of isolation imposed on Medivh by his role as Guardian that made him vulnerable to the fel's corruption, his loneliness ultimately leading to his downfall.\nHistory.\nInitiation.\nAlready a Novice in the , Medivh became Guardian at 11. He was initiated by the , in a special meeting in the . After being tested by and &lt;a href=\"Finden\"&gt;Finden&lt;/a&gt;, he was branded with the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Eye of the Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and welcomed as the new Guardian.\nTravels.\nIn his youth, Medivh traveled far and wide in an effort to feel a connection with the souls he was charged with protecting. During these travels he fell in love with a woman belonging to a race of strong and noble people, though their relationship was not meant to be.\nBut Medivh's travels would lead him not only to love, but to great evil. Seeing it as his duty to find and master all forms of magic, Medivh's search eventually led to him to the depths of the void, where he came upon the terrifying power of the .\nBonds of Brotherhood.\nWith his training complete, Medivh traveled to an inn to reunite with his childhood friends, Prince Llane Wrynn and Captain Anduin Lothar. With Medivh and Lothar on the verge of growing into their responsibilities and Llane spoiling for action, the trio set out for the jungles of Stranglethorn Vale to investigate a string of recent troll attacks on human settlements. After surviving an ambush they entered an ancient troll temple and did battle with a warlord who sacrificed his retainers as fuel for the fel, empowering himself. Medivh harnessed his mastery over the arcane to destroy the temple and kill the troll, though the son of the warlord would swear vengeance on the humans as a result.\nAfter this incident, Medivh took up residence in Karazhan and began researching the fel in hopes of controlling it. As war broke out between the trolls and humans, Medivh was repeatedly called upon to help battle the invaders but was frustrated by his inability to prevent the deaths of many soldiers and civilians, becoming increasingly reclusive as he focused more time and energy on experimenting with the fel. In time the trolls laid siege to Stormwind, invading the outer city and killing King Wrynn. During the ensuing battle Medivh attempted to rely only upon the arcane, but in a moment of desperation was ultimately forced to unleash the fel, killing the attackers. For this, he was honored as a hero by the newly crowned King Llane Wrynn, with a statue commemorating his victory erected in Stormwind. Medivh, however, would spend the next six years isolated in Karazhan.\nCorruption.\nOver time the burden of isolation and loneliness placed upon him by his role as Guardian began to weaken Medivh, and despite his best intentions, the fel began to consume him. Twisting his very soul, the dark magic turned his love for Azeroth into an insatiable need to spread the fel.\nAs the corruption progressed, his appearance twisted horrifyingly, and his will apparently not his own. Medivh would later have no recollection of these events. It was during one of these possessions that Medivh made contact with the orc warlock , sharing with him the secrets of the and leading him and the to Azeroth. Medivh later opened the gate to Azeroth, with Gul'dan providing fuel in the form of life energy drained from draenei prisoners.\nMedivh would progressively lose himself to the fel. While the energy of Karazhan's arcane font would serve to restore him and infuse him with energy, over time it would do so more slowly and less thoroughly than it once had, the Guardian recovering less completely each time he pushed himself. Medivh would find himself battling for control against a hooded figure that seemed to him to be formed out of the thunderheads themselves, whose eyes glowed green.\n was aware to some extent of his master's struggles with the fel, and would aid him in recovering each time, believing that he would continue to succeed in mastering the corruption. Over time Medivh would send away the community of servants in Karazhan, having ceased to receive guests, until finally only Moroes remained. Moroes did not seem entirely happy with his master's isolation, later commenting that the arrival of Lothar would do the Guardian good.\nWarcraft.\nWith the arrival of Lothar and Khadgar, Moroes escorts Lothar to Medivh's chambers.\nAppearance.\nAs a child, Medivh is described as having brown hair and eyes that changed from blue to green depending on the light. In maturity he was tall and well built, with a fit but ordinary build, and had long, loose hair and a beard of sandy brown.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Meerah also reveals that she found an incomplete journal, which turns out to have been written by &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; whom Kaja and the adventurer traveled to Vol'dun to find.\nLater, Meerah transports Kaja and the adventurer to various locations around Vol'dun using her &lt;a href=\"Meerah%27s%20Caravan\"&gt;carriage&lt;/a&gt; drawn by her two trusty &lt;a href=\"alpaca\"&gt;alpaca&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Dolly\"&gt;Dolly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dot%20%28alpaca%29\"&gt;Dot&lt;/a&gt;; first to the &lt;a href=\"Withering%20Gulch\"&gt;Withering Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, where they pick up &lt;a href=\"Jorak\"&gt;Jorak&lt;/a&gt;, then to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Akunda\"&gt;Temple of Akunda&lt;/a&gt;, where they eventually find and rescue Rakera, and finally to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt;. During the latter journey, the caravan is ambushed and set on fire by &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt;'s assassins, forcing the passengers to hop off and causing Dolly and Dot to run off into Zul'Ahjin, but Meerah quickly catches up with and ties down the alpacas within the ruins.\nLater, Meerah is encountered by &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer at &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Vorrik's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, sheltering a group of &lt;a href=\"Rescued%20Slave%20%28Vol%27dun%29\"&gt;vulpera slaves&lt;/a&gt; that have been rescued from the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;. She explains that at night, Kiro and &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; sneak down into the &lt;a href=\"Crater%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;sethrak slave camp&lt;/a&gt; below, rescue the most vulnerable vulpera, and lead them to the sanctum. Meerah then secures safe passage out to the dunes, where there are caravans waiting to take them away to safety. After the adventurer arrives, Meerah asks them to rescue a group of vulpera children being held in the slave camp by &lt;a href=\"Appraiser%20Versik\"&gt;Appraiser Versik&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Faithless ruler &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Emperor Korthek&lt;/a&gt; is eventually defeated, Meerah, Dolly, and Dot can be found back at the Vulpera Hideaway with Kiro and Nisha.\nWhen the armies of &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, Rakera had Meerah transport her and Kaja to the city. They took the opportunity to bring the two &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akunda\"&gt;Akunda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt; with them. Once they arrived, Meerah accompanied Rakera, Kaja, and &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Zocalo\"&gt;Zocalo&lt;/a&gt; and helped fend off Mythrax while the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; went to confront Zul.\nJoining the Horde.\nThe vulpera eventually decided to join the Horde in order to explore the world beyond Vol'dun. Meerah and Nisha accompanied Kiro as he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, but Baine was forced to decline giving them membership as troubles facing the Horde's current allies had stretched the faction's resources thin. The vulpera decided to offer their help, with Kiro sending Meerah to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; to help &lt;a href=\"Vintner%20Iltheux\"&gt;Vintner Iltheux&lt;/a&gt; with the production of &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the Horde adventurer, Meerah discovered that wine production at the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; had gotten into disarray because Iltheux wasn't properly utilizing the help he'd been sent by the Horde, having assigned his assistants\u2014&lt;a href=\"Micah%20Broadhoof\"&gt;Micah Broadhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nomi\"&gt;Nomi&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to roles they were completely unsuited for. Meerah sent the adventurer to reassign the workers to new roles, allowing them to resume production and create a new vintage that Iltheux approved of. Once all three vulpera completed their tasks and returned to Orgrimmar, Baine realized that he had been wrong to dismiss them so quickly and offered them a place in the Horde, which they gladly accepted. As a member of the Horde, Meerah and her alpacas can subsequently be found resting in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; next to Kiro, &lt;a href=\"Nilsa\"&gt;Nilsa&lt;/a&gt;, and Nisha.\nDragonflight.\nMeerah joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and is seen with &lt;a href=\"Jorak\"&gt;Jorak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Forkriver%20Crossing\"&gt;Forkriver Crossing&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nThese &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; sure know a thing or two about &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;s, huh?\nWell so do I!"}

In order to be summoned the three &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Guardian%20%28Throne%20of%20Thunder%29\"&gt;Eternal Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s must be slain and bells behind them rung.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Even the most callous among the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; quaver at the thought of the dark experiments performed at the Thunder King's behest. Long ago, a young &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Flesh-shaping\"&gt;twisted&lt;/a&gt; into a multi-headed &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt; and left to languish beneath &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s throne. Now the twisted creature lurks deep in the Forgotten Depths, awaiting the moment it may finally inflict its terrible agony upon others.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"The inspiration for this boss fight was the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra\"&gt;Lernaean Hydra&lt;/a&gt; that Hercules battled in Greek mythology \u2014a beast with many heads that regrew two heads in place of each that was severed. That foundation, combined with the concept of three distinct types of heads, resulted in the beast that now awaits players beneath the Thunder King\u2019s lair in patch 5.2.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nOne Body, Many Heads.\nWhen one of Megaera's heads is destroyed, her body takes damage equal to the head's maximum health and two heads regrow in its place.\nStrategy.\nLooking For Raid.\nThis fight is only available as a 25 man raid in Looking for Raid, and requires 2 tanks, 6 healers and a healthy mix of 17 melee and caster DPS. As this is the strategy for Looking For Raid, the mechanics have been simplified by the Blizzard development team. Keep in mind that the normal versions of the Megaera encounter are more difficult and require that raiders pay more attention to mechanics than what follows in this strategy.\nThe positioning is pretty simple. One tank will always be focused on a Venomous Head, and the other tank will always be focus on a Flaming Head. The hit box for each of Megaera's heads is fairly large, so DPS and healers will remain stacked about 8-10 yards behind one of the tanks, depending on which head is being killed at the time. There is a lot of AoE damage done during this encounter, so it helps to have the DPS and healers stack. This means there will be two stack points: One for Venomous Head DPS and the other for Flaming Head DPS. Using raid light beams may assist in quicker stacking between shifts.\nThe fight begins by having the DPS kill the Venomous Head first while healers maintain tank health via single target healing and AoE heals for the group. When the Venomous Head dies, more heads will spawn, and the raid group will relocate to the second stack point behind the tank with the Flaming Head. When the Flaming Head dies, the cycle will begin anew, and the raid group will return to the first stack point behind the Venomous Head that will respawn. This mechanic will continue until the Megaera is dead.\nDPS and Healers will have an additional mechanic they must pay attention to: Cinders. Every so often a single player will be targeted by the Flaming Head and will be marked with the Cinders debuff. The player will only have a few seconds to leave the stacked group and stand about 10-15 yards away. When the player is far away enough, a healer will need to cleanse that player before the player can return to the group. If this mechanic is ignored, the Cinders will kill the player and the raid.\n10 player (Normal).\nWhile this encounter appears complicated, the strategy is rather simple. For the 10 man encounter, 2 tanks and 2-3 healers will be required, and a healthy mix of 5 melee and caster DPS. Some raid teams may want to have a hybrid class player who can easily switch to a back-up healing role as needed, such as an elemental shaman or balance druid.\nThe hit box for each of Megaera's heads is fairly large, DPS and healers can remain loosely spread out for the most part, and then remain stacked about 8-10 yards behind one of the tanks, depending on which head is being killed at the time. There is a lot of AoE damage done during this encounter, so it helps to have the DPS and healers stack when noted. \nWhen the encounter begins, the raid will want to focus their DPS on the Frozen Head. After it dies, the raid should stack up in a location close to one of the other heads, while the raid endures the AoE damage of Rampage. There is no way to avoid this mechanic, it is simply an ability that must be healed through.\nRampage has a 20 second duration, and afterwards the raid can once again spread out loosely. Each of the two tanks will then aggro one of the two heads, and tank them facing away from the raid. They will need to perform a tank switch between these two heads.\nDPS one of the remaining two heads.\nAt this point, the raid will need to begin handling the abilities cast by the heads at the back of the cave:\nThe player(s) afflicted by Cinders must run over any Icy Ground void zones available and then be dispelled in a safe location (away from the raid and in a place where the resulting void zone will not interfere with the raid's movement.\nThe player(s) chased by Torrent of Ice must run from the beam of ice. They must be careful not to kite it over the raid's location, and, if possible, to kite over any existing fiery void zones to extinguish them.\nThe entire raid should move away from the impact location of Acid Rain to minimize the damage that is taken. Moving 15-20 yards away is sufficient.\nThe raid will continue DPSing to the heads one at a time, while handling the mechanics cast by the heads at the back of the cave, and enduring the increased damage as each head dies. Each head is worth about 14% of Megaera's health, so the raid will need to kill 7 heads to defeat the encounter.\nHeroic Mode.\nOnly significant differences is than raids will need to ignore greed and kill the other heads instead, as the acid rain damage, along the fact 3 players are targeted by it, is extremely hard (if not impossible) to heal regularly.\nA new head,the arcane head, enters on the rotation and spawns after the flaming head dies. The head has a breath abilities like the others but also summons 3-5 nether wyrms regularly than deals damage to random players, can channel a stun on them as well,and they respond to normal threat tables. Due to their low hp,the raid can simply ignore them,heal though the damage and dispel the stun.And only kill them just after a head has been killed, since the raid cannot dps any head for a couple of the seconds.\nRampage damage is extremely high on Heroic mode. 3rd and following ones will require to coordinate raid cds to heal though it and almost always make use of 3 heals.\nAdditionally, the ice torrent of the frozen heads on heroic grows till it fills thrice as much from its original size.And the Cinder debuff now leaves a fire pool every 3 secs instead of when dispelled. The raid should make sure to move away from the stack points for rampage to not compromise it with fire or ice.\nA ideal strategy for this phase is to set lock portals between 2 points of the room and when a player is targeted by torrent they can use a portal to go to the other way of the room and when a player is debuffed with cinders they can use the same portal to leave the fire pools over the ice and smelt it to release some space for the raid.\nThe Fight still requires 7 heads to beat it, much like on Normal mode. Once 7 heads are killed, the encounter is complete.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "53168", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=53168", "title": "Meitre", "text": "Meitre was a great &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; from many thousands of years ago that has become famous for his research. Disappearing into quiet seclusion after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, he left a collection of scrolls and spells that were researched by other wizards and came to form the basis of modern &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s. Meitre is presumed deceased, though as rather than give up &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; and the arcane after the conflict, Meitre choose to live as a hermit, his final end likely long buried by the strands of time, with his life and work a topic of heated, at times violent debate among modern &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nLife.\nMeitre lived during the height of the night elf &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;, and he was one of his race's most gifted &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s. He spent years exploring the world in search of knowledge. His extensive travels brought him into contact with an unknown &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;, from whom Meitre discovered the existence of the arcane being named &lt;a href=\"Aluneth%20%28entity%29\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; and the otherworldly plane where it dwelt. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, most &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; sorcerers sided with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and used their powers to help the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s invade the world. Meitre did not. He joined the night elf &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; and fought to defend the world. It was during these troubling years that Meitre mastered his connection with Aluneth. The sorcerer never enslaved Aluneth--the being was far too strong and unwieldy for that. Yet, Meitre found a way to draw power from the entity, thereby using its energies to enhance his own spells. In one battle, he and a group of night elf defenders found themselves surrounded by an overwhelming force of demons. Death was imminent, but Meitre did not abandon hope. He called on Aluneth's energies and wove a mass teleportation spell that transported him and his comrades to safety. \nFollowing their victory over the Legion, the night elves outlawed the use of arcane magic. They believed that the sorcerous arts were not safe and that wielding them would only lead to another disaster like the War of the Ancients. Meitre could not give up magic. Doing so would mean breaking his connection with Aluneth. The sorcerer quailed at the thought of losing his ability to draw on the entity's power. Perhaps he lacked confidence in his own skills. Whatever the case, Meitre retreated from society and became a recluse.\nNo one knows exactly what became of Meitre, but he left behind a wealth of scrolls that would form the basis of modern magic. His writings included a number of spells that the sorcerer had created himself. Even thousands of years after the War of the Ancients, high elf and human magi continued learning from Meitre's knowledge. The ability to cast spells from his scrolls was seen as an important milestone in a young apprentice's education, and a measure of a pupil's aptitude. Though many magi delved into Meitre's scrolls, no one knew of Aluneth. The entity that had played such a critical role in the sorcerer's life was forgotten until the time of Guardian &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nElven mages didn't attempt to cast from Meitre's scrolls until the final year of their apprenticeships, and humans didn't even try until their apprenticeships were completed. In arcane academies, such as those in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, it was established policy that apprentices not be allowed near them. The students of &lt;a href=\"Scavell\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt; all read the scrolls, though only Aegwynn did so with permission, and was able to gain mastery over the spells and rituals in the scrolls in record time. The scrolls covered magical topics ranging from transmutation to advanced ward-penetration, and likely a number of other subjects. Aegwynn also used the scrolls to control Aluneth, as Meitre had long ago; but unlike Meitre, Aegwynn bound Aluneth to her will and turned it into a staff: &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor much of Aegwynn's tenure as Guardian, the Meitre scrolls served as a sort of advanced guideline for magical theory; however, by the time that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was training, the scrolls had been largely laid aside. The only known copies at the time were lost when the Violet Citadel was destroyed, but the ancient mage &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; proved to have access to at least three copies of them."}

It is a large bipedal robot controlled by &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDescription.\n\"Sprawling pumping systems operate day and night throughout &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, built by the naga and their servants to drain the waters of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. At the heart of this industrial complex is the Steamvault, where arcane technology drives the machinery used in the distillation process. To command the engineers who maintain and operate this machinery, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; hired the renowned Mekgineer Steamrigger, a gifted gnome technician whose illness has damaged his sanity, but not his fierce dedication to his craft.\"\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The irradiation of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; transformed many of the city's survivors into leper gnomes. Among these victims was the brilliant Mekgineer Steamrigger. Although he escaped Gnomeregan and retained his intellect, whatever ethics and compassion he had once possessed were gone. He wandered &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, selling his knowledge to a number of unscrupulous groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, the naga hired Steamrigger to operate the intricate machinery in Zangarmarsh's Steamvault.\"\nStrategy.\nEvery 25% health at 75%, 50% and 25% health he shouts \"Tune 'em up good, boys!\", three to five Steamrigger Mechanics appear. These are non-elite, and can be killed quickly and should be first priority as they start healing Mekgineer Steamrigger. Pvp trinket and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful here, if you want to grab the &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; back after you had a net on you; druids can also shift form to break the net. Any damage whatsoever to the mechanics forces them to attack you and not heal the boss. So if your tank has an attack that can hit multiple mobs at once, you can disrupt them and bring them to your tank, giving your &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; time to pick them off one by one without them healing the boss.\nHeroic Mode.\nSteamrigger in &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; is almost identical to normal mode, except that an extra gnome appears every 7 seconds or so. So DPS need to burn it down in addition to the normal 3 spawn that comes when Steamrigger announces \"Tune em' up boys!\". The tank can Thunderclap to interrupt heals temporarily, but the gnomes quickly switch back to healing so it only buys 3\u20134 seconds at most. Druid tanks can use swipe to prevent healing until dps can pick up the gnomes. Priests should &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; gnomes that are beating on &lt;a href=\"clothies\"&gt;clothies&lt;/a&gt; when possible.\nThis fight is made trivial by the use of a paladin who uses &lt;a href=\"Consecrate\"&gt;Consecrate&lt;/a&gt;. Consecrate will almost kill the gnomes and stop them from healing by the time there are so many that you should &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; them down. &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt; will most likely do marginal damage but will hold aggro and reduce healing until there are enough that AoE will be worth it. If you do not have any serious AoE then you can use low mana AoE effects to keep them from healing since every damage done will stop their heal ability. A Magma Totem works fine if you can keep them from destroying it. \nSteamrigger also enrages after 5 minutes on &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; and quickly one shots the party."}

His subjects are numerous, vicious, and insane enough to defend their crazed king against any intrusion from the upper world. It is Thermaplugg's madness that makes him so dangerous; he possesses the cunning to destroy everything around him, with no thought for his own life. There is a reason that even the monsters of Gnomeregan fear him.\"\nStrategy.\nThermaplugg will probably be quite a hard fight for you. Thermaplugg activates (via lightning) bomb dispensers, which create homing, exploding &lt;a href=\"Walking%20Bomb\"&gt;Walking Bomb&lt;/a&gt;s. The bombs can be killed (without exploding) via a relatively small amount of damage, but the key is to prevent them from being created. Buttons on the side of active machines can be pressed to deactivate the dispensers. You may find assigning one party member to button duty to be effective, while others have vouched for a zone-defense strategy where some amount of buttons are assigned to different players, to reduce the time to run to them. With proper clearing, there will be no non-bomb adds. One of Thermaplugg's attacks is a &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; which reduces the threat of the party member knocked back. A warrior may find taunts sufficient to hold interest, while other tanks at this level may have more trouble. You should probably have a second character (offtank, or DPS) intentionally staying above your healer in threat. The fight will take a while.\nThermaplugg has roughly 23,190 health."}

{"id": "214141", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=214141", "title": "Melee mitigation", "text": "Melee &lt;a href=\"mitigation\"&gt;mitigation&lt;/a&gt; is reducing the effectiveness of an attack, and there are specific strategies for mitigating &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; attacks. For mitigating magical &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s, see &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; for more details. \nBasics.\nThis article summarizes in one place what a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; needs to know about mitigation and gear.\nThe following stats are described as a unit, most of which have their own individual pages for more information:\nThe attack table.\nTo begin, there are several different outcomes of any melee attack. These are miss, dodge, parry, block, hit, critical hit, and crushing blow. When leveling up to 80, or if you played during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, you may have seen a crushing blow. Currently in the game, crushing blows are only possible if the mob is 4 levels or more higher than your current level. Effectively once you reach level 80, you will never have to worry about these again since even raid bosses are only level 83. \nNote that &lt;a href=\"glancing%20blow\"&gt;glancing blow&lt;/a&gt;s only apply to offensive attacks, so they will not be described further in this article.\nCritical hits.\nFor dungeons and raiding, the first mitigation stat a tank must worry about is hitting the defense cap, which now pushes critical hits off the combat table. Remember that critical hits are double the amount of a normal hit. For a level 80, the defense cap for level 83 bosses is 540 defense when unmodified by &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;s. In a &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; dungeon, the bosses will only be level 82 so the cap is 535 defense. \nDefense at level 80 is acquired at a rate of 4.92 defense \"rating.\" Assuming the level 80 have 400 &lt;a href=\"defense%20skill\"&gt;defense skill&lt;/a&gt;, you need a minimum of 689 defense rating contributed from your gear to meet the 540 cap, again only 665 for heroic bosses. Notably, &lt;a href=\"Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest%20%28druid%20talent%29\"&gt;Survival of the Fittest (druid talent)&lt;/a&gt; completely eliminates the defense cap for druid tanks. It is very possible to have a high dodge or parry rating and then lose it via a stun and then critted. So having enough defense is vital to a tank's survivability.\nOnce a tank becomes dedicated to raiding, any pvp gear will be replaced with proper tanking gear. However new tanks still running heroics, keep in mind that resilience also mitigates critical hits and stacks with defense. If using resilience alone, 460 resilience rating is needed to completely mitigate critical hits from a level 83 raid boss, but only 443 for a level 82 heroic dungeon boss. This is because a raid boss has an 5.6% to critically strike and 5.4% for heroic dungeon bosses. When a tank has a combination of resilience \"and\" defense rating, sum the amount of crit reduction from both. 123 defense rating (or 25 defense skill) is needed to reduce critical hit chance by 1%. 81.96 resilience rating also reduces crit chance by 1%.\nHits.\nOnce a tank has is uncrittable, tanks now try to mitigate regular hits. For tanks that cannot wear shields, these attacks can only be partially mitigated by accumulating a large armor rating and can never be pushed off the combat table. For tanks that can wear a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, regular hits can be pushed off the combat table with block rating.\nBlock cap.\nFor shield wearers, the next stat they should strive for is the block cap. Much alike the critical hit cap, hitting the block cap will remove regular hits off the combat table altogether (as defense removed critical hits off the table). When block capped, \"every\" attack you take will be mitigated in \"some\" way. Fully mitigated hits are misses, parries, and dodges, where the amount of damage taken is reduced all the way to zero. The remainder of blocked hits will be reduced based on armor rating and block value (not to be confused with block rating and block chance). \nIf the tank is level 80 and the mob is level 80, the playing field is even, and the block cap is 100% avoidance. But when the boss is level 82 or level 83, the mob gains an advantage and has an extra chance to land a hit. For each level the mob or boss is above you, he is 0.2% less likely to be dodged, parried, miss, or to be blocked when hitting in melee combat. For a level 82 boss (in a heroic dungeon), the block cap for the tank is 101.6% and for raids (because bosses are level 83) the cap is 102.4%. A macro for displaying combat table coverage is given on the &lt;a href=\"CTC\"&gt;CTC&lt;/a&gt; page, making it easy to check on it while swapping gear around.\nAvoidance.\nEspecially for tanks that can block, remember that not all mitigation (block rating, block value, parry rating, dodge rating, armor rating) is created equal. Even though you must have 102.4% total avoidance or higher to be block capped, the table still only has 100 points. Even at the minimum 102.4%, 2.4% will always be wasted in a sense. This wasted avoidance will always come from your chance to block, never from your chance to miss, parry, or dodge. This is because block is the lowest stat on the table. \nStacking block rating is good when leveling to \"hit\" the cap with less gear. However, as a geared tank, hitting the cap using more miss, parry, and dodge chance is desirable to take less damage overall. Again this is because a regular or blocked hit is only \"partially\" reduced by armor and block value, but a parried, dodged, or missed hit result in the damage going all the way to \"zero\". \nOn the flip side of the coin, in terms of reaching the block cap, chance to block (from block rating, not block value) gives the most bang for your buck. For the sake of comparison, we'll temporarily ignore diminishing returns. For every 16.395 block rating, you gain 1% avoidance. The same is true for 39.348 dodge, 49.185 parry, or 122.95 defense rating. Defense rating is a little bit special because while doesn't provide very much total avoidance per rating point, it's the way to increase your chance to miss an incoming hit once you reach level 80 and max out your weapon skill. Parry is also special (remember that defense rating also increases parry just slightly) because a parried hit increases your attack speed temporarily, but a dodged hit does not. \nDiminishing returns.\nFinally, to explain &lt;a href=\"melee%20diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt;, commonly referred to as \"DR\". You'll notice on the character screen in several places there is the remark \"before diminishing returns.\" What you see is not actually what you get, in particular if you have a lot of any one avoidance stat. For this reason, you may find the best gear balances your avoidance stats somewhat evenly, to avoid the diminishing returns as much as possible. \nThankfully, base stats, talents, and &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt;s are not impacted by DR, only gear is. At first DR has little to no impact on the rate of return, but if you stack (for example) dodge and dodge only, you will eventually get very little additional dodge for each additional dodge rating. You would take less damage overall by replacing \"some\" of the dodge rating with another type of avoidance, defense, block, and parry rating. \nTo calculate DR exactly, you need to use your class specific coefficient for each avoidance stat. When calcuating remember that base stats and talented stats have no DR, agility and defense rating do give additional avoidance, but they are affected by DR as well. Block rating is impacted by DR, but since most tanks replace the majority of their block rating with parry, defense, and dodge, data is not available for the block rating DR coefficients. \nShield block value.\nLastly for shield wielders, when you have accumulated lots of high quality avoidance from parry, dodge, and miss, you can still reduce your damage taken from stacking shield block value (and armor of course). Block value has no DR, unlike \"chance\" to block (from block \"rating\"). Block value is important for new tanks as well, since fewer hits will be missed, dodged, and parried."}

It is said the Deadmines' gold deposits once accounted for a third of Stormwind's treasure reserves. The mines also had an abundance of &lt;a href=\"Lumber%23Whitestone%20oak\"&gt;Whitestone oak&lt;/a&gt; lumber; it was used in the construction of some of the more important lattices and tools because of its resilience to heat and pressure. However, they were abandoned during the First War. During that time, Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; ventured into the perilous Deadmines on a quest to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Tome of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; but was captured by a band of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and held captive for 20 months. He was ultimately rescued and successful in his mission. It was also to the dungeons below the Deadmines that &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter &lt;a href=\"Griselda%20Blackhand\"&gt;Griselda&lt;/a&gt; fled with the ogre &lt;a href=\"Turok\"&gt;Turok&lt;/a&gt;. Both were slain by an orcish raid. Many &lt;a href=\"Ooze\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s inhabited the dungeons at that time, but they have not been encountered lately.\nAftermath.\nAmid the chaos of the First War, the mines were abandoned and later thought to be haunted, leaving them relatively untouched.\n&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Bramblebeard\"&gt;Captain Bramblebeard&lt;/a&gt; and his crew inhabited the cave for a time until the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a group of former laborers turned brigands - claimed the labyrinth as a base of operations and killed the captain and the crew. Their ambitious leader, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, was constructing a &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the mines with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBloodsail Buccaneer.\nDuring his time living there, Edwin cheated the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail&lt;/a&gt; pirate &lt;a href=\"Jerias%20Bloodvein\"&gt;Jerias Bloodvein&lt;/a&gt;. Edwin took not only the pirate's money, but also a woman Jerias had fancied. In retaliation, Jerias prepared to invade the Deadmines. Starting from &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;, he and his crew descended down into the mines, killing &lt;a href=\"Rhahk%27Zor\"&gt;Rhahk'Zor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sneed\"&gt;Sneed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gilnid\"&gt;Gilnid&lt;/a&gt;. All was according to plan until &lt;a href=\"James%20Blackridge\"&gt;James Blackridge&lt;/a&gt; went behind the captain's back to rescue his parents. The two fought, and ultimately James beheaded Jerias. While James, his friends, and his family escaped the mine, the fate of Jerias's crew is unknown.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFor a time, the &lt;a href=\"Miners%27%20League\"&gt;Miners' League&lt;/a&gt; was partly in charge of the Deadmines under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Thistlenettle\"&gt;Foreman Thistlenettle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wilder%20Thistlenettle\"&gt;Wilder Thistlenettle&lt;/a&gt;. However, one day the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; attacked them during their work and the mine tunnel collapsed. Only Wilder managed to escape, while the rest of the company died and began to roam as restless &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, Wilder sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to find his brother, or at least his badge to give him some peace of mind, which they brought back after he transformed into a &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;. He also asked them to find their union cards, in order to make sure their families get some resolution from this tragedy.\nThe Deadmines were later eventually raided again, this time by a group of Alliance soldiers sent by &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;. The group battled their way through &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Cove\"&gt;Ironclad Cove&lt;/a&gt; to the juggernaught, where they confronted Edwin VanCleef and his &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Blackguard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt;. They killed VanCleef and took his head as proof of the deed.\nCataclysm.\nUnknown to the Alliance, VanCleef had a young daughter. She was there on the juggernaught the day he was killed, and she saw the group decapitate her father. Five years later, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; had officially become the leader of the Defias and enacted a plan to burn &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; to the ground. She also put Edwin's original plan back into action, hiring new \"employees\" and continuing construction of the juggernaught. With all the chaos going on in Azeroth due to the Cataclysm, she had the best time to plot and avenge her father by assaulting &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dungeon was updated to reflect current events and gained a Heroic mode for level 85 players. There are Goblin Teleporters scattered throughout the instance, usable only when the boss of the particular room they are located in is killed. Once unlocked, they can send players to either &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Cove\"&gt;Ironclad Cove&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mast%20Room\"&gt;Mast Room&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Foundry\"&gt;Goblin Foundry&lt;/a&gt;. The Goblin Transporter located at the beginning room with the quest givers only sends players further into the instance; it does not function as a destination point.\nLegion.\nAfter the defeat of the Defias Brotherhood, the Deadmines fell silent. &lt;a href=\"%22Captain%22%20Klutz\"&gt;\"Captain\" Klutz&lt;/a&gt;, the last surviving hobgoblin, adopted the animals roaming around the mines as his own. All was quiet until activity was heard coming from inside of it.\nGeography.\nTo go here enter into the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Hideout\"&gt;Defias Hideout&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; in southwestern &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. You can also check out the videos down below.\nResources.\nFish\nDungeon denizens.\nBosses.\nThe following bosses are present in Deadmines:\nGuide.\nEntrance.\nYou start the instance off with several &lt;a href=\"Kobold%20Digger%20%28Deadmines%29\"&gt;Kobold Digger&lt;/a&gt;s and an &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Henchman\"&gt;Ogre Henchman&lt;/a&gt;. Use the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Cannon\"&gt;Defias Cannon&lt;/a&gt; to DPS them down, first kill the kobolds, then the ogre. Pull the next wave of mobs back to near the cannon, and use the same tactic. Go ahead and take down the two &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Ogre Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;s, you can use the previous tactic if need be. Now you will meet the first boss, &lt;a href=\"Glubtok\"&gt;Glubtok&lt;/a&gt;. For tactics and strategies on how to kill him, go to his page.\nTunnel till Mast Room.\nNow you will meet &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Overseer\"&gt;Goblin Overseer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Bunny\"&gt;Mine Bunnies&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you do not pull the patrolling Mine Bunnies. While in this tunnel, break the chain tied to the &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Monkey\"&gt;Mining Monkey&lt;/a&gt;s and if you do not do this, make sure you do not attack them. After you kill several goblins, you will meet an &lt;a href=\"Oaf%20Lackey\"&gt;Oaf Lackey&lt;/a&gt; and then two Oaf Lackeys, just dispose of them quickly. Now you will meet the second boss, &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Gearbreaker\"&gt;Helix Gearbreaker&lt;/a&gt;. For tactics and strategies on how to kill him, go to his page.\nTunnel till Goblin Foundry.\nNow you will meet &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Envoker\"&gt;Defias Envoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Miner\"&gt;Defias Miner&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Digger\"&gt;Defias Digger&lt;/a&gt;s. Make sure you CC one of these mobs when pulling a wave, preferably the Envoker. Be sure to interrupt the spell Holy Fire (cast by the Envoker). Now, if you want, a DPS can mount on the &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20Reaper\"&gt;Prototype Reaper&lt;/a&gt; and attack the mobs which are very simple. Now you will meet the third boss, &lt;a href=\"Foe%20Reaper%205000\"&gt;Foe Reaper 5000&lt;/a&gt;. For tactics and strategies on how to kill him, go to his page.\nTunnel till Ironclad Cove.\nNow you will meet &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Blood%20Wizard\"&gt;Defias Blood Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Enforcer\"&gt;Defias Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Shadowguard\"&gt;Defias Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt;s. Make sure you CC one of these mobs when pulling a wave. Be sure to enter those red circles (Rage Zones) to increase your damage given. Use the same tactic for these mobs. After you pass the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Clad%20Door\"&gt;Iron Clad Door&lt;/a&gt; you must be careful when crossing the wooden platform, as cannonballs will be being shot from the &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; onto the platform. The parrots on the platform are simple. Once you get onto the ship you will meet &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Pirate\"&gt;Defias Pirate&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Squallshaper\"&gt;Defias Squallshaper&lt;/a&gt;s. Be sure to interrupt the spell Seaswell (cast by the Squallshaper). Make sure you use the cannons situated on the ship. Now you will meet the fourth boss, &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Ripsnarl\"&gt;Admiral Ripsnarl&lt;/a&gt;, the fifth boss, &lt;a href=\"%22Captain%22%20Cookie\"&gt;\"Captain\" Cookie&lt;/a&gt; and sixth and last boss, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "13955", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13955", "title": "Deadmines (Classic)", "text": "The Deadmines are expansive, winding tunnels dug out under &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; and part of northwestern &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. It is the lowest-level &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;, and is populated by members of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Its entrance can be accessed in the town of &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; in southwestern &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, while its exit is located in the western part of the &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20Hills\"&gt;Dagger Hills&lt;/a&gt; near the ocean. The Deadmines is the center of the Defias operation, led by the ambitious &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, who is constructing a &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the mines with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. Many quests occur in and around the Deadmines.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the Deadmines were the greatest gold-production center in human lands. However, they were abandoned during the First War. During that time, Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; ventured into the perilous Deadmines on a quest to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Tome of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; but was captured by a band of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and held captive for 20 months. He was ultimately rescued and successful in his mission. It was also to the dungeons below the Deadmines to which &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand's&lt;/a&gt; daughter &lt;a href=\"Griselda%20Blackhand\"&gt;Griselda&lt;/a&gt; fled with the ogre &lt;a href=\"Turok\"&gt;Turok&lt;/a&gt;. Both were slain by an orcish raid. At that time, many &lt;a href=\"Ooze\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s inhabited the dungeons but have not been encountered lately.\nGeography.\nGuide.\nThe tunnels leading to the instance portal first contain the level 15-16 &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Digger\"&gt;Defias Digger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Henchman\"&gt;Defias Henchman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Conjurer\"&gt;Defias Conjurer&lt;/a&gt; mobs. Close to the instance portal, it will then have the level 16-17 &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Worker\"&gt;Defias Worker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Watchman\"&gt;Defias Watchman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Magician\"&gt;Defias Magician&lt;/a&gt; mobs. The undead portion of the Deadmines has the level 17-18 &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Miner\"&gt;Skeletal Miner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Dynamiter\"&gt;Undead Dynamiter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Excavator\"&gt;Undead Excavator&lt;/a&gt; mobs. Three mini-bosses, &lt;a href=\"Marisa%20du%27Paige\"&gt;Marisa du'Paige&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brainwashed%20Noble\"&gt;Brainwashed Noble&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Thistlenettle\"&gt;Foreman Thistlenettle&lt;/a&gt;, exist outside of the instance. Inside the instance, it is full of level 17-18 &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Miner\"&gt;Defias Miner&lt;/a&gt;s. It also has two kinds of level 17-18 Elites: &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Overseer\"&gt;Defias Overseer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Evoker\"&gt;Defias Evoker&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe first boss you encounter is the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhahk%27Zor\"&gt;Rhahk'Zor&lt;/a&gt;. He is a level-20 Elite, hits quite hard, and has high amounts of armor. He has two &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Watchman\"&gt;Defias Watchmen&lt;/a&gt; in his room.\nThe instance is populated with non-Elite Defias Strip Miners, and level-18 or -19 Elites. \nAfter fighting Rhahk'Zor, you will fight more &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Miner\"&gt;Defias Miner&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Overseer\"&gt;Defias Overseer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Evoker\"&gt;Defias Evoker&lt;/a&gt;s. You will then enter the Mast Room where &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; carvers are working on a mast for the &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sneed\"&gt;Sneed&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Shredder\"&gt;Shredder&lt;/a&gt; are the bosses here. He is level-20 elite. Sneed's Shredder is immune to burn, bleed, and concussion effects. After destroying his Shreeder, Sneed himself will jump out and attack you.\nImmediately after Sneed's Shredder, you will then fight level 18-19 &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Strip%20Miner\"&gt;Defias Strip Miner&lt;/a&gt;s. It also has two kinds of level 18-19 Elites: &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Taskmaster\"&gt;Defias Taskmaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Wizard\"&gt;Defias Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. You will then enter the Goblin Foundry, where the goblins are busy creating anchors and cannonballs for the Defias Dreadnaught. The &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Craftsman\"&gt;Goblin Craftsman&lt;/a&gt; can be found there, along with the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Engineer\"&gt;Goblin Engineer&lt;/a&gt; that can summon a &lt;a href=\"Remote-Controlled%20Golem\"&gt;Remote-Controlled Golem&lt;/a&gt;, which will fight alongside them. &lt;a href=\"Gilnid\"&gt;Gilnid&lt;/a&gt; is the boss here. He comes with 3 adds. Killing him opens the door to the next area.\nYou will fight more &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Strip%20Miner\"&gt;Defias Strip Miner&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Taskmaster\"&gt;Defias Taskmaster&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Wizard\"&gt;Defias Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, and eventually come to an alcove which contains &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Gunpowder\"&gt;Defias Gunpowder&lt;/a&gt;. This should be looted as it is required to open the door to the docks. A &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; can also attempt to pick the lock on the door.\nIf the party elects to blast open the door, you will alert &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Smite\"&gt;Mr. Smite&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; First Mate, who will send Defias Pirates to see what the disturbance was. If you pick the lock instead, you will not alert them.\nMr. Smite is the next boss. All adds should be cleared from the area (the ship ramp) before you engage him. There are two stealthed Elites (&lt;a href=\"Defias%20Blackguard\"&gt;Defias Blackguard&lt;/a&gt;s)) at the bottom of the ramp. These should be eliminated before taking Mr. Smite on. Mr. Smite will perform a &lt;a href=\"Warstomp\"&gt;Warstomp&lt;/a&gt; and stun the entire party at 75% and 50% health. This stun cannot be interrupted or avoided. A notable exception to this is if a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; has maxed out his &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Eye%20%28hunter%20talent%29\"&gt;Hawk Eye (hunter talent)&lt;/a&gt; talent, allowing him to snipe Mr. Smite at max range, allowing DPS to continue to do damage, and hopefully not pull aggro if the tank had built enough. Any adds still alive will continue to attack the party. Mr. Smite will run over to his chest, and take out a new, stronger weapon, and attack the party again.\nThe ship contains level-19 Elite &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shipbuilder\"&gt;Goblin Shipbuilder&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Pirate\"&gt;Defias Pirate&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Squallshaper\"&gt;Defias Squallshaper&lt;/a&gt;s. The boss at the top is &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Greenskin\"&gt;Captain Greenskin&lt;/a&gt;, the ship's captain. He comes with two adds.\nThe final boss is &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;. He is a level-20 elite. He is hiding in the cabin on top of the ship. Attacking him will bring his two guards out as well. He can stun, and will summon more adds as his life gets low. The other boss is optional. After killing VanCleef, you can jump down the other side of the ship, and find more Defias. You will also find &lt;a href=\"Cookie\"&gt;Cookie&lt;/a&gt;, a level-19 elite Murloc who is also the ship's cook. After leaving the ship, you can continue to go up the path into the tunnel, which leads to the instance exit.\nNotable characters.\nThe Deadmines are home to the notorious Defias Brotherhood, and several of its more important members are stationed here. and operate the mast room, the smelter presides over the goblin foundry, and the first mate guards the ship. patrols the ship itself, where himself rules from the ship's cabin.\nLoot.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Deadmines%20loot%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;The Deadmines loot (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: Cataclysm.\nIn \"\" Deadmines was completely revamped. With the Defias no longer an issue, a new boss and enemies will appear in this location. The dungeons level range was slightly adjusted to level range 15 - 21 and also added a &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; for level 85 players. \nPreviously at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202010\"&gt;BlizzCon 2010&lt;/a&gt;, it was stated that \"Edwin was back, and he's VanCleef-ier than ever...\" and that a &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; version of Deadmines would be added for high level players. \nSince the release, Edwin VanCleef did not return but was replaced by his &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; instead. However, in a build during the beta, the heroic guild achievement for Deadmines requires you kill &lt;a href=\"Cookie\"&gt;\"Captain\" Cookie&lt;/a&gt;. It appears as if after VanCleef's death, the murloc instituted a mutiny and took over."}

It\u2019s a fun and fairly easy instance, with very few surprising encounters. It is a learning ground for most new players on &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; dynamics and multiple &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; pulls.\nUpdated for &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3\"&gt;Patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt; changes to loot and elite mobs before the instance are now non-elite (normal).\nGroup and Level Guidance.\nIt's recommend that your &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt; be level 21 or higher, to ensure that his hits actually land. If your &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; is lower level, it\u2019s of less concern than any orange mobs getting to them.\nYou need at least one dedicated healer and one tank (&lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bear%20form\"&gt;bear form&lt;/a&gt;). Make sure your healer understands his role, and tries to conserve &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; for heals.\nEnemies.\nYou will almost exclusively encounter &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; mobs in this instance. One boss () is &lt;a href=\"mechanical\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"immune\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bleed\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; effects.\nQuests.\nAlliance Only\nThe quests are completed in a section of the Deadmines before the instance:\nGiven by Wilder Thistlenettle, a dwarf NPC inside an inn in the Dwarven district of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\n (&lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; Quest):\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; Specific quests:\nPreparation for the Instance.\n&lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s should carry &lt;a href=\"drinks\"&gt;drinks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s to replenish their mana. Be sure to have your &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s repaired prior to the instance run, and always keep &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;s for you and other party members (&lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s). It is essential to be prepared for this instance run as it is quite long, and there are no places to get weapons repaired, buy supplies, etc. You should also know that every time you kill a boss, like for instance, a patrol will spawn behind you, with 2-3 Elites.\nWalkthrough.\nYou should know where the entrance is, since you probably did the Defias Traitor escort quest. The entrance is in a house in the village of Moonbrook, in the Southwestern area of Westfall. Loc 42,73 (if you use a UI that shows locations).\nThe first 2 quests.\nIf your group doesn't feel like doing the first 2 quests, then go straight to chapter 2.\nWhen you enter the house in Moonbrook which leads you into a mine, your minimap will look like this:\nBefore entering the actual instance, you encounter miners, and some overseers, taskmasters and wizards. Just go carefully and do not pull more aggro from mobs than you can handle.\nGo towards the area where &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Thistlenettle\"&gt;Foreman Thistlenettle&lt;/a&gt; is and kill him, loot the badge off his corpse to complete the quest &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Brother.%20.%20.\"&gt;Oh Brother. . .&lt;/a&gt; and keep killing the skeletons / zombies in the area until everyone has 4 &lt;a href=\"Miners%27%20Union%20Card\"&gt;Miners' Union Card&lt;/a&gt; to complete the second quest: &lt;a href=\"Collecting%20Memories\"&gt;Collecting Memories&lt;/a&gt;. They drop fairly often. The spawn rate is a bit slow.\nHaving a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; track or detect Undead will help you spot the respawns.\nWhen you are done with these 2 quests, you can head towards the Instance Portal and zone in.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Red%20Silk%20Bandana\"&gt;Red Silk Bandana&lt;/a&gt; drops off any of the Pirates. You'll find more than enough through the instance for each group member with the quest.\nTo Rhahk'Zor.\nFrom the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Rhahk'Zor|Boss&lt;/a&gt;, you will have to kill miners. They aren't elite and they die easily. There will also be a few Defias Overseers, which are elite, but not so tough. Also you will run into a couple of Defias Wizards. \nThe main danger to a group for the instance are runners. Try to always pull mobs back to your group; don't rush into them, so that if they run, you have room to finish them off before they bring friends. Best is to have a class with some kind of snare though, such as a rogue with Crippling Poison, shaman with Frost Shock, warrior Hamstring, etc. Make sure you designate a person who will be responsible for either snaring or have an instant damage spell available to finish them off. High DPS characters can also quickly finish off the runner if possible. Also, it will be good to have a 22+ paladin in your party, his Judgement of Justice will prevent runners from fleeing.\nYou will encounter &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Rhahk'Zor|Boss&lt;/a&gt;, your first mini-boss. He is not that tough, as you can pull him solo, if you wait for him to be far away from his 2 guards (two Defias Watchman), aka close to you. He hits reasonably hard but slow, has a lot of health, as any boss should have. This fight should be easy. Rhahk'Zor almost always drops a &lt;a href=\"Rockslicer\"&gt;Rockslicer&lt;/a&gt;, and rarely &lt;a href=\"Rhahk%27Zor%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Rhahk'Zor's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; instead. \nNote: Every time you kill a boss (up to &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Gilnid|Boss&lt;/a&gt;), the door he was guarding opens up, and a patrol respawns behind you and heads down towards you. After every boss fight this will happen, and the further you go down in the Deadmines, the bigger the patrols will be. So be on your guard and look behind you every now and then. The patrols are a mix of melee and spellcasters. Try to kill the spellcaster first, as their fireballs hurt a lot. It is best to kill these off as you go to clear the path for characters that die to run back.\nTo Sneed.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Rhahk'Zor|Boss&lt;/a&gt; dies, the big door behind him opens, kill the two Defias Watchmen (they use ranged weapons until they enter melee) and go through the now-opened door, you'll see the path fork off to the left and right. To the left is where &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Miner Johnson|Rare Spawn&lt;/a&gt; spawns, but only once every 5 instance runs or so. It just takes 2 minutes to check if he's up, and most of the time he drops a blue item: &lt;a href=\"Gold-Plated%20Buckler\"&gt;Gold-Plated Buckler&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Miner%27s%20Cape\"&gt;Miner's Cape&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo the right are goblins and further down the big goblin, aka &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Sneed|Boss&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Sneed%27s%20Shredder\"&gt;Shredder&lt;/a&gt;. I suggest clearing the room where Sneed roams about as much as possible before you pull Sneed, you don't want to get adds during this fight. Pull the Goblins back or through the door to fight them. The Goblins have an annoying \u201cknockdown\u201d with their thrown axes. Other than that, they are elite, with plenty of health.\nIf you have a Paladin with the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Test%20of%20Righteousness%20%283%29\"&gt;The Test of Righteousness (3)&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Goblins should drop the &lt;a href=\"Whitestone%20Oak%20Lumber\"&gt;Whitestone Oak Lumber&lt;/a&gt; piece the Paladin needs.\nSneed is slightly harder than the ogre, because you actually have to kill him twice. First destroy his Shredder (which he occupies) and then kill him. Make sure the party is aware of this and do not run off the moment the Shredder dies. The Shredder can be controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Universal%20Remote\"&gt;Gnomish Universal Remote&lt;/a&gt;. Remember also that the Shredder is mechanical and is immune to many effects. Take a moment to look for a chest, either near the door that opened, on the \u201chill\u201d in the middle of the room, or in the back corner as you entered.\nDon't forget to loot the &lt;a href=\"Gnoam%20Sprecklesprocket\"&gt;Gnoam Sprecklesprocket&lt;/a&gt; from the Shredder's corpse. &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Assault\"&gt;Underground Assault&lt;/a&gt; completed! Sneed drops: &lt;a href=\"Taskmaster%20Axe\"&gt;Taskmaster Axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buzzer%20Blade\"&gt;Buzzer Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buzz%20Saw\"&gt;Buzz Saw&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gold-Flecked%20Gloves\"&gt;Gold-Flecked Gloves&lt;/a&gt;.\nGilnid.\nRemember the patrol that spawns when &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Sneed|Boss&lt;/a&gt; dies, then move down the corridor and clear up to &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Gilnid|Boss&lt;/a&gt;'s room, once there, clear his room and save him for last. Have the lower level characters and casters hug the left wall at all times to prevent aggro from the center of the room. Make sure your tank does not charge up to them and aggro more, but focus your ranged attacks to take them down. Some of the goblins (Engineers) here are equipped with guns and send in Mechanical pets to combat you, and others (Craftsmen) have a \"Melt Ore\" ability that causes 140 Fire damage and lowers movement speed for 20 seconds (any ability that removes movement speed debuffs will remove this). The pets are immune to many effects, and can't be looted, so they are extremely annoying. Additionally, if the pet is killed and the goblin is still fighting, he can and will summon another; concentrate on killing the goblin.\nThis room contains smelters that allow miners to smelt their ore into bars, as well as boxes filled with lower level engineering reagents.\nGilnid isn't hard either, the only difference with previous bosses is that there is one goblin that always stays too close to him to be pulled solo. So you have several options: Kill the little goblin fast and then . Only your tank should take on Gilnid from the start. Or you could polymorph the goblin during the whole fight, provided you have a mage. Take time to check under the ramp leading down to the room for a chest. There is an insignificant goblin guarding it, although it is a possible add during the Gilnid fight.\nIf you are lucky, will drop &lt;a href=\"Lavishly%20Jeweled%20Ring\"&gt;Lavishly Jeweled Ring&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Smelting%20Pants\"&gt;Smelting Pants&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cannon and Mr. Smite.\nRemember the patrol that spawns when dies, then move on. Clear up to the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Gunpowder\"&gt;Defias Gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; as shown on the map above, and have someone loot it, but be aware that looting it causes a Defias Taskmaster to spawn in the corridor. Then clear up to the next gate. The person who looted the gunpowder will have to activate the cannon in this room, which will blow up the gate. The gate can also be picked by a rogue (thus avoiding the mobs that would have otherwise come to greet you) or blown up with Seaforium charges, if you have an &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt; in your party.\nAs the gate explodes, &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mr. Smite|Boss&lt;/a&gt; starts shouting orders, and mobs will rush for you (usually two Pirates with a parrot). Once the attack is dealt with, enter the docks and fight your way up the boardwalk. \nShort Cut: It is possible to jump down to the side of the boardwalk, fight off the ship builders, and swim straight round to Smite's island. However, this gives you the risk of accidentally pulling him when others aren't ready, so be careful!\nWarning: This is where things get serious, so make sure your group is sticking together and that nobody rushes toward the ramp going up to the ship or the dummy chest at the bottom of the ramp.\nYour group must be aware that as soon as you get close to that ramp, two assassins appear and attack your group, and as soon as they do so, rushes down from the ship and engages you as well.\nThe trick to this fight is that &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mr. Smite|Boss&lt;/a&gt; actually doesn't hurt that much as long as his hit points are high. So it's best to deal with the two assassins while your tank keeps &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mr. Smite|Boss&lt;/a&gt; busy. Once both assassins are either dead or under control (polymorphed), focus on &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mr. Smite|Boss&lt;/a&gt;. Also, try to carry the fight away from the ramp, so that every time &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mr. Smite|Boss&lt;/a&gt; stuns your group and goes to his chest to find a new weapon, you have some time to recover while he runs back to you. This is an important reason that you should kill the two assassins first. \nSave up some mana/rage for the end of the fight, because &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mr. Smite|Boss&lt;/a&gt; increases in damage output twice during the fight, and hits really hard when he is low on HP.\nWith luck, &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mr. Smite|Boss&lt;/a&gt; can drop the best two-hand weapon you can get at this level &lt;a href=\"Smite%27s%20Mighty%20Hammer\"&gt;Smite's Mighty Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, a nice &lt;a href=\"Thief%27s%20Blade\"&gt;Thief's Blade&lt;/a&gt; or a one-hand Axe &lt;a href=\"Smite%27s%20Reaver\"&gt;Smite's Reaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pirate Ship and Cookie.\nGo up the ramp, kill a few pirates and go to the left first. You'll find &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Cookie|Murloc Boss&lt;/a&gt; ; he's easy as long as he does not run off and bring adds. After an almost comical fight, he can drop a great wand &lt;a href=\"Cookie%27s%20Stirring%20Rod\"&gt;Cookie's Stirring Rod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cookie%27s%20Tenderizer\"&gt;Cookie's Tenderizer&lt;/a&gt; or the coveted &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Carrier%20%28Siamese%29\"&gt;Cat Carrier (Siamese)&lt;/a&gt;. After Cookie has been taken care of, go backwards and this time go right, to the other side of the ship.\nThe mobs on the ship are quite close together and are numerous. Beware of runners and pull carefully.\nIt is very easy to aggro and cause a party wipe. Try to have someone keep a watch on for early warning if he does aggro.\nIf aggros on your puller, have everyone jump off the side of the ship into the water, and swim to the right-hand side of the entry to the deck-area. You might just survive or have a rezzer survive to resurrect the dead.\nSo if you want to save time, let one puller carefully take mobs down to your group. Once the path is clear and the only thing left on the top deck is and his guards, your group can move up and engage him.\nCouple of chest locations:\nAround the perimeter of the cave where the ship is located, additional Pirates and goblins are located. There is no need to kill them, except if you want or need the XP and possible drops.\nThere is a little trick when you pull too many mobs. Almost at the 2nd highest point of the ship, there is a giant water wheel. If somebody jumps on this, the mobs will evade everything. The good point is that you can save a wipe this way. The bad point is that sometimes the mobs will still hit your characters and you won't be able to hit them. This technique is often seen as an exploit; however it has been in-game since beta and never been changed, so most people say it's legal.\nCaptain Greenskin.\n isn't that hard himself, the problem is that he has 2 guards, but that should not be a problem for your group; now that you managed &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mr. Smite|Boss&lt;/a&gt;, you know how to deal with such encounters. Just do not move too close to \u2019s cabin.\nThe recommended tactic here is to tank and polymorph the caster. Kill first, then the other melee mob, and then the sheeped caster. Sapping the bodyguards also works.\n can make casters happy with a very nice blue staff &lt;a href=\"Emberstone%20Staff\"&gt;Emberstone Staff&lt;/a&gt;, and Hunters with a Harpoon &lt;a href=\"Impaling%20Harpoon\"&gt;Impaling Harpoon&lt;/a&gt;. He can also drop the belt of the Defias set &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Defias%20Belt\"&gt;Blackened Defias Belt&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: it is not uncommon to pull at an inopportune moment and wipe. To prevent this, if you pull without meaning to, you can jump on the boat's waterwheel. While on the wheel, and any mobs who followed him will evade, and eventually reset. At this point, your party can jump down from the wheel, resurrect the dead, and proceed once more. It should be noted that low level characters may need to stand at the far outside edge of the wheel so that the pirates no longer \"see\" them, at which point they will stop evading and will reset. In addition, the non-elite parrot pets occasionally cross onto the wheel, but these can be dealt with easily.\nEdwin VanCleef.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef|Final Boss&lt;/a&gt; is waiting for you in his cabin, looking all by himself, but actually as soon as you aggro him, two guards will come out of the shadows and attack you. There is a trick to this fight: Kill him first, and don't try to kill the guards; just polymorph them if you can.\nThe thing is, if you kill both of &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef|Final Boss&lt;/a&gt;'s guards, he spawns two more of them. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef|Final Boss&lt;/a&gt; (at 50% health) spawns two additional guards for up to a total of four guards.\nKill him fast, and he will be an easy fight. After &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef|Final Boss&lt;/a&gt; is dead, deal with the guards and you will be safe.\nAn alternative strategy, if you do not have enough DPS for a fast kill, is to have your tank on &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef|Final Boss&lt;/a&gt;, while the rest of the group kills the first two guards. Then assist with &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef|Final Boss&lt;/a&gt;. If he spawns a second set of guards, kill &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef|Final Boss&lt;/a&gt; before the guards. A good tank is essential in defeating &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef|Final Boss&lt;/a&gt;.\nDon't forget to loot his &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20VanCleef\"&gt;Head of VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, which is needed to finish the main quest of the Deadmines. Also loot &lt;a href=\"An%20Unsent%20Letter\"&gt;An Unsent Letter&lt;/a&gt;, which begins a quest line for your next instance: &lt;a href=\"The%20Stockade\"&gt;The Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeing the big boss of the Pirates, &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef|Final Boss&lt;/a&gt; has a large loot pool, and can drop one of four blue items including the chestpiece to the Defias Leather set. (See below)\nIf you think that was your last blue item of the day, well that's incorrect, because now is the time to go and turn in your quests! Your group can either use hearthstone or clear the path towards the exit (see map). The mines exit on the southern end of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, near the Lighthouse.\nSource.\nOriginally based upon &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-pro.com/node/691\"&gt;Wow-Pro.com Guides&lt;/a&gt;"}

It was, a score of years ago, considered a part of the Redridge Mountains. A foul wind constantly blows across the decimated canyon, giving it its name.\nDeadwind Pass is a stretch of land devoid of life, where the trees are reduced to withered husks, the marshes are a desiccated waste, and the sky turned a sepulchral gray with the sun covered in a burial shroud. At its center stands the imposing and enigmatic tower known as &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, once the residence of the last &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the tower lies abandoned and cloaked in dark enchantments since the death of its master. Deadwind Pass is now home to various haunting creatures, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, malevolent spirits, and filthy beasts, that infest the region due to the curse left by Medivh upon his death.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nThe crater where Karazhan is built was formed by a magical arcane explosion long ago, and &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s personal theory is that the explosion happened specifically because he would one day come to live there. In fact, it was caused by &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;, to whom was given &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nMillennia ago, the Dark Titan commanded her to reap the souls of Azeroth's rebellious denizens, starting with the area that would later be known as Deadwind Pass. No one knows what the land was called before the coming of Sataiel. Most would rather not think of it at all. It is the burial site of countless trolls who were methodically slain, their spirits consumed by Ulthalesh, fueling its power to murder more. The scythe would feed and feed until all of the inhabitants were dead. While Sataiel was dispatched to break the will of Azeroth's denizens, it was not enough simply to kill them; bodies could be buried and forgotten. She decided to strike at the very heart of the land so that no new life could take up residence. With Ulthalesh, she would see that Deadwind Pass stood as a monument to the Legion's wrath.\nAfter she used Ulthalesh to consume the souls of all living creatures in Deadwind Pass, she turned the blade on the land itself, draining it of life. The trees were reduced to withered husks. The marshes became a desiccated waste. The sky turned a sepulchral gray, the sun covered in a burial shroud. Sataiel relished the despair of the scythe's new prisoners as they unwittingly assisted in the annihilation of their home. The destruction was absolute. Even Azeroth's slumbering world-soul quailed. While Sataiel methodically drained all life from the hapless inhabitants of Deadwind Pass, turning the land into a tomb, she created a potent magical nexus in the process, which caused the explosion that formed the crater.\nAfter being corrupted by the whispers of Ulthalesh, Sataiel guarded the weapon and hoarded the magical nexus they had created for centuries. When Sargeras discovered her deception, he manipulated the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scavell\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt; with a vision of a dangerous entity lurking in Deadwind Pass, which led him the mage to confront and turn the scythe against her, sending her soul to join those of her victims.\nThe Last Guardian.\nAround 600 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; was built in secret by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"%3AAluneth\"&gt;:Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; after she grew increasingly paranoid and hostile to her fellow members in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a result of the dark influence that the spirit of Sargeras was exerting over her. The tower acted both as a refuge from the council and as a conduit for the potent &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s in the region, through which Aegwynn could siphon power as needed. Aegwynn's son Medivh eventually took up residence in Karazhan. In time a small &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Cellar\"&gt;human village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;its church&lt;/a&gt; flourished around the tower, but both ended up abandoned at some point.\nAs the structure was built atop a nexus of potent ley lines, the energies that coursed through Karazhan sometimes warped reality in the region. In pursuit of his studies, &lt;a href=\"Arrexis\"&gt;Arrexis&lt;/a&gt; gathered his apprentice magi and came to Deadwind Pass to study the tower and its powers, experimenting with their warding magics outside Karazhan, and attempting to neutralize the tower's strange powers. From &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Kirin%20Tor%20Camp\"&gt;his camp&lt;/a&gt;, he performed research on Karazhan and the way it bends reality in the area. He later found a way to stop the warping from happening within special wards, but while bringing the wards up, reality was weakened. Medivh, who was possessed by Sargeras, came to the camp and encouraged Arrexis to try his ritual on demonic realms, which caught the attention of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balaadur\"&gt;Balaadur&lt;/a&gt;. The catastrophe ended with Arrexis and all of his apprentices dead, Balaadur taking Ebonchill, &lt;a href=\"Daio%20the%20Decrepit\"&gt;Daio&lt;/a&gt; exiled from the Kirin Tor for his part in it, and all records of Arrexis destroyed and stripped from Kirin Tor records so that no one would repeat his mistakes.\nOnce, &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of a group of charlatan merchants who sold counterfeit artifacts. From his base at &lt;a href=\"Ariden%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Ariden's Camp&lt;/a&gt; in Deadwind Pass, he and his group attempted to cheat Medivh by selling those fraudulent items. Unfortunately for the group, Medivh was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; at the time. In revenge for their trickery, Medivh cursed the group to forever hunt real magical artifacts and bring them back to him at &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. It is not known exactly what curse Medivh placed on them, or if they are undead or not, but the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; have haunted the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; since that moment.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; progressed, Medivh fought against Sargeras' control. The raging conflict within him finally drove the wizard irrevocably insane, until his childhood friend, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, aided Medivh's young apprentice, Khadgar, stormed Karazhan and decapitated their former comrade. The death of Medivh caused &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy being unleashed from his body, turning the surrounding land into a dangerous, thorny blight. Since that day, a terrible curse has pervaded both the tower and the lands around it - casting a dark pall over Deadwind Pass. A beautiful part of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;, was also corrupted in the process, transforming it into the area known nowadays as &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn recent years, &lt;a href=\"nobles%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;nobles of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; ventured into Deadwind Pass to investigate the blight that had settled over the region. None who entered the dark tower ever emerged.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20ogres\"&gt;Deadwind ogres&lt;/a&gt; came to settle in the area, setting up their &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mound\"&gt;mounds&lt;/a&gt; and camps in the area known as the &lt;a href=\"Vice\"&gt;Vice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt;, a secret sect founded by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, was assigned decades ago to keep an eye on &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and to spy on the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Although Medivh was killed long ago, and Karazhan somehow sealed itself off to the outside world, the Violet Eye remained to study the tower and the effects of its magic disturbances on Deadwind Pass. As Karazhan is a portal into &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, a beacon shining into other worlds, it's the Violet Eye's mission to ensure that the tower doesn't fall into the wrong hands, or the possible repercussions would be unthinkable.\nAt some point after the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Alturus\"&gt;Archmage Alturus&lt;/a&gt; asked for the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s' help to discover the reason for the ghosts around Karazhan, precisely some of their essences to study them. He also sent them with a scrying crystal to obtain an imprint of Karazhan's energy, and discovered that the haunted tower was no longer emanating all manner of arcane currents, but instead, became a huge energy vacuum with a very faint &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic echo.\nWhen the tower was reopened, the adventurers of the Alliance and Horde entered and defeated &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt;, preventing the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; from taking over the tower on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn the wake of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s reemergence and his &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;shattering&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nalice\"&gt;Nalice&lt;/a&gt; hid with her &lt;a href=\"Blackwyrm%20Cult\"&gt;Blackwyrm Cult&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Cellar\"&gt;Master's Cellar&lt;/a&gt; beneath Deadwind Pass, researching arcane secrets buried beneath the foundation to perform some sort of arcane experiments. The place was later infiltrated by the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who killed Nalice on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nRight after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was hovering over Deadwind Pass and more particularly &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. The entire city had been moved by a giant &lt;a href=\"teleportation\"&gt;teleportation&lt;/a&gt; spell, but not before Khadgar activated the defense mechanisms of Karazhan to repel the invading demons. However, the Legion was still successful in taking control of the tower. The &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; and a few Kirin Tor mages could be seen fighting the demons outside Karazhan, in the town ruins. The Legion intended to use the tower as a conduit to each and every one of the countless worlds that they had consumed during their Burning Crusade, but Medivh severed the connection between Karazhan and those worlds.\nDrawn by the power of the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; followed &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; to Deadwind Pass, and later attacked the adventurer who sought to recover the artifact.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in his reports that the agents he sent to meet the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Shade of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; had seen Nightbane appear upon their arrival at the tower, at least, that's what their charred reports say.\nGeography.\nThis region is barren and devoid of any useful resources - herbs do not grow here, and there are no precious metals to be found. The only wildlife to speak of are carrion birds. The Redridge Range stretches from the region of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to Deadwind Pass.\nIf merely passing through, the only mobs travelers usually come across are &lt;a href=\"vulture\"&gt;vulture&lt;/a&gt;s and giant &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, all of which are aggressive and will attack on sight. As one goes further south, they will come across a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20ogres\"&gt;Deadwind ogres&lt;/a&gt; living around the bend in the road leading to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; aggressive &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s haunt the remains of the town at the base of Karazhan, far south down the road. Their presence also extends deep underground. There are open cellar entrances in two of the ruined houses which will lead to catacombs and caverns filled with these ghosts.\nThe raid dungeon &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; can be found in this zone, a level 70 10-man instance in \"\". Other than that, there are no dungeons of any kind and no battlegrounds here. In addition, there are no travel hubs - players will have to rely on the nearby towns of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) and &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; (Horde) to access this zone.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D17\"&gt;Topographic map of Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Alturus\"&gt;Archmage Alturus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Leryda\"&gt;Archmage Leryda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Darius\"&gt;Apprentice Darius&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; are the only friendly characters that have dared to brave the pass. They have come on behalf of Dalaran to investigate the disturbances coming from Karazhan and are enlisting adventurers to delve deep into the tower's mysteries.\nIn the RPG.\nThis land is dead. The remaining trees are leafless and petrified, leeched of life by the tower's foul magic. The wind smells foul and dead, and the lightning storms are of concern to travelers carrying metal weapons. Undead and demons move over the land, refusing to allow it any chance of healing itself. In clear view of the road, scarecrow-like totems hang from the trees, a warning to remain on the path. The weather is in one of two states: threatening to storm or stormy. The main pass is through the middle of the region, and one must travel to the south to reach the cursed Ivory Tower of Karazhan.

It was, a score of years ago, considered a part of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ivory Tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, once the dark wizard &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s seat of power, stands in the center of this jagged region and leaks evil magic into the land. The trees are petrified and leafless, and a terrible wind keens through the canyon. Ogres, demons, undead and a few human gypsies roam the interior. Deadwind Pass connects Duskwood and the Swamp of Sorrows, and travelers are advised to move quickly \u2014 whispers tell that a new force has claimed the Ivory Tower, and that the ogres and demons are under its sway.\nHistory.\nDeadwind Pass is another region of the continent of Azeroth dominated by evil magic. It sits in the very middle of Azeroth and connects &lt;a href=\"Duskwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. The Ivory Spire of Karazhan, once the seat of Medivh, still stands. It leaks corrupting magic, destroying the region\u2019s flora. A foul wind constantly blows across the decimated canyon, giving it the name Deadwind. Although Deadwind does have a handful of inhabitants, few run across them.\nThe fates of many people in Azeroth and the surrounding continents were forged here. Medivh made his home here and planned the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;'s creation and opening. His evil is felt in this region more strongly than anywhere else, the land corrupted with the foul taint of his magic. Currently, the pass has little significance. People move through quickly, wishing to avoid ogres, undead and demons. It is rumored that the attacking monsters do not kill those they capture, but take them back to the tower.\nThe tower's builders have been lost to time, but surely they were great and terrible people to have built such a foreboding and yet magnificent structure. Medivh was sought out and killed during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, and the tower has since been apparently abandoned, though unknown dangers yet lurk within.\nIt is unclear who murdered all the villagers in the southern part of the chasm. It may have been &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; or some force he summoned. Another theory states that it was the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Riders\"&gt;Black Riders&lt;/a&gt;, who have a hunger for death and seek to obtain the dangerous &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; for their own purposes.\nThis area might have been &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; from WC1.\nGeography.\nThis land is dead. The remaining trees are leafless and petrified, leeched of life by the tower's foul magic. The wind smells foul and dead, and the lightning storms are of concern to travelers carrying metal weapons. Undead and demons move over the land, refusing to allow it any chance of healing itself. In clear view of the road, scarecrow-like totems hang from the trees, a warning to remain on the path. The weather is in one of two states: threatening to storm or stormy. The main pass is through the middle of the region, and one must travel to the south to reach the cursed Ivory Tower of Karazhan. Few people wish to travel there, and few ever return. The few who have returned never reached the tower; attacking ogres forced them back before they came within sight of it. Besides the ogres, travelers must watch for harpies in the canyons.\nAlthough Deadwind does have a handful of inhabitants, few are likely to run across them if they are just passing through. The Deadwind ogres comprise most of the population. The ogres are dedicated to cleansing the region of all interlopers, lead by a \"master\". These ogres dress in foul rags and carry crude, rough weapons. They are the biggest, most obvious threat to travelers and why most caravans and groups go heavily guarded.\nThe humans of the region are travelers, carrying their homes on their backs and trying to stay one step ahead of the ogres, demons and undead that haunt them. They do not recognize the Alliance or even ask its aid. They simply move from place to place, fighting for their lives, stolidly proclaiming Deadwind Pass as their home.\nThis region is barren and devoid of any useful resources - herbs do not grow here, and there are no precious metals to be found. The only wildlife to speak of are carrion birds.\nThere are no dungeons of any kind and no battlegrounds here. In addition, there are no travel hubs - players will have to rely on the nearby towns of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) and &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; (Horde) to access this zone.\nIn the northern part of the region is an abandoned camp that is labeled \"&lt;a href=\"Ariden%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Ariden's Camp&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIf merely passing through, the only mobs travelers usually come across are &lt;a href=\"vulture\"&gt;vulture&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;-like sprites, all of which are aggressive and will attack on sight. As one goes further south, though, one will come across a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Ogre\"&gt;Deadwind Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s living around the bend in the road leading to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. They live both along the roadside and within the nearby caves. In addition to the ogres and vultures, many &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; aggressive &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s haunt the remains of the town at the base of Karazhan, far south down the road. Their presence also extends deep underground. There are open cellar entrances in two of the ruined houses which will lead to catacombs and caverns filled with these ghosts.\nOf course, there is the tower of Karazhan itself, which dominates the southern area of the pass.\nDeadwind Pass is also known to be the origin point of a mysterious regime known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;, who have been sighted in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; when they slaughtered a family of farmers in search of the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Redridge Range stretches from the zone of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the zone of Deadwind Pass. \nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D17\"&gt;Topographic map of Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;"}

It teleports you to whichever settlement or city you have previously designated as your home.\nNotes.\nAstral Recall works as a second Hearthstone and will teleport you to wherever your Hearthstone would take you. It is not possible to set up a separate home for Astral Recall, meaning the main use of this spell is to allow you to return home more frequently. Unlike your Hearthstone it cannot be used in combat, but being a spell it benefits from &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; and will thus be slightly faster than using a Hearthstone if you have any haste on your gear. You can also use temporary haste bonuses like &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berserking\"&gt;Berserking&lt;/a&gt; to further reduce the casting time. Coupled with &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Spiritwalker's Grace&lt;/a&gt;, Astral Recall can be cast by Restoration shamans while moving or falling. Note that you still need to be out of combat to use Astral Recall, severely limiting its usefulness for escaping from bad situations."}

It is the largest settlement in the region. It lies on an island within a lake, straddling the main road through Ashenvale, connected to the mainland with only a pair of bridges.\nAstranaar offers a wide range of services, as well as a flight master, to &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players. It also has an unnamed inn and a graveyard.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;Valstann Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; was buried here by his &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf%20Grave\"&gt;grave&lt;/a&gt; is still visible in the cemetery by the lake.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAstranaar became the most important quest hub for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in Ashenvale. &lt;a href=\"Raene%20Wolfrunner\"&gt;Raene Wolfrunner&lt;/a&gt; sent players to cull the &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur\"&gt;Thistlefur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s north of the town, fearing that they could eventually find the courage to attack Astranaar directly.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded Ashenvale Forest, setting up a camp at &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Hellscream's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. From there, a group called &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Hellions\"&gt;Hellscream's Hellions&lt;/a&gt; attacked Astranaar with &lt;a href=\"wind%20rider\"&gt;wind rider&lt;/a&gt;s. Horde adventurers also bomb the town, setting it on fire in a victorious assault.\nAlliance heroes would douse the fires and use &lt;a href=\"Astranaar%20Thrower\"&gt;glaive throwers&lt;/a&gt; to slay the wind riders. Because of the Horde presence in the region, taxi services are offered to &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Luara\"&gt;Sentinel Luara&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s) and &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Song\"&gt;Forest Song&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Palanaar\"&gt;Vindicator Palanaar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Palanaar%27s%20Elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt;).\nDuring this period, both &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; arrived to live in the town.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe night elves of Astranaar sent several &lt;a href=\"Astranaar%20Caravan%20Leader\"&gt;caravans&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; during the for the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during their &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; in a surprise strike. Rogues attacked several elvish outposts throughout the region. The &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lorash%20Sunbeam\"&gt;Lorash Sunbeam&lt;/a&gt; led an assault against Astranaar itself, killing several of the guards and inhabitants, including sentinel &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Alennah%20Starsong\"&gt;Captain Alennah Starsong&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the town suffered heavy losses, including civilians, in the end it was able to rout and slay the rogues. The counterattack was led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Captain Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Darnassian City Guard&lt;/a&gt;. The fallen were honored by the City Guard and their &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s released.\nHuntresses from Astranaar joined the main night elven army. After losing the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the elvish forces retreated to Astranaar to make a stand there. There, they laid a trap to the Horde, propping up elvish corpses to make it seem as if the whole town had been slaughtered by rogues. When &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Highlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and his forces had occupied the abandoned town, Malfurion and his forces trapped Saurfang in an inn, collapsing it on the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;. Saurfang was saved by the timely appearance of Sylvanas, forcing the elves to retreat towards &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde took control of the town but eventually left for the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance eventually recaptured the town after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Thenysil\"&gt;Sentinel Thenysil&lt;/a&gt; assumed command of the remaining Sentinels in Ashenvale from the town. Horde champions were sent to infiltrate the town and take her down. A Horde army led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tarkan\"&gt;Captain Tarkan&lt;/a&gt; also marched on Astranaar.\nAfter the Alliance took it back, they fortified their holding.\nIn the RPG.\nAstrannar, with a population of 4000, is the largest town in Ashenvale located in its southwest. The road from the town splits in four major directions; northwest toward &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, northeast toward &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, southeast in the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and directly east toward &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The city is led by &lt;a href=\"Raene%20Wolfrunner\"&gt;Raene Wolfrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who organizes the defense against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the corrupted &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. It is an ancient settlement, and many families \u2014 even some specific elves \u2014 have lived in the city for generations."}

Extending out from the center of the city into &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the harbor houses the majority of Suramar's waterborne vessels. In addition to the gondolas which serve as a major method of transport throughout the city, Astravar Harbor is notably home to numerous larger pleasure boats, the property of the city's higher social classes.\nThe harbor mainly consists of a large dome enclosing a series of docks and jetties and, due to its size, is capable of accommodating a large number of boats of different sizes. There are two levels to Astravar Harbor: the very lower story on the waterfront where boats dock, and an upper floor rising to the dome's ceiling. The passage between the two floors is attained via a series of arcane transporters. The entire harbor lies on top of the great bridge which extends out through Astravar further into the bay, eventually ending with the massive &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of Suramar's Grand Magistrix and home to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nAstravar Harbor has been substantially involved in the recent turmoil which has gripped the city in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival, and has had the attention of both &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebellion directed upon it as a result of its strategic value.\nHistory.\nUnder the shield.\nThough it is unclear when exactly Astravar Harbor was constructed, prior to the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the raising of Suramar's shield the city was landlocked in the continent of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Old Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The harbor's principal purpose was the housing of the city's boats, which consisted of gondolas and larger pleasure or transport boats. The harbor has never been frequented by any ships or vessels larger than pleasure boats; the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; do not use any large vessels as the shield which protected the city for over 10,000 years cut off access to all waterways outside &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuramar at war.\nWith the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the raising of Suramar's shield, and the eventual agreement reached between &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, the city of Suramar was plunged into conflict. A rebellion, led by &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, began to grow in strength and launched frequent attacks throughout the city aimed at toppling the Grand Magistrix and expelling the Legion. As one of the city's key features, Astravar Harbor became a target for the dissident forces. Notably, Nightfallen elements carried out arson attacks using arcflame in which many of the harbor's pleasure boats were set on fire.\nAs the insurrection grew in strength and Suramar began to see further conflict, Grand Magistrix Elisande continued to take more drastic and controversial actions. Further strengthening her ties with the Burning Legion, her forces began to ship detained nightborne citizens en masse to Legion bases outside Suramar, their souls to be used in the demons' rituals. Astravar rapidly became the central base from which captured nightborne were placed on boats and deported. As such, the harbor was heavily occupied by Legion and &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; forces, though many Duskwatch subsequently deserted their posts to defect to the rebellion, horrified by Elisande's actions. The upper level of the center building was taken by &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;The Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;."}

As punishment, she was transformed into living stone. Only the retrieval of her gemstone heart could end the curse.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; happened upon the statue in the caverns of &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The statue's magic created an impassable barrier, and the voice of Aszune spoke in Thrall's mind. The imprisoned spirit told him that she would not allow passage to the Oracle's domicile until her &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Aszune\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; was returned to her.\nThrall found the heart in the possession of a &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; who was under attack and nearly killed by &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; that were after its treasure. Thrall retrieved the dragon's magical amulet and gave it to Aszune. With this act, he ended the curse, allowing her spirit rest, and the barrier that denied him access to the Oracle was lowered.\nThe &lt;a href=\"essence%20of%20Aszune\"&gt;essence of Aszune&lt;/a&gt;'s heart had come, through unknown means, into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; (after the city was destroyed too, it seems). They locked it away in the dungeons beneath the city, the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where it was eventually found by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Aszune\"&gt;Pillars of Aszune&lt;/a&gt; is a series of arcs on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; that lead to the open sea. When &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; was fighting off the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; forces, her runner got through the Pillars of Aszune to reach &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The name of the pillars might imply that Aszune lived before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and was rather famous. It might also refer to the region of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, not far from them."}

When the Dark Titan, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, came to Argus and offered the eredar to join his cause in exchange for unlimited knowledge and power, Archimonde and Kil'jaeden readily agreed, but Velen - who possessed the gift of future-seeing that the others lacked - saw the truth behind Sargeras' offer, and how he intended to lay waste to the known universe.\nPraying for guidance, Velen's pleas were answered by the naaru known as &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;. K'ure instructed Velen to take the Ata'mal crystal and rally anyone willing to listen to him, and travel to Argus' tallest mountain on the longest day of the year. There, Velen's prayers would be answered. As Velen and his followers awaited a sign from the naaru, Archimonde and Kil'jaeden had caught wind of Velen's plan and unleashed the &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; upon them. Raising the crystal into the air in desperation, Velen watched as the crystal was struck by a beam of light and suddenly shattered. The crystal created a barrier of light that prevented the man'ari from reaching them. At that moment, the gigantic &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt; known as the \"Genedar\" appeared, providing Velen and his followers their escape from Argus.\nThe shards.\nAssuming that the Eye of the Storm, Shield of the Naaru, and Fortune's Smile remain in Velen's possession, the only crystal that remains unaccounted for is Leafshadow, which has not been seen since it was used by the Horde to sack Shattrath."}

They are green or white skinned with green, purple, or white hair.\nThe Atal'ai trolls are a &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; of dark casters, known for practicing forbidden magic, including &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; which was taught to them by Hakkar for their unwavering loyalty. The Atal'ai was a once-great troll civilization that was destroyed, its buried artifacts can be found beneath the &lt;a href=\"Pool%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Pool of Tears&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \"atal'ai\" means \"Devoted Ones\" in &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;, the language of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThe long centuries following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; were difficult ones for the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; race. 1,500 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s, driven to desperate ends, enlisted the aid of the god &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulflayer\"&gt;Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Hakkar brought the trolls great power, but in return the bloodthirsty god required that souls be sacrificed to him.\nHis demands quickly escalated, and he grew impatient with his loyal &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt;. He told them to find a way to summon him physically into the world so that he might directly drain the blood of his victims. Most of the Hakkari were horrified at the idea, but the Atal'ai, a small extremist faction of the Hakkari, decided to do as Hakkar wished. Before the Atal'ai could complete the summoning, the other jungle trolls, including the Hakkari, rose up in open revolt against the cruel god. Even the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; was drawn into the conflict, which finally ended with the destruction of Hakkar\u2019s avatar. Driven from the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;jungles&lt;/a&gt;, the Atal'ai were hunted nearly to extinction. Yet a small group of Atal'ai escaped into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, where they secretly built a great temple to their god: the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were joined by the Hakkari not much later. The Hakkari, too, were killed or exiled for the evil deeds they had done in Hakkar's name, despite the fact that they had fought the Atal'ai. In great bitterness and despair, the surviving Hakkari tracked the Atal'ai to the Swamp of Sorrows and pledged to help the Atal'ai summon Hakkar into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Pleased by the Hakkari's obvious suffering, the Atal'ai welcomed their former brethren into the temple. Even so, Hakkar had not forgotten that the Hakkari had betrayed him in opposing his first entry into Azeroth, and so the hungry god would always regard the faithful Atal'ai with greater favor. Both groups bent all their efforts toward bringing about Hakkar's entry into the physical world.\nThe green &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera the Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;, soon learned of the evil priests' plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's ruins are guarded by mighty &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe green dragons that had been left by Ysera to guard the Temple of Atal'Hakkar had succumbed to another force, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. The descendants of the Atal'ai returned to the Sunken Temple to find that its guardians were disoriented and vulnerable. Both the Nightmare and the trolls dragged the dragons down into the depths of madness and corruption. In firm control of the temple, the Atal'ai began their gruesome rituals to summon Hakkar into the world. The Atal'ai's spiritual leader, &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an\"&gt;Jammal'an&lt;/a&gt;, had what he called a prophecy. He believed the summoning of Hakkar will bring the Atal'ai immortality. The Atal'ai and Hakkari lost no time in dispatching a number of their most skilled priests to the ancient &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, which was the place were Hakkar was to be physically summoned to. A green dragon named &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Itharius&lt;/a&gt; called for help from the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn sent an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; force to cleanse the temple and put an end to the Atal'ai's efforts.\nHowever, despite the attack on the Sunken Temple, the Atal'ai and their leader &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do%20the%20Hexxer\"&gt;Jin'do the Hexxer&lt;/a&gt; were successfully able to revive Hakkar in Zul'Gurub. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari tribe&lt;/a&gt; sent word through the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; needed to act immediately for Hakkar being successfully summoned would throw the world into chaos. A large Horde strike force was sent to Zul'Gurub in turn. The Horde charged into the temple city, killing the priests, Jin'do, and Hakkar.\nCataclysm.\nAfter Hakkar was defeated, the Atal'ai were able to recover a significant portion of Hakkar's skeleton that allowed them to call forth Hakkar's avatar into the world once more. &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Lord Itharius&lt;/a&gt; sends adventurers to put an end to the Atal'ai, the Hakkari, and destroy Hakkar's new avatar.\nShadowlands.\nThe souls of &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai%20Devoted\"&gt;Atal'ai Devoted&lt;/a&gt; are worshiping Hakkar in &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;De Other Side&lt;/a&gt;, the troll afterlife."}

Her servants are many, but few can match the fanatical devotion of Athissa. At her queen's command, she is poised to lead a massive naga army into &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, a region rumored to hold a long-lost titan relic of power. Nothing will stand between Athissa and this prize - not the cursed night elf spirits who haunt the land nor the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces that are gathering on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWhen the hero enters the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Nar%27thalas\"&gt;Ruins of Nar'thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Athissa tells her brethren to find the titan relic &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt; with no hesitation.

The hero was able to collect them but gets frozen after it was brought together.

He reached the academy entrance when he saw the two naga, with the hero in tow. Athissa telling Parjesh that the slave was not to be awakened. Farondis followed them closely and then engaged them when they were at a stopping point. The Tidemistress in combat with the Prince was overheard by her warlord that he will take the prison to the slave pens. Furious, she is going to tell Azshara of who she saw.\nAt the final confrontation, Athissa held her ground as Parjesh took the shattered pieces of the titan relic. She was met in combat by not just the hero and Farondis, but the ghosts of the past of the Princes' royal guard as well. She has met a quick death only to not see the Tidestone fully repaired."}

He was &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20of%20Althalaxx%20%288%29\"&gt;slain by Alliance adventurers&lt;/a&gt;, but even after his death his &lt;a href=\"Narassin%27s%20Tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; could be found in the burnt tower. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he returned as a &lt;a href=\"spectre\"&gt;spectre&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nOne of 's most loyal servants, Athrikus Narassin was an aristocrat who prided himself on the many magical items he attained or crafted. Though there were many towns and places of habitation constructed upon the lakeshore, &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; villages were the foremost. Having the touch of Azshara, the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;'s beloved Queen, in their creation. Her favored servitors, those of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, she brought to the twin towns to reside, and to govern them she placed Athrikus Narassin. Though it would be that he would spend most of his days in his &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;Tower of Althalaxx&lt;/a&gt;, some ways removed of the towns.\nHis second, a mage known of his prowess in the arcane arts as much as with his physical abilities was &lt;a href=\"Asterion\"&gt;Asterion&lt;/a&gt;, who lived among the people of Bashal'Aran, and went many times to Ameth'Aran to see to the needs and wants of its people.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, he was near the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; when it exploded. Athrikus was blasted far away, and when he awoke, he found that he was missing all the items he had so loved. However, the Well's explosion had made him immortal, and given him the power to sap the energies of other magi to augment his own.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, all was in ruins, its people clinging to the ground as though that might spare them from the destruction. It was then that Athrikus Narassin appeared to guide &lt;a href=\"Sargath\"&gt;Sargath&lt;/a&gt; and other Highborne to safety. With a spell he could protect them. He would say. While around them, brother and sister, father and mother perished. They would have life eternal trapped inside his soulgems, and have naught to fear from the Sundering that was to come.\n10,000 years later, Athrikus resided at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;Tower of Althalaxx&lt;/a&gt; and still possessed three soulgems, and two of them were being held in &lt;a href=\"Night%20Run\"&gt;Night Run&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Satyrnaar\"&gt;Satyrnaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;-held areas in northeast &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The soul of &lt;a href=\"Asterion\"&gt;Asterion&lt;/a&gt; was sealed in &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and guarded by the Satyrs of &lt;a href=\"Deth%27ryll\"&gt;Deth'ryll&lt;/a&gt;. He founded the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cult of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt; with many &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, including even a foul satyr. One of his most loyal servants was the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; warlock . Athrikus was empowered by soulgems holding the trapped &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; souls. He was also a pawn of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, of which his cult was an ally or a part.\nFollowing the Cataclysm &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;his tower&lt;/a&gt; has been razed and the ruins are being searched by &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt; scavengers looking for his research. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; presumed him &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20of%20Althalaxx%20%288%29\"&gt;long dead&lt;/a&gt; and no longer a concern, but wished to keep the research out of enemy hands.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Tortured%20Spirit%20%28Darkshore%29\"&gt;ancestral spirits&lt;/a&gt; at the Tower of Althalaxx were driven to madness by the Horde, including Athrikus who returned as a &lt;a href=\"spectre\"&gt;spectre&lt;/a&gt;. Some of his soul gems still remained at the tower as well, and were shattered by adventurers to free the trapped Highborne spirits.\nRelatives.\nBesides his brother Allaris, he may have also been related to &lt;a href=\"Andaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Andaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince Allaris and Andaris are both &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, Athrikus may have been from &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; before he was assigned to govern Ameth'Aran and Bashal'Aran."}

It is currently wielded by Medivh's former apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. The staff was born from the \"seed of hate\" and grants its wielder \"power unending\".\nAtiesh can be used to open up portals to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and is also known for attracting ravens towards the wielder. Atiesh gives its wielder the ability to turn into a raven themselves.\nHistory.\nIts date of creation is unknown, but it is known that Atiesh was forged from the \"seed of hate\" and was wielded by each &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, including Aegwynn, until the line ended with &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. This would set the age of Atiesh at thousands of years.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Medivh%23Deaths\"&gt;assassination of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the staff was found by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and brought to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by a series of tragic events, leading to the death of every Kirin Tor mage that came into contact with Atiesh. The staff was put behind impenetrable barriers of magic and mage &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Dosantos\"&gt;Angela Dosantos&lt;/a&gt; was appointed to watch over it.\nThe staff was lost and shattered, presumably due the failsafe system of the magical barrier, during the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29%23Dalaran%20during%20the%20wars\"&gt;destruction of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. The forty-two pieces of Atiesh were scattered across all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; sought to find the pieces and reform the staff. The &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tarsis%20Kir-Moldir\"&gt;Tarsis Kir-Moldir&lt;/a&gt;, who had previously wielded the staff briefly, managed to gather twenty pieces of Atiesh, but he was found by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad was then in possession of all the pieces, which he entrusted to his &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s, except for one, the &lt;a href=\"Base%20of%20Atiesh\"&gt;Base of Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;, found by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. However, Brann somehow lost it to &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; appeared over the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; attempted to prevent this powerful focus of power from falling into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;necromancer-lich&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad, and were apparently successful in their mission.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Winterstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; on a mission to retrieve the base of the shattered staff from within the remains of C'Thun. Garona succeeded and gave the base to &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, who restored the whole staff.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; onward, the staff is wielded by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, the former apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. It is unclear how he obtained it, as it was last seen in Med'an's possession. The most likely answer is that Med'an gave it to him.\nDuring the Nerubians and Xal'ataths' assault on Dalaran, Khadgar confronted the Harbinger as she was using the Dark Heart to absorb all of the arcane energy from the city within the Violet Citadel and attempted to end her threat once and for all; only for Xal'atath to negate the attack and unleash a storm of Void on the Guardian; which resulted in Atiesh snapping in-half, followed shortly thereafter by Xal'atath channeling the Void into the Dark Heart to create a powerful void blast that completely obliterated the city.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nAtiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian, is a &lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;caster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; which could be assembled via a quest prior to the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; moved back to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.

It can access full item tooltips, show drop rates, allow items to be chat linked and to use the dressing room. It can be integrated with any map mod and at the moment works with &lt;a href=\"Atlas\"&gt;Atlas&lt;/a&gt; and AlphaMap. Atlas Loot allows players to view all items that are currently attainable in game. In order to view the tooltips of a specific item at least one player on your World off Warcraft server must have seen the item drop of its perspective Dungeon Boss. Items will not be added to your in-game library until they are made available for acquisition.\nDownload Locations.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curse.com/downloads/details/2983/\"&gt;Curse Gaming&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com/list.php%3Fskinnerid%3D39780\"&gt;WoW Interface&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowui.incgamers.com/%3Fp%3Dmod%26amp%3Bm%3D2613\"&gt;INC Gamers&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.atlasloot.net/download.php\"&gt;Official Site&lt;/a&gt;\nLatest Beta.\nLatest versions can be found at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//files.wowace.com/AtlasLoot/AtlasLoot.zip\"&gt;WoW Ace&lt;/a&gt;. This version updates every time a correction or change is made, but has not has complete bug testing. \nHistory.\nAtlasLoot was originally created by &lt;a href=\"Pernicius\"&gt;Pernicius&lt;/a&gt; as a plugin for &lt;a href=\"Atlas\"&gt;Atlas&lt;/a&gt; and contained a handful of raid loot tables to browse. The original version is still up for download here: http://wow.curse-gaming.com/en/files/details/2828/atlasloot/ . Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Pernicius\"&gt;Pernicius&lt;/a&gt; was unable to maintain the mod, so took over and renamed it to AtlasLoot Enhanced to provide a distinction between the two versions. Since that time, AtlasLoot has grown to cover every loot table for every boss, every item set, PvP Items and items for every reputation faction.\nFor Mod Authors.\nAtlasLoot has an API making it easy to include loot tables in your mod. For example, to see Lucifron's loot you would type:\nThe pFrame tells AtlasLoot where to display the items and the format is as follows:\nThe AtlasLoot_ShowBossLoot function does all the work. The format is as follows:\nThe dataID can be obtained by looking at the database files included with AtlasLoot and finding the label that contains loot for the boss you are interested in."}

He is fought in the &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%20%28Blackwing%20Descent%29\"&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt; and is summoned using the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bell\"&gt;Ancient Bell&lt;/a&gt; after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Thanes\"&gt;Dark Iron Thanes&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAtramedes, also known as Experiment 25463-D, was a &lt;a href=\"black%20whelp\"&gt;black whelp&lt;/a&gt; experimented on by &lt;a href=\"Maloriak\"&gt;Maloriak&lt;/a&gt; to be granted \"sight beyond sight.\" This experiment failed, however, and rendered Atramedes completely blind. Rather than disposing of him, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; decided to make further use of the blind whelp. Over time the dragon learned to use his other senses, becoming powerful and formidable regardless.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Atramedes, or Experiment 25463-D, is a failed attempt to bestow enhanced senses on a &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt;. The toxic salve applied to the broodling robbed him of sight, forcing him to rely on sound and smell for survival. A tragic story... if Atramedes weren't so evil.\"\nAbilities.\nAncient Dwarven Shields.\nTen &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dwarven%20Shield\"&gt;Ancient Dwarven Shield&lt;/a&gt;s are positioned around the room. Any player can strike one of the shields and cause a Resonating Clash. This interrupts Atramedes' casting, resets the Sound on every player to zero, and gives Atramedes a case of Vertigo. When Atramedes recovers from Vertigo, he destroys the shield.\nGround Phase.\nAtramedes begins the fight on the ground.\nStrategy.\nThis encounter revolves around the Sound Bar mechanic. All of Atramedes' abilities cause their target's sound bar to increase, and when 100% sound is reached Atramedes will gain aggro on the target and hideously mangle and crush them. Atramedes will target the highest sound player with his abilities and follow them faster if their sound is higher.\nThere are 10 'gongs' around the room that can be interacted with, using them will reset every raid member's sound to zero and stun Atramedes for 5 seconds. However when they are used Atramedes will become extremely upset with them and burn them to ash, so they can only be used once each.\nPhase 1.\nAtramedes starts off on the ground and should be tanked near the entrance. Lasts 80 seconds. This allows quick access to the shields by a player designated to hit them. Atramedes melees slowly, but very hard. Ranged and melee should be stacked on differing sides of the boss to allow for predictable Sonar Pulse flight pathing. He will also cast Modulation at regular intervals for unavoidable raid damage and sound.\nTwice per phase Atramedes will use Sonic Breath, which has a 2 sec cast time. he will quickly target the person he's casting on before using it. A direction needs to be set up beforehand on where the player needs to run (i.e. targetted player runs clockwise, others run counter). Once per phase he will channel Searing Flames. This is the main source of wipes. The designated shield hitter must always be near a shield to quickly whack it and stun Atramedes. Ideally you'll only get one stack of the debuff. Two is acceptable. Anything higher is not acceptable as he usually follows up with a Modulation which will do hefty damage and likely kill low health members. \nShortly after Searing Flames he will take off and phase 2 will begin.\nPhase 2.\nAtramedes is now in the air and has a new repertoire of moves. The most deadly being Roaring Flame Breath. This is where you'll need at least one or two dedicated kiters. Mages and Warlocks work well, and engineering is almost a must. The goal of this phase is to get through it, using preferably only one, at max two shields. As soon as the boss starts channeling, the kiter whacks a shield stunning the boss and becoming the new target. A mage can use Blink as well as the engineering belt to stay ahead of the flame, while a warlock can use the Soulburn/Portal combo to get away from the flame as well as a speed boost, before using the belt. Both will still likely need Priest's Body and Soul shields for the final few seconds. Other good kiters include Rogues (&lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt;), Druids (&lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;Travel Form&lt;/a&gt;) and Shaman (&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Swiftness\"&gt;Ancestral Swiftness&lt;/a&gt;). It also is a good idea for everyone to bring a few &lt;a href=\"Swiftness%20Potion\"&gt;Swiftness Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, just in case they get stuck with being the first person targeted and they have no way to speed up - however doing this will make the player unable to use other potions such as &lt;a href=\"Golemblood%20Potion\"&gt;Golemblood Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Volcanic%20Potion\"&gt;Volcanic Potion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20the%20Tol%27vir\"&gt;Potion of the Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;. Set up an order of who hits the gongs on this phase before pulling to avoid wasted shields.\nWhile the kiting is going on the rest of the raid need to avoid the Sonar Bomb and Sonic Fireball as well as staying out of the flame patches, all the while ranged should be trying to put as much damage in Atramedes as possible.\nAfter 40seconds Atramedes will land and phase 1 will resume.\nRinse and Repeat.\nEnrage.\nThe shields work as a sort of soft enrage, limiting the fight's length by providing a limited number of sound bar resets. On Heroic difficulty, Atramedes will go berserk after ten minutes, likely wiping the raid in relatively short order.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

They were intolerant believers in the way of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and aspired to &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;hood within the organization, deciding to officially join them after the mercenary band was disbanded. They took the &lt;a href=\"%3ALeft%20Piece%20of%20Lord%20Valthalak%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;:Left Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; with them and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, meeting &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Crusader%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;his chamber&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately for the siblings, Sothos failed the final initiation rites and despite Jarien's succeeding and trying to defend her brother, both were slain on the spot by Dathrohan himself. As their souls were twisted further by their possession of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt;'s amulet, they still haunt the place.\nTheir ghosts can be summoned by igniting the &lt;a href=\"Brazier%20of%20Beckoning\"&gt;Brazier of Beckoning&lt;/a&gt; within the Grand Crusader's chamber where they died - but be warned, of their former mercenary company, they are the hardest to kill.\nStrategy.\nSothos and Jarien are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; warriors who seem to have split their class abilities between them. The brother, Sothos, has a shield and is the bad guy: he will &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"charge\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt; around (apparently random) and do a very painful &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;Shadow Bolt&lt;/a&gt;. Jarien, the sister, is melee only and not hard to &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;; her only special ability is a 1k dmg &lt;a href=\"cleave\"&gt;cleave&lt;/a&gt; that hits everyone in the room. A good strategy is to kill Sothos first and have Jarien offtanked as he is the one that does the most burst damage. After he is dead, his spirit will help the fight against Jarien, but don't count on him to take too much damage as he will go down a lot quicker to her than he did for you.\nShadow Protection buffs or &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; will help, as will a good Mana Potion for the casters. If you have a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; in your party, you can &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Inquisitor\"&gt;Crimson Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s on the way in for a buff called \"Shadow Barrier\" that reduces Shadow damage taken by 50 for 10 min. Sothos and Jarien are also undead, so stock up on &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Stratholme Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; before the fight to make it a little easier for everyone."}

He was the same age as Arthas. Neither of the boys cared that a horsebreeder's son wasn't a proper companion for a prince, and their parents didn't try to stop the friendship. One winter day when Jarim and Arthas were throwing snowballs and playing &lt;a href=\"Guards%20and%20Bandits\"&gt;Guards and Bandits&lt;/a&gt;, Jorum invited the boys to assist the horse &lt;a href=\"Brightmane\"&gt;Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; as she gave birth to her son &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, who later became Arthas' own steed.\nDuring the winter storm that led to the death of Invincible, it was Jarim and his father who found Arthas and rescued the prince from freezing to death in the woods near the &lt;a href=\"Balnir%20Farmstead\"&gt;Balnir Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter murdering &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas returned to the Balnir Farmstead to revive Invincible and found that the Balnirs had all been killed by the very &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; that he was now a part of."}
