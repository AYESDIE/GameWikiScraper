We were charged by the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s themselves to protect the world.\nOnce I gave up on the post of Prime Designate, I gave up any measure of influence over the other keepers. Not even my own son, &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, is bound to heed my commands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt; comes from a time before our falling out, however. A time of an ancient oath of honor.\nLet us invoke that oath -- I am certain Thorim will answer the call.\nRewards.\nYou will also receive: \nProgress.\nWhat news do you bring from Ulduar?\nCompletion.\nI thank you, &lt;name&gt;. That &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; is gone is unfortunate, but things could have gone much worse and thanks to you &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; did not fall to the Legion today.\nNotes.\nBefore beginning the scenario, check that you have food, bandages, and health potions. Talenting into &lt;a href=\"Shockwave\"&gt;Shockwave&lt;/a&gt; is also highly recommended for &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 1: Demons, Demons Everywhere....\nYou, &lt;a href=\"Ragnvald%20Drakeborn\"&gt;Ragnvald Drakeborn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Finna%20Bjornsdottir\"&gt;Finna Bjornsdottir&lt;/a&gt; will start off the scenario in &lt;a href=\"The%20Antechamber\"&gt;The Antechamber&lt;/a&gt;.\nKill the &lt;a href=\"Felguard%20Marauder\"&gt;Felguard Marauder&lt;/a&gt;s that are attacking a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rune%20Sentinel\"&gt;Dark Rune Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Mender\"&gt;Iron Mender&lt;/a&gt;. They will assist as you make your way further in.\nAfter killing the pack of imps, the sentinel will leave you while the mender stays with you.\nEither interrupt or move out of the Hateful Doombringer's rain of fire. The demon is simple enough to defeat, but the first real fight lays just ahead.\nIf you are not a protection warrior, watch your aggro. &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Gom%27tok\"&gt;Lieutenant Gom'tok&lt;/a&gt; attacks hurt, \"especially\" his Felsoul Cleave ability. Hit the demon a couple times then stand back to let the NPCs do the work for you. (Note: Do not stand at range or Gom'tok will sometimes use Demonic Leap on you. Avoid this by staying in melee, behind Gom'tok.)\nStage 2: Small But Mighty.\nFollow Dvalen as he heads down from &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattered%20Walkway\"&gt;The Shattered Walkway&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Observation%20Ring\"&gt;The Observation Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Be ready for two packs of Felblaze Imps, a group of Felguard Marauders, and two elite Hateful Doombringers.\nUse your own Heroic Leap to bypass the barrier and assist against the demons.\nContinue further into &lt;a href=\"The%20Halls%20of%20Winter\"&gt;The Halls of Winter&lt;/a&gt; and use Heroic Leap over the second fel flames after fighting packs &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Ravager\"&gt;Blazing Ravager&lt;/a&gt;s. Assist Dvalen in aiding another Iron Mender.\nFinish off the last pack and continue on to the large door.\nStage 3: A Feat of Strength.\nThe chain is in the right-side corner before the door. Grab it and follow Dvalen's example.\nStage 4: Hodir, Hodir, Hodir!\nFocus on slaying Felwarden Elreth. The hounds are periodically summoned but do not give credit.\nStage 5: The Clash of Thunder.\nFollow Hodir. As expected, there are still more demons to take care of on the way.\nStage 6: A Feat of Battle.\nAt this point Dvalen and Hodir break off to fight the flow of demons coming from the portal. Enter the main area and take the passageway on your left. For veterans, one needs not be reminded to be watchful.\nFight the &lt;a href=\"Felbite%20Broodling\"&gt;Felbite Broodling&lt;/a&gt;s and press on, while minding the spiders hanging from the ceiling. Use &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt; to draw the spiders to you for easy stunnage and &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; abilities. Take advantage of any breaks in combat to heal up if necessary, especially before reaching the first doorway.\nQuickly deal with the small spiderlings while letting Finna tank Morvaniss. Avoid the latter's Poison Nova. Once the brood queen is dead, the door will open up.\nStage 7: Rescue Thorim.\nMake your way out of the passageway and use &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Leap\"&gt;Heroic Leap&lt;/a&gt; once more to reach Thorim, who is busy fighting &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ran%27zara\"&gt;Lady Ran'zara&lt;/a&gt;. Attack Ran'zara once to get your champions to do your work again, while avoiding her Rain of Fire ability."}

It is regarded by many to be the greatest and most successful raid instance Blizzard has so far released.\nEncounters by location.\nTen of the raid dungeon's fourteen encounters have &lt;a href=\"hard%20mode\"&gt;hard mode&lt;/a&gt;s (different from normal and heroic modes). Algalon the Observer is a hard mode-only but optional encounter. Encounters completed on hard modes reward achievements as well as extra and/or improved item rewards. &lt;a href=\"Siege%20weapon\"&gt;Siege vehicles&lt;/a&gt; play a role in the dungeon's first encounter, Flame Leviathan.\nThe dungeon does not follow a completely linear progression; Yogg-Saron and Algalon the Observer are regarded as the most difficult encounters, and are accessible independent of each other.\nLoot.\nItems obtained in 10 and 25-man modes share the models, but vary in color.

It is the homeland of stone-cat people known as &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; and is rich with &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; lore. \nA superweapon is rumored to exist in Uldum which the Alliance, Horde and Deathwing's minions seek. There is no super weapon, however; Uldum \"is\" the weapon, intended to wipe out all life on Azeroth in case &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Reply-Code%20Omega\"&gt;Reply-Code Omega&lt;/a&gt; went through to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThe region of Uldum was once a vast jungle, dotted with pristine lakes and waterfalls. During the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; and his followers \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 installed the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in Uldum. The Forge would regulate the rhythms of the earth and fortify the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;'s form, but would also be able to completely reoriginate the planet in case of systemic corruption. After installing the Forge, Ra assigned some of the tol'vir and anubisaths to watch over the region, while he and the rest of his followers continued west to establish the prison of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; to house the defeated &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenturies later, Ra was imprisoned by &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King, who used the Highkeeper's powers to become the first emperor of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;. Learning from Ra of the demise of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, Lei Shen declared that he would carry on the work of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and led an army of his mogu warriors and &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; allies into Uldum, seeking to claim the Forge of Origination \u2014 believing it to hold the secrets of eternal life. The tol'vir knew they could not defeat the Thunder King and his armies in battle, and so instead turned to another tactic. While some of the tol'vir remained outside the fortress to hold off the invading armies, the ones inside activated the Forge. They knew that using the weapon to its full potential would wipe out all life on the planet, and so instead had configured it to only scour the nearby land. Waves of energy erupted from the Forge, bathing the surrounding lands in the powers of uncreation and instantly killing Lei Shen and his entire army; however, it also devastated the surrounding lands, turning Uldum into a barren desert. The surviving tol'vir then worked to ensure that no one would ever attempt to claim Uldum again, and shrouded the mountain passes leading into the region with magic, sealing the land off from the eyes of mortals. The dead Zandalari who had followed &lt;a href=\"Zulathra\"&gt;Zulathra&lt;/a&gt; were buried at &lt;a href=\"Kings%27%20Rest\"&gt;Kings' Rest&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Halls of Ash&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe illusion remained for many thousands of years until the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; damaged the ancient titan device that separated Uldum from neighboring &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; weaponsmith &lt;a href=\"Irmaat\"&gt;Irmaat&lt;/a&gt; was known all throughout Uldum for his excellent work in creating magical weapons that represent the &lt;a href=\"Air%20elemental\"&gt;air spirits&lt;/a&gt; that live there. The city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahmtul\"&gt;Ahmtul&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by raw elemental fury when Irmaat tried to bind the power of &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir the Windlord&lt;/a&gt; within a &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;set of fist weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Typhinius\"&gt;Typhinius&lt;/a&gt; recovered the fist weapons and took control of the air elementals. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded, Typhinus commanded his air minions to raid Uldum, the Fists of the Heavens sweeping away all early resistance. However, as it turned out, the air elementals still did not recover from their prior civil war and were weakened, and Typhinus had not properly mastered them. Soon, the attack on Uldum ended.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; striking &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with his sword unearthed new tombs, and from one the &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt; emerged. They speak little to other tol'vir, believing them to be betrayers of their sacred duties. They believe that they, stewards of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, should alone control the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. When they realized that &lt;a href=\"Rajh\"&gt;Rajh&lt;/a&gt; and his kin were slain, they constructed their own &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20watcher\"&gt;new keepers&lt;/a&gt;, which means they must have an active forge like the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt; tol'vir later began to assault the Halls of Origination and surrounding areas of Uldum, bringing them in conflict with the Ramkahen. The Ramkahen formed the &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20Accord\"&gt;Uldum Accord&lt;/a&gt; by allying with the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wastewander\"&gt;Wastewander&lt;/a&gt; bandits. They defended Uldum and the Halls of Origination from both &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s forces and the Amathet.\nGeography.\nUldum is a research facility for the titans in their continuing efforts to enhance the biosphere of Azeroth. Specific information regarding their work as it relates to Uldum is unknown and can only be accessed with the &lt;a href=\"Plates%20of%20Uldum\"&gt;Plates of Uldum&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Gunstan\"&gt;Prospector Gunstan&lt;/a&gt; maintained a lonely vigil near the outside gates on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, he has been joined by a number of his fellow explorers, with the rival blood elven &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; setting up camp nearby.\nThe landscape of Uldum is predominately desert, with a large river surrounded by an oasis flowing through the center of the region, mostly populated by the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;, with the largest settlement - the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20City%20of%20Tol%27vir\"&gt;Lost City&lt;/a&gt; located on the river delta. The western part of Uldum consists of a large expanse of the wind-swept dunes with half-buried Tol'vir settlements and pyramids, caused by the recent transgressions of &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;'s air elemental minions. In the east lies a massive pyramid that houses the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; complex known as the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt;. The northwestern part is the location of the &lt;a href=\"Obelisk%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Obelisk of the Stars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20Unending%20Cycles\"&gt;The Gate of Unending Cycles&lt;/a&gt; connecting the region with &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; desert. The southern part of the region besides the river delta is mostly cliffs, with settlements held by the &lt;a href=\"Neferset\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt;. The southwestern part is being held by an expedition led by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Schnottz\"&gt;Commander Schnottz&lt;/a&gt;. The Cataclysm also brought the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; towers into Uldum that serve as an entrance to the Al'Akir's domain - the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20plane\"&gt;elemental plane&lt;/a&gt; of air. Al'Akir sends his elemental minions to convince the Tol'vir to join his new liege &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, even rewarding them with removal of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Those who dared to oppose suffered dire consequences as exampled in the &lt;a href=\"Orsis\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt; settlement.\nThe animals that live there are &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;s and more. Notable animals include the large scorpion himself, &lt;a href=\"Madexx\"&gt;Madexx&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel hubs.\nFlight paths.\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Oasis%20of%20Vir%27sar\"&gt;Oasis of Vir'sar&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Schnottz%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Schnottz's Landing&lt;/a&gt;\nPortals.\nThere are portals to Uldum from the earthshrines in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. They unlock after players wind up in &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; after completing the &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20quests%23Escape%20and%20retribution\"&gt;first few mandatory quests&lt;/a&gt; starting with &lt;a href=\"Easy%20Money\"&gt;Easy Money&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Adarrah\"&gt;Adarrah&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are no portals from Uldum back to Stormwind/Orgrimmar, however.\nResources.\nHerbalism\nMining\nWild creatures.\nThe fauna of Uldum is not widely known to the outsiders because of the long-timed isolation of the region from the outside world.\nIn the RPG.\nIt is said that &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; once housed a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, a place known as Uldum. The city seems to be lost as no one has been able to find it. Perhaps the sands cover it, or maybe Uldum is just another name for the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;, a goblin trading post in Tanaris, is where many &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"prospector\"&gt;prospector&lt;/a&gt;s stock up on supplies before heading out in search of the lost Titan city of Uldum. Fragments of notes unearthed from &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; suggest that a great titan city lies deep within the rocky expanse of the southern desert. So far, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; expeditions have yet to track down the location of Uldum, but they are confident that it is only a matter of time.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "89264", "revid": "452956", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=89264", "title": "Rival Nations", "text": "Rival Nations is a custom map for &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt; in which there are three teams of three, pitted against each other in a free-for-all &lt;a href=\"AoS\"&gt;Aeon of Strife&lt;/a&gt; format. Each player begins the game with one hero of their choosing, and battles computer controlled armies until becoming powerful enough to destroy the opposing teams' Castle. The biggest difference between Rival Nations and other AoS styled maps is that in Rival Nations you are able to purchase and control more than one hero. This leads to increased strategy and micro requirements in order to be victorious. Started in the summer of 2002, it was developed by &lt;a href=\"MicrosoftXP\"&gt;MicrosoftXP&lt;/a&gt; until June 2004. The last version released by MicrosoftXP was x2.0b for . After a few months &lt;a href=\"AwaKening\"&gt;AwaKening&lt;/a&gt; took over development. The map was renamed to 'Rival Nations Reborn' and is currently at version 1.03d as of 2007-03-13.\nFeatures.\nRival Nations pioneered a number of features now seen frequently in custom maps. Unfortunately there are so many features, that the learning curve of the map is quite steep and does not lend itself well to new players versus more experienced ones. This is perhaps the greatest flaw of the map and the biggest reason why it has gone down considerably in popularity.\nHeroes.\nRival Nations primary focus is heroes and hero to hero combat. There are other strategic options that can be explored, such as town and troop upgrades, as well as non-hero mercenaries, however ultimately \nMultiple Heroes.\nRacial Combinations.\nIf a player gets the 4 primary heroes from the same race, they would get additional benefits for themselves and their team. If a player gets five heroes and they include the four primary heroes plus a neutral hero of the same race, further additional benefits are rewarded. The benefits included a general town bonus and a powerful magic item. The bonus later came to include a racial shop that would be created in the player's base which contained useful and powerful items.\nHuman.\nThe Human Alliance enhances the army by training a random specialty unit at each barracks. Possible units include Sorceress, Priest, Spell Breaker, Dragonhawk Rider and Gryphon Rider.\nSpecialty Item: Magic Forged Gauntlets\nThese magical gauntlets grants their owner inceased Armor, Movement Speed, Strength, Intelligence, and Agility. They also grant the ability to cast Inner Fire and can be used to summon aid.\nSummons: Blood Elf Lieutenants\nPowerful lieutenants from Prince Kael's Blood Elf army. Experts at destroying spellcasters.\nSecret Hero.\nThe Lich was for a long time nothing more than a myth to many players, very few knew it even existed and fewer knew how to actually get it. This was done in the interests of balance, as the Lich's ultimate ability was Death and Decay, which is by far the best building killing spell in the game, and it would have caused many complications to allow this spell to be available at the start of the game. Thus, in order to acquire the Lich, one first had to have the other two available Undead Heroes: the Death Knight and the Dreadlord. Once these two were acquired, if another hero was purchased, a message would appear that said 'Can you find the secret hero?' The trick then was to simply wait approximately 60 seconds for the Lich to spawn."}

It probably originates from the mountains within Silverpine Forest and flows towards or into &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the bridge leading out of the village, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, having traveled to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, made a stand against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in order to save a retreating force of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;. She succeeded in holding the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; back, but was swept downriver as the bridge collapsed.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and Illidan's forces both searched the banks of the river as the Scourge was tracking down the missing priestess. A &lt;a href=\"dam\"&gt;dam&lt;/a&gt; had been built there by the &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen%20Trolls\"&gt;Shadowglen Trolls&lt;/a&gt;.

The Arevass may run out of the mountains in northern &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; or from the hills above &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" there is only one watercourse in Silverpine Forest, the traces of a river that was once connected to Lordamere Lake. All that remains of it is a dried up canyon and a few pools of water, with a bridge crossing it near the lake itself, however, it isn't near Pyrewood Village. As of ; there is a swampy area that runs from Pyrewood to the Greymane Wall with a bridge that runs above it. This area may have once been the River Arevass; as there are a number of rowboats near the patches of water that remain; which would be pointless given how shallow the water is. The Arevass' absence from the game may be related to reasons that aren't related to the lore, such as scale issues.\nThe region that surrounds the river may have shared its name; possibly providing a name for the region that would later become the &lt;a href=\"Battlefront\"&gt;Battlefront&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northgate\"&gt;Northgate&lt;/a&gt;."}

The first type is native to and is distinguished by their rocky plates and long, club-like tails. The second type is native to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and more closely resembles real-life hippos. It is not known if the two types are related to each other.\nDraenor.\nOne version of riverbeasts (also called hippopotamuses or hippos) are native to the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and were first introduced in the \"\" expansion. They can be found in lakes and rivers in almost every region of Draenor except for &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventurers are often misled by the seemingly docile riverbeasts. Though slow to anger, once disturbed, a charging riverbeast is a ferocious sight: 4,000 pounds of fat and muscle storming toward its target like a runaway tram. Roaming &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rangari\"&gt;rangari&lt;/a&gt; have long been astounded by how much damage a rampaging riverbeast can take before it's brought down, and draenei children are taught to keep a wide berth of shallow waters. Riverbeasts are characterized by their rock-like skin, likely developed during the early days of Draenor's prehistory, when &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;creatures of stone&lt;/a&gt; dueled for supremacy against the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;chaotic flora&lt;/a&gt;. Those looking to take a riverbeast as a trophy should take note of their durable armored flesh and tendency to charge unexpectedly.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sapphire%20Riverbeast\"&gt;sapphire riverbeast's&lt;/a&gt; color mimics the clear blue of Draenor's river shallows, making it almost invisible to aquatic predators. &lt;a href=\"Trained%20Riverwallow\"&gt;Riverwallows&lt;/a&gt; are one of the heartiest beasts on Draenor, resulting in their increased stamina and distinctive coloring. Aggressive and territorial, the &lt;a href=\"Mosshide%20Riverwallow\"&gt;mosshide&lt;/a&gt; is known for hiding in river-shore scrub and ambushing unwary passersby. Special webbing that grows on the soles of the &lt;a href=\"Mudback%20Riverbeast\"&gt;mudback&lt;/a&gt;'s feet gives them extra traction in mud and slick terrain.\nRiverbeast calves are surprisingly quick when provoked, but easily calmed with a meal of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand%20Arrowbloom\"&gt;Nagrand Arrowbloom&lt;/a&gt;. The playful &lt;a href=\"Periwinkle%20Calf\"&gt;periwinkle calves&lt;/a&gt; enjoy scooping up a large mouthful of water and then spitting it at one another.\nAzeroth.\nAnother version of riverbeasts are native to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and were first introduced in the \"\" expansion. These riverbeasts are more reminiscent of real life es, with the exception of their sharp, protruding tusks and sparse manes of hair, and can mainly be found around bodies of water in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiverbeasts are actually one of the most dangerous animals on Azeroth, despite their appearance. Riverbeasts kill more &lt;a href=\"Centaur\"&gt;centaurs&lt;/a&gt; than any other animal in the Ohn'aran Plains, and are inexplicably driven to eat a type of white pellet."}

The drogbar have long provided the Rivermane with potent alchemy to protect their crops from insects and in return, the Rivermane provided them with most of their food between their fish and crops.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; was stolen, however, the drogbar have begun attacking the Rivermane, with &lt;a href=\"Ormgul%20the%20Pestilent\"&gt;Ormgul the Pestilent&lt;/a&gt; leading an attack on the Rivermane crops that sustain all of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rivermane totem animal is a &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;.

From &lt;a href=\"Forest%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Forest's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, Hogger led his Riverpaws into battle. Sergeant Brashclaw had a hold over the far reaches of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Fedfennel\"&gt;Fedfennel&lt;/a&gt; headed the Riverpaw presence at &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cairn%20Lake\"&gt;Stone Cairn Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence also supported rumors that the Riverpaw may have been in a loose alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Their leaders dropped a document known as &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Collector%27s%20Schedule\"&gt;:The Collector's Schedule&lt;/a&gt; indicating that there was payment being processed between the Defias and the Riverpaws. &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20the%20Collector\"&gt;Morgan the Collector&lt;/a&gt; conducted the relevant transactions of gold. &lt;a href=\"Wiley%20the%20Black\"&gt;Wiley the Black&lt;/a&gt; also revealed that the Defias were working with gnolls, &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 clearly hinting at a pact between Hogger and &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Riverpaw became a more ominous threat, raiding farms and human villages throughout &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20forest\"&gt;Elwynn forest&lt;/a&gt;. Many speculated that the historically dimwitted gnolls had conspired with another force, which was equipping them with weapons, tactical leadership, and magic. Though it is unclear what the gnolls were after, the Stormwind Marshals then realized that the creatures posed an obvious threat to the kingdom and were to be eradicated.\nCataclysm.\nAfter Hogger and some of his gnolls were captured, they were arrested and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;. Following the events of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Hogger and his gnolls took over a part of the Stockade. &lt;a href=\"Jango%20Spothide\"&gt;Jango Spothide&lt;/a&gt; rose up to lead the remaining free gnolls.\nAfter the Fourth War.\nSince Hogger's death, the Riverpaw gnolls became less well-organized, and the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; works with the to keep the gnolls at bay."}

I was in the midst of important studies, delicate magic that requires weeks of preparation and ritual.\" Kel'Thuzad had been forced to wait for hours, fuming at the insult, before he was permitted the bare courtesy of confronting his accusers. The group's apparent spokespersons, Drenden and Modera, had long been two of his most vocal critics. Nonetheless, they would not have launched this latest inquisition without support from Antonidas, who had yet to show himself. What was the old man up to?\nDrenden snorted. \"That's the first time I've heard your sort of magic called 'delicate.'\"\n\"An ignorant opinion from an ignorant man,\" said Kel'Thuzad with cold precision.\nA distant voice spoke to him then, the voice of a friend. By now its remarks had grown so familiar that they felt like his own thoughts. \"They fear and envy you. After all, thanks to this new course of study, you are continuing to gain in knowledge and power.\"\nThere was a sudden flash of light, and a scowling gray-haired archmage appeared in the hall. A small wooden chest was tucked under his arm. \"I would not have believed it if I had not seen it myself. You have abused our patience for the last time, Kel'Thuzad.\"\n\"The venerable Antonidas graces us with his presence at last. I began to think you had fallen ill.\"\n\"Age frightens you, doesn't it?\" Antonidas snapped. \"You realize there's only one alternative.\"\n\"Let him think so, if that comforts him.\"\nCalming somewhat, Antonidas said, \"As for my health, you need not have concerned yourself. I was merely busy elsewhere.\"\n\"Searching my chambers for evidence of forbidden magic? You should know better.\"\n\"True, your chambers bore no such evidence. The warehouses you own in the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand...\" Antonidas gave him a disgusted look.\nDamn the man for being a self-righteous snoop. \"You had no right...\"\nAntonidas tapped his staff to the floor, silencing him, and turned to the other magi. \"He has turned the buildings into laboratories for a series of foul experiments. See for yourself, colleagues. Behold the fruit of his labors.\" He opened the chest and tilted it so that all could see.\nThe decaying remains of several rats. Two were still scrabbling clumsily at the sides of the chest in a vain attempt to escape. Several magi bolted to their feet, and there was a hubbub of dismay. Even the golden-haired high elf who had been sitting in the back of the room seemed startled, though Prince Kael'thas was a man whose age made that feat nearly impossible.\nTurning back to the captive rats, Kel'Thuzad saw that they had collapsed and stopped moving. Another set of failures, apparently. No matter. Someday he would create a stable undead specimen. His hard work would be vindicated. It was only a matter of time.\n\"There are loose threads in the spell that silences you. Shall I show you how to unravel it?\"\nTime, and his unknown ally, whose enigmatic voice occasionally helped him to move one step closer to his goal. \"Show me,\" he thought.\nA young woman arrived in another flash of light. As she went to stand by Antonidas, the high elf's gaze followed her with troubled, brooding intensity. But Jaina Proudmoore took no notice; she was utterly focused on her duties. The handsome prince didn't stand a chance.\nHer vivid blue eyes spared Kel'Thuzad a curious glance. She took the box from Antonidas, who explained, \"My apprentice will see to it that the chest and its contents are incinerated.\"\nThe woman inclined her head and teleported from the room. Across the room, the high elf frowned at the spot she had vacated. Under other circumstances, Kel'Thuzad might have found the silent drama amusing. However, left unchallenged, Antonidas was continuing his tirade. Mutely seething, Kel'Thuzad resumed his efforts to free himself.\n\"We have permitted this state of affairs long enough. Rapped his knuckles occasionally for his more questionable pursuits. Tried to guide him. Now we find he has been practicing evil magic. The name of the Kirin Tor is fast becoming a curse on the lips of the local villagers.\"\n\"You lie!\" Kel'Thuzad burst out, and a few of the magi were his again, waiting for him to offer an explanation. \"Peasants remember the Second War just as well as we do. Say what you like about the orcs; their warlocks wielded great power. Power against which we had precious little defense. We have an obligation: we must learn to wield and counter these magics ourselves.\"\n\"To form an army of dead rats, their unnatural existence measured in hours?\" Antonidas asked dryly. \"Yes, my boy, I found your journals, too. You kept quite detailed records regarding this abominable enterprise. You cannot mean to use these pathetic creatures against orcs. Assuming, of course, that the orcs should ever emerge from their current lethargy, escape the internment camps, and somehow manage to become a threat again.\"\n\"Being younger than you hardly qualifies me for boyhood,\" retorted Kel'Thuzad. \"As for the rats, they are the gauge by which I measure my progress. It is a standard experimental technique.\"\nA sigh. \"I am aware that you spend most of your time in the north these days. Your increasingly lengthy absences were what caught my attention in the first place. Yet even you must have heard that the king's new tax has given rise to civil unrest. Your selfish pursuit of power could incite the peasantry to revolt. Lordaeron would be engulfed in civil war.\"\nHe hadn't known about the tax. Antonidas must be exaggerating. Besides, true magi would focus on matters of greater substance. \"I will be more discreet,\" he offered, gritting his teeth.\n\"No amount of discretion could possibly hide a secret of this magnitude,\" said Drenden.\nModera added, \"You know that we have always walked a fine line in order to protect our people without becoming a danger ourselves. We dare not sacrifice our humanity- not in appearance, and certainly not in truth. At best, your methods would see us condemned as heretics.\"\nIt was too much. \"We've been called heretics for centuries. The church has never been fond of our methods. Such sentiments notwithstanding, we are still here.\"\nShe nodded. \"Because we avoid dark magic, which leads to corruption and catastrophe.\"\n\"Because we are necessary!\"\n\"Enough.\" Antonidas sounded weary. To Modera and Drenden, he added, \"If words alone could have reached him, they would have done so before now.\"\n\"I have heard your words,\" Kel'Thuzad said in exasperation. \"Merciful gods, I have heard them until I am sick of them! It is you who will not hear mine, and put aside your antiquated fea...\"\n\"You mistake our purpose here today,\" interrupted Antonidas. \"This is not a debate. At this moment, your properties are being thoroughly searched. All items tainted by dark magic will be confiscated and, once identified to our satisfaction, destroyed.\"\nHis nameless ally had warned him this might happen, but Kel'Thuzad had not believed. Strange. He felt almost relieved that events had come to this pass. The need for secrecy had limited the scope of his work, hindered his advancement.\n\"In light of the evidence,\" Antonidas said heavily, \"King Terenas has agreed with our judgment. If you do not abandon this madness, you will be stripped of your rank and holdings, and you will be exiled from Dalaran- indeed, from all of Lordaeron.\"\nHis mind racing, Kel'Thuzad bowed and left the hall. Doubtless the Kirin Tor were keeping his so-called disgrace quiet, fearing repercussions should his actions become public knowledge. For once, their cowardice would work in his favor. His wealth would never line the king's coffers.\nA pack of wolves stalked Kel'Thuzad for miles, just out of spell range, before they fell behind. Glancing warily over his shoulder, he saw them snarl and flatten their ears before darting away. Thankfully the arctic winds were dying out as well. In the distance he could make out the summit, a bleak mountaintop, the sight of which gave him a sense of triumph and foreboding. The very peak of Icecrown. Few explorers had ventured onto the glacier, and even fewer had survived to tell the tale. But he, Kel'Thuzad, would scale its heights alone and look down on the rest of the world.\nUnfortunately almost no maps existed of the frigid continent of Northrend, and he found them woefully inadequate, like the supplies he'd proudly packed for this journey. Uncertain of the path ahead and his ultimate destination, he could not teleport. Not sparing himself, he staggered onward. He had lost track of how long he'd been walking. Despite his fur-lined cloak, he was shivering uncontrollably. His legs felt like pillars of stone: awkward and numb. His body was beginning to shut down. If he didn't find shelter soon, he was going to die out here.\nEventually a glint of light drew his gaze: a stone obelisk carved with magical symbols, with a citadel beyond it. At last! He hurried past the obelisk and crossed a bridge of what looked like pure energy. The citadel's doors opened at his approach, but he stopped short.\nThe entryway was guarded by two grotesque creatures that resembled giant spiders from the waist down. Six narrow legs supported each creature's weight; the other two limbs were attached like arms to a vaguely humanoid torso. More fascinating than the creatures themselves, though, was their current state. Their bodies showed an assortment of open wounds, the worst of which had been roughly bandaged. One guard's arms were bent at improbable angles. Ichor oozed from the other's fanged maw, but the guard made no effort to wipe it away.\nDespite the familiar stink of undeath, the guards showed no sign of confusion, unlike Kel'Thuzad's rats. The spider-like creatures must also have retained most of their original strength and coordination. Otherwise, they would have made poor guards. Their creator was clearly a skilled necromancer.\nTo his surprise, they moved aside to let him pass. Unwilling to question his good fortune, he gladly entered the citadel, which was significantly warmer. In the hallway ahead was a battered statue of one of the half-spider creatures. The building itself was of recent construction, but the statue was quite old. Come to think of it, he'd seen similar statues in the ancient ruins he'd passed through on his way north. The cold was slowing his wits.\nAt a guess, the necromancer had conquered a kingdom of these spider-like beings, successfully converted them into undeath, and taken their treasures as the spoils of war. Exultation filled him. He would surely learn great things here.\nAt the end of the hall, a gigantic creature lumbered into view: a grotesque mixture of beetle and spider. It approached him at a deliberate pace, and Kel'Thuzad observed that its towering body sported an even greater number of wounds and bandages. Like the guards, it was undead, but its sheer bulk made him feel more frightened than impressed. He doubted he had sufficient skill to vanquish such a monster, much less raise it from the dead.\nThe creature greeted him in a deep bass voice that reverberated within its ponderous body. Although it spoke perfectly understandable Common, the sound chilled him. Strange buzzing and clicking underlaid its words. \"The master has been expecting you, archmage. I am Anub'arak.\"\nIt had both the intelligence and motor skills for speech - astonishing! \"Yes. I wish to become his apprentice.\"\nThe huge creature simply looked down at him. Possibly it was debating whether he would make a tasty snack.\nHe cleared his throat nervously. \"May I see him?\"\n\"In due time,\" Anub'arak rumbled. \"Thus far, you have devoted your life to the pursuit of knowledge. An admirable goal. Still, your experiences as a mage cannot have prepared you for serving the master.\"\nWhat could have inspired such a speech? Did the majordomo consider Kel'Thuzad a rival? That was a misconception to dispel as soon as possible. \"As a former member of the Kirin Tor, I have more magic at my command than you could probably imagine. I am more than prepared for whatever tasks the master gives me.\"\n\"We shall see.\"\nAnub'arak led him through a number of tunnels that took them far beneath the earth. At last Kel'Thuzad and his guide emerged into a vast ziggurat whose name, so Anub'arak said, was Naxxramas. From its architecture, the building was another product of the half-spider creatures. Indeed, the first chambers Anub'arak showed him were populated by the undead things, which swiftly lost their novelty. Actual spiders also skittered here and there among the undead, busily spinning cobwebs and laying eggs. Kel'Thuzad hid his distaste. He wouldn't give the enormous majordomo the satisfaction. Indicating one of the undead spider-things, he said, \"You bear them some resemblance. Are you all derived from the same race?\"\n\"The nerubian race, yes. Then the master came. As his influence spread, we made war upon him, foolishly believing we stood a chance. Many of us were slain and raised into undeath. In life I was a king. Today I am a crypt lord.\"\n\"In return for immortality, you agreed to serve him,\" Kel'Thuzad mused aloud. Remarkable.\n\"'Agreed' implies choice.\"\nWhich meant that the necromancer could compel obedience from the undead. Kel'Thuzad might be the first living being to come here of his own free will. Faintly disquieted, he changed the subject. \"This place is full of your people. I take it you rule here?\"\n\"After my death, I led my brethren in conquering this ziggurat for our new master. I also oversaw the process of altering it to serve his design. However, Naxxramas does not fall under my authority. Nor are my people its only occupants. This is but one wing out of four.\"\n\"In that case, lead on, crypt lord. Show me the rest.\"\nThe second wing was everything Kel'Thuzad could have hoped. Magical artifacts, laboratory equipment, and other supplies that put his old laboratories to shame. Huge rooms that could hold a veritable army of assistants. Undead beasts that had been cleverly sewn together from a hodgepodge of animals and reanimated. Even a few undead humanoids composed of body parts from assorted humans. The human body parts bore no wounds: unlike the nerubians, the humans had not fought their fate. The necromancer must have acquired the bodies from a local graveyard. Wise to avoid drawing notice. The Kirin Tor would have taken immediate action.\nUnfortunately the third wing proved less interesting. Anub'arak showed him an armory and an area for combat training. Next the crypt lord led him through chambers filled with hundreds - no, thousands - of sealed barrels and shipping crates. Why would Naxxramas need so much in the way of supplies? Well, the pyramid was well stocked in the unlikely event that it was besieged.\nAt last he and Anub'arak reached the last wing. Giant mushrooms grew in a garden area and gave off noxious fumes that made Kel'Thuzad feel ill. The soil beneath each mushroom seemed unhealthy, possibly diseased. Going closer to inspect it, he stepped on something that squished: a fist-sized creature that resembled a maggot.\nHe shuddered and hastily moved on. The next room had a number of small cauldrons filled with a bubbling greenish liquid. Curious despite the substance's revolting odor, Kel'Thuzad took a step forward, but a massive claw abruptly blocked his way.\n\"The master wishes you to remain among the living. Your time has not yet come.\"\nHis breath caught in his throat. \"It would have killed me?\"\n\"There are many who will not serve the master in life. The fluid resolves that difficulty.\" At Kel'Thuzad's blank look, the crypt lord said, \"Come. I will show you.\"\nAnub'arak took him to a cell that held two prisoners. Villagers, by their homespun clothing. The man was cradling the woman in his arms; she was ghastly pale and soaked in sweat. Alive, both of them, though the woman was clearly ill. Kel'Thuzad glanced at the crypt lord uneasily.\nHer desperate glassy eyes found Kel'Thuzad and brightened. \"Mercy, my lord! My body fails. I have seen what will happen next. One bolt of flame, I beg of you. Let me rest in peace.\"\nShe was afraid of becoming the necromancer's thrall. According to Anub'arak, she would have no choice. Kel'Thuzad looked away queasily. After all, she couldn't live much longer anyway.\nShe struggled out of the man's arms and clung to the cell bars. \"For pity's sake! If you will not aid me, at least take my husband to safety!\" And she wept hopelessly.\n\"Hush, sweetheart,\" the man murmured behind her. \"I will not leave you.\"\n\"Make her be quiet!\" Kel'Thuzad whispered fiercely at Anub'arak.\n\"The noise distresses you?\" With one lightning-quick motion, Anub'arak shot one claw through the bars and speared the woman through the heart. Then the crypt lord casually shook the corpse off onto the floor.\nHer husband howled with anguish. Guiltily relieved, Kel'Thuzad began to turn away, but froze when the corpse started thrashing and arching against the stone floor. The male villager gaped in shock and fell silent.\nThe dead woman's skin was changing color: shifting to a faintly greenish gray. Gradually the spasms died off, and she scrambled unsteadily to her feet. She rolled her head to one side, then shivered as she spotted her husband. \"Guards, get this man out of here.\" she rasped.\nThe guards didn't move. With a groan, she raked her fingers through her tangled brown hair, and Kel'Thuzad got a good look at her face. Blood vessels were darkening under the skin, and her eyes seemed feral, crazed.\nHer husband asked doubtfully, \"My love? Are you all right?\"\nA bitter laugh escaped her and twisted into a snarl when he took a hesitant step toward her. \"Don't come any closer.\"\nThe man ignored her protest and went toward her, but she shoved him away with enough force to send him flying. He hit the cell bars and slid down, stunned.\n\"Stay back.\" Her speech was becoming more guttural. \"Hurt you.\" She wrapped her arms around herself, backed up until she bumped against the opposite side of the cell. \"Hurt you, hurt you,\" she whined, and something began to be wrong with the way she said it.\nUncomprehending, Kel'Thuzad watched her slowly, jerkily lift a hand to the hole in her chest. She hissed, grimaced, and brought her fingers to her mouth. Licked them. Sucked at them. Then in a blur of movement, she was leaping at her husband, lashing out, baring her teeth -\nThe man screamed, and blood spurted onto the cell floor. Kel'Thuzad flinched away. Closing his eyes didn't help; he could still hear unspeakable sounds. Ripping, shredding. Chewing. A soft, wretched mewling that he very much feared meant the undead woman was aware of her actions on some level, but unable to stop herself.\nSickened and horrified, he teleported out of Naxxramas altogether, staggered a little distance away, and threw up. Finding a patch of unsullied snow, he scooped up handfuls and scrubbed viciously at his mouth and face. It felt as if he would never be clean again. What had he gotten himself involved in?\nOne by one, his scattered thoughts fell into place. The necromancer was no simple academic, interested in studying a widely condemned field of magic. Nor did he plan to stop at fortifying his home against attack. He was mass-producing a fluid that converted people into zombies. Naxxramas also had an enormous stockpile of supplies, weapons, armor, training grounds...\nThese weren't defensive measures. They were preparations for war.\nA sudden wind buffeted him with an unearthly shriek, and a group of cold wraiths coalesced in front of his eyes. He had read of them years ago in the Violet Citadel. The vague description of their cloudy, translucent forms had mentioned nothing of the frigid malice in their glowing eyes.\nOne of the wraiths drifted closer and asked, \"Second thoughts? As you see, your little trick will not avail you. You cannot escape the master. At any rate, what could you hope to accomplish? Where would you go? More to the point, who would believe you?\"\nFight or flight: those would have been the heroic choices. Heroic, but pointless. His death would serve nothing. By agreeing to become the necromancer's apprentice, Kel'Thuzad bought himself time in which to bolster his own skills. With enough training, he could surpass the necromancer or catch the man off guard.\nHe nodded to the wraith. \"Very well. Take me to him.\"\nThe wraiths teleported him back to the citadel and escorted him downward through a series of halls and rooms that Kel'Thuzad knew he wouldn't be able to remember later. At last, deep beneath the earth, he and the wraiths entered a huge cavern whose dank chill sank into his bones. In the center of the cavern was a dizzyingly tall spire of rock. Blanketed in snow, a set of stairs spiraled up the sides of the spire.\nHe and the wraiths began the ascent. His heart pounded with excitement and dread. When he realized that his steps were slowing, he sped up again. His resolution didn't last long, however. It felt as if a weight was pulling at him. Evidently the long journey across Northrend had tired him more than he'd thought.\nFar above him, at the top of the spire, he could barely make out a large chunk of crystal. Untouched by snow, it had a faint bluish gleam. There was no sign of the necromancer.\nOne of the wraiths used a frigid gust of wind to give him a push. His pace had been lagging again. Irritably he tugged his cloak closer and forced himself to keep climbing, though he was breathing hard.\nTime passed, and a blast of sleet brought him back to full awareness. He had stopped in the middle of the stairs to lean on his staff. The air was foul and suffocating; he was panting by now. \"Give me a moment,\" he managed.\nA wraith behind him said, \"We cannot rest. Why should you?\"\nGrimly Kel'Thuzad resumed the climb and hunched his shoulders against the growing exhaustion. He raised his head with an effort and saw that the glimmering crystal was drawing close. At this distance, it looked like a jagged throne with hazy dark shapes inside it. There was a palpable aura of menace about the thing.\nThe wraiths brushed against him and startled him into crying out. Echoes of the sound reverberated throughout the cavern. He clutched at his fur cloak with clammy, trembling hands. His breath rattled in the back of his throat, and he had the sudden terrible urge to turn around and start running. \"Where is the master?\" he asked, and his voice was high and quavering.\nNo answer, just a storm of hail that lashed at him cruelly. He stumbled and recovered his footing. With each step, the throne looming above him felt more oppressive, pushing his head down, bending his spine. He could barely walk upright. Before long, he fell to his hands and knees.\nThe necromancer spoke directly to Kel'Thuzad then in a voice that was no longer even remotely kind. \"Let this be your first lesson. I have no love for you or your people. On the contrary, I intend to scour humanity from this planet, and make no mistake: I have the power to do it.\"\nRelentless, the wraiths did not permit him to stop. Beyond humiliation, he abandoned his staff and began to crawl. The necromancer's malevolence beat down upon him and pressed him deeper into the snow. Kel'Thuzad was shaking and whimpering, and o gods, he'd been wrong--stupidly, colossally wrong. This wasn't fatigue. It was stark terror.\n\"You will never catch me unaware, for I do not sleep, and as you should have already guessed, I can read your thoughts as easily as you might read a book. Nor can you hope to defeat me. Your puny mind is incapable of handling the energies I manipulate on a whim.\"\nKel'Thuzad had long since torn his robes, and his leggings were useless against the icy rock of the rough-hewn stairs. His hands and knees left bloody tracks behind him as he struggled up the last spiral. The throne radiated bone-chilling cold, and mist surrounded it. A throne not of crystal, but of ice.\n\"Immortality can be a great boon. It can also be agony the likes of which you have not yet begun to fathom. Defy me, and I will teach you what I have learned of pain. You will beg for death.\"\nHe came within a few feet of the throne and could go no farther, pinned helplessly beneath the thing's overwhelming aura of inhuman might and hatred. An unseen force bore down on him and ground the side of his face into the unyielding stone. \"Please,\" he found himself sobbing. \"Please!\" Further words escaped him.\nFinally the pressure eased. The wraiths flitted away, but he knew better than to rise. Doubted, in any case, that he could. His eyes, however, unwillingly sought out his tormentor.\nA set of plate armor was seated within the throne, rather than upon it. Kel'Thuzad might have thought the armor merely black, but, blinking hard, he saw that no light at all was reflected from its surface. In fact, the longer he looked, the more it seemed to devour all light, hope, and sanity.\nThe ornate spiked helm obviously doubled as a crown. It was set with a single blue gem and, like the rest of the armor, appeared empty. In one gauntlet, the figure clasped a massive sword whose blade had been etched with runes. Here was power. Here was despair.\n\"As my lieutenant, you will gain knowledge and magic to surpass your most ambitious dreams. But in return, living or dead, you will serve me for the rest of your days. If you betray me, I shall make you into one of my mindless ones, and you will serve me still.\"\nServing this spectral being--this Lich King, as Kel'Thuzad was beginning to think of him--would assuredly bring Kel'Thuzad great power... and damn him for all eternity. But that knowledge came far too late. Besides, damnation had little meaning without the prospect of true death.\n\"I am yours. I swear it,\" he said hoarsely.\nIn response, the Lich King sent him a vision of Naxxramas. Small black-robed figures stood in a broad circle outside on the glacier. Their arms, visibly wreathed in dark magic, rose and fell in time with a droning chant that eluded Kel'Thuzad's understanding. Tremors shook the earth beneath their feet, but they kept casting.\n\"You will go forth and bear witness to my power. You will be my ambassador to the living, and assemble a group of like-minded people to further my plans. Through illusion, persuasion, sickness, and force of arms, you will establish my hold upon Azeroth.\"\nTo Kel'Thuzad's astonishment, the ice shifted and cracked, and the top of a ziggurat pierced the frozen ground. A building was being pulled up out of the soil. While the robed figures redoubled their efforts, the vast pyramid continued its impossible emergence. Chunks of dirt and ice flew outward with explosive force. Soon the entire structure had broken free of the earth's embrace. Slowly but surely, Naxxramas rose into the air.\n\"And this will be your vessel.\""}

It can also be played during any game of \"Warcraft III\" by entering the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20cheat%20codes\"&gt;cheat code&lt;/a&gt; \"TenthLevelTaurenChieftain\". The song repeatedly appears in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the band's in-game concerts.\nThe song \"appears\" on Elite Tauren Chieftain's fictional 2003 album, also titled \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\". A &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202005\"&gt;BlizzCon 2005&lt;/a&gt; announcement jokingly asserts the song as a \"multimillion-selling\" single, and the fictional album it derived from as best remembered for the \"popular little computer game\" that was included with it as a bonus feature, while these \"facts\" were quite the opposite in reality (the song itself included as a bonus to the highly popular expansion to \"\").\n\"Power of the Horde\" was adapted from one of the band's previously existing songs called \"The Serpent and the Slave\". Since there was not enough time to write entirely new music in time for the release of \"The Frozen Throne\", &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt; simply took the song's lyrics and altered them to be \"Warcraft\"-themed.\nIn-game availability.\n\"Power of the Horde\" can be heard in \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\"'s ending credits, or by playing it in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20World%20Editor\"&gt;Warcraft III World Editor&lt;/a&gt;'s sound manager, where can be found as \"PH1.mp3,\" or by entering \"TenthLevelTaurenChieftain\" in the chat box, enabling a &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20cheat%20codes\"&gt;cheat&lt;/a&gt; which plays the song. This cheat can be used in both \"Warcraft III\"'s mode and The Frozen Throne mode, but will only play in the former mode if the expansion set has been installed.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1.2\"&gt;patch 2.1.2&lt;/a&gt;, the song was included in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", as well. It can be heard in the game by entering \"codice_1\" (pre-&lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.0\"&gt;patch 8.2.0&lt;/a&gt;) or \"codice_2\" (post-patch 8.2.0) in the &lt;a href=\"chat\"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; box. The filename \"DMF_L70ETC01.mp3\" was the first indication of the band's name change, from \"Level 60\" to \"Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain\", keeping their Tauren Chieftain up to date as the highest level obtainable in ; the prefix \"DMF\" refers to the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;, the band's new location near &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, they have updated their name up for newer levels up until 2014 when they decided to keep it as Elite Tauren Chieftain.\nIf you have &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%27s%20Remote\"&gt;Direbrew's Remote&lt;/a&gt;, you can take it to the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Guzzler\"&gt;Grim Guzzler&lt;/a&gt;, talk to the roadies on the lower level to bring the band in for a \"Practice Session\" to hear the song. It also plays nightly at 8pm server time."}

But there is more to it than that.\nHe asks you to go out and collect some additional materials..\nYour contact has concocted 10 doses of &lt;a href=\"Curative%20Animal%20Salve\"&gt;Curative Animal Salve&lt;/a&gt;, which he asks you to apply to the local wildlife (Deer or Gazelle, depending on faction). These are easily identified, and you manage to apply the salve.\nLocal officials are busy making more of the salve, your job is pretty much done here.\nBack you go to &lt;a href=\"Dendrite%20Starblaze\"&gt;Dendrite Starblaze&lt;/a&gt;.\nStarblaze remands you to the mentor who started you on this journey, with the admonition to remember the difficulties faced by the rest of the world.\nYou return to your mentor, who applauds your efforts, and teaches you a spell that gives you a more permanent power over poison than that given by mere salves and potions.\nRewards.\nThe primary reward is the spell &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Poison\"&gt;Cure Poison&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the course of the quest chain, you will also gain"}

The &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; would then be free to instantly re-enter the shapeshift form that was just left. Some &lt;a href=\"Macro\"&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt; would even put the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; back in the form as well with no extra &lt;a href=\"hotkey\"&gt;hotkey&lt;/a&gt; presses or mouse clicks necessary. All of these methods of quickly shapeshifting out of and back into a form became collectively known as \"powershifting\". \nControversy.\nIn practice, the manual methods for powershifting were not commonly used by skilled players nor recommended by the community as they were highly inconvenient and considerably more error prone than the practically flawless &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; based methods. \nAs a result of the almost necessary &lt;a href=\"macros\"&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt; that were used to powershift, players have argued that powershifting was in fact an &lt;a href=\"exploit\"&gt;exploit&lt;/a&gt;, or at least similar in nature to one. \nOthers have claimed that since, while awkward, it was entirely possible to perform powershifting through the default &lt;a href=\"user%20interface\"&gt;user interface&lt;/a&gt; or regular &lt;a href=\"Hotkey\"&gt;hotkeys&lt;/a&gt; found in the default keybinding menu, without the help of &lt;a href=\"AddOn\"&gt;addons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"macros\"&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt;, that powershifting must have been entirely intentional or at least not against the rules or spirit of the game. \nRemoval.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.0.3\"&gt;Patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, the pre-patch of , all methods of leaving a form were made to incur a 1.5 second &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; on the form that was just left. This effectively made powershifting impossible. \nAt the time Blizzard argued that the removal of the mechanic, which had grown into a staple of especially the &lt;a href=\"Feral\"&gt;Feral&lt;/a&gt; specialization toolkit, was due to the frequent shapeshifting causing the &lt;a href=\"client\"&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"lag\"&gt;lag&lt;/a&gt; and that this fairly non-obvious mechanic was a detriment to players who did not know of or use advanced macros. \nSimilar arguments have been used by Blizzard when removing other mechanics which necessitated, or greatly benefited from, using &lt;a href=\"Macro\"&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"AddOn\"&gt;addons&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of such events include the introduction of dynamic &lt;a href=\"stat\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; scaling periodic damage effects in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2%23Periodic%20effects\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; following the rise in popularity of &lt;a href=\"AddOn\"&gt;addons&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20181117072030/https%3A//www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/affdots\"&gt;AffDots&lt;/a&gt; to simplify usage of the &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2%23Periodic%20effects\"&gt;snapshotting&lt;/a&gt; mechanic of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;dots&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternatives.\nOver the years multiple abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Prowl\"&gt;Prowl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiger%27s%20Fury\"&gt;Tiger's Fury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dash%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt; have been made to automatically enter a &lt;a href=\"Druid%20shapeshift%20forms\"&gt;shapeshift form&lt;/a&gt; on activation, ignoring any cooldown on the form. This can be used to circumvent the 1.5 second cooldown and enable quick or instant re-entering of the form that was just left. This is however very limited, as these abilities all have significant cooldowns of their own.\nAdditionally, it is possible to avoid wasting the 1.5 seconds of downtime by using an ability in &lt;a href=\"Druid%20shapeshift%20forms\"&gt;caster form&lt;/a&gt; or to enter another &lt;a href=\"form\"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;, although this is not considered powershifting as it is not re-entering the \"same\" \"form\" quickly. Moreover, it is commonly not optimal to do this as it is usually not what the user would like to do, which is likely to just quickly re-enter the form that was left.\nUse Cases.\nFuror and Wolfshead Helm.\nUp until , the talent &lt;a href=\"Furor\"&gt;Furor&lt;/a&gt; would grant the user an instant boost of &lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rage\"&gt;Rage&lt;/a&gt; after entering &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; respectively, as opposed to starting with none.\nBy making use of the powershifting mechanism in combination with the &lt;a href=\"Furor\"&gt;Furor&lt;/a&gt; talent an advanced technique used by many skilled and knowledgeable &lt;a href=\"Feral\"&gt;Feral&lt;/a&gt; players was created. In order to maximize &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; and thereby &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; players would frequently powershift when low on &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; and rapidly consume &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mana%20potions\"&gt;Mana Potions&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent running out of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;. The technique was often used in conjunction with the infamous level 40 &lt;a href=\"Wolfshead%20Helm\"&gt;Wolfshead Helm&lt;/a&gt; which caused the strange appearance of very high-geared &lt;a href=\"Feral\"&gt;Feral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s raiding in full &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; tier sets and the latest, best gear, but still using a &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; helm for characters not even level 60 which was crafted with simple materials.\nThis technique was rendered ineffective in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the pre-patch, when the &lt;a href=\"Furor\"&gt;Furor&lt;/a&gt; talent was intentionally altered slightly to make the technique not work any longer. According to a Blizzard poster on the &lt;a href=\"Forum\"&gt;official forums&lt;/a&gt; the technique will not return as it was never intended and caused some rather strange player behaviour.\nDisentanglement.\nSince the initial release of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; all &lt;a href=\"Druid%20shapeshift%20forms\"&gt;Druid shapeshift forms&lt;/a&gt; have, with a partial exception for all specializations except &lt;a href=\"Druid%23Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; during the expansion, had the &lt;a href=\"Disentanglement%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Disentanglement&lt;/a&gt; effect built in or otherwise offered, thereby allowing the user to remove any movement impairing effects with the activation of a &lt;a href=\"Druid%20shapeshift%20forms\"&gt;shapeshift form&lt;/a&gt;.\nA technique in which the user powershifts to efficiently get rid of such effects was thus developed and utilized heavily especially in &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, with macros and guides suggesting its use as early as in . \nThe technique was well-known by players and Blizzard alike for many expansions without any signs that Blizzard was not accepting of its use. Proponents of the technique have therefore long argued that it can be assumed that the removal of powershifting was actually caused by Blizzard wanting to &lt;a href=\"nerf\"&gt;nerf&lt;/a&gt; the mobility of primarily the &lt;a href=\"Feral\"&gt;Feral specialization&lt;/a&gt;, and in order to avoid criticism opting to do so by disguising the &lt;a href=\"nerf\"&gt;nerf&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"bug\"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; fix of powershifting. \nTerminology.\nThe term is sometimes assumed to only refer to the &lt;a href=\"Furor\"&gt;Furor&lt;/a&gt;-related technique, or the &lt;a href=\"Disentanglement%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Disentanglement&lt;/a&gt;-related technique. It is often the case that players who predominantly participate in &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; activities refer primarily to the &lt;a href=\"Disentanglement%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Disentanglement&lt;/a&gt;-related technique when using the term, whereas players who predominantly participate in &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Environment\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; activities refer to the &lt;a href=\"Furor\"&gt;Furor&lt;/a&gt;-related technique. \nThere are also other, less common, uses of the term related to various convenience &lt;a href=\"macros\"&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt; which choose form based on modifiers and the current location of the player, see &lt;a href=\"Useful%20macros%20for%20druids%23WoD%20Power%20Shifting%20Macro\"&gt;Useful macros for druids&lt;/a&gt; for reference. \nReal Life Reference.\nThe term originates from the real-life motor racing term which refers to \"The clutch [being] briefly depressed while the shift lever is slammed from gear to gear, keeping the engine in its power band.\" See &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powershifting\"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for reference."}

Like many currently aboard the barge, he was previously located at the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; which he had built along with &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20Brassbolts\"&gt;Fizzle Brassbolts&lt;/a&gt;, his long-standing rival, because they wanted to prove the superiority of their respective race engineering. Both of them then built rocket cars and enlisted teams to drive them. He used to be one of the most respected &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;ers in &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt; before he retired to start working on the racers. Once he joined the new team, he developed the two engine model racers.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he is affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nPozzik is a member of MEGA, the &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Engineers%27%20Guild%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Mechanical Engineers' Guild of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Nazmir\"&gt;Faction Assault on Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, he directed Horde champions to use &lt;a href=\"Pozzik%27s%20Experimental%20Bomber\"&gt;Pozzik's Experimental Bomber&lt;/a&gt; against the Alliance on the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Span\"&gt;Sundered Span&lt;/a&gt;.\nPozzik was among those who attended the private auction for the &lt;a href=\"X-52%20Personnel%20Armor\"&gt;X-52 Personnel Armor&lt;/a&gt;. After Gallywix took &lt;a href=\"Hobart%20Grapplehammer\"&gt;Hobart Grapplehammer&lt;/a&gt; hostage to get the armor for himself, Pozzik joined the battle against Gallywix. After Hobart was freed and Gallywix beaten, the armor fell into the possession of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Gallywix's old rival&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nIt's all I can do to keep this ship from tearing itself apart and I still have to deal with puffed up baffoons like Fizzle here!"}

It is automatically learned for Holy priests.\nPrayer of Mending a buff similar to &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shield\"&gt;Earth Shield&lt;/a&gt;. It will not actually heal the target when cast on them, but instead place a &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; on the target. When the buffed target takes any damage, the buff will heal the target, and move to another random raid member within 20 yards. The buff has 5 charges, and will not proc from environmental damage (falling, lava, fatigue, etc) nor damage that is absorbed, such as with . Spells that reduce the caster's own HP such as &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt; will not proc PoM.\nStrategy.\nPrayer of Mending is often cast on the &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt; before engaging combat. Pre-casting before combat will begin the spell's 12-second &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; and possibly allow mana regeneration before the fight begins. Waiting several seconds between casting the first Prayer of Mending and engaging combat allows a subsequent PoM to be cast immediately (or almost immediately) after the initial spell procs.\nPrayer of Mending's benefits over other multiple-target heal spells include large range and low mana cost (particularly in situations where most or all of the charges proc). There are some drawbacks, however, including the long cooldown, inability to stack on multiple targets, inability to heal multiple targets simultaneously, inability to target the heal after the first proc, and a maximum of 5 procs every 12 seconds. That said, combining PoM and other group healing spells (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt;) can be an extremely useful way to do a great deal of healing on a number of targets in a short period of time.\nPrayer of Mending also lends itself to group healing during mob grinds, particularly where the priest themselves is capable of (albeit slowly) taking on a single mob at a time. Have each member of the party hold the &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; of separate mobs. As each person is hit, the PoM will bounce from one to the other doing the sustained healing; allowing the priest to take a break from healbotting. Whenever a &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt; in the party finishes their mob, they should target a new mob instead of coming back to assist the priest. The goal is to spread the damage, and thus the chance for PoM to jump."}

Having initiated the spell, Illidan &lt;a href=\"banish\"&gt;banished&lt;/a&gt; four &lt;a href=\"Naga%20Summoner\"&gt;Naga Summoners&lt;/a&gt; and set them to channel the spell, whilst he marshalled his forces into defense of the ruins.\nUnaware of Illidan's intentions, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; had joined &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; in her quest to bring Illidan to justice, and had trailed Illidan to Lordaeron. Troubled by the ravaged state of Lordaeron's forests, Malfurion traveled on his own into the heart of the trees in order to convene with their spirits. Maiev and Tyrande made the acquaintance of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shards%20of%20the%20Alliance%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;aided him&lt;/a&gt; in retreating with a group of his people through Scourge territory. However after holding back a horde of approaching Undead on a bridge, Whisperwind was washed away by the river deep into Silverpine Forest, which was then a Scourge stronghold. Horrified, Prince Kael suggested they attempt to rescue her, but Maiev reminded him of his promise to help the Night Elves capture Illidan, which she believed took precedence.\nMeanwhile, Malfurion's meditation was interrupted with terrible visions of wild magic being unleashed upon Northrend. Realising this to be the work of Illidan, he quickly reconvened with Maiev near Dalaran, who told him that she had seen Tyrande \"torn apart with my own eyes\". Driven mad with grief, Malfurion resolved to destroy Illidan once and for all, even as his brother's mighty spell entered its final stage.\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nSpell of Destruction.\n\"Illidan's Summoners have begun channeling a powerful spell through the Eye of Sargeras that threatens to tear the planet asunder. Time is running out as they come ever closer to finishing their diabolical chanting. You must slay all four Summoners before time runs out, but they have turned ethereal and can only be harmed by magic. Use one of the following to damage the Summoners.&lt;br&gt;Faerie Dragon - Mana Flare&lt;br&gt;Chimaeras - Attack&lt;br&gt;Druid of the Talon - Attack&lt;br&gt;Maiev's Fan of Knives or Shadow Strike Spells&lt;br&gt;Malfurion's Entangling Roots Spell\"\nOptional Quests.\nSave the Paladin.\n\"There is a Paladin being held behind the Naga. Break him free of his cage, and he may aid you in the destruction of Illidan's forces.\"\nThe battle.\nThe Scourge of the area had been stirred into action; Prince Kael marshaled his forces into defending the Night Elves from the Undead so they could concentrate on attacking the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;. As the Night Elves tested the Illidari defenses their scouts found that the Naga had captured a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt;. The Night Elves rescued him and the grateful &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; reciprocated by lending his holy powers to the Elven assault.\nIllidan and his Naga defended the four Summoners bitterly as the mighty spell caused the ground to shake and thunder to roll. Having broken the Naga line of defence, Malfurion and Maiev organized flocks of &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Dragon\"&gt;Faerie Dragons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chimaera\"&gt;Chimaera&lt;/a&gt; to attack the banished units. At last, the final Summoner fell, the Eye of Sargeras was destroyed and the Naga retreated in disarray. Illidan was entangled by Malfurion even as he pleaded with his brother that the Archdruid didn't know what he had just prevented.\nAftermath.\nBrushing aside Illidan's pleas, Malfurion prepared to kill Illidan for his reckless actions and for the slaying of his beloved, Tyrande. At this point Prince Kael interrupted, suggesting that Tyrande may very well be alive, as she had only been washed away downriver. Realizing that he had been tricked by Maiev, Malfurion turned his entanglement on the unrepentant Warden and united with Illidan, who was shocked that his actions had inadvertently endangered the life of his one-time love, in an &lt;a href=\"The%20Brothers%20Stormrage%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;attempt to track her down&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt is thought that &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Serpentra\"&gt;Lady Serpentra&lt;/a&gt; was slain during this battle; it is not clear why &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; was not present. &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt; went on to marshall attempts to rescue human survivors of the Scourge from Lordaeron, and was slain by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; in so doing."}

Their warships stayed close to shore with a zeppelin overhead; their &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and towers were upgraded as soon as their supply of resources permitted. Construction continued with a &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"goblin%20alchemist\"&gt;goblin alchemist&lt;/a&gt; to produce more fliers for the invasion. A second &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; was erected to double their &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; production, and soon they had a powerful flotilla in the bay.\nSix massive juggernaughts sailed out with a zeppelin overhead to spot enemy &lt;a href=\"Submarine\"&gt;submersibles&lt;/a&gt;, and they began the slow process of pounding the defenses on the central island. Keeping the ship together, they made constant strikes on single targets, then sailed back out of range to regroup. Enemy ballistae were drawn out to shore for their destruction. With most of the towers removed, they then started attacking the shipyards at both villages. Many of their juggernaughts were sunk in the process, but more were constantly produced to replace them. Once the Alliance's naval power was decimated, the juggernaughts moved in close to shore on the island and removed most of the land structures to make way for a landing.\nWhile the island was being pounded, an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mound\"&gt;ogre mound&lt;/a&gt; went up within the Horde's base and twelve ogres were loaded on &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s to assault the island. Resistance was minimal and soon the runestone was theirs. This sent a clear signal to the remaining humans in the other village, who beat a hasty retreat. Urok believed their might was growing daily and that their morale was higher than it had ever been, even during the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Only one drops per kill.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Saronite\"&gt;Primordial Saronite&lt;/a&gt; can either be obtained through bosses on 25 player, or by purchasing them for 266 &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt; and/or the Auction House. This will require either 6650 Justice Points or a large sum of gold (exactly how much depends on the prices on your server).\nUpon obtaining all of the items, the quest is turned in at the &lt;a href=\"runeforge\"&gt;runeforge&lt;/a&gt; to the left (as you face him) of Darion Mograine in Light's Hammer.

But part of that includes the northern parts of Ashenvale. And a small area near the border - the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Vale\"&gt;Howling Vale&lt;/a&gt; - has been overtaken by some mysterious wolf-men. The sentinel wants you to go to the &lt;a href=\"shrine%20of%20Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;shrine of Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt; and see if the Tome of Mel'Thandris can explain any of what is going on there.\nYou pass through the howling vale, dodging or dispatching the wolf-men nearby, and reach the shrine. &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf priestess, had been here, and some of the recent events nearby had been recorded. Among these, that &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; had given her an item with great powers - the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nSentinel Frostshadow believes that this scythe is worth further investigation.\n&lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde&lt;/a&gt; had been Melyria's predecessor at Forest Song, before she disappeared. The sentinel directs you to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, to speak with &lt;a href=\"Thyn%27tel%20Bladeweaver\"&gt;Thyn'tel Bladeweaver&lt;/a&gt;, one of the commanders of the Darnassus Sentinels, in hopes that she might know more of what happened.\nVelinde is very much still trusted in Darnassus, and is expected to return at any time. Thyn'tel insists on knowing more before saying anything about her departure.\nUpon hearing the story, though, he suggests that you look through her &lt;a href=\"Velinde%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;, in the Sentinel's bunkhouse. You find the journal without much trouble, but do find worrisome details in the journal.\nYou return to Thyn'tel and show her the entries from the journal, and now you've got \"her\" interested as well.\nVelinde's last journal entry speaks of her taking ship in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thyn%27tel%20Bladeweaver\"&gt;Thyn'tel Bladeweaver&lt;/a&gt; enlists your aid tracking down what happened to Velinde, and tells you to seek the master of the dock in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;, the only port in the Barrens.\nThe way to &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; is difficult, with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; controlling the area, but you finally make it there.\n&lt;a href=\"Wharfmaster%20Dizzywig\"&gt;Wharfmaster Dizzywig&lt;/a&gt; eventually finds record that &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde&lt;/a&gt; had taken the Black Osprey to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Since there was no note otherwise, it is presumed she got there. The wharfmaster suggests you talk to the caravan master there, if you want to track her after she left the town there.\nWhile initially almost hostile (thinking you were going to waste his time), you explain your story to &lt;a href=\"Caravaneer%20Ruzzgot\"&gt;Caravaneer Ruzzgot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Ruzzgot tells you that he last saw her headed for &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, and that the clerk (&lt;a href=\"Clerk%20Daltry\"&gt;Clerk Daltry&lt;/a&gt;) there could look in his records to find whether she got there.\n&lt;a href=\"Clerk%20Daltry\"&gt;Clerk Daltry&lt;/a&gt; is little more helpful, not having any record of any night elf priestesses staying in Darkshire. However, mention of the &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; perk up his ears. The Carevin Family are monster hunters, and a hunter who works with them recently came in to town with a string of Worgen heads. He directs you to &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Carevin\"&gt;Jonathan Carevin&lt;/a&gt;, head of their household.\n&lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Carevin\"&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; turns out also to have not heard of your elven priestess, but has heard a fair bit about the Worgen. He's been hunting them. And he can direct you to where they were first found... &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou head off to the now-abandoned mine, and investigate. Searching through a pile of dirt in the cave, you disturb the spectre of &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt; herself. \nYou return to Jonathan Carevin with the spectre's tale. Johnathan understands that he doesn't have the resources to end the Worgen issue once and for all, but vows to keep it as contained as he can.\nAnd finally, you return to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, to tell &lt;a href=\"Thyn%27tel%20Bladeweaver\"&gt;Thyn'tel Bladeweaver&lt;/a&gt; of Velinde's fate. Thyn'tel is sorry to hear of Velinde's demise, but is grateful for your having uncovered the full story.\nRewards.\nFor seeing this chain of quests through to completion you earn...\nSummary.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;"}

He defended the draenei as they evaded the demonic army of the Burning Legion across countless worlds. As a paladin of the Holy Light, Maraad epitomized the strong arm of righteousness. His weapon, the Hammer of the Naaru, meted out punishment to anyone who threatened his kind. He vowed to protect the innocent. But when the draenei came under attack by orcs on Draenor, Maraad failed to uphold that pledge. Catastrophe befell his people, and it haunted him since that day. Barely surviving the orcs' attempt to exterminate them, the draenei came to Azeroth.\nAfter harboring regret for many years, Maraad learned that the orc traitor Garrosh Hellscream had forced his way into an alternate version of Draenor's past. There, the orcs had forged most of their clans into an Iron Horde, a confederation of destruction that endangered two worlds: Draenor and Azeroth. Maraad agreed to help lead the forces of the noble Alliance as they stood against the impending invasion. Now, Maraad has a chance to come to terms with the tragedy of his past. He intends to fulfill his vow, not only to save the innocent, but also to execute vengeance on everyone who caused him and his people so much heartache.\nVindicator Maraad can be found anywhere the draenei people are threatened, from the dense Tanaan Jungle, to the starry grasslands of Shadowmoon Valley, to the heart of draenei settlement on Draenor, the city of Shattrath."}

After Thrall's orcs relocated to Kalimdor during the Third War, the Darkspears joined them, and Vol'jin became one of the warchief's most trusted advisors. Vol'jin collaborated with Thrall to resolve crisis after crisis: he stabilized the Undercity after a coup orchestrated by Grand Apothecary Putress and the dreadlord Varimathras, and ousted the witch doctor Zalazane from the Echo Isles, the home of the Darkspear trolls.\nThen, Garrosh Hellscream rose to become warchief of the Horde. Almost immediately, Vol'jin disliked the younger Hellscream's lust for war, and it didn't take long for the troll to move the majority of his people out of Orgrimmar and back to the Echo Isles, where the Darkspears might distance themselves from Garrosh. In time, Vol'jin turned his eye toward the Zandalari -- an ancient line of trolls who were planning to forge a new troll empire -- and dispatched heroes of both the Horde and Alliance to deal with them. After the Horde's attack on Theramore and subsequent campaign to claim Pandaria, Vol'jin's relationship with Garrosh deteriorated further. The chieftain of the Darkspears was one of the few to openly challenge the warchief's ceaseless quest for blood and glory; after leading the revolt that helped bring Garrosh low, Vol'jin assumed the mantle of warchief himself. Existential threats challenge Vol'jin at every turn, but, for the first troll in history to lead the Horde, the truest test is the divisiveness left by a tyrant's reign."}

Their eternal curse had turned Wrathion's father, Neltharion the Earth-Warder, into Deathwing, the mad creature called the Destroyer by the races he tormented.\nFrom the shadows, Wrathion employed assassins to eliminate many of his tainted \"siblings\" in the black dragonflight. After the fall of Deathwing, his attention shifted to the exploration of the continent of Pandaria and the turbulent relationship between the Alliance and Horde. While his true agenda remains a mystery, Wrathion has revealed himself to both factions, allegedly to help defeat a threat that he believes could overcome the combined efforts of all heroes in Azeroth."}

She grew up in the Temple of Karabor, the center of the Holy Light for her people, and served as an acolyte. Devoted to her beliefs and her studies, she showed promise as a healer. Prophet Velen noticed her talent. He invited her to train as his pupil and began to teach her the value of leadership and sacrifice. But Yrel carried a dark secret within her. Velen sensed it, and he foresaw that for good or ill, she had a larger role to play. Yet when she considered her prospects, Yrel preferred to stay inside the temple, quietly caring for those around her. Unfortunately, that ideal did not survive.\nHer peaceful life was shattered when the savage orc clans forged themselves into a fighting force named the Iron Horde and set out to conquer Draenor. Yrel was captured and flung into a war. Now, she stands at the brink of greatness. Whatever her fate, Yrel is not destined to remain a humble acolyte in the Temple of Karabor. Draenor is in danger, and she's called to do something more: to shield her people from oblivion.\nYrel grew up at the Temple of Karabor in Shadowmoon Valley, an extraordinary complex of gardens, monuments, and shining halls nestled at the edge of the sea. Here, all manner of draenei study and commune with the Light. Beyond the walls of the temple, moonlit plains roll into a perpetually twilit horizon."}

It was kept as a tome that was later scattered into three fragments. The cipher is seen during quests in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. The cipher is ancient; the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; had writings about it located in &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Kra%27nak\"&gt;Kra'nak&lt;/a&gt;.\nSources.\nThis item is provided, and is an objective of, the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Cipher%20of%20Damnation%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Cipher of Damnation (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;Genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, the mad warlock &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; needed to sever the connection the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s had with the elemental spirits of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to ensure their demonic corruption would be complete. He used the Cipher of Damnation on the mighty &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cyrukh%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Cyrukh the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;. Using Cyrukh's power, Gul'dan ensured the orcs could no longer hear the spirits and corrupted the land. In the process, a massive volcano called the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was raised at the site of the ritual and the once pristine &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; become vile with demonic corruption. Many orc shamans, even former shamans like &lt;a href=\"Oronok%20Torn-heart\"&gt;Oronok Torn-heart&lt;/a&gt;, perceived a profound sense of loss within themselves as they felt the severance.\nAfter the orcs left Draenor to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the cipher itself was left behind in Gul'dan's quarters in &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; became the new Lord of Outland, he discovered the cipher in the Black Temple. Not wanting the past to repeat itself and potentially saving it for himself for later use, Illidan separated it into three pieces which he gave to three of his lieutenants: &lt;a href=\"Veneratus%20the%20Many\"&gt;Veneratus the Many&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Coilskar%20tribe\"&gt;Coilskar tribe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ruul%20the%20Darkener\"&gt;Ruul the Darkener&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of an adventurer and his sons, Oronok Torn-heart recovered the fragments and used it to call for the now-insane and corrupted Cyrukh the Firelord to at last put the elements at peace. \nAlternate Draenor.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, of that world ordered both of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Lord Iskar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Sethekk&lt;/a&gt; to search for pieces of the Cipher.\nGul'dan later discovered the hidden location of the Cipher at the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Earth\"&gt;Vault of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; after one of the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20the%20Vault\"&gt;Guardians of the Vault&lt;/a&gt; was captured and tortured by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The Lord of the Shadow Council and his &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; proceeded by traveling to the Vault and slaughtering almost all of the Guardians, before claiming the Cipher and traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Refuge\"&gt;Corrupted Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in the shadow of the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan intended to use the Cipher to empower the elemental lord &lt;a href=\"Cyrukh\"&gt;Cyrukh&lt;/a&gt;, driving it insane before unleashing to ravage Draenor, but he was foiled by the combined efforts of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;the commander&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Yrel\"&gt;Exarch Yrel&lt;/a&gt; and the former Shadow Council lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Oronok%20Torn-heart%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Oronok Torn-heart&lt;/a&gt;.

It looks like we're going to have some competition.\nNotes.\nFly all the way to Guo-Lai Halls, where the voice of Xuen welcomes you.\nBattle through the halls, defeating &lt;a href=\"Shao-Tien%20Spirit%20Warrior\"&gt;Shao-Tien Spirit Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Shao-Tien%20Wraith\"&gt;Shao-Tien Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s haunting the halls. &lt;a href=\"The%20Edict%20of%20Fire\"&gt;The Edict of Fire&lt;/a&gt; is to the right, &lt;a href=\"The%20Edict%20of%20Stone\"&gt;The Edict of Stone&lt;/a&gt; to the left, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Edict%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;The Edict of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; forward.\nThe Edict of Fire is in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Xioliang\"&gt;Xioliang&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating him involves positioning him in the pool of water which reduces his haste significantly, as well as prevents applying stacks of Heating Up, without standing in it yourself. Remember to &lt;a href=\"Purge\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt; Flame-Wreathed Weapon which deals additional Fire damage.\nThe Edict of Stone is in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Zhu%20of%20the%20Eternal%20Stone\"&gt;Zhu of the Eternal Stone&lt;/a&gt;. First clear the room of any &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20Statue\"&gt;Mogu Statue&lt;/a&gt;s that might activate during the fight, then interact with him to start the encounter. Defeating him requires the use of &lt;a href=\"Cleanse%20Spirit\"&gt;Cleanse Spirit&lt;/a&gt; to remove a movement speed reduction debuff, as well as copious amounts of &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt; to get out of area attacks.\nThe Edict of the Storm is in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Serpent%20Nalak%27Ra\"&gt;Thunder Serpent Nalak'Ra&lt;/a&gt;. It's a pretty straightforward fight which doesn't require any specific tactics apart from using &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt; to get out of attacks.\nOnce you've collected all the Edict, a &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;Memory of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; appears in the main hall, showing off Ra-den wielding &lt;a href=\"The%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;The Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Highkeeper%27s%20Ward\"&gt;The Highkeeper's Ward&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is also implied that she gets bored easily and likes playing games. She makes wagers with the other nobles to see how long it would take the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; to die, claiming it was the most exciting thing to happen since Renathal's rebellion, as well as allying with the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt; against Denathrius simply because she was excited to see what would happen.\nHistory.\nShe likes others to believe that she is an original venthyr, born from &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;' will, like &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt; are, but she was, in fact, mortal.

She also invites the Maw Walker to one of her parties (though they do not end up attending) and wishes that they do not die too fast, as she is desperate for entertainment.\nThe Venthyr Campaign.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; continued his rebellion, he gathered the other bearers of the seven medallions of Revendreth, hoping to unite them against &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;. While she joined the &lt;a href=\"Tithelord\"&gt;Tithelord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonewright\"&gt;Stonewright&lt;/a&gt; in refusing his offer, she subtly implied that Renathal simply required \"leverage.\"\nUnperturbed, Renathal sent the Maw Walker to sneak into the Countess' estate, &lt;a href=\"Redelav%20Tower\"&gt;Redelav Tower&lt;/a&gt;, to steal the medallion away from her with Duke &lt;a href=\"Theotar\"&gt;Theotar&lt;/a&gt;'s help, as he used to be very familiar with her prior to his exile to the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their efforts, the Countess caught the adventurer red-handed, claiming she knows everything that goes in her district. However, she is amused by the attempt and forcefully \"offers\" the adventurer to dine with her. The Countess shares that she is perfectly willing to part with the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Desire\"&gt;Medallion of Desire&lt;/a&gt;, but only if they perform some favors for her, and the adventurer agrees. After several errands and a few assassinations of traitorous nobles, the Countess allows the adventurer to take her medallion to Prince Renathal.\nOnce a Venthyr player has raised their &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Court\"&gt;Ember Court&lt;/a&gt; to Level 4, they can begin inviting the Countess as a guest to their parties. After obtaining Best Friend status with the Countess, she gifts them the &lt;a href=\"Desire%27s%20Battle%20Gargon\"&gt;Desire's Battle Gargon&lt;/a&gt;."}

Currently (due to what appears to be a bug) the filter is actually called twice for each frame. Due to this non-deterministic calling, your filter function should not have side-effects.\nExample filter implementation.\nWriting a filter is fairly straightforward:\n local function myChatFilter(self, event, msg, author, ...)\n if msg:find(\"buy gold\") then\n return true\n end\n if author == \"Knownspammer\" then\n return true\n end\n if msg:find(\"lol\") then\n return false, gsub(msg, \"lol\", \"\"), author, ...\n end\n end\n ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter(\"CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL\", myChatFilter)\n ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter(\"CHAT_MSG_SAY\", myChatFilter)\n ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter(\"CHAT_MSG_YELL\", myChatFilter)\n ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter(\"CHAT_MSG_WHISPER\", myChatFilter)\nYou should use the variables passed into the function rather than the global arg1, arg2 etc\nExample Chatframe addon use.\nChatframe addons / whisper managers etc should of course make use of these filters.\n local function myChatEventHandler(self,event,arg1...)\n local filterFuncList = ChatFrame_GetMessageEventFilters(event)\n if filterFuncList then\n for _, filterFunc in pairs(filterFuncList) do\n local filter, newarg1 = filterFunc(self,event,arg1...)\n if filter then \n return\n end\n if newarg1 then\n arg1 = newarg\n -- you should actually probably do this for all of arg2..arg11 since that's what framexml does\n end\n end\n end\n -- whoop de do, not filtered, go about our business and display etc\n end\nDetails.\nThis set of functions was added in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4\"&gt;patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;. The arguments of the filter function were incompatibly changed in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1\"&gt;patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nRe-adding an already-existing filter is harmless - the second addition is ignored.\nRemoving a filter that has not been added is harmless - there is no error.\nYou first have to define your filter function - local filterfunc(self,event,arg1...) - and after that use ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter(\"event\", filterfunc) in your lua code."}
