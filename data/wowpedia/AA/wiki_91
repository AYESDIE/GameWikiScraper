He became a hero and leader to the night elves following the war's conclusion, and was instrumental in easing tensions between his people and the Highborne. He made his first appearance at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", although he previously appeared in several novels.\nHaving estranged himself from greater night elf society after becoming disillusioned with Malfurion and his druids' increasing distance from their people following the ancient war, Jarod married &lt;a href=\"Shalasyr\"&gt;Shalasyr&lt;/a&gt;, and led a reclusive life with her in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s wilderness for several millennia before finally re-settling in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and rejoining his people after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Jarod found out that his older sister &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for targeting and murdering the recently returned &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and helped to save most of them, although Maiev escaped.\nHe then returned to Mount Hyjal to assist the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a region near his home city &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, to seek out his sister, eventually rescuing and reconciling with her. Afterwards, Jarod successfully defended Val'sharah from the Legion's further encroachments, and most recently returned to Kalimdor with Maiev and other night elves to fight in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, a warfront which he once again helped his people ultimately win.\nBiography.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; broke out, Jarod Shadowsong had risen to the rank of captain in the &lt;a href=\"Guard%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Guard of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, and his sister Maiev was one of the senior &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shadowsong\"&gt;Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; family was not of noble blood, and so both siblings had earned their positions through skill and hard work.\nPatrolling night elf lands for possible intruders, Jarod captured and made the disguised &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; a prisoner. A strange and extremely powerful phenomenon had thrown Krasus back to a time that contained a far younger version of Krasus, and the overlap had left Krasus weakened and ill unless he was in close proximity to his younger self.\nFrom jailor to protector.\nWith magical persuasion from Krasus, the captain began worrying that Krasus might die before being questioned. Thus, Jarod sought out one of the priestesses of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; in the hope that she could heal his prisoner. He happened upon the novice &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and she consented to lend her aid. Although she could not heal Krasus of his malady, she was soon working with him to help her friend, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently fallen comatose. The forest demigod arrived, to Jarod's poorly concealed astonishment, and returned Malfurion's spirit from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion was reunited with his body and made a quick recovery. Then Jarod accompanied Krasus, Malfurion, and Tyrande as they went to speak with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the night elf army that was fighting the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\n was impressed by Jarod's dedication to duty, and put a group of battle-hardened soldiers at Jarod's command. Jarod and his soldiers were responsible for watching over the four strongest spellcasters of the night elf army: Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; wizard , and . Malfurion and Krasus eventually left the army and sought out the rest of the dragons, intending to appeal to them for help against the Legion. They embarked on this quest against Lord Ravencrest's express orders and without Jarod's knowledge. Yet Kur'talos could not find it in his heart to reproach Jarod for failing to halt the spellcasters' departure.\nThe assassination of Lord Ravencrest.\nEventually ' strong leadership of the night elf army irked , who instructed Captain to eliminate the noble. Varo'then sent &lt;a href=\"Kelorn%20Nightblade\"&gt;Kelorn Nightblade&lt;/a&gt; to carry it out. The assassination was successful, and Lord became the new leader of the night elf defenders. During that time, Jarod was named a liaison to the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, largely because Stareye thought Jarod was used to sacrifice. Unfortunately, Desdel had no skill at tactics. The invading &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s pretended to retreat and then swiftly attacked the night elves from the air. Desdel watched in horror as the demons began pouring containers of boiling red liquid over the night elf army. Hundreds were injured, some mortally. When Jarod asked Desdel what action to take, the panicked noble had no useful response. Jarod caught sight of another group of demons hovering over Desdel, and so Jarod tried to pull Desdel out of the way. However, Desdel took offense at Jarod's effort and ordered him away on pain of imprisonment. Jarod yanked his mount aside just in time to avoid an agonizing death. The demons tipped over their container, and boiling liquid poured down on Desdel and his nearby companions. Desdel was killed in moments, his face maimed beyond recognition.\nUnwilling hero.\nWhen Stareye was killed (much to the relief of &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;) \u2014 and soon after was killed \u2014 Jarod unconsciously assumed field command of the troops. With his intuitive grasp of tactics and his natural talent at leadership, he quickly found himself appointed the new leader of the night elf army. As a result, the tide of the battle was turned from the death of the resistance into a small victory within hours. The relieved nobles eagerly followed his commands. Jarod continued to doubt his importance to the war effort, but he received a very welcome surprise. Cenarius led a large group of &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s into the midst of the night elf army and humbly knelt before the astonished captain. The demigods had agreed to fight under Jarod's direction. &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; insisted that Jarod assume complete command of the allied forces, to which he reluctantly agreed. Most of the nobles and &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; agreed he should lead them. Jarod's unorthodox tactics were extremely effective in holding the line against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; (about 25 miles out to sea from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s current coast) with minimal loss of life until the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; to the battlefield. These battles even liberated the night elves from Stareye's mistakes and improved relations with other races, and even served to deteriorate the caste system of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; (which placed only nobles as leaders).\nDuring the war, Jarod saved the life of &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. Huln promised to carve Jarod's name on his spear &lt;a href=\"Talonclaw\"&gt;Talonclaw&lt;/a&gt;, which would cause Jarod to be honored for generations of Huln's line. At some point later, during a battle in &lt;a href=\"Eldarath\"&gt;Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, Jarod and Huln fought &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;.\nJarod's mere presence also seems to serve in raising morale. It is noted that, unlike the commanders before him, all fight harder and obey him with greater swiftness. An amused &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, however, realizes that Jarod probably doesn't consider himself impressive at all, and believes he is only doing what he must. Unfortunately for his modesty, his people's reverence for him only grew when the demigods joined the conflict, and willingly placed themselves under his command. He even manages to earn the admiration and respect of his sister, who had never seemed to approve of him.\nAs the captain continued to rally the night elves and turn the tide of battle, he caught the eye of the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion's absence from the battlefield had frustrated the massive demon, who decided to take out his fury on Jarod. Archimonde was certain that the Legion's victory was inevitable, and so he took his time, sadistically toying with Jarod, slowly beating him to death. Very likely Archimonde took even greater pleasure in the prospect of finally breaking Jarod's iron will. Before Jarod was too badly wounded to recover, though, Malfurion and Illidan Stormrage worked their combined magic on the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. All the demons, including Archimonde, were sucked into the Well and forced back into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, howling in fury. Although he believed his people would consider his resistance pathetic, as he fought so poorly against the demon commander, he was celebrated as a hero. In spite all but impossible odds, he had stood defiant against a commander of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, even though the latter had merely been toying with him.\nJarod was known to have at least partly returned the affection of &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; despite how when he first met her during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, he described their age gap as being \"A gulf the size of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;,\" although the difference was only a few years. As of such, he is initially disturbed by the affectionate smiles the younger night elf always gave him. At the end of the war, however, he admits that he began to find comfort in them, especially with the pressures of leadership.\nAfter the Sundering.\nThe Great Sundering triggered the birth of a new ocean, and the rushing waters chased the night elves all the way to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. At last, the waters subsided, and Jarod led a group of night elves to scout the area for drinkable water. They discovered that Illidan had created a second Well of Eternity. Jarod attempted to stop him but was badly beaten by the other's vast command of the arcane. When they discovered him, &lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; and quickly went to tend to him. A furious Maiev then attempted to kill &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; for harming her brother, but is stopped by and . Jarod gave Malfurion the power to decide his reckless brother's fate, and so it was Malfurion who sentenced Illidan to an imprisonment that would last ten thousand years. Jarod later agreed to his imprisonment and was present during the birth of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and the blessing it received from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s. He also helped guide his people in finding a new place, and new ways, to live.\nA reluctant army commander, Jarod was deeply gladdened by the end of the war. He dissolved the makeshift army and continued to serve as a kind of administrator for a short time, but he had never wanted to be a leader. Gradually he directed increasing numbers of petitioners to the new high priestess of Elune, Tyrande Whisperwind, whose compassion and wisdom went a long way toward calming post-war tensions. By the time Tyrande established the night elves' new army, the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, Jarod had deliberately faded into the background. He did not think of himself as a hero, and he did not wish others to do so.\nSelf-exiled.\nOver time Jarod grew disenchanted with the polarization of night elf society after the War of the Ancients and felt that Malfurion and his druids were more concerned with nature and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; than their own people. Unknown to anyone else, he entered into a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Shalasyr\"&gt;Shalasyr&lt;/a&gt;, a novice priestess. As he was seriously considering leaving their people behind, the couple agreed to keep their relationship secret. Jarod partially hoped that, if he departed, Shalasyr would not follow him into what amounted to self-exile, and she would be free from having to answer questions as to why he had left.\nEventually, Jarod made up his mind to leave, and Shalasyr decided to go with him. The two secretly vanished together; he did not say where he was going or bid anyone farewell, and it was generally assumed that Shalasyr wandered away and was killed in an accident, even though searchers never found a body. With their love a secret, no one realized that the two disappearances were actually related. Eventually most thought that Jarod was probably dead.\nConsidering themselves now as husband and wife, Jarod and Shalasyr would spend the next 10,000 years enjoying their life together in the wilderness. Some time after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; occurred, they heard rumors that they had become mortal.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; occurred, Shalasyr was struck by an illness due to aging, one of the first signs of the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Timeless One&lt;/a&gt;'s blessing on &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. While she and Jarod agreed to bring her to the new capital of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to be saved by Tyrande and Elune, Shalasyr actually knew that she was dying and that it was her time. She privately wished to die among her people, and to make certain her beloved wouldn't remain alone in self-exile. Though Jarod did get her to Darnassus and sent for Tyrande, she passed away before the priestess arrived.\nWolfheart.\nJarod\u2019s return was quickly noticed by Malfurion, as well as &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and his sister, &lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris had an emotional reunion with Jarod. She revealed that she once had feelings for him, and envied Shalasyr and the time she spent with him. Jarod apologized to Shandris for his sudden and unexplained disappearance, and explained that while he was flattered by her affections, their choices prevented a romantic relationship; Shandris had been training to take on a more active role in night elf society, while Jarod wanted to live out his life in seclusion. Both Shandris and Jarod resolved to have a platonic relationship, after which Shandris gave her condolences. Jarod's reunion with Maiev was more bitter. Though he was happy to reconnect with the only family member he has left, Maiev was angry at him for abandoning his people and duty. Still, she eventually softened to him when he sympathized with the traumatic events that transpired in her life after which she also gave her condolences for his loss.\nWhen Maiev was called upon to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; murders, Jarod assisted his sister in her search. Eventually, Jarod discovered that Maiev had been orchestrating the Highborne assassinations, and that she had kidnapped Malfurion as well. Jarod rescued Malfurion and later the other Highborne Maiev had captured. Though he could have killed Maiev in their bloody confrontation, he was unable to kill his own sister and thus allowed her to escape. After he recovered from his injuries, Jarod had vowed to hunt down Maiev and bring her to justice. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; appointed Jarod Shadowsong as the leader of a new force for Darnassus and will hunt down its threats and enemies, with their first target being Maiev. Shandris was ordered to aid Jarod with forming his new task force, in order to help him choose some possible candidates from the Sentinels. Malfurion quickly realized that Tyrande did this in the hope that Jarod will grow closer to Shandris in the future.\nCataclysm.\nHe appears at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; being held captive inside a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; camp in &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. He's scheduled to be sacrificed by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the Twilight's Hammer as part of this year's initiation. On 's orders, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s infiltrate the Twilight's Hammer forces at Darkwhisper Gorge and incite conflicts between ogre and non-ogre members - while the primary goal is sneaking out Jarod Shadowsong out of Twilight's Hammer's custody. After his rescue Jarod aids and the &lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt; against the forces of . Once again he is charged with leading the military operations against an enemy with demigods walking among him.\nLegion.\nWhen Illidan's corpse was stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; by and , Maiev pursued them and subsequently went missing. &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;s loyal to Maiev began to search for her across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and Jarod volunteered to help them. Jarod feels he has been a poor brother to Maiev, for he knows Maiev would never have committed the murders in Teldrassil unless she was under some foul influence, but he did not investigate and simply assumed the worst.\nJarod is first seen in &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Bradensbrook&lt;/a&gt;, a town of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; refugees who escaped from the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; lands years ago during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; uprising. The nearby &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; has become plagued by undead night elves, and Jarod has come to investigate while also searching for his sister, but the Gilneans do not trust him. After having an adventurer prove his trustworthiness, Jarod ventured to Black Rook Hold and found that Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest's body had gone missing, raised along with the other undead in the fortress. Jarod and the adventurer put the night elf spirits to rest while also searching for his captured sister.\nWhen Maiev is freed, she reveals that Gul'dan raised Ravencrest and the soldiers of Black Rook Hold to protect the secrets within the tower, with the ghost of protecting the dungeons. In her reunion with Jarod she is surprised that he came for her even after she tried to kill him, but Jarod says to forget about it, that he heard what happened in the Vault of the Wardens, and jokes that luckily his hair cannot get any grayer. He thanks Elune that his sister is still alive, and together the Shadowsong siblings defeat Stareye, who, like all the undead in Black Rook Hold, believes them to be demons.\nLegionfall.\nJarod and &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; lead the defense of Black Rook Hold when &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; comes under invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the soldiers of Black Rook Hold once more begin to attack Bradensbrook, Jarod returns to the village to defend it from his fallen comrades. He discovers that this assault is led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Erdris%20Thorn\"&gt;Lord Erdris Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, who was a key commander of Lord Ravencrest's forces and who was actually risen later than the soldiers that had come from the hold so far. Jarod and the adventurer travel into Black Rook Hold, where they discover &lt;a href=\"Lorgos%20the%20Resurrector\"&gt;Lorgos the Resurrector&lt;/a&gt; reviving &lt;a href=\"Rooksguard\"&gt;Rooksguard&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and tricking them into thinking the people of Bradensbrook are demons. Several Rooksguard are freed and put to rest, and Lorgos is killed, but Erdris - still under the Legion's spell - vows to raise his own army. Jarod sends the adventurer to report to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; while he scouts the hold for Erdris, saying that he will call for aid when the time to strike arrives.\nLater, Jarod and the adventurer, along with &lt;a href=\"Callie%20Carrington\"&gt;Callie Carrington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Granny%20Marl\"&gt;Granny Marl&lt;/a&gt; from Bradensbrook, confront Erdris and his army atop Black Rook Hold. Jarod urges Callie and Marl to leave for their safety, but they insist on defending their home. When the &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, Jarod, Callie, and Marl confronted Erdris, they were being mind-controlled as considered to be demon worshippers. The three regained themselves and finished off the commander. After the threat was secured, Jarod provided the healer a portal back to Dalaran of their success in Black Rook Hold.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nJarod returned to Kalimdor for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and served as Recruitment Officer at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; under Maiev's leadership.\nSpeculation.\nBesides being Maiev's brother, he may also be related to &lt;a href=\"Nessa%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Nessa Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fiskal%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Fiskal Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eileese%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Eileese Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Having felt the elements abandoning him, he was wary of the course of his people and refused to drink the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;Chalice of Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;, unlike his brother &lt;a href=\"J%27argg%20Bloodfyre\"&gt;J'argg&lt;/a&gt;, who became a leader of raids on the remaining draenei, and often urged Jaruk to drink as well and join their slaughtering of man, woman and child alike. J'argg forced him to carry axes but they were ineffective in the shaman's hands. He was very saddened by the situation of violent orcs and helpless draenei. He had learned the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;Draenei language&lt;/a&gt; in order to trade with them, and was fluent in it.\nBiography.\nAt least two times, Jaruk tried to help draenei to escape, but was thwarted by J'argg showing up and killing them, who already suspects his brother of what he deems treachery. After he tried to help &lt;a href=\"Alius\"&gt;Alius&lt;/a&gt; to escape, the draenei was mortally wounded by J'argg who eventually went for the draenei's family. Alius asked Jaruk to help his family before Jaruk ended his suffering. It was then that Jaruk decided to change his fate. He hurried after Alius' wife and daughter to protect them from J'argg, but was too late to save the woman. When J'argg wanted him to kill the young girl, &lt;a href=\"Leena\"&gt;Leena&lt;/a&gt;, Jaruk instead attacked J'argg and blinds his left eye, escaping with the girl as an attacking &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt; distracted his brother. While heading to &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, Leena got bitten by a Cavern Crawler\u200e Hatchling and she started to burn up. Jaruk smashed the hatchling and eventually found some herbs in Zangarmarsh for the antidote. Later, a &lt;a href=\"marsh%20beast\"&gt;marsh beast&lt;/a&gt; delayed them, allowing J'argg's raid party to catch up, but Jaruk was able to stir a hive of &lt;a href=\"fireflies\"&gt;fireflies&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"spore%20walker\"&gt;spore walker&lt;/a&gt;, which attacked the approaching orcs. With the help of Jaruk's &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt; mount &lt;a href=\"Fang%27gar\"&gt;Fang'gar&lt;/a&gt;, who had been brought with the raid party, they were able to escape again.\nSeveral years pass, with Jaruk and Leena hiding among her people. Knowing that J'argg would hunt him as long as he was alive, Jaruk never stayed too long in the same place as to not endanger the draenei sheltering them. Jaruk adopted the girl and raised her, teaching her the old ways of his people, the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt; language, how to track, and hunt with a bow. Thanks to her, he found inner peace. After some years, Fang'gar passed away, leaving Leena in tears of mourning. However, for her next \"birthday\" (the anniversary of the day Jaruk rescued her) he got her a young cub, which she named &lt;a href=\"Pebbles\"&gt;Pebbles&lt;/a&gt;. That very night, she took her new pet out to hunt boars for breakfast, but is discovered by J'argg and his men, taking her as hostage and confronting Jaruk in the cave of a draenei named &lt;a href=\"Chantu\"&gt;Chantu&lt;/a&gt; that was their temporary home. Jaruk charged at them, but was subdued and forced to finally drink the Blood of Mannoroth that J'argg had acquired from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. His eyes turning to a red glow like the others, he was given a dagger to kill Leena, but instead pierces J'argg's throat, and then dispatched the rest of their enemies, including &lt;a href=\"Ra%27nok\"&gt;Ra'nok&lt;/a&gt;. But J'argg managed to drive his sword into Jaruk's back, until Leena finished him off with a fallen blade. As Jaruk laid dying, the elements returned to grant him one final vision: that of Leena as an adult shaman, working together with draenei, orcs, and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; to restore the balance of the elements."}

Despite betraying his own people in wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; in a petty act of vengeance, he retained his position as Trade Prince of the Bilgewater Cartel for many years in its service to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Once being a vocal supporter of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, he would eventually become one of the last leaders to support the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, showing respect for &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and pledging his loyalty to the new Warchief following the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Gallywix expresses his only desire is to find his people a secure and profitable future, which he saw neither of under Hellscream's reign. Gallywix was among those present following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; when a dying Vol'jin named &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; the next Warchief with his dying breath.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; reached its end, Gallywix was the first to recognize the potential of the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; bursting from the planet after &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' final attack. Tempting his warchief with the power and profit this new resource could bring, Gallywix's greed served as one of the impetuses of the renewed Alliance-Horde conflict, profiteering from the war. Near the very end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas and Gallywix abandoned their people following the rebellion of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to promote &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; as his successor.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nJastor Gallywix's father, &lt;a href=\"Luzik%20Gallywix\"&gt;Luzik&lt;/a&gt;, was a tinker who lived and worked on &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Street\"&gt;Copper Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drudgetown\"&gt;Drudgetown&lt;/a&gt; on Kezan, and his &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20mother\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; left for a life of piracy. His father regularly tested his inventions - all of which had something to do with explosives (appropriately for goblins) - in the house, which had the potential for causing fatal injuries to both himself and his son. On his tenth birthday, Gallywix had had enough of his father's antics and thought about running away to become a pirate himself. That was before he witnessed a local street gang rough up his father for money, and steal a cookie his father had given him (from a bakery that had been destroyed in the various &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Wars\"&gt;Trade Wars&lt;/a&gt;; as a result, the confection was highly rare). That inspired him to take control of his neighborhood and begin his rise to power on Kezan. First, he booby-trapped the payment to the gang with dynamite, blowing the entire gang sky-high. Then he took over, buying out the street's businesses, among them his father's tinkering business.\nMany years later, Gallywix had become president of what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Street%20Conglomerate\"&gt;Copper Street Conglomerate&lt;/a&gt;, an advisor to the &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Union\"&gt;Tinkers' Union&lt;/a&gt;, a major figure in the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, and the second wealthiest goblin in the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; - second only to &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Maldy\"&gt;Trade Prince Maldy&lt;/a&gt; himself. With the aid of the moguls of the Bilgewater and from &lt;a href=\"Tek%27zik%20Riddlevox\"&gt;Tek'zik Riddlevox&lt;/a&gt;, Director of the Tinkers' Union, all of whom believed that Maldy had gone soft (he was known to dote over his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Nessa%20Maldy\"&gt;Nessa&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Gallywix had fallen in love with on first sight), Gallywix initiated a hostile takeover of the Bilgewater Cartel. He bought the loyalty of Maldy's staff, and replaced his security with his own mercenaries; he even owned the land on which Maldy's manor (the site of &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Villa\"&gt;his own villa&lt;/a&gt; many years later) was situated. Though Maldy hoped to re-buy his possessions with the money he gained from trading weapons to the Alliance, Gallywix eliminated that possibility by destroying Maldy's trade fleet. Now in total control, Gallywix exiled Maldy and his daughter from Kezan, and later arranged his (supposedly accidental) death. His assistant, &lt;a href=\"Thissy%20Steeltack\"&gt;Thissy Steeltack&lt;/a&gt; paid some assassins to kill him while swimming in a pool. He fired her.\nGallywix and his current chief enforcer, &lt;a href=\"Druz\"&gt;Druz&lt;/a&gt;, were childhood friends. Later in life, Gallywix's own late &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20mother\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; attempted to kill him at least twice; the trade prince had a painting named &lt;a href=\"The%20Goblin%20Lisa\"&gt;The Goblin Lisa&lt;/a&gt; commissioned to depict her.\nWhile he would grow fat in later life, in his youth Gallywix was apparently a strong and lucid street fighter.\nThe Bilgewater Cartel dug really deep into Kezan in order to mine more kaja'mite ore, create Kaja'Cola and please their customers. While digging, they discovered a small vein of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and one smart miner took a chunk of it discreetly. He wanted to give it to Gallywix as a token of his esteem, or, in other words, bribe him. Gallywix took the substance, fashioned it into the orb ornamenting his cane and kept it as a secret for years.\nCataclysm.\nEscaping Kezan.\nMore than twenty years later, on the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Gallywix owns a &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Yacht\"&gt;yacht&lt;/a&gt; but is on the verge of losing his position as Trade Prince and views the adventurer - apparently a former protege of Gallywix's - as his rival for the office. When &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; causes &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt; to erupt, his position is greatly enhanced because he holds the only ship out of Kezan. Anyone who wishes to escape the island - including the adventurer - must use his or her life savings to purchase a ticket, later becoming Gallywix\u2019s slave. The ship is en route to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; when they are fired upon and sunk by an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; vessel in the crossfire of a naval battle with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; just off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Trade Prince turns out to have survived the Alliance attack and is one of the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Escape%20Pods\"&gt;first goblins saved&lt;/a&gt; by the adventurer on the island. He appears with the other goblin survivors immediately afterwards. Later, after the adventurer rescues former &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Gallywix arrives and swears vengeance upon the adventurer and the other goblins of his own cartel, using &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Dampwick\"&gt;Foreman Dampwick&lt;/a&gt;'s rocket sling and escapes.\nHe later enslaves members of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and uses them as slaves in the &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Labor%20Mine\"&gt;Gallywix Labor Mine&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, he is able to turn the adventurer's friend (and female adventurer's ex-boyfriend) &lt;a href=\"Chip%20Endale\"&gt;Chip Endale&lt;/a&gt; to his side. After Chip's death, Gallywix begins going out with &lt;a href=\"Candy%20Cane\"&gt;Candy Cane&lt;/a&gt; (the male adventurer's ex-girlfriend). However, she is soon killed by a group of goblin adventurers who also cut out her heart.\nThe orc survivors of the naval battle eventually team up with the surviving goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel to confront the traitorous Gallywix in the conclusion of the goblin starting zone. The adventurer and Thrall fight and defeat the Trade Prince, but Gallywix surrenders and promises to reform how he runs the cartel. Thrall allows Gallywix to remain as the Trade Prince of the Bilgewater Cartel, informs him that the cartel will have a new home in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and offers for them to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Gallywix then swears his loyalty to the Horde. Unfortunately, Gallywix seems to resume his poor treatment of the adventurer almost immediately, as evidenced by his refusal to talk to the adventurer or grant pay raises during the ride to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining the Horde.\nWith the Bilgewater goblins now in the trenches with the bigger brutes of the Horde, a significant number of trampling deaths have been reported. Normally unconcerned with such matters, Trade Prince Gallywix was alarmed to learn that Garrosh\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; accountants refused to pay soldier death benefits if the soldiers never got to the actual battle, and accidental stomps caused by &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; maneuvers made it extremely difficult to calculate how many goblins had made it to the battlefield before they were rendered flat. Gallywix offered a substantial cash reward for an invention that could both lift goblins out of hoof traffic and speed them along at comparable velocities so that goblin soldiers could die in \u201ca calculate-able and reimbursable fashion.\u201d Hundreds of submissions were made. Most exploded upon delivery. In the end, the clear (and relatively undamaged) winner was the sturdy transport &lt;a href=\"trike\"&gt;trike&lt;/a&gt; created by the remarkably aged &lt;a href=\"Jibidiah%20Gragglefutz\"&gt;Jibidiah Gragglefutz&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Bilgewater Cartel's admission into the Horde, Gallywix seems to have engaged in some damage control - mostly for his own public image - and declared that unlike the other goblin cartels, the Bilgewater Cartel will not hamstring itself with neutrality; instead leaping at the chance to join a superpower such as the Horde. He appears to have conveniently left out the fiasco with Thrall.\nGallywix takes up residence in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;; quickly having the \"&lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;Gallywix Pleasure Palace&lt;/a&gt;\" constructed, complete with a gigantic stone monument depicting his head and a top hat. However, Gallywix himself is currently no-where to be found, and &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt; seems to be holding things together in his apparent absence.\nIronically, while one of Garrosh's more vocal supporters, Gallywix was trying to sue for peace between the Alliance and the Horde prior to the attack on &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nWhen Baine made his way to &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, he was greeted by Gallywix in a surprisingly friendly matter, calling him \"Friend Baine\", and even asked him about news of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. He was excited for his first visit to Grommash Hold. Gallywix was present at the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; leader meeting called by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, and saw value (unsurprisingly, financial value) in the warchief's plan to remove the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; from the continent\u2014starting with &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Like &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, Gallywix did not critique Garrosh's decisions; though while the regent lord was subtly specific in his loyalty to the Horde as a whole rather than Garrosh, Gallywix made no such allusions.\nGallywix rallied the troops before the assault begins, his unlikely presence on the battlefield something Garrosh noted positively. The trade prince made several comical attempts to embrace the warchief, though a bewildered Garrosh drew the line at patting him on the top hat instead.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; joined the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt;, a Bilgewater &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;, decided to abandon &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the cartel and the Horde. Jastor and Grizzek thus made a deal: the trade prince would allow it if Grizzek left his inventions with him. Grizzek agreed, and took only his personal supplies and left for &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLandfall.\nThough Gallywix was, at first, not present on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, he sent an army of goblins to accompany Garrosh on his campaign. Jastor remained in contact with the goblins, making clear that orders from Gallywix or his officers overrule the authority of any other Horde official. Gallywix's true (and somewhat low) opinion on Garrosh was also revealed, when he offhandedly mentioned that Garrosh was likely to bankrupt himself in the war.\nThe Blank Scroll.\nGallywix later arrived on Pandaria himself with another raid of goblins (aptly dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Plundersquad%20Initiative\"&gt;Plundersquad Initiative&lt;/a&gt;), which he set to the task of uncovering powerful artifacts on the continent. His presence was ostensibly to \"inspire\" the troops, though the trade prince spending most of his time aboard his flagship zeppelin hosting parties and living in comfort (said \"uberzeppelin\" boasting both rum slides and pudding jacuzzis) had evoked only contempt. Gallywix was accompanied by his childhood friend and top enforcer, &lt;a href=\"Druz\"&gt;Druz&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of his own followers came to doubt the merit of this mission, fearful that Gallywix would hand over any weaponry they uncovered to their \"lunatic\" Warchief. As it happens, Gallywix was after these items as leverage for himself, not trusting them in the hands of anyone else. Inside a &lt;a href=\"lorevault\"&gt;lorevault&lt;/a&gt;, Druz and &lt;a href=\"Ziya\"&gt;Ziya&lt;/a&gt; acquired an &lt;a href=\"The%20Blank%20Scroll%20%28item%29\"&gt;enigmatic scroll&lt;/a&gt; during their encounter with &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Shuchun\"&gt;Lorewalker Shuchun&lt;/a&gt; and intended to give it to Gallywix.\nHowever, the two were treated to a vision of the future this would lead to: Gallywix would refuse to use the scroll, electing to hide the weapon instead. Rumors of Gallywix keeping the scroll for himself would ripple through the land, and Garrosh, branding the trade prince a traitor, would invade &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and assault Bilgewater Harbor in a swathe of destruction. Gallywix himself would don his spider-tank and protect the scroll by challenging Garrosh directly, though would lose the battle after putting up a surprisingly passionate fight; on the cusp of defeat, he would eject himself from the tank and dive into Garrosh, grabbing the orc's tusks and smashing his forehead into Garrosh's face, like the street fighter Jastor had once been. Still, he would end the fight dead, accidentally killed by his loyal enforcer Druz. In the months following Gallywix's death and Garrosh's acquisition of the Blank Scroll, the world would be plunged into terror and destruction under Hellscream's rule; the races of Azeroth fighting and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;side&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;side&lt;/a&gt;, until the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; itself arrived to finish off a world bereft of its champions.\nHaving been granted this terrifying vision, Gallywix's subordinates fearfully chose to instead leave the scroll in the hands of the Lorewalkers.\nDarkspear Rebellion.\nIt would seem that Gallywix and the Bilgewater Cartel were the last members of the Horde to join the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Though helping Garrosh to excavate the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, they joined the rebellion after the Kor'kron refused to live up to their contract and paid them only a fifth of the promised amount. &lt;a href=\"Grizzle%20Gearslip\"&gt;Grizzle Gearslip&lt;/a&gt;, who was actually present, quietly insulted Garrosh's lack of loyalty and ran off. Presumably, he eventually delivered this information to Gallywix and thus prompted the Bilgewater Cartel's joining the Rebellion.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nGallywix is present along with the rest of the Horde's leadership (barring &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;, who was injured earlier in the siege) at the defeat and arrest of Garrosh. When Thrall names &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; the new Warchief, Gallywix tips his hat and bows in respect.\nWar Crimes.\nJastor was invited to attend the trial of Garrosh Hellscream in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; alongside the other Horde leaders. When the Horde and Alliance leaders met at the temple a few days prior to the start of the trial, Jastor loudly argued that the Alliance shouldn't be involved in the trial at all and that Garrosh should instead be tried by his peers so he could make proper compensation to those he had wronged. &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; retorted that Gallywix meant monetary compensation. Jastor replied that \"That would be an acceptable form, yes\".\nLegion.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Jastor and his &lt;a href=\"uberzeppelin\"&gt;uberzeppelin&lt;/a&gt; were advertised in a &lt;a href=\"Doomsayer%20%28Legion%29\"&gt;Doomsayer&lt;/a&gt;'s pamphlet. Whether the Trade Prince was aware of this is unclear.\nGallywix was present when a dying &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; returned from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and named &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; Warchief before dying in &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently attended his funeral ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and fought against demon assassins revealed by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. He then personally led the defense of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Rear%20Gate\"&gt;Orgrimmar Rear Gate&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs the Legion's invasion raged on, Gallywix holed himself up inside the &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;Gallywix Pleasure Palace&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt; wanted Gallywix' one-of-a-kind &lt;a href=\"Love%20Potion%20%236\"&gt;Love Potion #6&lt;/a&gt; in order to replicate it and make himself rich. A &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Uncrowned\"&gt;the Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; sneaked into Gallywix's palace at Noggenfogger's request while Gallywix was relaxing in his sauna and stole the potion.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer reaches Prestige Rank 2, Jastor can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nUpon the Legion's defeat, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; impaled &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;his sword&lt;/a&gt;, causing a &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;mysterious new substance&lt;/a&gt; to flow to the surface. When this occurred, the mineral sample that the Bilgewater Cartel had uncovered on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; years prior and which Gallywix had used as a cane adornment suddenly changed color from red to gold and regained its original, extraordinary properties. The trade prince was the first to realize what this meant and immediately sent goblins to mine the mineral in Silithus. This earned him suspicion from &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok&lt;/a&gt;, but on the other hand Warchief Sylvanas was fascinated by the mineral and declared that it would change everything.\nShortly after, Jastor traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; with the other Horde leaders.\nBefore the Storm.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s support, Gallywix went on to begin researching and mining &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of eventually commodifying it. Jastor Gallywix, his main enforcer &lt;a href=\"Druz\"&gt;Druz&lt;/a&gt;, and a contingent of goblin &lt;a href=\"Bruiser\"&gt;Bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; to recruit the &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt; to be his main innovator for this endeavor. Grizzek had stipulated that he'd invent for Gallywix if he was allowed freedom to dictate how he worked, what he made, how it was used, and also the assistance of his lab partner &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt;. Gallywix reluctantly agreed to Grizzek's demands but to ensure Grizzek's compliance, he also stationed his bruisers and Druz to supervise him while he worked.\nSometime later, Sylvanas and Gallywix had a meeting in the &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;Gallywix Pleasure Palace&lt;/a&gt; and Sylvanas threatened Gallywix to hasten the goblins' efforts and to focus entirely on the development of Azerite weapons. Gallywix relayed Sylvanas' orders to Druz who coerced Grizzek and Sapphronetta to shift the focus of their research accordingly. When Gallywix heard Grizzek and Sapphronetta tried to sabotage their work to prevent the Horde from acquiring weapons, Gallywix ordered to confiscate their notes and inventions and to blow up the two inventors. However, unbeknownst to the Bilgewater Cartel's goons, Sapphronetta made sure to secretly destroy their notes before she and Grizzek made their attempted escape. Thus Gallywix would be unable to recreate their experiments and would be left with only a few prototypes and mixed potions.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGallywix funds the Horde's war campaign and understands Azerite better than any of the other leaders. Gallywix is aboard \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;The Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. He leads the Horde's expedition into &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; because of the large amount of Azerite beneath the region. He and Eitrigg arrived there, driving &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20War%20Trike\"&gt;his trike&lt;/a&gt; and established an outpost.\nThough Gallywix was against it, the Horde made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; to have them refine Azerite for the Horde's war. When Venture's leader &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; backed out of the deal, Gallywix decided to cut out the middle man and attack Venture Company's Azerite facilities at the &lt;a href=\"MOTHERLODE%21%21\"&gt;MOTHERLODE!!&lt;/a&gt; on Kezan.\nUnable to resist the allure of the gold of &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, Gallywix looted his &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; allies' sacred burial temple. He was confronted not by the Horde or Zandalari, but by the &lt;a href=\"void%20elf\"&gt;void elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; and an Alliance adventurer, who had chased him down to end his funding of the Horde's war efforts. Gallywix escaped to his pleasure palace in Azshara, but they followed. They battled Gallywix at the palace only for it to turn out to be an &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Impersonator\"&gt;imposter&lt;/a&gt; as the real Gallywix flew off.\nTides of Vengeance.\nGallywix acquired a new mech suit powered by Azerite, &lt;a href=\"G.M.O.D\"&gt;Gallywix's Mech of Death&lt;/a&gt;, but had problems acquiring fuel due to &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;Azerite elemental&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Bonanza\"&gt;Bilgewater Bonanza&lt;/a&gt; in Zuldazar. With the G.M.O.D refueled, Gallywix brought it to Drustvar to fight off &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; and his remote-controlled robotic forces who were attacking &lt;a href=\"Krazzlefrazz%20Outpost\"&gt;Krazzlefrazz Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Arom's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. Once the attack was fought off, Gallywix faced Mekkatorque and his mech suit in the air above Drustvar only for the G.M.O.D to run out of fuel, giving Mekkatorque the chance to knock Gallywix out of the sky. Once the G.M.O.D was operational again, Gallywix attacked Mekkatorque's airship \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Strider\"&gt;The Strider&lt;/a&gt;\" above &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; to draw out Mekkatorque. As they fought \"The Strider\" began to fall apart and so Mekkatorque fled, leaving Gallywix to wonder how to break through his mech's Proto Layered Optimal Titan Armor. On the flight back to the surface, Gallywix mused that if he had never told Sylvanas about Azerite, then perhaps the entire &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; never would have happened, and &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; would still be standing... only to laugh and state that he doesn't actually care, as he has a robot shooting lasers made of the planet's blood.\nGallywix battled Mekkatorque during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Siege of Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and later attended Talanji's coronation.\nAfter Sylvanas called for the leaders of the Horde to gather in &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Gallywix, knowing that this meeting would be a big deal, sold tickets to the event. When &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from Horde captivity, Gallywix admits that he didn't see it coming but wished he'd known ahead of time so that he could have charged double for admission.\nUpon hearing rumors that &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt; was still alive, Gallywix would request Horde adventurers to investigate the matter and ensure that Grizzek was dead. However, unbeknownst to Gallywix, &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; would give them a higher offer to ensure that Grizzek stayed alive. Thus, the adventurer traveled to Tanaris to investigate what happened to &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt; and Grizzek. After repairing &lt;a href=\"Feathers\"&gt;Feathers&lt;/a&gt; and following him, the adventurer found Saffy and Grizzek just north of &lt;a href=\"Thistleshrub%20Valley\"&gt;Thistleshrub Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that if the adventurer found them that meant others could, Saffy and Grizzek promised to give the hero Feathers in exchange for telling everyone that they had died. With that, the pair drove off on Grizzek's bike. While Gallywix was convinced, Gazlowe saw through the adventurer's lie and was happy that Grizzek still lived.\nRise of Azshara.\nGallywix, along with &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;, were the only two leaders to stay loyal to Sylvanas. Gallywix was discovered burning paperwork when &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; asked him if he had completed his preparations. Gallywix subsequently revealed that the mechs were good to go but remarked that they weren't cheap and that Sylvanas better be ready to pay on delivery.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nGoblins exalted with the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; are sent to deliver a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Package\"&gt;Mysterious Package&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hobart%20Grapplehammer\"&gt;Hobart Grapplehammer&lt;/a&gt; only to discover that Gallywix has not only used forgery to get Hobart under contract but has managed to buy all of &lt;a href=\"Crapopolis\"&gt;Crapopolis&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"MOTHERLODE%21%21\"&gt;Motherlode&lt;/a&gt;. Upon discovering that Hobart has no intention of giving him the &lt;a href=\"X-52%20Personnel%20Armor\"&gt;X-52 Personnel Armor&lt;/a&gt; Gallywix and &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Scoundrel\"&gt;Hired Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt;s attacked Hobart's workshop only to be driven back. Despite this minor setback Gallywix returned with greater numbers and took Hobart prisoner, with the intention of claiming the armor as his own. However, Hobart stubbornly refused to yield to Gallywix to the point of giving the X-52 Personnel Armor to Gallywix's &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;old rival&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting fight between old rivals ended with Gallywix trapped in his own armor and forced to renegotiate his contract with Hobart, whose shaking him down actually impressed the Trade Prince.\nBy the time of the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, Gallywix had left the Horde and the Bilgewater Cartel and fled from Orgrimmar along with the rest of Sylvanas' inner circle. This caused Thrall to turn to &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to take over the Cartel. Gazlowe promised to pay the goblins more so that they wouldn't be funded by Gallywix. It is unknown how this affected his contract with Hobart.\nShadowlands.\nAt some point, Gallywix traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and was able to gain access into &lt;a href=\"Tazavesh%2C%20the%20Veiled%20Market\"&gt;Tazavesh, the Veiled Market&lt;/a&gt;. He could subsequently be found within the &lt;a href=\"Myza%27s%20Oasis\"&gt;Myza's Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, where he seemed to be in a meeting with the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Negotiator\"&gt;negotiators&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Xy\"&gt;Cartel Xy&lt;/a&gt;. He was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Scoundrel\"&gt;Hired Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt;s, and despite officially no longer leader of the Bilgewater Cartel, he still appeared with the title of Trade Prince.\nQuotes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGossip.\nOrgrimmar Embassy.\nYeah, sure.

One needed not worry about competitors' heads, as only males with the thickest crests chose to compete. It seems to be an ancient sport, as it was described as a \"basic ritual\" and &lt;a href=\"Socrethar\"&gt;Councilor Othaar&lt;/a&gt; liked to think that it showed how far the eredar had come. \nAt the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Aspirants\"&gt;Circle of Aspirants&lt;/a&gt; in Eredath, players can challenge each other in \"jed'hin\" by using the &lt;a href=\"Jed%27hin%20Master\"&gt;Jed'hin Master&lt;/a&gt; \"vehicles\".\nOrigins.\nJed'hin was originally a fan-made conception of player Isei-Silva.\n\"Jed'hin\" started as a fan-made game set inside of the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt; between a couple of friends in the and then as small tournaments within the draenei-related guilds Te'amun and Sha'nash of , and the Sha'tor on Wyrmrest Accord. It has since spread across other guilds and &lt;a href=\"roleplaying\"&gt;roleplaying&lt;/a&gt; servers.\nWhat is \"Jed'hin\"?\n\"Jed'hin\" is a competitive full-contact wrestling sport where a wrestler attempts to force another wrestler into submission within a large, circular ring. The sport originated in &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, where it was practiced professionally.\nIn addition to its use as a trial of strength in combat, \"jed'hin\" has also been associated as a spiritual ritual.\nProfessional \"jed'hin\" can trace its roots as a form of sporting entertainment. Only males participate in \"jed'hin\" due to both physiological reasons and cultural ones: males represented perseverance and strength, females represented diligence and gracefulness.\nWinning a \"Jed'hin\" Bout.\nThe winner of a \"jed'hin\" match is either:\n1.The first wrestler to force his opponent to step farthest from the ring\n2.The first wrestler to force his opponent into submission\nThe referee or judge may award the win to the wrestler whose opponent uses an illegal move, they also can call the match and declare the winner if the fight's taking too long for the sake of the losing wrestler, due to the superior skill of his opponent, since he was already in an irrecoverable position with no chance of winning.\nMatches consist of several rounds and only last a minute, as usually one wrestler is quickly ousted farthest back or pinned. However, they can occasionally last for several minutes.\nA professional \"Jed'hin\" Bout.\nAt the ring both wrestlers face each other from opposite ends of the ring, and must bow to their opponent simultaneously. The referee can restart the bout if this simultaneous reverence does not occur.\nAt the referee's command, both wrestlers charge and must crash their crests first before they are allowed to grapple each other. The referee immediately calls out if there has been crest contact. Different grappling techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and take-downs, joint locks, pins and other grappling holds are allowed. Some kicking moves are also allowed, as are some types of tail swipes. The referee can decide whether a move was excessive in force, or illegal altogether.\nBouts are typically very short, usually less than four minutes. If after four minutes, or five matches, the wrestlers are still deadlocked with no end of the bout in sight the referee can determine the winner.\nStyle in \"Jed'hin\".\nWrestlers are bare-chested, though some wrap their necks and chest to help stiffen the muscles.\nA large, thick belt (three-layered) that covers half up the chest is usually worn to protect the exposed abdomen from kicks. The belt is optional.\nTraditionally, novices wore leggings so that they could learn leg positioning and other take-down techniques. Experienced wrestlers switched to thick kilts that prevented the opponent from knowing where the opponent's legs were so as to heighten difficulty and prolong the match. Nowadays, both leggings and kilts are interchangeable.\nSpeculation.\nAs he used to be a renowned brawler, &lt;a href=\"Zuraal%20the%20Ascended\"&gt;Zuraal&lt;/a&gt; might have practiced Jed'hin."}

In the beginning, there was Light and there was Void, and a time long ago, the two clashed, creating the parallel realms of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and the Twisting Nether.The Nether is an ethereal dimension of chaotic &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s that connects the myriad worlds of the universe.\nNature.\nThere are a thousand ways to perceive the Nether, every voyager sees it differently, depending on circumstance, form, and state of mind. Illidan projecting his spirit into the Nether saw it as a black, airless void in which a billion stars twinkled, and behind and beneath him blazed the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; from which he had come. A snake of energy leading out into infinity represented the flow of energy of the portals the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; use. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; perceived it as a chaotic realm where the universes sparked by the Light and Shadow bled together; a place of pitch black skies, twisting and filled with strange, conflicting powers. Countless worlds appear on the edge, seemingly close enough to touch and yet unimaginably far away. The Light intermingles with the Shadow, the primal uncontrolled forces of chaos and order, life and death, clash.\nThe Nether, though separate from the physical universe, still has physical objects, such as planets. It transcends all realities and is normally imperceptible to mortals. &lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; passes differently deep inside the Twisting Nether, and it is impossible to tell whether days, years, or centuries have passed. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; have fought in the Nether for a thousand years from their perspective, while on Azeroth it has been only a few decades. A week on Azeroth could be a month in the Nether, or ten or many, many more.\nFrom within the Nether, Turalyon could witness &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction without being there. He was standing in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, in a copy, or illusion, of Draenor, witnessing the cataclysm all around him, and yet unaffected by any of it, until &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; extirped him from the Twisting Nether and brought him back to the real Draenor, now &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins.\nBefore life began and before even the universe existed, there was only the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. The Light existed as a boundless sea of living energy, swelling across all of existence, unfettered by time and space. Yet as the ever-shifting sea expanded, pockets of cold nothingness appeared. From these, the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; was born. The Void quickly grew and began to move against the Light. Eventually, the mounting tension between the two forces ignited a series of explosions that ruptured the very fabric of creation, giving birth to the physical universe.\nThe energies released from the clash between Light and Void raged across the nascent universe, forming countless primordial worlds. For long epochs, the ever-expanding &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; broiled in a maelstrom of fire and magic. Shards of Light were flung throughout reality, suffusing worlds with the spark of life.\nThe most unstable energies however coalesced into an astral dimension now known as the Twisting Nether. Light and Void collided and bled together at the edges of this realm, throwing it into turmoil. Their energies would give birth to the very first &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The Twisting Nether is the only place where demons can truly die. Although the Twisting Nether existed outside the borders of the physical universe, its volatile energies would occasionally tear through the veil of the Great Dark, flooding into reality and warping creation.\nHistory.\nThe world of &lt;a href=\"K%27aresh\"&gt;K'aresh&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart by the portals to the Twisting Nether and to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; opened by &lt;a href=\"Dimensius%20the%20All-Devouring\"&gt;Dimensius the All-Devouring&lt;/a&gt;. While the K'areshi managed to block the flood of shadow energy, it was the arcane energies of the Nether that shattered their physical bodies. All that remained were their souls, bristling with magic. They became known as incorporeal creatures named &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn pursuit of his studies, a &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Arrexis\"&gt;Arrexis&lt;/a&gt; gathered his apprentice magi and from &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Kirin%20Tor%20Camp\"&gt;his camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Arrexis was performing research on &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and the way it bends reality. He found a way to stop the warping from happening within special wards, but while bringing the wards up reality was weakened. &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, came to the camp and encouraged Arrexis to try his ritual on demonic realms. When the magi began their casting, they inadvertently opened a path between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the Twisting Nether, catching the attention of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balaadur\"&gt;Balaadur&lt;/a&gt;. Arrexis and all of his followers were ripped through the gateway and were never seen again. One account states that within the Twisting Nether, a handful of demons fell upon the shocked magi and slaughtered them to the last, with Balaadur taking &lt;a href=\"%3AEbonchill\"&gt;:Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Akaari%20Shadowgore\"&gt;Akaari Shadowgore&lt;/a&gt; proved herself with the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, she requested that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; allow her to roam the Twisting Nether for a time. He agreed, curious to see how she would further the goals of the Burning Legion. She spent time skulking among the ranks of Sargeras's own armies, rooting out discontent and erasing ambitious demons who hoped to seize power at the Legion's expense. She became skilled in the art of interrogation, able to inflict untold pain and suffering upon any creature able to scream. She built a &lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Citadel\"&gt;citadel&lt;/a&gt; on a dead world to hold prisoners and extract knowledge from them.\nInvasion of Draenor.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and his most loyal followers opened dimensional portals and the orcs escaped into the Twisting Nether. There, they were captured by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAn in-game area called the \"Twisting Nether\" was added with \"\". It can be reached by flying beyond the edges of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and, in practice, serves a similar function as that of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt;: a mere border to the in-game representation of the world. Also in common with the Veiled Sea, the Twisting Nether has its own general and local defense channels.\nEven though the Twisting Nether does not seem to be part of Outland, players can explore it with a flying mount and remount if they choose to explore the floating masses on foot. There does not appear to be a fatigue warning as one gets exploring the Veiled Sea. If you fly too far out or too high, you simply get an audible sound indicating that you can't go any farther. For a druid in flight form, the bird makes a screeching noise. Note that there have been reports of random invisible dismount flags strewn about the Twisting Nether. According to these reports, the mount and player character will make a jerking motion when you approach these flags.\nSometimes, taking the boat to &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt; will make you join Twisting Nether chat channels for a split second just after the loading screen. This happens because &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, like the nearby &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, is actually located on the Outland map despite appearing geographically in the Veiled Sea. Drinking &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Energy\"&gt;Pure Energy&lt;/a&gt;, provided for a quest at &lt;a href=\"Toshley%27s%20Station\"&gt;Toshley's Station&lt;/a&gt;, also causes the zone display to say \"Twisting Nether\".\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; dismantled parts of the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; and built &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. These machines harvested magic from the Twisting Nether and stored them in magical cells sent to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the manaforges weakened the fabric of reality in Netherstorm and caused it to deteriorate the state of the entire region.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the early stages of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dalynnia%20Wrathscar\"&gt;Dalynnia Wrathscar&lt;/a&gt; teleported themselves into the Nether and channeled their powers into &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; back in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; diverted the magical powers that coursed beneath Azeroth to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, the world's crust splintered, and the resulting unstable rifts tore the very fabric of the magical dimension of the Twisting Nether.\nCataclysm.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"Phaseblood%20Potion\"&gt;Phaseblood Potion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; shifts you into the Nether.\nWarlords of Draenor.\n began harnessing the power of the Twisting Nether bringing its creatures into &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Pillars of Fate&lt;/a&gt; in .\n&lt;a href=\"Kalandrios%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Kalandrios&lt;/a&gt; in sends adventurers into the Twisting Nether by &lt;a href=\"Through%20the%20Nether\"&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Beacon\"&gt;Nether Beacon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; enemies drawn by Warsong shaman want to connect the Nether into Draenor through .

Toward the end of the fight, the ship leaves the Nether to appear in orbit above &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Twisting Nether is a formless place of magic and illusion. It is indistinct and chaotic, with no size or shape. Coterminous with all other worlds, the Twisting Nether can be a gateway for those who know how to use it. For mortals, the Twisting Nether is notoriously difficult to access. Spells and portals can take one there, but few other options exist. Traveling to a location within the Twisting Nether, such as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, can then lead a hero into the formless plane itself. In the non-canon &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; books, it is also known as the Abyssal Plane and even possibly the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Below\"&gt;Dark Below&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe worlds of the universe are orderly, bound by physical law, and comprehensible. The Twisting Nether is everything the worlds are not. It is a stream of pure chaos that surrounds the worlds and binds them together.\nChunks of worlds float among prismatic clouds, and colorful energy ribbons twist through the void. All is spectral and shadowy \u2014 blurring together in a muted, multicolored haze that brushes and teases the senses. Physical laws do not exist in this realm of ghosts, save those that a traveler creates for his or herself. Magic and illusion dance across the ever-changing vastness.\nThe Twisting Nether does not co-exist with these worlds in any physical sense. It is a completely different state of being, one that is fundamentally incompatible with the universe as most creatures know it. Someone cannot look from the Nether into a world and vice versa; it is much easier to move between the Nether and a world. A shadow walk spell will take one through the Nether as he moves from place to place, and one can reach the Twisting Nether and its inhabitants with just about any planar travel or communications spell. Entering the Twisting Nether brings one to a realm of pure, lunatic thought. Most of the Twisting Nether is protean, never appearing the same for more than a few seconds. Colors change, it grows dark and light from moment to moment, sparkles and strange sounds emit and then vanish. One moment someone is suspended in nothingness, the next he is standing at the bottom of a deep canyon of purple rocks. His next shift may be to a tiny rock suspended in a starry night, and he has no way of knowing whether the change will occur in seconds or days. The Nether is an intensely magical environment, and some speculate that it is the true source of all arcane magic.\nThe Twisting Nether has subjective directional gravity. The strength of gravity in the Twisting Nether is the same as on Azeroth, but each individual chooses the direction of gravity's pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects\nand non-sentient creatures. The Twisting Nether can be very disorienting to the newcomer, and the plane appears weightless. Movement is controlled by the will, and one can travel in any direction simply by deciding to do so. Creatures in the Twisting Nether can move normally along a solid surface by imagining \"down\" near their feet. If suspended in midair, a person \"flies\" by merely choosing a \"down\" direction and \"falling\" that way in a straight line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one's movement by changing the designated \"down\" direction. Though limited to regular movement speeds, one can sprint as long as he wishes without growing tired. The Twisting Nether does not restrict him from simply appearing wherever he wants to within it (this normally \"impossible\" action is known as point-to-point movement). Merely existing within the Nether strains the mind of non-native creatures, though, and ignoring traditional physical laws is even more painful. Creatures native to the Twisting Nether, such as demons, can move point-to-point at will without any handicap.\nThe Twisting Nether is of infinite size, there are no known borders to the Nether. Age, hunger, thirst, poison, and natural healing do not function in the Twisting Nether, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the plane. It is also strongly &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;chaos&lt;/a&gt;-aligned. It also enhances magic. Magic is extremely powerful in the Nether. Any spell cast while in the Nether has its duration extended. Illusion spells cost no mana and last for extended periods. \nThe Twisting Nether is highly morphic and little shifts occur all the time in the Twisting Nether, and many changes are caused by the landscape adjusting itself to fit the thoughts of those within it. Worry about war, and the landscape may become a battlefield populated with undead soldiers. If one is lonely, his lost love may step out of a nearby cottage. The solidity, detail, and potential danger these images possess depend on how well a creature can control its thoughts. If a creature is in control of its thoughts, then images the creature's mind triggers are benign or easily ignored. If it doesn't control its thoughts, then the images that appear are realistic and frightening. Strong-minded individuals may consciously influence the Twisting Nether. The changes made may be subtle or drastic. One can create an image of a dog wandering around the area sniffing others and licking any hand that is presented or place oneself and those nearby at the top of a windswept mountain. A creature cannot create any knowledge that it does not already have. If someone creates a well-appointed library, for instance, the only information in the books is information he already knows. If more than one creature tries to manipulate the environment, the one with the strongest will controls the environment. This control persists until another stronger willed creature changes it. The forces of the Twisting Nether steadily erode any attempt at a static environment. If someone creates a cozy chalet with a roaring fire on the hearth, he should not be surprised if a few moments later the fire poker has morphed into a duck. A harmful environment created requires all those within the area to be willful to avoid being harmed by it.\nResidents.\nThe first edition of the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\" listed a number of creatures that could be encountered in the Twisting Nether, as described in the \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20%26amp%3B%20Light\"&gt;Shadows &amp; Light&lt;/a&gt;\" sourcebook. Most of these creatures are either standard \"Dungeons and Dragons\" monsters translated to the \"Warcraft\" setting, or creatures unique to the \"Warcraft RPG\", and are therefore non-canon."}

First up, Tony and three Southsea Burnmasters:\nThe Burnmasters, with 1651 health, have a Flamethrower attack as their one ability:\nTake out the burnmasters closest to Tony, then wail on him until he closes the chests. Up next is Tony and two Southsea Grenadiers:\nThe grenadiers, with 330 health, only throw dynamite:\nSame as before, take them out then turn back to Tony. He next brings in a huge group of Southsea Parrots:\nRoughly seven parrots with only 83 health each spew out of the cages. A single AoE move is all that is necessary to kill all of them, but they only hit for a few points of damage each.\nThe fourth phase has tony bringing out a Southsea Engineer:\nShe has 165 health. Her ability:\nAs the boss warning indicates, this can one-shot players at the appropriate level, so kill her quickly!\nThe fifth phase introduces a friendly Confused Murloc!\nThe murloc and all of the baby murlocs are friendly, so take this opportunity to unload on Tony.\nIf, after all five phases, Tony isn't dead, he will repeat the process as long as it takes for players to kill him. When he finally does bite the dust, he will jump out of whatever chest he is in and return to his spawn position before perishing.\nLoot him and exit the cave, remembering to bribe the ogres on the way out.\nOn complete:\nSuddenly, the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Tony%20Two-Tusk\"&gt;Spirit of Tony Two-Tusk&lt;/a&gt; appears, haunting the player, offering the next quest!"}

His death created a power vacuum that caused a civil war among the remaining air elementals, squabbling over who was strong and clever enough to take his place. One amongst them, Typhinius, sensed Al'akir's lingering essence within the weapons and used it to end the civil war, proving himself to be so strong that his rivals could not stand against him. While using the Fists of the Heavens, he was very powerful, but very unstable, taking all he had to keep the chaotic energies of the weapons from tearing him apart. In this mad state, he attempted to launch yet another invasion of Uldum while most of Azeroth's champions were preoccupied with the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that the air elemental forces were severely weakened from their civil war a few months prior. Wishing to finish what Al'akir started, he led his forces against the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; tol'vir, but was swiftly defeated, the power of the Fists alone not being enough to win his war.\nRetreating to Skywall, the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grandmaster\"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; tracked Typhinius down and finally killed the mad djinn. The Grandmaster held the Fists of the Heavens and, as the teachings of the monks require balance and harmony of spirit, they were able to wield the Fists as Typhinius and Iramaat could not, using them in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;."}

He once resided at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Order\"&gt;Temple of Order&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. Tyr died fighting against Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;'s minions, after his betrayal was made known to both Tyr and &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;. He was buried in a tomb now known as &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, beneath a lake in what is now called &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, named in honor of his ultimate sacrifice. Many years later, the Aspects returned to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and rediscovered the titan facility of &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;. Working together with the organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, they used the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt; and titan technology to restore their ancient friend in a new &lt;a href=\"Titansteel%20Bar\"&gt;titansteel&lt;/a&gt; body, allowing the titanic watcher to live again. \nTyr is regarded as a dear friend to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, who he worked together with to defeat &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; long ago. His valiant sacrifice to protect the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; would cause him to be revered by them, and his legend would be passed on to their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; descendants. Tyr was the inspiration for the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nOrdering of Azeroth.\nTyr was one of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; to lead the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; armies during the &lt;a href=\"war%20between%20the%20titans%20and%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;war between the titans and the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Tyr was imbued with strength and courage by &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. As the mightiest of the Keepers, the great warrior Tyr was armed with &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;an immense hammer&lt;/a&gt;, inspiring courage in everyone who fought at his side.\nTogether with &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, he battled and defeated &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;. During their battle Ragnaros retreated to the heart of his lair where he was strongest, and filled it with thick, dark smoke. Tyr's hammer shined as a silver beacon in the darkness, and it moved to and fro, back and forth. The strange movements confused Ragnaros, who thought Tyr and Odyn were too cowardly to approach him. When Ragnaros let his guard down, Tyr burst through the smoke and scored a staggering blow against him. With Odyn at his side, they brought the Firelord down.\nDawn of the Aspects (past).\nCountless years after the Ordering of Azeroth, Tyr observed the &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s from the shadows, particularly the intelligent ones such as &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. When the massive &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; began devouring proto-dragons and the victims became undead, Tyr made his presence known to Malygos and asked for the clever blue's help, as well as the help of Malygos's companions. Tyr blamed himself for Galakrond's mutations, saying it was never intended. Tyr explained that his fellow keepers would not face the danger of Galakrond as they are not tied to Azeroth like its native species are, and so he all but begged Malygos for aid.\nLater, Tyr used an undead proto-dragon to catch the attention of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. Some time after, Malygos found his way to the three of them. As Malygos and Tyr conversed, Ysera in an effort to reason with the undead proto-dragon freed it and only survived due to Malygos quickly destroying the fiend. However, Malygos soon fell into the hunger for flesh, having been bitten earlier, but was brought back to his senses by Ysera. Remarking that Ysera was special and Malygos had the strength to resist the hunter for so long, Tyr used his powers to heal Malygos of his ailment. He then proposed hunting Galakrond and decided to stand by the proto-dragons this time, revealing a war hammer from beneath his cloak. Lastly, he pulled out an octagonal artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, moving it to the three proto-dragons as it glowed, with the promise that he was \"trying to ensure some future.\"\nGalakrond returned outside the cavern, chasing &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos and Tyr moved to the entrance to witness their battle, and Tyr was overjoyed at the proto-dragons' coordination. Alexstrasza, Malygos, and a now full-sized Tyr joined in the battle. Temporarily stunning Galakrond with his hammer, Tyr ordered the proto-dragons to flee as he stayed to battle the monster.\nAn unknown time later, Tyr met with the five proto-dragons, informing them that Galakrond was sleeping in a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;mountain range to the north&lt;/a&gt; and that it was the perfect time to attack. He told them to eat before doing so, and just before they left Tyr held the Spark of Tyr before Nozdormu and Neltharion as he had to the others before. After doing so, Tyr vanished in the blink of an eye.\nTyr and the proto-dragons met up near Galakrond's slumbering place. Save for Ysera, they all began the battle against Galakrond, who had grown larger and even more mutated than before. Throughout the battle, the Spark of Tyr on Tyr's belt glowed ever brighter. When Galakrond suddenly expanded in size without warning, Tyr's hammer could no longer harm him. With a flap of wings, Galakrond called up a massive wind that scattered the fighters. Ysera suddenly appeared and Galakrond attempted to devour her, but Tyr silenced his laughter with a mighty blow from his hammer. Tyr pulled Galakrond to the ground and began to mercilessly beat him even as Galakrond began mutating further - as he began to resemble a true &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the battle, Tyr's hammer and the Spark of Tyr were knocked free from his person. Tyr reached to grab the Spark, just as Galakrond's massive maw came within range and the monster clamped down on Tyr's hand. Malygos moved to save Tyr, examining the bloody stump as Galakrond roared in triumph and grew ever larger.\nAn unconscious Tyr was brought to a frozen lake by the proto-dragons, only to vanish from the shore. While the proto-dragons believed some beast had taken him for food, they later met two other Keepers who revealed that they were the ones to bring Tyr home. With Tyr out of commission, the proto-dragons had to defeat Galakrond on their own. However, it was Tyr who had brought them together and shown them the power they wielded united, and in doing so he had convinced the other Keepers that they were worthy protectors of Azeroth.\nTyr's friend &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt; would later help Tyr replace his severed hand with a closed fist made of silver, and also added Tyr's new silver hand symbol onto his hammer. Jotun agreed, but asked why Tyr would want to draw attention to his wound by marking it on his hammer. Tyr replied that he did not consider his argent hand a reminder of defeat. For him, it was a symbol of the sacrifice he had made to defend Azeroth, and he wanted the world to see it that way as well. He renamed his hammer &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; were uplifted, Tyr created the &lt;a href=\"refti\"&gt;refti&lt;/a&gt;, a titan-forged race that would work in harmony with the dragons. He also crafted the facility &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Uldorus&lt;/a&gt; for the dragons, which they started calling \"Tyrhold\", much to his embarrassment.\nLoken's rebellion.\nWhen one of his fellow keepers, &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, fell to corruption, only Tyr and &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; did not fall victim to Loken's schemes. Tyr had long suspected something was wrong with Loken, so he was not caught by surprise. However, since Loken had vast armies at his disposal, Tyr, Archaedas, and their friend &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; hid in the outskirts of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; to plan their next move while Loken hunted them. After looking for them and not finding them, Loken assumed they had fled far away from Ulduar.\nLoken later instigated the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;, fought between the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, Tyr and his companions were approached with pleas of help by the beleaguered earthen. Tyr and his friends immediately emerged from their hiding place to lead the earthen and attack the Winterskorn, eventually driving them back for a while. Tyr, alongside his companion &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, forged a shield named &lt;a href=\"%3ATruthguard\"&gt;:Truthguard&lt;/a&gt; and gave it to a &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; champion named &lt;a href=\"Yrgrim%20the%20Truthseeker\"&gt;Yrgrim the Truthseeker&lt;/a&gt; to help expose Loken's treachery. This allowed them to convert many vrykul to their cause. After the Winterskorn came back, now riding on &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, Tyr called the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to help them put a final stop to their war. With their help, they defeated the vrykul and put most of the Winterskron in deep hibernation.\nAfter defeating the Winterskorn, Tyr decided it was time to take the fight to Loken. Otherwise, he would continue creating conflicts and destroying everything he could reach. Tyr and his allies decided to steal the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the extent of Loken's betrayal. Before instigating their plan, Tyr had to make some contingencies. He and Ironaya traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; where Tyr gave the Dragon Aspects a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;scale forged of pure silver&lt;/a&gt;. It was a gift that they could use to outwit the traitor Loken's schemes, though the Aspects were not told its purpose just yet. Tyr bid his good friends farewell for the last time, and though they wanted to help even without knowing where he was going, Tyr insisted it was something only he and the keepers could do.\nTyr came to Ulduar's entrance to distract Loken with requests for him to relinquish control of Ulduar. Meanwhile, Archaedas and Ironaya infiltrated Ulduar and stole the Discs. They then escaped back through the Storm Peaks and prepared to flee far away from that area, in order to find a new refuge where they could analyze the data and plan their attack. Tyr was able to gather many titan-forged that would accompany them in their journey: vrykul already afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, most of the surviving earthen and many &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s. Jotun, Tyr's friend, stayed behind to try to stop Loken from pursuing them.\nDeath.\nDiscovering the theft of the Discs, Loken panicked, thinking that if the Pantheon were to look at the information in the Discs, his life would be forfeit. Out of desperation, Loken sent horrific &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi monsters after Tyr's group, known as &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;. After many weeks they found Tyr and his companions, far to the south, in a tranquil glade. Tyr ordered Archaedas and Ironaya to flee further south with the rest, while he remained to hold off the C'Thraxxi. They fought for six days and six nights, and eventually, Tyr decided to sacrifice his life to protect his friends. He unleashed all his remaining energy in a blinding explosion, killing Zakazj and dying as well. The severely wounded Kith'ix fled to the west and did not come back.\nIn honor of her friend, Ironaya named the glade \"Tyr's Fall\", which in the vrykul tongue translated to &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. They built a &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; and buried Tyr and his foe where they lay. Then they created a shrine to Tyr out of his silver hand atop his tomb, as a memorial to his sacrifice. His hammer, &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, was stored inside the tomb as well. The vrykul were so moved by Tyr's sacrifice that they decided to settle at the battle site and guard Tyr's grave forever. Archaedas, Ironaya, and the earthen and mechagnomes continued south and ended up settling in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving anticipated his death, Tyr had crafted a disc containing his memories and entrusted it to Archaedas and Ironaya. When the time was right, the disc was to be given to the Dragon Aspects to tell them what to do.\nLegacy with humanity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; began to give birth to \"weak and ugly\" children around 15,000 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, leading them to believe their gods had abandoned them. The vrykul king &lt;a href=\"Ymiron\"&gt;Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; ordered that all the weak children be killed: the punishment for not doing so was that the child's parents would be executed alongside them. Despite the risks, however, not all parents obeyed this order and instead hid their children to grow up far away from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. These vrykul had heard of a lost clan of vrykul who had journeyed with Tyr, Archaedas, and Ironaya, and thus ventured for this fairy-tale refuge. Few managed to find &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and leave their children there. Legends later changed this story to say that it was Tyr who brought the humans to their new home.\nTyr's legend and symbol would haunt and inspire the humans forever after. The vrykul wrote down the basic details of Tyr's life, including Tyr's name, that he owned a warhammer, that he lost his hand while battling an unfathomable evil, and how he chose to replace it with a silver fist rather than make himself whole again. The vrykul interpreted this to mean that true order and justice can only be accomplished through personal sacrifice. The vrykul tale of Tyr and other stories from their culture were left with the humans, who kept transmitting it from generation to generation. While the origin of the tale was lost, Tyr's story was not forgotten and became a source of inspiration to humanity, particularly to &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient order of human paladins, replaced the vrykul that guarded the tomb and continued to guard it for thousands of years.\nDawn of the Aspects (present).\nKalecgos found the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; still clutched in his severed hand at &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. As Kalec is rocked by visions of the war against Galakrond, he often caught brief glimpses of Tyr observing him only for Tyr to vanish before Kalec could get a clear look. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; theorized that the ghost of the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buniq\"&gt;Buniq&lt;/a&gt; was actually Tyr in disguise. After reminding the Aspects of their duties via Tyr's recording device, Kalec once again thought he saw Tyr standing at Galakrond's Rest.\nGiven that Tyr had died before this event while combating Loken, it seems that Jaina was wrong about Buniq and that Kalec seeing him was either his ghost or visions brought on by the Spark of Tyr.\nLegion.\nAround the time of the Battle for the Broken Shore, a remnant group of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Farthing\"&gt;Twilight Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, found and opened Tyr's Tomb, hoping to awaken &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly corrupt the body of the dead watcher, to bring about the end of Azeroth.\nSometime after the Tomb was broken open, a priest and warrior, respectively had delved into the Tomb and retrieved &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; they sought, and having killed the Twilight's Hammer members they could find, they left the Tomb behind.\nLater on, a paladin, seeking &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt; itself, traveled to &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt; to find a paladin named &lt;a href=\"Galford\"&gt;Galford&lt;/a&gt; who had a &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and had gone to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Tyr. Galford was killed by Tyr's old friend &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt;, who had been cursed by Loken to attack any ally of Tyr's, but not before he had succeeded in using the Spark to see memories of Jotun aiding Tyr. After being defeated, Jotun allowed the Spark of Tyr to be taken. The paladin then delved into the Tomb alongside its guardians, and after killing the remaining dark forces found within, retrieved the Silver Hand. Due to a failsafe that was connected to the Silver Hand, the tomb then collapsed, preventing further incursions, so as to protect Tyr's secrets forever.\nDragonflight.\nA previously-undiscovered wing of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed the \"\", is discovered. Within its halls is a disc containing Tyr's memories that he entrusted to Ironaya and Archaedas along with the Discs of Norgannon, and it holds an important message for the Dragon Aspects. Before the disc can be retrieved, however, the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragon\"&gt;infinite dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; sends it to another time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt;, a dragon scale forged of pure silver that Tyr gave to the dragons long ago as a symbol of unity and friendship, begins to pulse with power. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes that the dragons returning to the isles has awakened the scale, and asks an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to investigate at &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt;. By placing the scale at various consoles in Tyrhold, ancient broken messages from Tyr are uncovered concerning Loken's corruption and Tyr, Archaedas, and Ironaya fleeing from Ulduar. After uncovering all of the messages the Aspects arrive at Tyrhold and Nozdormu shows a vision of when Tyr gave the scale to the dragons, shortly before he left for &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Alexstrasza says that she hopes Tyr would be proud of the dragons' accomplishments and how dragonkind has thrived, voice recognition activates a titan orb with a recorded message from Tyr. Tyr tells the Aspects that if they are receiving this message then a time of great need has arrived, but he is no longer among the living. He tells them to take the Silver Scale to his forge. Placing the scale into the console at the forge activates it, and with ancient &lt;a href=\"Titansteel\"&gt;Titansteel&lt;/a&gt; ingots forged by &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; himself that have been safekept by &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Irideus\"&gt;Watcher Irideus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Infusion\"&gt;Halls of Infusion&lt;/a&gt;, a new body for Tyr is reconstructed using schematics stored within the Silver Scale. But it is only an empty vessel, and in the absence of further instructions, the Aspects must figure out what to do next to restore his mind. Alexstrasza proposes either tracking down the disc containing his memories that the infinite dragons stole, or finding some other method.\nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; felt the energy that transcends time in the Silver Scale and believed that this would enable them to collect memories that Tyr did not implement on the scale. Thus, adventurers and &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; went to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and were able to acquire the memories of Tyr's final moments. After uploading the memories to the copy of Tyr, the body moved briefly, before shutting down once more.\nFollowing the events of &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;, the reformed &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; worked together to recover the lost disc containing Tyr's memories. After they placed 3 beacons at key moments of the timeline, Chromie and Eternus triangulated the disc in possession of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nTyr has silver skin and golden hair. A thick, long mustache extends down to Tyr's chest. Tyr's eyes are yellow and lack pupils, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; compares them to those of a night elf. He often wears a cloak and hood, and an octagonal object called the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; is strapped to his silver belt - the same Spark which grants Kalecgos visions of prehistoric Azeroth during \"&lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Dawn of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;\". The Spark of Tyr's purpose was a sort of recording device, meant to remind the Aspects of their greatest moments should they ever feel as though they did not deserve their powers. Underneath his cloak, Tyr wore a crimson tunic and no armor save for shin guards. A band with diamond patterns wrapped just above his right elbow and a crimson cape attached to his tunic with a high, pointed collar.\nAfter one of his hands was eaten by &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, Tyr replaced it with a closed fist made of silver. His hammer was named &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyr has the ability to make his body appear much smaller than it actually is, about the size of a night elf or tall human. It is unclear if Tyr actually shrinks or the shrinking is only an illusion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;'s Cathedral of Light, there was a stainglass depicting Tyr, as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s imagine him. The Keeper was imagined as a proud, regal warrior of broad features and noble bearing. Surrounded by a halo of golden light, Tyr held a mighty warhammer in one hand and a large, leather-bound tome in the other.

As the name suggests, it was the place where the &lt;a href=\"titan%20keeper\"&gt;titan keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; made his final stand against the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; generals &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;. Under the lake lies a &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt;, the final resting place of Tyr, which collapsed.\nThe tomb and the surrounding area have been guarded by a secretive group of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThousands of years ago, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; and their followers fled &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; after stealing the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from the corrupted self-appointed Prime Designate &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;. To pursue them and recover the discs, Loken sent two of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; generals\u2014&lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who felt the lingering touch of their master &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; on Loken's mind and decided to abide.\nIn a tranquil and temperate glade far to the south, the two C'Thraxxi finally overtook them. Fearing for his allies, Tyr ordered his friends to lead the rest of their followers farther south while he held off the enemy for as long as he could. Only a faint of &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;'s power lingered within Tyr's iron form, but still he decided to make a stand. As he fought with the C'Thraxxi, torrents of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; energy ripped through the once peaceful glade. The violent struggle between them lasted for six days and nights, but Tyr never gave ground, though neither did his foes. As fatigue began to set on Tyr, he resolved to sacrifice himself to protect his allies. Unleashing all of his renaming power, Tyr expended his life force against his enemies in a blinding and massive explosion of arcane energy that was even sighted by Archaedas and Ironaya in the far south. The two titan-forged turned back and returned to the battlefield. There they found a gigantic crater crackling with arcane magic. In it, the lifeless bodies of Tyr and Zakazj rested. Kith'ix had narrowly escaped Tyr's vengeful onslaught, who, severely wounded, fled west, not to be seen again for many years.\nIn honor of their fallen friend, Ironaya named the glade surrounding the crater \"Tyr's Fall\", which in the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; tongue translated into \"Tirisfal\". She and her followers buried Tyr and his foe where they laid, placing Tyr's massive silver hand atop his final resting place as a memorial to his valiant sacrifice. Although everyone there would carry on the story of Tyr's noble endeavor, the vrykul, in particular, felt compelled to do something more. They were so moved by the keeper's deeds that they decided to settle at the battle site and stand vigil over &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tyr's tomb&lt;/a&gt; until the end of their days. Honoring their wishes to settle there, Archaedas and Ironaya\u2014and their &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt; followers\u2014continued their journey to the southeast, eventually reaching the easternmost titan-forged vault in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time, the crater was filled with water, becoming a lake and burying the tomb underneath it.\nTyr's Guard.\nThe vrykul watching over the tomb would form the order known as the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;. These vrykul, knowing that they would not live forever, started inducting some of the fledgling &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s into their ranks, teaching them the history of the fallen keeper, his tenets of self-sacrifice and justice, and the truth of what laid within the tomb.\nTyr's weapon, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, was held here alongside Tyr, with a failsafe set up in the tomb that should the hammer ever be removed from where it was held, the tomb would collapse.\nThe only time they ever failed their task was when, thousands of years later, the legendary human king of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;, obsessed with his specie's history after abdicating his throne, eventually traveled to Tirisfal Glades, where he discovered the tomb of Tyr. In his intent of breaching into the tomb, he and his &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; accidentally broke the wards that kept Zakajz dead within the tomb. To protect the world from such creature, Thoradin fought the reawaken Zakazj with his sword &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt;, eventually managing to not let the creature escape. Although the human king fell in battle, his sword kept the monster at bay for millennia, keeping it from regenerating fully. The Tyr's Guard knew that Thoradin's magi had broken the tomb's wards and its members made a vow that they would not enter the catacombs again, for fear that further meddling could awaken the C'Thrax buried inside and unleash its evil on the world.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; swept over the human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Tyr's Guard crumbled. Only a few brave members, led by a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt;, remained to uphold their ancient vows.\nLegion.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a remnant group of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"Farthing\"&gt;Twilight Deacon Farthing&lt;/a&gt;, found and opened Tyr's tomb, hoping to awaken &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly corrupt the body of the dead watcher, to bring about the end of Azeroth. To this end, they set up their base of operations on the shore of the lake.\nSometime after the tomb was broken open, at least two &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 ventured to Tyr's Fall and defeated the Twilight forces at the lake. They then went into the tomb itself and retrieved &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar, the Warbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and after they killed Farthing and Zakajz the Corruptor, with all the Twilight's Hammer members they could find, they left the tomb and Tyr's Fall behind.\nLater on, a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; adventurer delved into the tomb alongside &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt; and the Tyr's Guard, seeking to claim &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary warhammer of Tyr himself. After they killed all the remaining cultists outside, and the abominations of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; found within the tomb, they finally retrieved the fallen watcher's hammer. However, due to a failsafe that was connected to the artifact, the tomb then collapsed, preventing any further incursions. The paladins and troops of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; then left the area, knowing that tons of rocks and water would protect Tyr's secrets forever.\nDragonflight.\nAt some point after his order was decimated and the artifacts within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; secured; &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt; found that the tomb had not fully collapsed. He endeavored instead to remain, standing vigil over it as the last remaining Tyr's Guard for several years, until at some point the defense systems locked him out.\nAfter the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; ventured to the tomb to find memories of Tyr, the old paladin decided to aid them with activating the various mechanisms in the tomb, hoping that they contained enough memories to activate the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt; in order to revive Tyr's new body. After witnessing Tyr's sacrifice through a titanic console, Travard told Koranos and the hero that his faith has been renewed and returned to &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; with them, while the Tomb of Tyr collapsed once more, this time definitively."}

Originally an order of &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to protecting &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s body for eternity, they were replaced upon their death by their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; descendants, who carried out their secret mission for centuries. However, even after they became paladins following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Tyr's Guard was decimated by the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, but the survivors continued to carry out their duty under the leadership of a paladin named &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Farthing\"&gt;Twilight Deacon Farthing&lt;/a&gt; threatened the safety of their secret charge, and the Tyr's Guard requested aid from the paladins of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. After they secured the legendary hammer at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the Tomb of Tyr was believed to have collapsed with all its secrets, with Travard as the last surviving member of the order. It was later revealed that the tomb had only partially collapsed, and that Travard resumed his duties alone for years.\nFollowing the rediscovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer returned to the tomb and recruited Travard for their mission of restoring Tyr; the tomb at last collapsing in earnest while Travard dedicated himself to reviving the legendary keeper in the order's name. Using &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; as their new base of operations, Travard and Koranos recruited new members across the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to restore the Tyr's Guard, and together, they began their quest to retrieve the disk containing the keeper's memories.\nBackground.\nOrigins.\nThousands of years ago, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; and their followers fled &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; after stealing the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;. To pursue them and recover the discs, Loken sent two of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; generals, &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing for his allies, Tyr faced them alone for days and sacrificed himself to defeat them. After they found his lifeless body, the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who accompanied them were so moved by the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice that they decided to settle at the battle site to guard Tyr's grave forever.\nIn honor of her friend, Ironaya named the glade \"Tyr's Fall\", which in the vrykul tongue translated to &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. They then built a &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; to bury Tyr and his foe where they lay, and created a shrine out of his silver hand atop his tomb, as a memorial to his sacrifice. His hammer, &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, was stored inside the tomb as well. The vrykul then enchanted the tomb with protective wards and bound the legendary hammer to these magical seals, thereby preventing anyone from touching it in the future. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Yrgrim%20the%20Truthseeker\"&gt;Yrgrim the Truthseeker&lt;/a&gt;, the champion of Tyr, who helped to build the tomb and decided to stay guarding his tomb. While most other refugees continued south, the vrykul were moved by Yrgrim's example and stayed with him. Yrgrim stayed at Tirisfal Glades for several years, teaching the vrykul there about the pursuit of justice and nobility. Once he had taught them all that he could, he departed to find a champion that could bear his &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; in his stead.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity emerged in Tirisfal Glades, while the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron-skinned vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who lived there slowly died off after they suffered from the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Yet one group of vrykul lasted longer than the others, and formed the Tyr's Guard to protect the tomb. As they knew that they would not live forever, they started inducting some of the fledgling humans into their ranks, and taught them the history of the fallen keeper Tyr, his tenets of self-sacrifice and justice, and the truth of what laid within the tomb.\nIn the ancient days, the only time they ever failed their task was when the legendary human king &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;, obsessed with his race's history after abdicating his throne, eventually managed to discover Tyr's final resting place. When Thoradin arrived at the tomb, Tyr's Guard confronted him, and though they did not want them to disturb the gravesite, they also did not want bloodshed. However, Thoradin and his followers forced their way past, and the Tyr's Guard knew that Thoradin's &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; had broken the tomb's wards. As they feared that further meddling could awaken the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; buried inside, and unleash its evil on the world, they made a vow that they would not enter the catacombs again.\nFor thousands of years, Tyr's Guard continued its sacred duty. New members came and went, and over time they adopted more techniques to help them protect Tyr's tomb. In particular, the defenders felt an affinity toward the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, holy warriors who arose to battle the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The members of Tyr's Guard learned how to wield the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, and they became mighty paladins. Yet even this newfound power could not save the order from the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; swept over the human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Tyr's Guard crumbled. Following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, only a few brave members, led by a paladin named &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt;, remained to uphold their ancient vows.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Travard and &lt;a href=\"Efrina\"&gt;Efrina&lt;/a&gt; went to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to seek for help, but with the ongoing invasion, no one wanted to come to their aid, and the old paladin hoped that the remnants of their order would be enough to carry out their duty. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; was sent by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; to find Travard in the city, and to bring him at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to help his organization.\nIn order to save &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the Legion, Tyrosus asked the hero paladin to search for legendary holy &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;. At their request, he redirected them to Travard, announcing that the small order of paladins has come forward claiming to know the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;. The old paladin then explained that they are the protectors of &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, and that recent intrusions of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; have revealed the secret position of the tomb, endangering the ancient weapon.\nWhile he prepared a strike force for the tomb, Travard sent the hero paladin to &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in order to find his brother &lt;a href=\"Galford\"&gt;Galford&lt;/a&gt;, as the latter journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious artifact that would allow them to pass the wards protecting the warhammer. However, after he learned about the fight between Tyr and &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lanigosa\"&gt;Lanigosa&lt;/a&gt;, and discovered the Spark of Tyr at &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, Galford tried to meet the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt; (without knowing about his curse) and was killed. The champion of the Light then fought Jotun, who handed them the Spark of Tyr in a moment of lucidity, and they brought the artifact back to Travard who learned with sadness of his brother's death.\nAs too many knew about the location of the tomb, Travard stated that it was necessary to close it forever, but only after they recovered the hammer. With the help of Tyrosus, the old paladin gathered the members of the Tyr's Guard and departed with troops of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. When the hero paladin arrived at &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, Travard and his paladins had just finished eliminating the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; at their camp, although there had been &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Paladin\"&gt;casualties&lt;/a&gt; during the battle. When they entered the tomb, they discovered many abominations of the void and had to eliminate them before Travard could begin the ritual to claim the hammer. However, the ritual could not be performed as one of the Sparks of Tyr was stolen and taken in the depths of the tomb. During their descent towards the &lt;a href=\"Grave-Prison%20of%20Zakajz\"&gt;Grave-Prison of Zakajz&lt;/a&gt;, the Tyr's Guard eliminated many void creatures, until they encountered the &lt;a href=\"Horrific%20Aberration\"&gt;Horrific Aberration&lt;/a&gt; who killed Efrina and her brother &lt;a href=\"Duvall\"&gt;Duvall&lt;/a&gt;. After they slew the monster, Travard resumed the ritual while his allies protected him from &lt;a href=\"Mordoth%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Mordoth the Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, and once the hero paladin was in possession of The Silver Hand, everyone fled from the tomb which began to crumble.\nAs the only remaining member of the Tyr's Guard, Travard explained that Tyr's body and its secrets, as well as the prison of &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, were now buried and protected under tons of stones and water. He then announced that the champion of the Light was in his opinion the most worthy person to carry and protect the legendary artifact, and that they would soon meet again.\nFollowing the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, with Travard's assistance, the Head archivist &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Elda\"&gt;Sister Elda&lt;/a&gt; recorded the writings of the Tyr's Guard in the &lt;a href=\"Libram%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Libram of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAt some point after his order was decimated and the artifacts within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; were secured; &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt; found that the tomb had not fully collapsed. He endeavored instead to remain, standing vigil over it as the last remaining Tyr's Guard for several years. However, at some point, the defense systems locked him out for unknown reasons.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; ventured to the tomb to find the memories of Tyr, they found Travard frustratedly locked out. The old paladin decided to aid them by activating the various mechanisms in the tomb, hoping that they contained enough memories to activate the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt; in order to revive Tyr's new body. He defended the group in the main chamber before leading them to the &lt;a href=\"Darkwalk\"&gt;Darkwalk&lt;/a&gt;; where they found a second console after the first short-circuit. The hero activated the console with the Silver Scale, showing them Tyr's last stand against &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;. When the keeper faced an image of &lt;a href=\"Mordoth%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Mordoth the Hunter&lt;/a&gt;; Travard realized that the creature who eliminated his brethren was hunting for Tyr. After witnessing Tyr's sacrifice, Travard told Koranos and the hero that his faith had been renewed and returned to &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; with them, while the Tomb of Tyr collapsed once more, this time definitively.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;, Travard was present when the Silver Scale was presented before Tyr, and then stated that his new mission, as the last of the Tyr's Guard, was to aid the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; in restoring the legendary &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;. He stated that he would gather elements of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to aid in restoring him, and that if Tyr was awakened, he would aid him in his mission.\nFury Incarnate.\nAs he had faith Tyr would need him again soon, Travard made the hard decision to leave the past behind and reforge Tyr's Guard. If Tyr was to walk the world again, the Tyr's Guard would be his vanguard and his servants, following his values and carrying his will. He and &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; later met a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to find worty recruits. However, while the Silver Hand envoy gave them the names of a few of their paladins, none of them were what they were looking for. As a result, they ended up seeking out four paladins he felt fit the virtues he was after. These came in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20prelates\"&gt;Zandalari prelate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nolaki\"&gt;Nolaki&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Talthis\"&gt;Talthis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hadwin\"&gt;Hadwin&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Valunei\"&gt;Valunei&lt;/a&gt;. From their camp near &lt;a href=\"Brackenhide%20Hollow\"&gt;Brackenhide Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, which served as their training grounds, Travard began their rigorous formation and taught them the story of the legendary keeper.\nIn order to triangulate the location of Tyr's disc, &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; asked Travard and the Tyr's Guard to help the adventurer deliver three beacons to three different places in the &lt;a href=\"timeway\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt;s. Before they began their quest, Travard announced that his recruits were now ready for their last assignments to become full-fledged members of the Tyr's Guard. After each new recruit received their equipment, all of them were sent to fight against the &lt;a href=\"decay\"&gt;decay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and their corruption around &lt;a href=\"Brackenhide%20Hollow\"&gt;Brackenhide Hollow&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the adventurer. Once they all successfully complete their trials, Travard organized the Tyr's Guard initiation ceremony on the steps of &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;. Bathed in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, their tabards changed to a brilliant gold and white, signifying the Guard's reformation.\nNow ready, the Tyr's Guard met &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; who announced they had determined where the paladins needed to place the beacons. Three groups were sent to place them in the timelines, Travard and the adventurer traveled at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Order\"&gt;Temple of Order&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;, Hadwin and Nolaki went to an unknown destination, while Talthis and Valunei ended up in &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Since the latter were the only ones who did not return, Travard led the Tyr's Guard to help them, and discovered that Valunei had fallen prey to a &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; who took the appearance of her former master &lt;a href=\"Iriska\"&gt;Iriska&lt;/a&gt;. Once the abomination was killed, the paladins guarded the last beacon until the signal was operational.\nAlthough they were successful, the paladins barely made it back from their battle with the Black Empire. Worried for his recruits after such an experience, and for himself because of the weight of his responsibilities, Travard asked the adventurer to speak with each member of them to ensure that they were doing well. Once assured everyone was ready to continue their duty, &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; announced that Tyr's disc was in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; was in its possession. However, Travard ordered his subordinates to rest, and announced that he and Koranos set up their headquarters in Tyrhold, where they would continue to train and prepare for their future incursion into &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nBefore they embark on their last training trial, it is a tradition that recruits receive their gear from the highest-ranking Tyr's Guard, who bestow their tabard and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard%20Bulwark\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; on them. The members originally wore the same &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, both being inspired by the same story. Since the reformation of the organization, they now use a custom tabard of their own, with the same iconography and design, but instead, with the colors of gold and white over light blue and silver.\nWhen Travard and Koranos sought recruits to reform the Guard, they recruited individuals who had an intense commitment to the virtues that made Tyr the greatest of the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s: justice, order, compassion, and self-sacrifice.\nThey consider themselves to be \u201cBrothers\u201d and \u201cSisters\u201d."}

Subsequently, the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; defeated the undead forces within Tyr's Hand and took control of the city.\nDescription.\nTyr's Hand lies on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Bay\"&gt;Tyr's Bay&lt;/a&gt;, within the area originally known as the &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the oldest and most revered holy sites of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Because of its religious significance, Tyr's Hand is also known as a \"city of &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es\". It is home to both the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Basilica\"&gt;Scarlet Basilica&lt;/a&gt; and the fortified &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand%20Abbey\"&gt;Tyr's Hand Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. The latter consists of three sections: the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Hall%20%28Tyr%27s%20Hand%29\"&gt;main hall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Arms%20%28Tyr%27s%20Hand%29\"&gt;hall of arms&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Library%20Wing%20%28Tyr%27s%20Hand%29\"&gt;library wing&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is a heavily fortified city, able to hold its own against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Its most important military structure is the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;. It also has its own &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s reign of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, many humans expanded the nation settling in the &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;northern lands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, formerly ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s. These humans populated the &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt; some 2,700 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and founded new Arathi settlements.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, with its origins tracing back to the chaos of the Troll Wars, was founded some centuries later in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It became a predominant human religion and the church constructed temples and shrines throughout the human lands. Among the oldest and most revered of these holy sites were the temples in the Eastweald, including Tyr's Hand.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, troubles arose in Tyr's Hand when the local &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt; population fell into a state of minor revolt. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was forced to fight the rebellious peasants. Eventually, the uprising was quelled and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; were summoned to watch over the populace. It was later discovered that the rebellion was started by &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; spies in hopes of concealing the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish mining facility located in the region.\nEventually, the Horde used &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt; to attack the area, establishing a &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; on an island at the mouth of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Bay\"&gt;Tyr's Bay&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to cut off the Alliance supply lines into &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The city suffered heavy damage as the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s razed the bayside area.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, as the Eastweald was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and turned into the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, Tyr's Hand held on. Under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Lord%20Valdelmar\"&gt;Lord Valdelmar&lt;/a&gt;, the fortified city withstood almost daily attacks by the undead. Eventually, it allied itself with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. The knights extended their protection to the city, while also hoping to recruit additional personnel from there. As the Order of the Silver Hand splintered, the city allied itself with the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe city was controlled by Crusader Lord Valdelmar and the Scarlet Crusade, holding out against the Scourge dominating the Eastern Plaguelands. It sent supplies and reinforcements to other Scarlet locations. Daily reports were sent here from &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; via heavily escorted &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Courier\"&gt;couriers&lt;/a&gt; who had to fight their way through the Plaguelands.\nProminent Scarlet Crusade members here included &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Scarlet Oracle, &lt;a href=\"Demetria\"&gt;Demetria&lt;/a&gt;. The latter was eventually lured out of the city by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and ambushed on her way towards &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s were sent here to steal a vial of the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand%20Abbey\"&gt;abbey's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; in their quest to attain the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Charger\"&gt;Thalassian Charger&lt;/a&gt;. Adventurers also entered the city to loot a &lt;a href=\"%3ABrilliant%20Sword%20of%20Zealotry\"&gt;:Brilliant Sword of Zealotry&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a battle near Tyr's Hand, the Crusaders utilized the artifact weapon &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;:Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt; to great effect, defeating a Scourge army outnumbering them twenty to one.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nTyr's Hand was the center of the holdout area known as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, also encompassing &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt;. The area came under attack by the Scourge &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, . Although High General Brigitte Abbendis initially organized the resistance, and a relief force from &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; was sent towards the city, Abbendis was eventually influenced by false visions of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and Scourge deception to abandon the area. She sailed away with some of her followers to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, forming the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;. The relief army led by &lt;a href=\"Galvar%20Pureblood\"&gt;Galvar Pureblood&lt;/a&gt; was decisively defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlthough most of the Scarlet Enclave was ruined by the Scourge, Tyr's Hand endured under the leadership of Lord Valdelmar. Among the survivors was the High General's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lynnia%20Abbendis\"&gt;Lynnia&lt;/a&gt;. Acherus eventually defected to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, who focused their efforts on destroying the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAs one of the last human holdouts in the area, the city was eventually able to collect many of the relics of Lordaeron. These included the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20Uther\"&gt;Shroud of Uther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%27s%20Sigil\"&gt;Gavinrad's Sigil&lt;/a&gt;, and others, which were mostly kept within the barracks.\nEvery Crusader within the city was turned into undeath, presumably due to the machinations of the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; posing as the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Crusader%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; sent an assault force of one hundred men to the area. Aided by adventurers, the Brotherhood was able to capture the city and eliminate the Scarlet leadership including the then undead Valdelmar himself. With this, the Scarlet Crusade definitely lost its hold over the city, which came under the control of the Brotherhood of the Light.\nName.\nThe city is named after the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;. He lost his hand in a fight with the massive &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, and had a new, &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;silver hand&lt;/a&gt; forged to him by the &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt; instead. Tyr eventually found his death while fighting the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, and was buried within the area now known as the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. He entered the legends of the humans, and his name is carried on by both the city of Tyr's Hand and the nearby &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Bay\"&gt;Tyr's Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nTyr's Hand serves as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;'s main base of operations. The city is manned by an army of Scarlet Crusaders and is untouched by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;undead plague&lt;/a&gt;. Located in the southeastern &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, Tyr's Hand is the only human settlement left in this part of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. In the city's center is the newly erected &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Basilica\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, a grand edifice that rivals &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; commands the city and its Crusaders and priests. The few humans who roam the Plaguelands desperately seek the safety of Tyr's Hand.\nTyr's Hand is very near to the border of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, which may help explain why that city remains relatively safe."}

While your victories have been notable, the menace of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; still hangs over the head of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lord Lothar&lt;/a&gt; has stationed your troops in the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt; to protect the borders of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Troubles have arisen in the township of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, with the local &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt; population in a state of minor revolt. You must quell this uprising and then summon the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to watch over the populace. To maintain order in the region, you must search out all of the Horde forces in the area and destroy them.\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\nBelieving they had forced all the orcs to withdraw from &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;'s commander was sent to quell an uprising in Tyr's Hand. Slaughtering human workers was unpleasant, but with the Horde nearby, this action was necessary to ensure their survival. Once the township was quiet, they had very little time to make preparations for war. They trained more peasants to speed up mining operations while their troops patrolled inside the town walls, ever vigilant for raiding orcs. &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; were constructed first, and then a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; near the forests on the east side of town. Next came the transformation of the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt;. To protect their efforts they constructed &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; to block the north and west entrances. Behind these they raised &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s, placing archers near them for good measure. The remaining troops were gathered near the other entrances while &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt; were prepared for the arriving paladins, who would hearten and watch over the people.\nOnce the township had been properly fortified, they began training knights and constructing ballistae for the coming battles. When resources were available, the keep was fortified into a stalwart castle and a &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; was constructed for the paladins, who invited the knights to join them and learn their craft. To ensure their success, they spent much time and gold preparing better weapons, armor, and ballista spears in the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;smithy&lt;/a&gt;. Ten paladins and four ballistae gathered in the courtyard before sallying out, and the long process of cleaning out orcs began in earnest.\nThey sent a single paladin northward to draw enemies toward a row of ballistae defended by paladins. Though many of the creatures turned back, a few were aggressive enough to fall into the trap. This they repeated until the number of guards in the northern camp was greatly reduced. Only then did they roll in the ballistae to help take out structures. Several raids were made on the Alliance township, but their fortifications held nicely with cannon towers defending them. They then started destroying the camp to the west of town, replacing fallen warriors as needed. Finally, they assembled a large force of mixed units to remove the stronger threat to the northwest and, with that task completed, constructed a second castle on the ruins to prevent further problems there. The Horde was now on the defensive and the ground was soaked with orcish blood rather than their own.\nAftermath.\nThe Horde forces around Tyr's Hand were destroyed, but unfortunately the orcs later launched a massive naval assault from &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Bay\"&gt;Tyr's Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Razing%20of%20Tyr%27s%20Hand%20%28WC2%20Orc%29\"&gt;razed&lt;/a&gt; down the city.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Tyranastrasz was an old dragon before he was captured, older even than Alexstrasza and the constant strain of his captivity hastened his death. He died by the hands of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; just before the Dragonqueen herself was liberated. His skeleton currently lies near &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, but his &lt;a href=\"The%20Skull%20of%20Tyrannistrasz\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; was found by the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Explorers\"&gt;Hall of Explorers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Library%20%28Ironforge%29%23Museum\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "15086", "revid": "50303572", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15086", "title": "Tyrande Whisperwind", "text": "Tyrande Whisperwind (pronounced \"teh-rahn-dah\") is the chosen high priestess of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the former general of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and the current head of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Together with her lifelong mate, the &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, she has represented the highest leadership of the night elves since the fall of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; caste ten thousand years ago. Since the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande is also the current incarnation of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, the embodiment of Elune's wrath.\nIn the years prior to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s first invasion, Tyrande was the object of both Malfurion and his brother &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan's&lt;/a&gt; affections. In the end, the priestess chose the druid over the sorcerer. After playing a pivotal role in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande was promoted to General of the Sentinels and would protect &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; for over 10,000 years while her lover and the druids slept in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande and Malfurion then led the night elves in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the Burning Legion as they had done in ages past at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. She subsequently stepped down as general, handing the reins to her adoptive daughter &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, to devote herself fully as leader of her people.\nAfter Malfurion had become trapped within the Emerald Dream for a prolonged period of time, Tyrande journeyed into the dream to rescue him. In the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande and Malfurion were wed and now lead their people as one. Together they supported the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; in their return into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande also restored complete night elf control over &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. However, following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande became the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; in response to the Horde's invasion of night elven territory and to claim justice against &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter killing &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas' right hand man who personally burned Teldrassil, Tyrande pursued Sylvanas into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. Though she eventually caught her quarry, Elune interfered at the last second, and the Night Warrior's powers became nearly fatal to Tyrande. In the end, Tyrande chose peace over vengeance, saving herself. She instead sentenced Sylvanas to atone for the burning of Teldrassil by collecting the souls of the Night Elves who had died because of her. She later worked with Malfurion to restore &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to life, which came at the expense of her husband taking Ysera's place in the Shadowlands.\nTyrande serves as one of the main protagonists in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" franchise.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nTyrande Whisperwind grew up together with the two male night elf twins, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, in the kaldorei &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, the city of her birth. The three were inseparable, playing in the woods, racing, learning to hunt. Tyrande consistently bested the brothers. She apparently had a number of dolls, but &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%27s%20Favorite%20Doll\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; was her favorite. Tyrande's idyllic childhood proved to be in sharp contrast to the sorrow and conflict that she would endure later in her life.\nAs the three young elves grew into adulthood together they encouraged each other to find their respective callings. Tyrande was to find peace in the Temple of Elune in Suramar, and became a novice priestess in the order of the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion, meanwhile, was taken under the wing of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, but Illidan was yet to find his own destiny, and searched for it in the arts of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan was enamoured by the very thought of Tyrande, but his brother never even noticed this \"contest\" of Illidan's over Tyrande's heart.\nThe &lt;a href=\"frostsaber\"&gt;frostsaber&lt;/a&gt; cub &lt;a href=\"Ash%27alah\"&gt;Ash'alah&lt;/a&gt; became her life-long companion sometime before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nShortly before the start of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande met the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;, whom she helped escape from captivity in Suramar, and later reunited with the time-traveling &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the War of the Ancients, Tyrande healed the wounded in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; along with the other priestesses, who had turned the Temple of Elune into a refuge. The brothers &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; both saw her as a love interest, but in the end Tyrande would only return the feelings to one of them.\nWhen the night elven rebellion led by &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; finally arrived to Suramar, the priestesses of the moon donned their armor and joined with them. Many civilians joined the host, and Suramar was abandoned. One of those civilians was a young orphan named &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, a little girl that would look up to Tyrande ever after.\nBefore High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Dejahna\"&gt;Dejahna&lt;/a&gt; died at the hands of the Burning Legion, she named her successor, one who was favored by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and touched with the power of the goddess herself, Tyrande. A new recruit herself, she doubted her ability to lead the order, yet she still accepted her new role as High Priestess in honor of Dejahna. All the priestesses agreed with Dejahna's decision for they too believed Tyrande's abilities to be extraordinary, and a sign of Elune's approval.\nTyrande was later abducted by the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned within &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s palace. The Queen found Tyrande beautiful enough to join her &lt;a href=\"handmaiden\"&gt;handmaiden&lt;/a&gt;s, though the priestess refused the offer. This led to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; attempting to murder her, and later to &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; freeing her when the rebel armies finally marched on the palace.\nThe Sundering.\nAs she felt the energies of Azshara's gateway grow, Tyrande knew that they had to stem the flow of demonic reinforcements. Malfurion came up with the idea that they must destroy the Well, which was doubtless the portal's location. At first, Cenarius and Alexstrasza were wary, knowing that only the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; gave them their powers. Tyrande, however, though she too enjoyed her immortality and power, realized that it must be done to save their world, and convinced them to go along with it.\nIllidan, however, would not hear of it, and despite Tyrande's pleas he abandoned his brother and made to warn Azshara. Tyrande and Malfurion quickly moved against them, but they were too late. Azshara, warned by Illidan, was all too prepared for them, and the magical onslaught she unleashed upon their forces devastated them.\nAs Malfurion fought at the entrance, Tyrande snuck into Azshara's palace with a small band of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and launched an attack from behind, but were startled by the queen's guardsmen. Though the Sentinels destroyed the guardsmen, most of them were destroyed, and Tyrande suffered near-fatal wounds. At the sight of his love falling in battle, Malfurion was enraged, and attacked Azshara. Their battle threw the spellcraft of the high-borne into chaos and the portal beneath the Well of Eternity collapsed with such force that the Well was destroyed, and the world was scarred, torn into fragments as floods engulfed the lands. \nTyrande managed to survive the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and she helped to lead her people back across the waves to Cenarius' land on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Cenarius and Malfurion had also survived, and they made the long trek back to land together. To their horror, however, a lake atop Mount Hyjal had become fouled by the magical energies of the Well of Eternity, which they had hoped was gone forever. It was Illidan, who had taken several vials from the old Well's waters and poured it into the lake, creating a new Well of Eternity. Malfurion, knowing that Illidan's addiction to magic would always be a threat to the safety of the world, imprisoned his brother in the caverns below Hyjal; the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the Sundering still fresh in their minds, Tyrande and the night elves dared not attempt to destroy the new Well.\nCurse of the Worgen.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande explained to &lt;a href=\"Ralaar\"&gt;Ralaar&lt;/a&gt; the connections between &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;'s ferocity and Elune. When Ralaar and &lt;a href=\"Arvell\"&gt;Arvell&lt;/a&gt; used the form, she asked Malfurion what their punishment would be. The archdruid responded that it will be the guilt for the deceased Sentinels. She then participated in a battle against the satyr where she witnessed the first &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; who destroyed the satyr's encampment but also attacked the elves. The night elven army had to flee. She eventually battled against the Alpha Prime and his feral worgen until Malfurion trapped them into &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; delivered by priestess &lt;a href=\"Belysra\"&gt;Belysra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Long Vigil.\nTyrande slowly went about rebuilding the night elven society. After the World Tree was made, the high elves exiled, and the mists shrouding Kalimdor from sailors raised, Malfurion knew that he had to leave Tyrande to rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande, not wanting to be alone, begged him not to, but he insisted, and drifted off into hibernation in a Barrow Den within the Moonglades, along with all the druids. Tyrande and the remaining night elven women reformed the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, and they kept peace throughout &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; with the help of Cenarius' sons and daughters, the Keepers of the Grove and the dryads, and the many creatures who knew and loved the Moon Goddess. But without Malfurion, she felt lost and alone, despite her devotion. Tyrande became more fierce over millennia of protecting their lands. She was now more willing to make any sacrifice needed to protect her people from danger. \n4,000 years ago, Tyrande saved the life of the frostsaber queen, &lt;a href=\"Shy-Rotam\"&gt;Shy-Rotam&lt;/a&gt;, at the hands of rampaging &lt;a href=\"Frostmaul%20Giant\"&gt;Frostmaul giants&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the frostsabers have been allies of the night elves.\nThe centuries passed, and suddenly, a new threat arrived on their shores. Tyrande and her people were partially aware of the events across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, but rarely intervened, and when they did, they did so in a subtle way. As the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; started, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s in the Emerald Dream sensed the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and informed Tyrande about it. She sensed the works of the Burning Legion behind it.\nInvasion of Ashenvale.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;remnants&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Kalimdor and made their way to Ashenvale, the Sentinels reported the strangers to Tyrande. Having assumed the worst, she was pleased that the intruders were not demons and suspected that they were old enemies, trying to escape from the plague. She initially ordered the Sentinels to observe the two groups as she hoped that the refugees were simply passing through the forest in order to find new lands. She was proven wrong when the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s started felling Ashenvale's woods. Tyrande would have none of it and the Sentinels attacked the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shadowleaf\"&gt;Shadowleaf&lt;/a&gt; Sentinels, led by &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, returned to report with sorrow that &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; had been murdered by the green-skinned invaders. Tyrande gathered her Sentinels once again, and she sensed a growing evil. Shandris, in counsel, suggested that perhaps it was the orcs, but still, Tyrande was still uneasily aware that there was a darker power hiding in the shadows.\nDuring her short campaign, Tyrande found a group of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s who were trying to leave Ashenvale before it was corrupted. Tyrande helped them gather their people and bid them farewell. \nAfter killing &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Lionheart\"&gt;Duke Lionheart&lt;/a&gt;, hordes of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; invaders suddenly swarmed into the settlement, and the orcs and humans were quickly overcome. Tyrande quickly withdrew her forces, knowing that her small detachment could not handle such staggering numbers. They retreated, tirelessly followed by the undead. Finally, they caught up to them, and their fel leader was revealed.\n&lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; slaughtered her kindred, and would have killed her if she had not quickly used the powers of Elune to hide in the shadows. Enraged, Archimonde ordered his &lt;a href=\"doom%20guard\"&gt;doom guard&lt;/a&gt; to find and destroy her. Hoping to warn Shandris before the Shadowleaves were attacked, Tyrande stealthily used her shadow powers to navigate the forests unseen. She collected the survivors of her cadre, and together, they raided the undead settlement blocking their way and made for the Shadowleaf encampment across the river.\nAwakening of the druids.\nTyrande knew that the time had come to awaken the &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; once again. Leaving Shandris to defend the forests of Ashenvale, Tyrande made haste for the Barrow Dens in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"dryads\"&gt;dryads&lt;/a&gt; reported that &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; were advancing on &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%27s%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Malfurion's Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; on the Moonglade was blocked by an orcish settlement. In a race against time, Tyrande destroyed the orc camp, defeated the Primal Guardians of the Moonglade, recovered the Horn of Cenarius, and awoke Malfurion Stormrage, her love. The Primal Guardians were the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protector\"&gt;Fire Protector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Protector\"&gt;Ice Protector&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Protector\"&gt;Lightning Protector&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalfurion believed that Archimonde's primary motivation was to assault &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree, steal its energies, and become a god. Together, they set out to &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; to awaken the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; from their &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Talon%27s%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Druid of the Talon's Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt;. However, when they arrived, Tyrande found the &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; furbolg tribe. They had not escaped the corruption after all, and Tyrande, having no alternative ended their suffering once and for all. Malfurion noted that Tyrande was different than he remembered, and she replied acidly that she did not have the \"luxury of sleeping through times of peril.\" It seems that as much as she loves him, she would prefer he spend time with her rather than his duties in the Emerald Dream.\nThe Barrow Deeps and liberation of Illidan.\nAfter the Druids of the Talon were awakened, they proceeded back to the base of Mount Hyjal, where they entered the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt;. However, they soon came to an elven door, and Malfurion recognized it as the door to Illidan's prison. Tyrande thought that they should free him, saying he would be the perfect power against the enemy. Malfurion forbade her to do so. However, Tyrande, enraged that he would forbid her anything, gathered her Sentinels and entered the prison.\nTyrande had first requested that the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; release Illidan, but they strongly refused. Not willing to tolerate dissent with the imminent danger facing Azeroth, Tyrande had the Watchers that opposed her struck down and cleared the path to Illidan's prison. After battling through &lt;a href=\"Califax\"&gt;Califax&lt;/a&gt; and his minions, and defying &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, the warden of Illidan, Tyrande found him, and bid him come back to help their people. Illidan, still in love with Tyrande, professed he would battle the demons, but not for the glory of the night elves. When they met Malfurion again, he rebuked Tyrande for freeing Illidan, and told her that he would have nothing to do with his brother.\nSoon after Illidan went to Felwood to battle the demons, Tyrande and Malfurion were alerted that Illidan was being attacked by Tichondrius. They quickly mustered their forces to assist him. When they arrived, they found that the Scourge and Tichondrius had been defeated, and found Illidan had beaten them by somehow transforming into a demon himself. Tyrande was horrified, and made no objection when Malfurion banished Illidan from the forests forever.\nBattle of Mount Hyjal and aftermath.\nSoon, Malfurion brought Tyrande to a hillock in Ashenvale, where they met the leaders of the outlanders. Tyrande sent them away, insisting that they had no place being there. Suddenly, a powerful mage appeared in the commotion and revealed himself to be &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the Last &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. He told them that Archimonde was a leader of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; with powers beyond any of them, and that they would only be victorious if they joined forces. With the death of Cenarius still fresh in her mind, Tyrande felt wary but soon realized that she had little choice. So, together they planned their defense of Hyjal. Tyrande also tasked the elf &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt; with assisting Jaina.\nTyrande, Malfurion, and Shandris helped to defend &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s base until it was finally overrun, then they moved to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. Finally, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; came upon the night elven settlement at the gates and destroyed it all. Everything was going according to plan.\nArchimonde, feeling over-confident by his victories, proceeded to attack the World Tree and disregarded the Ancestral Guardians who had begun to gather around the World Tree's roots. At Malfurion's command, the Ancestral Guardians amassed and began their assault on Archimonde. As a result, Archimonde was destroyed and the World Tree damaged. However, the group had won a victory against impossible odds.\nIn the wake of the titanic battle the allies went their separate ways. Jaina's people settled on the island of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall founded the territory of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and Tyrande and Malfurion remained on Hyjal and began rebuilding. They later took their people back to Ashenvale to begin healing the damage done by the Burning Legion.\nTerror of the Tides.\nAfter many months, Tyrande and Malfurion were in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, discussing that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; could intervene in the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were interrupted by a runner from &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, who reported that the Warden had come under &lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Isles%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;heavy attack&lt;/a&gt; by Illidan. Malfurion decided to go to her and reinforce her, and Tyrande was quick to follow him.\nTyrande and Malfurion sailed east to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and battled their way to Maiev, where they fought valiantly against Illidan's insidious &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev was grateful for Malfurion's assistance, but turned up her nose at the sight of Tyrande. Maiev told Tyrande that she was to blame for Illidan's escape and the murders of the Watchers who'd been guarding him, that she should be locked away like Illidan, but Tyrande defended her actions and told her she had no right to judge her. Malfurion told them to set it aside before they could trade blows.\nIllidan told her that he wanted to show her his power. However, Tyrande revealed a detail that had haunted Illidan for ten thousand years; she believed that raw magical power can never replace one's true inner strength. This is why she had chosen Malfurion over Illidan. Tyrande told him that now she realized it was a mistake to have ever set him free. As they were nearing victory, Tyrande noticed Illidan fleeing the scene and therefore took chase. Illidan ensnared her but spared her life. When Malfurion and Maiev arrived, Illidan was seen immediately fleeing.\nLordaeron and the Plaguelands.\nThe three heroes took chase across the sea once again, and landed on a strange, uncharted land. Malfurion recognized it as the conquered lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. With the forest so blighted by the passing of the Scourge, he felt he needed to commune with its spirits. He left Tyrande and Maiev alone together, telling them to settle their disputes another time.\nThey had begun to look for Illidan when they ran across a group of &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Remnants\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that they were being overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and were packing up their things and evacuating to across the nearby river Arevass. Tyrande resolved to help them, despite Maiev's protests. The Warden believed that they should ignore the elves and rush to find Illidan, but Tyrande insisted that they would not leave them unprotected since their brethren, the Alliance under &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; at Theramore, had aided them against the Burning Legion. Tyrande and Maiev thwarted the Scourge's relentless assault and finally arrived at &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt; village, but an ambush was lying in wait, and the caravan came under attack.\nTyrande told them to cross the river, and promised that she would hold the line. Maiev sneered at her nobility, saying that she would never hold against such forces. But Tyrande was confident that Elune would protect and strengthen her.\nAs the undead forces advanced, Tyrande called down the fire of the stars to crush all enemies of her people, and the lines of undead fell before her. But as she neared victory, the bridge she was on crumbled away, and Tyrande was swept up the river, deeper into undead territory. Maiev told her blood elf allies to help her hunt Illidan rather than save Tyrande.\nEncountering some remnants of her forces, Tyrande held out on a small island as the undead harassed her time and time again. Their tireless assaults began to wear away at the stalwart Sentinels, and Tyrande feared that they would be lost. But, to her surprise, Illidan battled his way to her and rescued her, bringing her through a portal to a safe area.\nWhen they exited the portal, Tyrande admitted her surprise at this sudden turn of events, and found that Malfurion and Illidan had joined forces to save her. Malfurion told Illidan that his actions saved his life, but that he would never be allowed to threaten the night elves ever again. Illidan understood, and vanished through another portal. Maiev arrived on the scene, furious at Malfurion's allowing Illidan to escape, and took her Watchers through the portal. Tyrande called for her to stop, but Malfurion advised the priestess not to waste her breath. Maiev had become the embodiment of vengeance, and would no longer listen to reason. Tyrande invited Malfurion to return home with her for a well-deserved rest.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn the aftermath of the horrific conflict, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and Tyrande helped their people rebuild their shattered villages and ruled them for a time. Slowly the night elves began to adjust to their mortal existence. Such an adjustment was far from easy, and there were many night elves who could not adjust to the prospects of aging, disease, and frailty. Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world. When Malfurion heard about this plan, he warned that nature would never bless such a selfish act. Shortly thereafter, Malfurion's spirit was somehow lost within the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and his disappearance deeply troubled Tyrande. Though his fellow druids attempted to find his wandering spirit, only his body remained sleeping within his &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Malfurion missing, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the leader of those who wished to plant the new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 became the new &lt;a href=\"Arch-Druid\"&gt;Arch-Druid&lt;/a&gt;. In no time at all, he and his fellow druids had forged ahead and planted the great tree, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, on a sizable island off the stormy coasts of &lt;a href=\"northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Under their care, the tree sprouted up above the clouds. Among the twilight boughs of the colossal tree, the wondrous city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; took root. However, the tree was not consecrated with nature's blessing and soon fell prey to the corruption of both the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe night elves made Darnassus their new capital city, and with Malfurion gone, Tyrande became the sole leader of the night elves, priestesses, Sentinels and Darnassus. Tyrande strives to keep the night elves from reliving the mistakes of the past, but Archdruid Fandral Staghelm's radical beliefs and aggressive demeanor would often lead him and Tyrande to openly quarrel.\nFour years passed since the mortal races banded together and stood united against the might of the Burning Legion. Though Azeroth was saved, the tenuous pact between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has all but evaporated. At some point, the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; allied with the Alliance, and thus participated in the re-emerging conflict with the Horde, especially in the territorial dispute over &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyrande became aware of the corruption eating away at the Emerald Dream. When &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; assaulted Moonglade, the High Priestess led a half dozen of her &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Ahn%27Qiraj%29\"&gt;fellow priestesses&lt;/a&gt; to aid the defenders. Tyrande herself took on Eranikus alongside &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the strength of the Nightmare eating away at Eranikus, the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;light of Elune&lt;/a&gt; as channeled through Tyrande was enough to free the \"Tyrant of the Dream\".\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; visited Darnassus to give the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; they also met Tyrande at the Temple of the Moon and later on at dinner when Lo'Gosh told his story to the priestess. She sensed the dark magic in his amnesia and sent the two friends to seek &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s council in Theramore.\nScourge Invasion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke, he sent his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; into all corners of Azeroth. To defeat the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and necropolises, members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; and created an artifact of the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s Light. Adventurers of the Alliance delivered it to Tyrande to defend the World Tree. Tyrande also added that the elves sensed another World Tree in the domain of the Lich King.\nStormrage.\nFollowing the Lich King's death, Tyrande was impelled by nightmares and visions of Malfurion's impending death to journey to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and rescue &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, she decided to venture into the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, where Malfurion's body was being hospitalized. She interrupted a summit of druids led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; to ask for their aid in finding Malfurion's dreamform. Realizing that Fandral wouldn't consent to aid her in her quest, Tyrande approached &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; and asked him to search for Malfurion in the Emerald Dream via the portal in &lt;a href=\"Bough%20Shadow\"&gt;Bough Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. She had suggested that Shandris accompany him, but Tyrande's true plan was to have Shandris stay in Darnassus, while Tyrande joins Broll in his quest. Traveling by Shandris' &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;, Jai'alator, Tyrande met Broll in &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;. All residents of the town have become victims of the Emerald Nightmare. The Nightmare sought to attack Tyrande and Broll but was rescued by a human male who used his power to teleport them to safety.\nThe trio materialized somewhere in the forests but the human was unconscious. When he woke up, he revealed himself to be &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt;. The three noticed a dragon so Lucan used his power to materialize near a cave, where Lucan sensed that the dragon was located. The trio entered the cave and found the dragon who revealed himself to be &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s corrupted consort, &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande healed him by using Elune's power. Eranikus revealed Lucan's history and the origin of his power. Tyrande and Broll asked Eranikus to help them in their search for Malfurion. Meanwhile, Lucan separated from the group only to be attacked by an orc, &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;, inadvertently forcing him to teleport themselves to the Emerald Dream. Broll realized what had happened and convinced Eranikus to take Tyrande and Broll to the Bough Shadow. There the night elves found just one guardian - &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt;. At first, Gnarl attacked the green dragon because he thought Eranikus to still be corrupted. Tyrande however, convinced Gnarl otherwise and the ancient allowed them to enter the Emerald Dream. As the elves were entering, &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt; the corrupted dragon attacked them. While Broll and Tyrande were attacked by nightmarish satyrs, Lethon and &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt; attacked Eranikus in order to corrupt him once more. The attack was unsuccessful as &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; came to help. The corrupted dragons were forced to retreat. Alexstrasza convinced Eranikus to enter the Emerald Dream and free Ysera. The night elves and the dragon entered the Dream. \nIn the the Nightmare infested Emerald Dream, they found Lucan, who was released by Thura. Lucan explained that she is closing in on Malfurion and plans to kill him. Tyrande believed that Thura was misinformed about Broxigar's death and was being deceived into assassinating Malfurion. Tyrande ran to free Malfurion and save him from Thura. Only Broll followed after her, but lost her in the forests. While she was running, the nightmare caught her - A vision of Naga Queen &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; tried to transform her into a naga, though the priestess used Elune's power to avoid the vision and fell unconscious. She was awakened by Malfurion's whispers to leave the dream, though Tyrande was determined to stop Thura from killing her love. As she continued, she finally found the place where Malfurion was kept, though Thura was also there. The two women fought each other, and Broll with Lucan joined the fray. At that moment, Thura was able to cut the tree with Broxigar's axe, which resulted in releasing Malfurion from his prison. Green dragons led by Ysera came to observe this, but Ysera was sucked into the Emerald Nightmare causing the Nightmare in the Emerald Dream to worsen. Tyrande, Malfurion, Broll, Lucan, and Thura then flew on a dragon to safety, though Malfurion returned to his body and the four of them were left to be attacked by Emeriss. The four were tossed into a portal to Azeroth. There, they encountered a corrupted Gnarl and fell to nightmares. Everyone except Lucan was suffering from their biggest fears. Tyrande dreamt about a dying Malfurion. At that moment Lucan used his power and once more they materialized in the Emerald Dream next to Eranikus. However, Eranikus was saddened by Ysera's imprisonment and he falsely threatened them in order to force Lucan to teleport away.\nThey teleported out of the Emerald Dream and materialized in Stormwind. There, they found King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who ordered &lt;a href=\"Major%20Mattingly\"&gt;Major Mattingly&lt;/a&gt; to accompany the group to an inn where the night elven ambassador lived. Tyrande was asked by Broll why the ambassador lives in that place and she responded that it is because of policy and it kept a close eye on her allies, which was for the good of all. When they got there, Tyrande and Broll went to the ambassador's chamber. They found what they were looking for - a &lt;a href=\"%3Ahearthstone\"&gt;:hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; connected to Darnassus. However, Tyrande was attacked by the dreaming ambassador. She ordered Broll to use the hearthstone. While Broll teleported to Darnassus, Lucan and Thura arrived to the chamber and helped Tyrande to calm the ambassador. They then heard Mattingly's scream, concluding that the Nightmare had also taken him. Because of this, the group teleported out of this place and materialized in the Nightmare. The Emerald Nightmare wanted to keep Tyrande as a prisoner and the three were about to be apprehended by &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;. The corrupted dragons also wanted Thura's axe, so Tyrande created a diversion so Lucan and Thura could teleport to safety. Though Lucan and Thura escaped, the axe and Tyrande remained within the Nightmare. Thanks to the efforts of Malfurion, she was later rescued by him. She tried to heal Emeriss, but she was destroyed as there was nothing left to heal. Tyrande then chose to stay with Malfurion; aiding him in his battle against the Nightmare Lord and his shadowy satyrs. After Xavius' defeat, Tyrande agreed to have him imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; was over, mortals returned to Azeroth to rebuild their world. So too did the high priestess and the archidruid. In Darnassus Malfurion and Tyrande held a great celebration as they at long last wed and became husband and wife.\nElemental Unrest.\nShe was present at the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings\"&gt;Elemental Unrest meeting&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind where she expressed her belief that the earthquakes may have been what brought the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nWhen word reached the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s fate (turning into stone while trying to help heal the land), Tyrande personally came to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. With Malfurion by her side she was in attendance during the ceremony honoring Magni. It was during this time that Lady Whisperwind met the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;young prince of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.\nSeeds of Faith.\nTyrande is troubled by the natural disasters caused by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; which has taken even more night elf lives from &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;. She fears for the safety of her adopted daughter, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, who she could sense was in peril. Despite Malfurion's council to stay in Darnassus during such dire times, Tyrande was determined to find Shandris and bring her to safety. Malfurion, knowing that nothing could derail her from protecting Shandris, followed her to the shores of &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande's intuition proved correct as they encountered the invading naga force that overwhelmed &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. The naga mocks Tyrande's role as the new queen of the night elves, a title she hates as much as the treasonous naga. With Tyrande and Malfurion fighting as one, the two night elves dispatched the naga army. Tyrande killed Lady &lt;a href=\"Szenastra\"&gt;Szenastra&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the naga invasion force, with a hail of &lt;a href=\"moonfire\"&gt;moonfire&lt;/a&gt;. Pressing on to a tower in the ruins of Feathermoon Stronghold, she encounters the critically injured body of Shandris Feathermoon. Saying a desperate prayer with the support of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and Malfurion, Tyrande was able to heal Shandris enough to save her from the brink of death. Tyrande later returned to Darnassus where she conducted the funeral rites for the dead who have fallen from the recent calamitous events.\nCataclysm.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; no longer lost in the Emerald Dream, Tyrande insisted that he joined her in becoming the co-leaders of their people, and she is to be found standing next to her spouse in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, where she continues attending to her duties as high-priestess and leader of the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters&lt;/a&gt;. No longer alone, she still strives to keep the night elves from reliving the mistakes of the past. She welcomed &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and the other Gilnean refugees into Darnassus, and asks for their aid in the night elves' war with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe wore a &lt;a href=\"Mooncloth%20Robe\"&gt;Mooncloth Robe&lt;/a&gt; and had blue hair, until her in-game model was changed, and Tyrande finally received a unique model.\nTyrande congratulates Alliance players who obtain the title of &lt;a href=\"The%20Loremaster\"&gt;Loremaster&lt;/a&gt; and reward them with their &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%27s%20Colors\"&gt;Loremaster's Colors&lt;/a&gt;.\nWolfheart.\nTyrande Whisperwind, along with her mate, Malfurion, knew that someone must guide the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to new heights in the wake of the Cataclysm. Especially since they now faced a revitalized &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by a violent new &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;. In a vision given to her by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande was shown that &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;'s favored champion, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, would come to battle the Horde. Tyrande believed that Varian was meant to be that leader for the Alliance. Both Tyrande and her mate set up a summit, not only to propose the induction of the worgen and Gilneas into the Alliance, but also to see if one would arise to guide the Alliance in this new world. When Tyrande got word of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s push to take &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande gathered reinforcements from her Alliance allies and personally led them into battle against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the battle for Ashenvale, Tyrande used Elune's light not only to dissipate the fog of war created by the Horde's goblin machines, but also to blind the Horde, which subsequently allowed the Alliance to decimate the invading army's front ranks. Garrosh Hellscream anticipated this however, and was waiting for Tyrande to reveal herself. With Elune's light revealing her location, Garrosh unleashed his &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; on the defending Alliance army and focused his efforts in killing the High Priestess. In the ensuing chaos, Tyrande was struck down and wounded by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; archers. The battle became bleak for the Alliance until Varian Wrynn and worgen reinforcements arrived to turn the tide of battle. With Varian Wrynn's leadership, the Alliance was able to drive the Horde back and force them to retreat. After which, the triumphant force returned to Darnassus. There Tyrande and Malfurion both agreed to appoint &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of a security force and proclaimed that Shandris would help Jarod to bolster his new force. After this, Tyrande and her mate headed toward the new summit, where Gilneas was finally voted into the Alliance.\nElemental Bonds.\nAs the battle rages on in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande appears alongside Malfurion to witness &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; become life-mates under Nordrassil.\nHour of Twilight.\nTyrande's past and future self appears in the first two Hour of Twilight instances, &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. In the first, set in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in a possible future where the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; is not averted, Tyrande is one of the four possible \"echoes\" of Azerothian heroes that serve as the first two bosses of the instance (before the final battle with &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"echo%20of%20Tyrande\"&gt;echo of Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; is located at the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, which has been bathed in perpetual night after the apocalypse.\nIn the second instance, set in the final moments of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande - along with Illidan - aids players in the battle against &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20and%20Varo%27then\"&gt;Mannoroth and Varo'then&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;When the Horde was about to attack Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina asked Tyrande and Malfurion for warriors and ships. The High Priestess and her husband sent Shandris and a group of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; to aid the defense effort.\nTyrande and her husband were also willing to help Varian in the counter attack by sending a few dozen ships.\nMists of Pandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Vaeldrin\"&gt;Lorekeeper Vaeldrin&lt;/a&gt; had long heard that long ago, there existed a Pools of Youth controlled by an ancient dynasty in a valley of golden blossoms. He urged Tyrande to approve his mission to find the Pools of Youth so that the night elves can reclaim their immortality. At first, Tyrande refused his request because of risks. However, after receiving visions of a light that will need to be found and defended, Tyrande sent out a group of Sentinels to accompany Vaeldrin and his daughter &lt;a href=\"Lyalia\"&gt;Lyalia&lt;/a&gt;, a Sentinel herself, to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and carry out the task she foresaw. Indeed, Vaeldrin found the Pools of Youth, but they were not the light Tyrande had seen in the vision.\nLandfall.\nTyrande and a cadre of &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; join the Alliance forces &lt;a href=\"patch%205.1\"&gt;landing&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. While there, she and her rangers begin to pursue a Horde party and eventually find them holed up in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"A%20Little%20Patience\"&gt;A Little Patience&lt;/a&gt; scenario, Tyrande is urging &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to take decisive action and charge the temple by force, before the Horde can completely fortify themselves or be rescued by reinforcements. However, Varian decided to take a more cautious approach and was able to lure out the Horde army from the Temple of the Red Crane and decimate them with the Alliance's hidden traps. The victory resulted in the annihilation of the Horde army and its commander with minimal to no casualties for the Alliance. After attaining victory, Tyrande acknowledges the wisdom of Varian's strategy and becomes impressed by his leadership. Tyrande then pledges the night elves' support to Varian's command.\nTyrande is later seen in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt; summit, where Alliance dignitaries and allies discuss the pros and cons of using the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;. She was horrified by the Sha's dark power and proposed to destroy them.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nTyrande mustered an army of her people and began a slow march towards Orgrimmar, picking up siege weapons and more troops on the way. After the Alliance and Horde rebel armada land at &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande's forces appeared from the west and using &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s, managed to destroy the front gate of Orgrimmar. Tyrande told &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; that her forces fought for Kalimdor, and not to save him. She also told him to get forces inside Orgrimmar while she and her &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; distracted Garrosh's Kor'kron.\nWar Crimes.\nTyrande served as the accuser during &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh's&lt;/a&gt; trial in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. Her husband &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; worried that this trial would change her forever. Her advisor for the trial was &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande displayed scenes from the past to prove the accusations against Garrosh, opposing the defender &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. To aid her case she displayed various scenes such as the threats he made towards &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, and more indirect crimes like the brutal enforcement of his law by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;. However, she also veered into moments where she came off as putting trying to put orcs and the Horde trial over Garrosh himself such as when she had &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; serve as a witness on the grounds that Dragonmaw were Garrosh' biggest supporters and when &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and his forces destroyed &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the majority of the trial, almost everyone believed that Tyrande had the upper hand against Baine, though her reckless disposition and personal hatred for Garrosh showed numerous times during the trial when she spoke out of line. After &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, freed Garrosh and took him with them, the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; revealed that they never considered executing Garrosh for even a moment, and that everyone else was on trial instead. Tyrande's desire for justice pleased the Celestials, but they disagreed with her, claiming that no matter the crime, everyone is capable of change and change can never occur if one is dead.\nLegion.\nTyrande attended &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and assuaged King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s doubts about their success against the Burning Legion. She also approved of Anduin's decision to accept the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance ranks, noting that they will be a powerful weapon in their war against the demons. When &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the funeral to inform the assembled leaders that Stormwind's guards have been infiltrated by the Legion, Tyrande realized that &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; had freed the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s from their imprisonment and the situation was even more dire than she realized.\nAfter receiving a vision of Malfurion, Tyrande traveled to &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to find that &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; had returned, corrupted &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and captured her husband. Angered, Tyrande began to pursue the Nightmare Lord through the forest. In her pursuit she discovered &lt;a href=\"Elothir\"&gt;Elothir&lt;/a&gt;, one of the three archdruids of Val'sharah, who had fallen to the Nightmare's corruption and dies before her eyes, but not before leading her down Malfurion's trail.\nA reunion with Tyrande was something Xavius has longed for for many years. With Malfurion held captive, Xavius gave the High Priestess an ultimatum: she could pursue him and spend her husband's last moments at his side, or she could return to the region's Temple of Elune and protect it from Xavius's forces which would be led by Ysera. Mournful and distraught, Tyrande chose her goddess over her love, though the decision hurted her. At the temple, Ysera was put to rest, and with her last breath she stated that the nightmare had felt so real. After the Dreamer's death, Tyrande tasked &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s with following Xavius and Malfurion into the &lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Tyrande can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, she is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nTyrande authorized the release of the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to the druids of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;, and sent &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; and several of the Sentinels to &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nInsurrection.\nTyrande later leads the Sentinels to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, nostalgic about returning to the city of her birth and aiming to wrestle it from those she once considered her people. Tyrande forms an alliance with the nearby &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, and has set part of her camp aside for &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her war mages.\nRecalling her home city's passivity during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when the elves inside Suramar erected a shield that trapped the other night elves outside their city while they were fighting the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and returning to find its streets now patrolled by demons that the Nightborne had later allied with, Tyrande has a fairly negative impression of both the Nightborne and Nightfallen exiles. In private, she called them \"mana addicts\" and said she left behind any regret for the ones that still serve the Legion after they went under Suramar's shield. She is also concerned if &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; will betray them and if she'll be any better a leader than Elisande or &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande tells the nightfallen leader that her people will see the Legion defeated and the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; destroyed, after which they'll go from there.\nThe high priestess has bulletins and posters placed within Suramar City itself, to tell the residents of the Alliance's arrival and hopefully inspire more to join the rebellion. On the eve of battle, Tyrande, like Liadrin, is somewhat ashamed to admit that her forces have been exchanging insulting items and verbal harassment with the sin'dorei camp, and has any such items removed before insults turn into violence. \nTyrande leads the kaldorei forces into Suramar after the sin'dorei and shal'dorei breach the city's center. The combined elven army fights straight to the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, but the kaldorei, sin'dorei, quel'dorei, and shal'dorei rebels are confronted by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; herself. When she turns to address Tyrande, Elisande claims that the kaldorei have disgraced their glorious past, hiding in trees and cloaking themselves in \"false piety\", no better than the trolls that skulk their forests. \nUsing her great mastery of time magic, Elisande traps the combined elven army in a time stasis and departs. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; then works together with an Alliance adventurer to rescue Tyrande alone from the time bubble, and a Horde adventurer to rescue Liadrin. The rest of the army, however, remain frozen in time on the steps before the Nighthold, the battle lost.\nTyrande takes part in the siege of the Nighthold, and is present when &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; kills . When Thalyssra and her advisors relocate to the site of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, which has become unstable without the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin and Tyrande observe whether the first arcanist will save it or let it die. After Thalyssra chooses to let the Nightwell die, Tyrande was hopeful that the Nightborne will learn to survive without the corrupting powers of the Nightwell.\nMoments of Reflection.\nBefore he left for &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt; for the final battle with the Legion, a revived Illidan created a crystal with a message for Tyrande. He spoke of how all the paths he had taken had led to a single purpose, saving the world; he could bide no half measures or compromises. He told her how whenever he faced doubt, he held on to one anchor: Her. He told Tyrande that she embodied the best of Azeroth with her faith and devotion, and asked her to take care of Malfurion. While he sometimes wished her heart had made a different choice, in the end he knew she made the right one.\nTyrande's response was to wonder if Illidan truly meant what he said. She spoke of how, after the events at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, she tried to let go of her feelings, her distrust and bitterness, toward Illidan. Yet upon his revival in the Nighthold, she could not bring herself to speak to him. But the time for talk had passed, and now Illidan had a duty to fulfill, as did she.\nBefore the Storm.\nAfter being made aware of the dire condition &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was in, Tyrande Whisperwind and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; met with King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the night elves' progress in healing Azeroth and their investigations about &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion told him that the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to assess the damage. As they rode through the city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, Malfurion further elaborated that the druids of &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; were all killed by Sargeras' destruction and Tyrande had sent &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;priestesses of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to help when she got word of their deaths. Although the night elves thought to make &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s to heal the wounds of Silithus, their priestesses and druids were unable to finish creating one with the goblins plundering Azerite from the land. The night elves however, found a vein of Azerite and took some samples to study. Malfurion told Anduin that although he cannot deny the magnificence of Azerite's power, he promised Anduin the night elves will do all within their power to prevent its misuse. Tyrande introduced &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt; to Anduin whose unit was providing protection to the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin commended Tyrande for her wise initiative and pledged some of his own men to guard further expeditions as well. During their discussion, a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; portalled in to deliver a message from &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos reported &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to him and informed Anduin she will be unavailable for the foreseeable future. Anduin revealed the message spoke of Jaina and all the leaders spoke of their hopes that Jaina will one day return to active duty in their coalition. With their business concluded, Anduin &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;hearthed&lt;/a&gt; back to Stormwind.\nAftermath.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; in order to recruit the nightborne for the Horde, Thalyssra reflected on how &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;their kin from Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; would have made for obvious allies. She had however perceived Tyrande's caution regarding the former Legion-affiliated nightborne as arrogance and mistrust. Liadrin sympathized by claiming that the blood elves had been scorned by Tyrande and the night elves as well.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nAfter being briefed of reports stating that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was deliberating heatedly the conquering of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind and King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; agreed this argument over war strategy indicated that the Horde had weaponized &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and were planning to secure a monopoly of the mineral in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; diminished from the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves remained the speediest &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; presence in Kalimdor to respond to Horde aggression. Tyrande had began to secretly amass a night elf army in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to intercept the Horde forces should they march to Silithus. After further reports indicated that &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had endorsed the Silithus campaign, Tyrande and the other Alliance leaders deliberated on their course of action. Tyrande stated that if the Alliance was in agreement, her army stood ready to deter the Horde's campaign. King Anduin in the end gave his endorsement to deploy the night elven troops. While Tyrande was at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; aiding in the planning for the upcoming war and with the night elf fleet en route to Silithus, the Horde saw an opportunity to attack &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; to hold the line. When word reached Stormwind of the Horde invasion, the Alliance leaders realized that the Horde had deceived them into weakening Ashenvale's defenses. The Alliance leaders coordinated with each other to accommodate as many refugees as possible and to reinforce the Ashenvale warfront. Tyrande planned to fight by Malfurion's side as soon as she could, but she had to tend to the needs of the refugees being evacuated to Stormwind before she could depart to Kalimdor. Though troubled by her people's predicament, she was uplifted by her allies' stalwart commitment to her people's well being. She in turn assured her allies that even should her city fall and be held hostage, the Alliance will not become divided. \nSometime in the late stages of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion's &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt; wall defense failed and he went off to confront Sylvanas alone. Malfurion sent a missive to Tyrande to tell her of his plan and his farewells. This new information had compelled Tyrande to fight by Malfurion's side despite Anduin's objections. When Anduin realized nothing he could say would dissuade her, he gave Tyrande &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20hearthstone\"&gt;his hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; that he had attuned to Stormwind and told Tyrande to come back with Malfurion alive, since their people would need their leadership in these troubled times now more than ever. After portalling into Darnassus, Tyrande gave an inspirational speech to improve morale for her people before taking her &lt;a href=\"Tamed%20Hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; to search for Malfurion. Tyrande prayed to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, who shined a shaft of moonlight from the sky to direct her to her beloved. Tyrande arrived to see Malfurion at the mercy of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. But the old orc had struck Malfurion from behind while he had battled &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, which he found dishonorable, and could not bring himself to kill Malfurion. Tyrande arrived just in time to heal Malfurion's grievous wound and saved him from the brink of death. For sparing her husband's life Tyrande allowed Saurfang to live, and she brought Malfurion to Stormwind with the hearthstone that Anduin had provided. She tasked an Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; with seeing to Darnassus during the Horde occupation, but soon after, the Horde burned &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; down. Tyrande went to the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; to aid in evacuation efforts and witnessed &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia&lt;/a&gt; rescue the last night elven refugee from the burning &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande named the last night elven survivor &lt;a href=\"Finel\"&gt;Finel&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 \"The last\" \u2014 for she was the last kaldorei to escape alive. Tyrande cradled baby Finel close and sang her an elegy.\nMalfurion and Tyrande briefly relocated to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; with Malfurion having fully recovered.\nThe Night Warrior.\nSome time later, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; spoke to Anduin to try and convince him to assault Darkshore and retake it from the Horde, but with the war focused on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;; Anduin did not have the troops to do so. As the three night elves spoke to Anduin, Tyrande went on ahead of the army to try and retake Darkshore herself. At the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;/Darkshore border, Tyrande's ship was attacked by the Horde, and she fled north while leaving behind her bow, her mount &lt;a href=\"Ash%27alah\"&gt;Ash'alah&lt;/a&gt;'s bridle, and a book about the Night Warrior ritual. The Night Warrior was the incarnation of Elune's wrath. The ritual to become the avatar of the Night Warrior was extremely dangerous, and even witnessing it would put you in danger. Legend said that long ago, the Night Warrior was used by the night elves to carve out their empire. None who have attempted the ritual since then have survived, for Elune's raw power tore them apart.\nTyrande arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Eye of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and from there to &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; to conduct the ritual. Along the way she lost Ash'alah, who was captured by the Horde. She was trailed by Maiev, Shandris, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; while Sira scouted the beach. The three found and saved Ash'alah and met with Tyrande at Bashal'aran, where she declared to Elune that, with Elune having stood by and done nothing during the War of the Thorns, Tyrande would continue to serve Elune only if she granted Tyrande justice. Tyrande survived the ritual to become the Night Warrior, the avatar of Elune's fury, and turned her attention toward &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; on the shore. Blaming the Burning of Teldrassil on herself for allowing Saurfang to live, Tyrande swore that the time for mercy was over. Along the way to Nathanos she confronted &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; and his forces, then swiftly killed them and froze Belmont in place with Elune's magic. Malfurion also arrived to fight Nathanos alongside his beloved; however, Tyrande instead told him to wait at the sidelines until she gave the command.\nNathanos and two &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; were attempting to raise not only &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; who had died during the War of the Thorns, but also Sira who Tyrande arrived just barely too late to save from being killed. Tyrande and the adventurer confronted Nathanos and the Val'kyr and a battle ensued, with Malfurion later joining the fray. Between them, the two Val'kyr kept Nathanos from being struck down and succeeded in raising Delaryn and Sira. Despite Tyrande's efforts to convince them not to give in to darkness, the two undead Kaldorei blamed both her and Elune for abandoning them and declared their allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. In retaliation, Tyrande slew &lt;a href=\"Brynja\"&gt;Brynja&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Val'kyr, provoking a retreat from the Horde forces. Shandris and Maiev arrived and the night elf forces flew back to the Zoram Strand. On the way, Tyrande placed Maiev in charge of the warfront in Darkshore, as despite their checkered history with each other the future of their race was on the line. When Maiev asked where Sira had gone, Tyrande hesitated and then asked to speak with Maiev alone.\nShe was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nWhile fighting in Darkshore, Tyrande did not respond to any of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin's&lt;/a&gt; missives. While Anduin led the Alliance leaders to the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to end Sylvanas' rule, Tyrande was not present. He feared that \"vengeance has consumed her.\" Through her efforts, the night elves successfully retook Darkshore for the Alliance.\nAfter the end of the Fourth War, Tyrande was present at Stormwind during the peace treaty. Tyrande interrupted Anduin's speech, saying the call for vengeance was still strong, that the Horde had yet to answer for their crimes and that they were untrustworthy, asking Anduin how he would handle it if Stormwind fell. She concluded by calling Anduin's faith in the Horde naive and left, but not before saying she wouldn't sign a treaty \"...unless it is written in &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;the Banshee's&lt;/a&gt; blood.\"\nShadows Rising.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion, Tyrande, and the night elven people made their new home in &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion and Tyrande had taken to ignoring any and all missives sent to them by the young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. In light of both the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; sensing something horrible within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion and Tyrande agreed for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to meet with them under the condition that the Earthen Ring &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; was to be present and for Thrall to bring what was owed.\nAfter Thrall and his companions (&lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;) arrived, Malfurion, Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and Maiev Shadowsong greeted them with frosty, rigid silence. Thrall formally apologized to night elves and explained how the Horde sought to change. When Tyrande stated she saw their words as empty pledges of justice, Thrall promised to give her the head of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; causing her smile and declare, \"Do it, then, or never seek to speak with me again.\"\nSometime later, the night elven leadership received another missive from Anduin revealing that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had sent them a gift, a start to what was owed. In response, Tyrande, Shandris, and Maiev journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; where they encountered the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev mentioned to Tyrande that she had lived a life consumed by vengeance and though there was no great love between them, she had no desire to see Tyrande become what she was. After Tyrande cut a shallow cut into Sira's neck, Shandris took her blade, and Maiev encouraged her to have mercy towards Sira, who Maiev saw as a sad defeated thing. Tyrande subsequently departed while Maiev and Shandris had more things to ask.\nDeath Rising.\nWhen the Scourge began to &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;rampage&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; gone, Tyrande was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; who sought to bring her to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. However, Tyrande neutralized her attackers.\nSeeking &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande came upon &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;engaged in battle&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. She subsequently ambushed him, and with the grown power of the Night Warrior, she easily dispatched the Banshee Queen's champion. Before killing him, she attempted to interrogate him to learn of Sylvanas' location. Nathanos instead offered cryptic answers and gloated that killing him would merely send him straight to her. He proceeded to attempt to taunt Tyrande further, only for her to kill him mid-sentence, after which she resumed her hunt. \nWhen the Alliance and Horde champions reported these events to &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; respectively, both expressed concern over Tyrande's state of mind. In addition, the latter hoped that her wrath would remain on the Banshee.\nShadowlands.\nShe was one of the Alliance leaders to convene with the leaders of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; voiced that they couldn't risk the stability of the Horde and Alliance and send their fellow leaders on what might well be a suicide mission, Tyrande grew hostile and called Lor'themar a coward. She further declared that she would pay any price to see Sylvanas impaled upon her glaive. In response, Calia called reminded Tyrande that the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; needed her in order to have any hope of finding peace. However, Tyrande was unmoved and was outraged that Calia spoke of peace, in light of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;atrocities&lt;/a&gt; committed by the Forsaken during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately the Horde and Alliance stood down when Bolvar called for it.\nAs she witnessed the ritual to open the doorway to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, she joined the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, while declaring that the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; was hers to kill. She then ignored Genn calling on her to stay behind, while directing her allies with rescuing the others. After making it through the rift, she charged ahead into the chaos of the Maw.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; had come to dwell in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; since her death during the Legion's invasion. She had been having dreams of night elf souls tortured in the Maw, Tyrande consumed by vengeance, and the destruction of Ardenweald. On Azeroth, Shandris had been having similar dreams. Shandris and an adventurer of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; were tasked by Ysera to travel to the Maw and find Tyrande. They located Tyrande, but she refused to leave the Maw while the souls of their people still suffered in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris and the Maw Walker followed Tyrande through the halls of the tower but were always one step behind her as Tyrande's vengeance would not allow her to stop. Shandris expressed concern that the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; would consume her. When they finally caught up to Tyrande they confronted a &lt;a href=\"Tortured%20Amalgamation\"&gt;Tortured Amalgamation&lt;/a&gt; comprised of countless night elf souls. After putting the souls out of their misery for oblivion would be a kinder fate, Tyrande swore to avenge them.\nDespite Shandris's pleas, Tyrande refused to stop her hunt until Sylvanas was dead and chose to remain in the Maw. But upon learning that the Maw Walker could save the souls damned in the Maw, she tasked them to save her imprisoned people while she continued to hunt for Sylvanas. Shandris did not try to stop her, but she knew that Tyrande would not stop until either Sylvanas was dead or the Night Warrior consumed her. Upon bringing the saved night elves to Ardenweald, Ysera said she would investigate a promising whisper she had heard regarding someone who could aid Tyrande. This whisper led Ysera to &lt;a href=\"Thiernax\"&gt;Thiernax&lt;/a&gt;, a former Night Warrior, who later developed a strategy to save Tyrande by channeling Elune's power through the former Night Warriors, who were hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. In accordance with a pact between the Maw Walker and &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, the Horned Hunter vowed to not rest until he found the other Night Warriors.\nChains of Domination.\nAs &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;:the Battle of Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; reached its conclusion, Tyrande emerged from a maw portal, killing a gigantic &lt;a href=\"charred%20behemoth\"&gt;charred behemoth&lt;/a&gt;, and engaging Sylvanas in combat. During the fight, she revealed that she had killed Nathanos and, in light of Sylvanas' surprise, taunted the Banshee Queen that &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;her master&lt;/a&gt; was keeping secrets from her. As the fight reached its conclusion the Night Warrior's powers began to wane, letting Sylvanas to successfully flee the battlefield. Following her departure, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; came to Tyrande's side, where &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; hoped that Ysera would be able to keep Tyrande stabilized long enough for them to save her.\nAs a result of the covenants working more closely together, Huln was able to discover more Night Warriors in Maldraxxus and Revendreth. After the Maw Walker successfully recruited &lt;a href=\"Khaliiq\"&gt;Khaliiq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Stonewright\"&gt;The Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;, the pair journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; and gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; to complete a ritual alongside &lt;a href=\"Thiernax\"&gt;Thiernax&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera, and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt;. As the ritual was conducted to liberate Tyrande from the Night Warrior's powers, Tyrande called upon more of Elune's power and grew hostile to the point of attacking Shandris. After being weakened enough, Elune herself took control of the High Priestess and spoke with the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Elune was horrified by the knowledge that her favored people had been sent to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, though the Winter Queen was quick to reassure her that by their hand they may yet guide those souls unto their spring, starting with Tyrande herself. In response, Elune noted that Tyrande had invoked her and it was ultimately Tyrande's choice to choose vengeance or renewal.\nIn the end, Tyrande chose renewal instead of vengeance, which stabilized Elune's powers, no longer posing a threat to her life. With &lt;a href=\"the%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;the Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt; left behind by the goddess, the Winter Queen restored her &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, Tyrande spoke with &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii Starseeker&lt;/a&gt; about renewing their people.\nFollowing the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande and Shandris could be found conversing outside of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. After Shandris mentioned her joy at seeing Tyrande whole again, Tyrande admitted her rage and anger prevented her from recognizing that grief and deep sense of betrayal that hide within her heart. Shandris admitted that when Teldrassil burned, she couldn't understand why Elune didn't intervene, how could she seemingly allow for so many to be lost. However after learning of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; and the duty and purpose that should have awaited the souls of their people, if not for the Maw, Shandris felt she could, and in response Tyrande declared that while they can never truly know the ways of the gods, but that she felt that Elune made the decision to aid her sister and not to cause them sorrow. This prompted Shandris to remark about how the Winter Queen had faced hard choices as well and how Elune and the Winter Queen were bound together in an eternal cycle, one of death and rebirth. Agreeing with her, Tyrande told Shandris that it was a cycle that the kaldorei must now rejoin, no more looking to the past, but embracing the future.\nEternity's End.\nFollowing the defeat of the Jailer, a remorseful Sylvanas was brought to the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; in Oribos to be judged by &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;the Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; for her crimes. Tyrande attended the event alongside Shandris and Maiev. During the trial, Sylvanas insisted on accepting the consequences for her actions, and the Arbiter told her that, if so, she knew whom she had to answer to. She did, and willingly handed herself over to Tyrande's judgment. Tyrande initially assumed that this was a new deception by the Banshee Queen and threatened her with her glaive, but Sylvanas calmly responded that she didn't expect Tyrande to give her a merciful death. Tyrande stated that remorse couldn't erase Sylvanas' actions and that she wouldn't be allowed peace until there was peace for her victims' souls, and had Shandris and Maiev escort her down to the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Transference\"&gt;Ring of Transference&lt;/a&gt;. The Arbiter allowed Tyrande to decide Sylvanas' fate since it was she and her people who'd been most wronged by the Banshee Queen and he trusted in her to make a wise decision. Tyrande, for her part, believed that no judgment by the Arbiter would ever be enough to balance the scales.\nIn the Ring of Transference, Tyrande declared that Sylvanas would begin her penance by scouring the Maw, freeing all of its trapped souls and sending them back to the Arbiter, all while she was watched by &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt;. This, Tyrande added, was how Sylvanas would bring renewal to her victims and to the night elves. Sylvanas accepted this and vowed that it would be done, no matter how long it took, then jumped into the Maw alongside Dori'thur to begin her work. Afterward, Tyrande reflected that this freeing of souls wouldn't have come to pass if she'd killed Sylvanas in Ardenweald, and that this might have been why Elune interfered. She thanked the Maw Walkers for helping set things right, then returned to Azeroth with Shandris and Maiev to begin \"healing the kaldorei and preserving our future\".\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were cleansed of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; by the Forsaken, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; said to an undercover Alliance adventurer, sent on a reconnaissance mission by &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, that some &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s raised by Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; wished to return among their people, and that if Tyrande would have them back, they were free to rejoin them. As some of them ended up joining the Alliance, it seems that Tyrande has indeed decided to accept their return among her people.\nSometime later, Tyrande was called to meet the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, where she questioned if Tyrande had found the justice she sought. However, Tyrande corrected her that she had come seeking vengeance, but within these groves, and by the light of Elune, she had found hope, to which The Winter Queen declared that choice had mended a broken bond between sisters. She then displayed the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt; and spoke of how though it was born in sorrow, it would become a vessel of renewal, and that the night elven souls who had been saved from the Maw rejected the eternal tranquility in the boughs of Ardenweald by becoming a new beginning for their kin, with the seed thus embodying the cycle of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. Thus she offered the seed to Tyrande, who accepted it on behalf of her people.\nIn the aftermath, Tyrande, Shandris, and Ysera spoke about the seed, to which Ysera revealed that it had been touched by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;the Dream&lt;/a&gt; as well, making it a symbol of the crucial balance between life and death. She thus revealed that the seed should be brought to her daughter, as &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; should know where it should be taken. When Shandris questioned if Ysera would return to Azeroth with them, Ysera revealed that as she is bound to Ardenweald, she would not able to leave without a great sacrifice, rejected Tyrande's offer for aid as she felt that the kaldorei needed them, and stated if Elune willed then she would soar Azeroth's skies again.\nDragonflight.\nTyrande and Malfurion brought &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;The Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, the domain of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing they held the hopes of souls of so many fallen night elves, they asked Ysera's daughter &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; if she was sure it would be safe there. Merithra told them to follow her and they stepped into the Emerald Dream portal.\nSome time later, Tyrande and Malfurion worked with &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt; on a plan to restore &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to life and thus traveled to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. In their absence the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; through the trickery and deception of &lt;a href=\"Rymek\"&gt;Rymek&lt;/a&gt; were able to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; portal upon the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, successfully claiming the area and preventing the defenders from being able to breach the ice barrier around them. Though Rymek's magic prevented them from entering the grove, Merithra realized that there was a way in from death.\nThus Tyrande pleaded with Ysera to name any price for her return, as they and her flight needed her, but Ysera remained silent. Malfurion quickly realized however that in order for her to return to life, he must take her place in death, and thus he interrupted Tyrande and after a moment of silence, revealed this truth to Tyrande's shock. When Tyrande rejected this notion, Malfurion informed her that when Ysera gave her life for him in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn't her time, and that now balance could be restored. After a moment of hesitation, she accepted this and offered to stay as well, leaving &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris&lt;/a&gt; and the others to lead the night elves. However, he remarked that if everything they hoped came to pass, their people would need her. Tyrande in return pointed out how tired she was after enduring so much, and requested that he not ask this of her. Soothingly Malfurion reassured her that she was the strength of their people, that they will follow her ever onward, and that she would never be alone.\nThus the group went to the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;, who while initially hesitant ultimately agreed and switched her bounding from Ysera to Malfurion. As Malfurion took Ysera's place and slept, he repeated the same words he spoke to Tyrande long ago at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;: that whatever came, their bond was eternal.\nAfter catching wind a resurgence of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic corruption in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande sent out a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kaylessa%20Duskwhisper\"&gt;one of her own priestesses&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Jaedenar\"&gt;Jaedenar&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the matter further. However, none returned, causing her to ask the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; for aid. &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; personally agreed to investigate the matter, while recruiting night elven &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to aid her. Working together Maiev, the &lt;a href=\"Arko%27narin%20Starshade\"&gt;Starshade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lysander%20Starshade\"&gt;siblings&lt;/a&gt;, and the champion were able to deal with the infestation and kill &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hel%27nurath\"&gt;Lord Hel'nurath&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath Maiev sent word to Tyrande, who at Maiev's recommendation sent Lysander an offer to join the Sentinels.\nTactics.\nDarnassus has several entrances, and can be entered through the usual portal or by ascending Teldrassil via &lt;a href=\"flying%20mount\"&gt;flying mount&lt;/a&gt;. Rush straight for the temple, and deal with the large guard spawns before approaching Tyrande's balcony. With the raid in place, it is a good idea to look out for any &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players who may interrupt the battle.\nAt first glance, the battle with Tyrande can seem intimidating, due the presence of Malfurion Stormrage by her side. However, Malfurion does not engage &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players, and will therefore not interfere with the fight against Tyrande. There are no elite guards or &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s, so only one tank is needed - however, the presence of her owl companion &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt; can prove a nuisance unless kept tanked too. Hold Tyrande with the tank's back against the wall opposite the balcony, and keep Dori'thur in a similar position.\nTyrande's major ability is her channeled &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt;. It is a powerful technique, and the small amount of space allocated for the fight leaves many members of the raid susceptible to it, most notably melee. However, the ability costs mana, and Tyrande can be drained of it relatively quickly via &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; abilities. Tyrande will use a searing arrow on a random party member, and a &lt;a href=\"moonfire\"&gt;moonfire&lt;/a&gt;, though again, only with mana. If drained completely, she will rely on her far weaker melee abilities, and the fight's difficulty will drop considerably.\nPersonality.\nTyrande is the passionate, and occasionally rash, leader of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s. She is also the high priestess of the Moon, and worships &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; with total submission and adoration. She loves &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and will do almost anything to help or protect him. Tyrande is a caring soul at her core, and is willing to do anything to protect those she loves and is sworn to protect \u2014 which these days means the entire &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; race. She is decisive, and may take courses of action that others find disagreeable, but always has the well being of Kalimdor at the forefront of her thoughts. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; once observed that she looked like a goddess herself in her war regalia, a compliment Tyrande was reluctant to accept, given her initially peaceful nature. Tyrande is in many ways the perfect avatar for &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth: she is a caring and gentle soul when she needs to be, but is willing to do whatever it takes to protect her home and her people. Tyrande was originally daunted by her task but found the strength needed to adapt with the support of her beloved &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is highly suspicious of outsiders from other races, and only rarely volunteers advice or assistance to them. The most she will offer to do for visitors is to provide a small escort of archers or huntresses to guide them, as well as to secretly keep tabs on them and prevent them from despoiling her homeland in any way. As she grows to know outsiders better, she tends to open up more to them and can become quite friendly. She often develops a deep respect and camaraderie with anyone who fights side-by-side with her on the battlefield and appreciates the assistance of strangers even if she doesn't display or communicate that appreciation very well.\nTyrande rides a mighty female frostsaber tiger named &lt;a href=\"Ash%27alah\"&gt;Ash'alah&lt;/a&gt; into battle.\nIn recent years, Tyrande seems to have developed a more amiable and open-minded personality, perhaps due to her exposure and interaction with the races of the Alliance. Her balance in judgment, wisdom, and strong intuition provide her with any caution and foresight needed before taking decisions that could affect her people and the Alliance as a whole.\nAfter getting some criticism about Tyrande's personality in recent years, the designers wanted to get back to her Warcraft 3 roots, in which she was very much gung-ho. So with &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.1.0\"&gt;Patch 5.1.0&lt;/a&gt; they wanted to show Varian's development and thought she'd be an interesting foil.\nShe prefers to fight in forests where she is most comfortable. She uses her speed and mobility to stay at range while peppering enemies with lethal bow shots. She uses her most powerful spells if severely outnumbered or the battle is going poorly. When confronted by enemies, she never hesitates to attack and prefers to not let any escape alive. Her duty to protect her people from danger is greater than her own personal moral code about fighting with honor. If an enemy turns to flee, she will gladly take the opportunity to put a cluster of arrows deep in his back.\nApperance.\nTyrande is known for being an elf of extraordinary beauty. Like many night elves, her skin is purple, she has long aqua green hair and her eyes shine with blue light. As a high priestess she primarily wears a white dress with white, green, and blue jewels.\nWhen she was promoted to Night Warrior, her appearance changed radically, her hair was braided in two braids over her shoulders and a ponytail behind her, her eyes became completely black with two blue dots and her skin began to have a dark tone like the night sky. His clothing transformed into a white and silver armor that covers his entire body and leaves his back exposed.\nAbiities.\nAs a high priestess Tyrande has the main power of using the divine magic granted by Elune, with it she can create shields, heal wounds and launch rays of energy. After ascending to night warrior, her priestess powers increased greatly, being able to even fly. Another of her most characteristic abilities is her skill with the bow, being considered a master archer since she is capable of launching arrows at great distances in addition to using lunar energy in her arrows to unleash explosions of energy with her bow.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBattle of Mount Hyjal.\nThe moment we've been dreading is now at hand, &lt;class&gt;.

Her brow is furrowed, as if deep in thought.&gt;\nBattle for Azeroth.\nStormwind Embassy.\nI will not stand idle while Sylvanas roams free and the crimes against my people remain unpunished.\nIn Hearthstone.\nTyrande is the alternate hero (player character) for the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; class in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", and the sixth alternate hero to be revealed. She is obtained via a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/20303032/\"&gt;special promotion&lt;/a&gt; with Twitch Prime. Her flavor text reads: \"Unlike some people, this leader didn't fall asleep on the job. We're looking at you, Malfurion.\"\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nTyrande is a playable hero in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAlternate timelines.\nIn a timeline where the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in bringing about the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande remains as a &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Tyrande\"&gt;crazed echo&lt;/a&gt; in the darkened remains of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Enveloped in this endless midnight, she has almost completely lost sight of the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;light of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelatives.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", there are some NPCs with the surname Whisperwind who may or may not be related to Tyrande:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

So absolute is the molten behemoth's power that he has cowed two core ragers \u2014 offspring of the colossal beast &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 which he now uses as pets. For this affront, he has earned Magmadar's eternal and unwavering ire, although the fearsome creature has yet to act on his savage impulses.\nGolemagg is a &lt;a href=\"molten%20giant\"&gt;molten giant&lt;/a&gt; boss with 2 pet dogs, called &lt;a href=\"Core%20Rager\"&gt;Core Rager&lt;/a&gt;s, for guards of the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Theri\"&gt;Rune of Theri&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, the Core Ragers are permanently buffed with Golemagg's Trust. Golemagg will also cast Earthquake throughout the fight instead of only when below 10% health.\nStrategy.\nThis is the most boring and uneventful fight in the whole of Molten Core. The main tank needs high fire resistance (to reduce the effect of the magma splashes), and healers need to pay some attention to their mana pools, since it's a rather long fight.\nTwo offtanks should fight the Core Ragers far away from Golemagg. The dogs can't die so there is no reason to DPS them, just keep them occupied. When they are out of range of Golemagg's buff, their horns will stop glowing red. When Golemagg gets to 10% life the melee should leave and he should be killed by ranged. It is often a good idea to have two tanks on Golemagg. If the main tank gets too many DoTs on him it will be simply impossible to keep him up. The second tank can either be ready to take over when the main tank dies, or when the DoTs start getting too high on the main tank the second tank can take over and let the main tank recover.\nThis fight is one of the few places where &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Weakness\"&gt;Curse of Weakness&lt;/a&gt; is useful, as the two hounds are not killed themselves. The hounds also can provide a steady stream of health to warlocks via &lt;a href=\"Siphon%20Life%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Siphon Life (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;."}

While their bodies were destroyed, the spirits survived, launched themselves through the Great Dark and then slammed into the Keepers of Azeroth.\nSargeras would eventually capture the spirits of the Pantheon, except for &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; who escaped. &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; succumbed to Sargeras's torture and was revived as an &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; on the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Aman'Thul, Khaz'goroth, Norgannon, and Golganneth were tortured by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of breaking them as Aggramar was. \nAfter the Pantheon was liberated and reunited, they returned to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, where they attempted to sever &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;'s connection with the Legion. Golganneth personally aided the Alliance and Horde champions by creating a Gift of the Sky and Gift of the Sea to empower them, and also helped by cleansing his Death Fog. Sargeras struck out at Azeroth and wounded her heavily in Silithus. Immediately thereafter, the Pantheon imprisoned him within the Seat, decisively ending the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who stayed behind while his comrades left, serves as Sargeras's jailer.\nIn the RPG.\nGolganneth is a male &lt;a href=\"Aesir\"&gt;Aesir&lt;/a&gt; titan. His classes are &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;. He carries a horn named &lt;a href=\"Shargahn\"&gt;Shargahn&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreator of the seas and skies, Golganneth is the father of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s and loves flying and swimming creatures above all else. He has a massive laugh, which he uses often, and a fine sense of humor. Aman'Thul's mighty son, Golganneth is a diligent, energetic titan who takes great joy in all he does. He revels most of all in storm and the rage of the winds; though he exists to bring order, of all the titans he secretly loves the fury of nature. When angered, he is truly frightening.\nGolganneth influences the seas and skies, and their native beings. Azeroth's sea giants venerate Golganneth and hold small ceremonies several times a year in his honor. These ceremonies involve the crafting and sounding of musical horns and the feeding of small &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspiration.\nGolganneth has some similarities to the \"thunderer\" archetype, of which the Norse god is a famous example. Shargahn also has a tie with Thor's hammer, Mjollnir, in that neither are traditionally weapons (in old Nordic times hammers were used exclusively as tools, and were considered a very strange choice for a weapon). Golganneth's horn is more reminiscent of , but his province of the sea and storms most closely links him with , also of the Norse pantheon, or Poseidon/Neptune, Greco-Roman mythology, respectively."}

The &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s heard many of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;'s tales about Gonk. He taught both tribes how to be &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and the Zandalari druids serve him as the &lt;a href=\"Raptari\"&gt;Raptari&lt;/a&gt;. Gonk's high priest is &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Wardruid Loti&lt;/a&gt;. The followers of Gonk and &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt; do not get along.\nBackground.\nGonk taught the Darkspear tribe how to contact the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; in a different way than they had before, thus allowing them to serve all the nature spirits at the same time instead of only one at a time as they used to do as loa priests (witch doctors). The other loa, such as &lt;a href=\"Shirvallah\"&gt;Shirvallah&lt;/a&gt;, were against this but Gonk forced their hands in order to defeat &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;, who had trapped several loa inside the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Through this method the Darkspear became druids, though the other loa are not happy about it and want the trolls to continue worshiping them one at a time.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nUnlike the Darkspear druids, Gonk did not just speak to the Zandalari. For his &lt;a href=\"Raptari\"&gt;Raptari&lt;/a&gt;, Gonk is not just a fragment or piece of him, but physically there, a real voice they can listen to in person.\nWhile aiding &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Wardruid Loti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Hexlord Raal&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Cultist\"&gt;Crimson Cultist&lt;/a&gt; within of &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; became imbued with the powers of Gonk and &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Dregada\"&gt;Dregada&lt;/a&gt;, the Speaker was informed that they had to choose between the loa. Those who chose Gonk sought him out within his den within the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20the%20Loa\"&gt;Garden of the Loa&lt;/a&gt;, where in exchange for them raising a shrine in his honor at the steps of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, he accepted them into his pack.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27zul\"&gt;Atal'zul&lt;/a&gt; began their &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20civil%20war\"&gt;uprising against&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, Loti hurried to save Gonk only to find that Gonk had already slain the attackers who sought to kill him and drain his power. When the time came to hunt &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, Gonk was among the army that &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; gathered. He was tasked to lead his followers to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Temple of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; and slay any foes he found. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, Gonk ordered for a full retreat from &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;. Noting that only Rezan's power could keep &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; from claiming &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, who was sorely wounded and aging fast due to Rezan's death, Gonk revealed that he would offer Rastakhan his own power if not for the fact that it was not Gonk's domain to challenge the loa of death.\nGonk participated in the defense of Zuldazar when Zul and his forces sought to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;Great Seal&lt;/a&gt;. He, Pa'ku, and &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt; battled &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; while Rastakhan took care of Zul.\nTides of Vengeance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Zuldazar\"&gt;Faction Assault on Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, Gonk discovered that the &lt;a href=\"void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; sought to corrupt his raptor children with their dark magics. In response, he granted his boon to those who would follow his command to bring him their heads. The loa later assisted &lt;a href=\"Gonk%27s%20Aspect\"&gt;his chosen aspect&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn accordance of the ritual of queens and kings, Talanji sought the judgment of the loa. During the trial, Gonk addressed the importance of the pack and its allies, specifically mentioning &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nTalanji chose her witness well.\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion \"\", Gonk serves as the patron of Gonk's Raptors, a dinosaur-themed team of troll &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and personally appears as .

Gor'groth goes first, before sacrificing himself to raise Ravnyr. Once the dragon is downed, the encounter is over.\nPhase One.\nGor'groth begins by sending a few shadow bolts onto you. Stay close to &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Garrick\"&gt;Henry Garrick&lt;/a&gt; to get healed. At some point, Gor'groth will unleash Unstable Shadows, where the ground will be covered with circular purple shadows. Simply get out of the circle to avoid talking damage. DPS him down as quickly as possible. \nPhase Two.\nAt 40% health, Gor'groth sacrifices him in order to raise Ravnyr. His first ability is Necrotic Breath; simply avoid standing in the front cone of the caster. Wing Buffet is his other ability; to counter it, stand close to the boss and Henry so you don't get thrown a long-distance away. DPS him down as quickly as possible and you won. \nLoot.\nGor'groth drops several appropriate-level items.\nQuotes.\nHorde.\nHold your head high in honor, &lt;name&gt;.

After years of hopelessness, the day &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; came to save the prisoners, the sight of Doomhammer being lanced in the back by a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; shattered his hopes of things ever getting better. The rest of the orcs escaped, but Gor'mul was left behind and wandered alone and lost for years without direction or hope until his brethren came back to settle Hammerfall. Wishing that he had died alongside Doomhammer, Gor'mul stayed morose at this new development.\nThe other orcs tried to cheer Gor'mul up with stories of victory and of the mighty city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing moved him. It was then that &lt;a href=\"Tor%27gan\"&gt;Tor'gan&lt;/a&gt; thought of displaying him their newly found shamanistic magic. Gor'mul was dismissive at first, but when the guile of the &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt; was blessed upon him he realized the power now held by his beloved Horde. Convinced, Gor'mul accepted to talk to the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore Tor'gan left the camp, he taught Gor'mul how to form the guile of the raptor to help out his brethren in Hammerfall. Now the orc provides for all there, crafting the same boons that gave him newfound strength.\nQuotes.\nOur people were held as prisoners, as slaves, in this very camp by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. I was locked in these cages; I saw my brothers held in these stocks, hung in these gallows.\nI saw &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, leader of us all, stabbed in the back. His blood stained black the earth we stand on.\nAnd look at us now. This is our legacy: &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;, where we lost everything, and then took it back with our own hands."}

A savage leader and a wielder of powerful magic, Gorak Tul led the Drust in a war against the initial &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; settlers who had come from the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being defeated by &lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, Gorak Tul endured, waiting hundreds of years to enact his revenge. He reached out to the grieving &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; and used her to spread his corrupt influence throughout &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of wiping out the Kul Tiran people. His plans were thwarted by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt;, and he was eventually defeated by &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nGorak Tul serves as the main antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"Drustvar%20storyline\"&gt;Drustvar storyline&lt;/a&gt; and a supporting antagonist in the &lt;a href=\"A%20Nation%20United%20%28quest%29\"&gt;A Nation United (quest)&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nBackground.\nAround 2,700 years ago, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; arrived on an island that they would later call &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. The Drust already lived on the island when the humans arrived, and from &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; they enacted raids against the humans' fledgling hamlets. The Drust &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s attacked the human settlers unprovoked. When the humans landed they tried peace but the Drust went to war immediately, and only a few tolerated new neighbors. They glorified the slaughter, attacking unarmed civilians. When &lt;a href=\"Sef%20Iwen\"&gt;Sef Iwen&lt;/a&gt; spoke out against Gorak Tul's brutal methods, he gave her an ultimatum, to attack the humans or to live in the woods forever, Sef chose the latter; believing Tul simply meant to exile her. Instead, she was murdered by Gorak Tul and her soul torn from her body then shackled to the remains; forcing her to live as a spirit forever in the woods that would eventually become the &lt;a href=\"Glenbrook%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Glenbrook Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, her death meant as an example to those who would seek to work with the humans. This, amongst the other atrocities that Gorak Tul would commit against the humans, eventually led to Sef's fellow &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; rebelling against Gorak Tul and aiding the humans.\nIn time, the Drust would be forced to withdraw as they lost numbers to the human settlers. When Gorak Tul ran out of living warriors, he conducted a ritual to create &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;stone constructs&lt;/a&gt; to fight for him as part of his desperation to win. Colonel &lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; led the humans' final assault on the Drust and stabbed Gorak Tul himself. As he was stabbed Gorak Tul's power was broken and with it his connection to his stone constructs, which shattered. But though wounded and broken, Gorak Tul did not die.\nThe Drust would live on as spirits, trying to return to the physical world. The Waycrests had wiped out the Drust, but could not destroy Gorak Tul. For countless years he waited to enact his vengeance from within &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; provided the means. Lady Waycrest had contacted Gorak Tul in the hopes of keeping her ailing husband from leaving her. Gorak Tul taught the Drust's ancient death magic to Lady Waycrest, who in turn formed the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;. The coven's magic awakened the remaining stone constructs and stirred the Drust's spirits, causing some to rise as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen the Coven attempted a rite to bring Gorak Tul back into the world, &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Inquisitor Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Ashton\"&gt;Master Ashton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marten%20Webb\"&gt;Marten Webb&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer confronted Gorak Tul in &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Inath\"&gt;Gol Inath&lt;/a&gt; and succeeded in pushing him back into the Blighted Lands. After Lady Waycrest's, Gorak Tul attempted to enter the physical world once more, at the &lt;a href=\"Rupture%20%28Waycrest%20Manor%29\"&gt;Rupture&lt;/a&gt;. Though he was defeated once more, it was revealed that it was merely a vessel and that Gorak Tul still dwelled within the Blighted Lands. Even so, the Heartsbane Coven was broken and Drustvar was released from Gorak Tul's power.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was exiled to &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt; by her own &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;, Gorak Tul captured her and dragged her into Thros. When the people of Kul Tiras sought to rescue Jaina and turned to the Drust &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt; for help, Gorak Tul attacked him and the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; who he had taught the Drust's ways to. Gorak Tul was not happy that Ulfar had shared their gifts with the humans, but Ulfar himself saw Gorak Tul's twisted ways as bringing disgrace to the Drust. When he sent the adventurer on their way to empower an effigy to open the way to Thros, Ulfar warned that since Gorak Tul was vulnerable within it, he would go to great lengths to prevent their entry. Within Thros, Jaina was being tormented by memories of her past. After she was saved by her mother, Jaina and the adventurer defeated Gorak Tul in his own domain."}

During this invasion, Drust were able to permanently possess the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; as a result of Gorak Zhar's power. She personally led the Drust in attacking &lt;a href=\"Hibernal%20Hollow\"&gt;Hibernal Hollow&lt;/a&gt; but had her forces retreat following the twin deaths of &lt;a href=\"Lorkron%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Lorkron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fulyar%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Fulyar the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; attempted to imbue a &lt;a href=\"Drust%20Fetish\"&gt;Drust Fetish&lt;/a&gt; with the power of Gorak Tul at &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Inath\"&gt;Gol Inath&lt;/a&gt;, in order to break her curse, Gorak Zhar tried and failed to arrange their death via a &lt;a href=\"Drust%20Behemoth\"&gt;Drust Behemoth&lt;/a&gt;.

Gorak Zhar mocked the Winter Queen and declared that the Drust would claim every grove, every fae, and every soul. However, these taunts had no effect on the Winter Queen, who instead admitted that she noted that that the Drust could have been protectors of nature and thus almost pitied them for choosing to steal and destroy. In response, Gorak Zhar rejected this pity and taunted her about the Heart of the Forest being destroyed. Unmoved by this taunt, the Winter Queen and the Maw Walker reclaimed the grove's magic and disposed of Gorak Zhar. With her dying breath, Zhar declared that the Drust will never be vanquished."}

Like most of their kind, Gordunni ogres are remarkably bloodthirsty and are comprised both of melee warriors and spell casters. Gordunni ogres have proven to be highly detrimental to the land of Feralas, desecrating its cultural treasures and despoiling its lush forests. In the ruins of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; city, the Gordunni have established Dire Maul, a stronghold of some potency and power.\nTheir evil effects affected &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThey also collected the &lt;a href=\"cobalt\"&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt; minerals and became protective of them, burying them in the ground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;s that follow the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s used to accompany the &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThey are known to take various &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s for their &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;ial fights in Dire Maul, including the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s and murlocs.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nOver the recent years, Gordunni ogres have steadily expanded their area of influence in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, raising concern among some of the Horde lieutenants that, if left unchecked, their expansion will eventually threaten Horde interests in the area. To this end, &lt;a href=\"Belgrom%20Rockmaul\"&gt;Belgrom Rockmaul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; has put out a call to many adventurers to travel to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; and assist Horde forces in their fight against the Gordunni. &lt;a href=\"Rok%20Orhan\"&gt;Rok Orhan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt; is one of Belgrom's lieutenants and is always ready to find some work for adventurers looking to thin Gordunni ranks.\nTerrible whispers from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; plagued King Gordok's mind, urging him to madness and slaughter. He commanded his clan to indiscriminately murder anyone they could find.\nOutland.\nThe Gordunni (possibly the members that \"remained\" in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;) have made their presence known in Outland, setting up a settlement in the &lt;a href=\"Barrier%20Hills\"&gt;Barrier Hills&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Slaag\"&gt;Slaag&lt;/a&gt;, one of the seven sons of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Comic.\nThe Gordunni hold gladiatorial games in Dire Maul every year. Last year champions of the game were the Gordunni ogres &lt;a href=\"Two-Heads\"&gt;Two-Heads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giago\"&gt;Giago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brlee\"&gt;Brlee&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe Gordunni tamers captured a &lt;a href=\"sasquatch\"&gt;sasquatch&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Bigfist\"&gt;Bigfist&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\nThe Gordunni clan has been raiding the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Coast\"&gt;Forgotten Coast&lt;/a&gt; for several years, taking murloc prisoners for their gladiatorial pits. Some time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the ogres raided the murloc village on the Coast and took a dozen of them to Dire Maul. They also heavily deforested part of Feralas, driving the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20clan\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s further east.\nThey also captured the &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"One-Eye\"&gt;One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and her three cubs from &lt;a href=\"Skypeak\"&gt;Skypeak&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; exile named &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wuul%20Breezerider\"&gt;Wuul Breezerider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; boy &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe boy was sought after by the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; whose members attacked the gates of &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and entered its amphitheater. &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the dark organization, fought and killed &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;, becoming new King of the Dire Maul Gordunni clan, the new Gordok. Since the boy and his friends escaped, Malus declared the Gordunni ogres to be no more as they are Hidden now and ordered all of his new ogre minions to leave Dire Maul and find Aramar. As such, all Gordunni ogres completely evacuated Dire Maul, being sent to Feralas, Thousand Needles, and Tanaris. Most of their elites were killed by the Hidden, but Malus wanted to have their remaining best organized into an &lt;a href=\"Gordok%27s%20Elite\"&gt;elite force&lt;/a&gt;. In order to keep &lt;a href=\"Throgg\"&gt;Throgg&lt;/a&gt; loyal, the new Gordok assured him that once the business with Aram and the compass is done, he will renounce being Gordok to anyone Throgg will choose and the Gordunni will return to Dire Maul.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Wordok\"&gt;Wordok&lt;/a&gt; used to lead his group of slave hunters to western Feralas, &lt;a href=\"Marjuk\"&gt;Marjuk&lt;/a&gt; was taking his to eastern Feralas. After Gordok's death, Marjuk found the Feral Scar tribe's new home and invaded it. His group of approximately 20 ogres was killed by the tribe's members and leader &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt;, aided by Aram's group.\nEventually, Malus and his Hidden caught Aram and took his compass, bringing them to &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Malus didn't bring only the boy, he also the approximately a dozen of Gordunni ogres there to act as his bodyguards. When Throgg discovered this, he confronted Malus, but the human king of ogres told him that he had decided to keep the title as King Gordok. When Malus killed &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt; and became corrupted by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;, he commanded &lt;a href=\"Ssarbik\"&gt;Ssarbik&lt;/a&gt; to bring the Gordunni bodyguards to him in order to feed them to the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing this, Throgg shouted in protest, but the fel-corrupted Malus ignored him. Soon, the Gordunni in shadowy-shackles were brought to Malus by a &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt;. A portal emerged and sucked them, stunning &lt;a href=\"Karrga\"&gt;Karrga&lt;/a&gt; in shock. Upon seeing this and the fel-transformed Malus, Throgg renounced him as his master and as King Gordok, saying that he has no honor and betrayed the ogre clan. Eventually, Malus was killed.\nExploring Azeroth.\nThe remaining Gordunni returned to their homes in Feralas. They hold many of the best areas of the jungle, and after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; they continue to attack &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Ataya\"&gt;Camp Ataya&lt;/a&gt;, both of which needed help. As a response, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Belgrom%20Rockmaul\"&gt;Belgrom Rockmaul&lt;/a&gt; to answer their calls for help. Belgrom reported that adventurers had aided him in thinning the enemy forces, but it wasn't enough. While the tug of war goes on between the gnolls, yetis, silithid, and the Horde, the Gordunni grow their holdings. Their war parties hammer the contested borders of the jungle and spoil what land they pry away from others. They continue to lay claim to the Forgotten Coast, and force captives to fight in the Dire Maul arena for the pleasure of their king, Gordok. &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; visited Dire Maul, even though the Gordunni didn't like them being there. The ogres told them about a cruel human named Malus who was their king. Zekhan then confirmed that Malus no longer held the title Gordok and reported that there are many warriors present in the ruins.\nCulture.\nGordunni do not have any funeral traditions, and simply leave their dead where they lie.\nMembers.\nGordok.\nThe Gordok ogres (also referred to as a tribe) are the \"upper class\" of the Gordunni clan, chosen to defend Dire Maul. They are the strongest members of the Gordunni, respecting strength above all else. The Gordok ogres are the head of the Gordunni clan, ruling them from Dire Maul. They are stronger than the lesser Gordunni.\nIn Gordok society, their king is simply their strongest warrior. If their king, &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;, is slain, the slayer will become the new king and takes on the name \"Gordok\", this is the way of most ogre clans. Only an ogre is allowed to become King Gordok, however, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; was the first known exception to this. To become king among the Gordunni, one must have the confidence to declare oneself king, and have the stomach to see the claim through by defeating any challengers.\nWhen Malus took over, the Hidden killed most of the clan's elite warriors, referred to as Gordok's best. This may refer to (or include) the Gordok upper class.\nGordok members.\nAccording to \", many of the King Gordok's elite warriors were killed by the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;. The new king Gordok, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;, had the remaining best warriors gathered, but none of the above mentioned ever appear, leaving their fate unclear.\nHolidays.\nIn the recent &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; festivities, even a few Gordok have forgotten their initial hostilities and brought something from their tribe to share with all: the powerful but delicious &lt;a href=\"Gordok%20Grog\"&gt;Gordok Grog&lt;/a&gt;! The Gordoks have now established a presence in both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; territories selling their trademark alcohol to everyone with &lt;a href=\"Gordok%20Festive%20Keg\"&gt;Gordok Festive Keg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Dire Maul Gordunni clan also celebrated the &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Fire%20Festival\"&gt;Midsummer Fire Festival&lt;/a&gt;."}

Through her role as Grand Magistrix, Elisande existed as sole ruler of her people, leading in a similar capacity to a monarch. In addition to this, Elisande was assisted in her role by a host of selected advisors, whose opinions she considered carefully. For her often cruel actions in attempting to put down the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, many nightborne began to view Elisande as evil and uncaring towards the fate of her people. Despite this, in her final moments, the Grand Magistrix argued that her decisions were ultimately intended to save the shal'dorei at any cost. \nBefore the war, Elisande served as a highly influential member of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; caste in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, acting directly at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself. Ever distrustful of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; which her Queen had allied with, Elisande eventually moved against them. \nTo prevent the potential destruction of Suramar, Elisande and her Highborne succeeded in separating the city from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; using the power of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; to create an arcane shield. Over 10,000 years later, long after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; that marked the war's conclusion, Elisande and her people became once more involved with the outside world. The Grand Magistrix's unlikely decision to ally with the Burning Legion at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; served as one of the main contributing factors towards the creation of a movement in opposition to her rule: &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; grew in size, Elisande became more erratic and callous in her measures. Finally, with the aid of other forces, the rebels assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of Elisande's power. In the ensuing battle, Elisande was defeated and killed, heralding the end of her reign. \nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Elisande was the ruler of a small sect of &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; sorcerers based in the city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. These Highborne were fiercely loyal to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and excelled at acquiring ancient relics and artifacts, the greatest of which were the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; had used in ancient times to shape &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. However, when Azshara's servants summoned the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth, causing what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the views that Elisande and her servants had on the queen and her new allies began to shift. Elisande grew concerned that the demons did not have the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' best interest in mind, a distrust that deepened further when she discovered that the Legion was planning to open a second portal in Suramar's &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; in order to create another staging ground for the war.\nConvinced that the portal would threaten to destroy all of Suramar and its inhabitants, Elisande and her followers severed their ties with the other Highborne before gathering the Pillars of Creation and using them to seal the portal with a set of unbreakable magical seals. However, they did not afterwards join the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;resistance forces&lt;/a&gt; fighting against the Legion. Instead, the Grand Magistrix and her followers used the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Pillars, to create the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;: an immense well of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy that would nourish and protect them. During the years that followed the War of the Ancients' end, the Nightwell's energies gradually transformed Elisande and her Highborne into a new race, known as the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight of Suramar.\nShortly after the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;War in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s 10,000 year period of isolation was shattered by the arrival of their enemy of old, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, as they had become, had been completely out of touch with the rest of the world since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, but were now directly contacted by a representative of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in the form of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; . \nGul'dan presented himself before Grand Magistrix Elisande (who had led the nightborne people throughout their millennia-long isolation) and her closest advisors and made them an offer on behalf of the Legion. If the nightborne would lower their protective shield and grant the Legion access to the energies of the Nightwell, then they would not only be spared the demons' wrath but also be welcomed as allies; should Suramar refuse, then the Legion would lay waste to their entire civilization. Giving them three days to decide, Gul'dan left Elisande and her people to consider their options.\nDespite the gravity of the situation, Elisande remained unsure exactly how to proceed. The Grand Magistrix listened attentively to the counsel of her advisors, who remained bitterly divided on the best course of action. While Elisande's First Arcanist, &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, believed the Legion should not be trusted, others such as &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Vandros\"&gt;Advisor Vandros&lt;/a&gt; argued that agreement was the only path for survival for the nightborne. Ultimately, despite her disgust with the Burning Legion itself, Elisande decided to acquiesce to their demands and lower the shield. Unbeknownst to many, the Grand Magistrix's grasp of time magic gave her the ability to peer into all potential futures, or so she thought. Having done so, Elisande came to the conclusion that resistance could only possibly lead to her people's annihilation. \nOpposition to Elisande's choice culminated in a failed coup, led by First Arcanist Thalyssra. Seeking to depose the Grand Magistrix and prevent the lowering of the shield, Thalyssra led a small group in attempting to breach the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. The plot failed, however, when &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt; betrayed Thalyssra, revealing himself as being loyal to Elisande. With no further opposition, Elisande and her retainers lowered the barrier around the city and watched, troubled, as the demons they once resisted began to pour in.\nLegion.\nResistance.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s shield was lowered on Elisande's orders, forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; moved in to occupy much of the city. Despite the reservations some nightborne held, order was maintained at this time. This continued until a movement known as &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; soon emerged and began working to disrupt the plans of the Grand Magistrix and her demon allies. Led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to survive the failed coup attempt, the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; quickly erupted in and around Suramar City. The rebellion received much assistance from &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and began to carry out covert operations in Suramar with the aim of undermining the Grand Magistrix's power in the city.\nIn response to this unrest caused by the Legion's arrival, Elisande and the city's leadership hastily instigated rationing on &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;, a drink that provided the nightborne people with the energy from the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; that they had become dependent upon. This tactic was used primarily to keep the population of Suramar in line, particularly those of the lower classes that resided in the city's southwest and who were more sympathetic to the Nightfallen cause. The measures introduced by Elisande to maintain order within Suramar were carried out by the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, the primary nightborne military force, who remained highly loyal to the Grand Magistrix. \nWith the increasing influence of the Nightfallen, Grand Magistrix Elisande and her advisors decided to fill an opening in their inner council. An individual was traditionally chosen based on the support of Suramar's noble families. Eventually, a candidate in the form of Lady &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; (who, unbeknownst to Elisande, was actually a member of the rebellion) emerged with the required support. Elisande personally attended the appointment ceremony which took place in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt;, and watched as &lt;a href=\"Coryn\"&gt;Coryn&lt;/a&gt; of House Stelleris challenged Ly'leth to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27ashar\"&gt;Tal'ashar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an honor duel \u2014 for the position. Ultimately, Ly'leth emerged triumphant with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;a champion&lt;/a&gt; and occupied her new position on Elisande's council of advisors within the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nElisande attempted to reassure the more influential citizens of Suramar by attending in person a large social gathering in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt;, amid the recent turmoil. Hoping to use this opportunity to eliminate the Grand Magistrix, Nightfallen agents infiltrated the event and succeeded in forcing their way to Elisande herself, who was conversing with &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt; on a balcony. Elisande, however, teleported back to the Nighthold, leaving Melandrus to deal with the intruders. Although Melandrus was defeated, the assassination attempt failed to claim the life of the Grand Magistrix. \nRebellion.\nDespite various crackdowns, rebel activity within Suramar City continued to grow, becoming more bold and widespread, and beginning to gain the support of much of the populace who were disillusioned with Elisande's leadership. To combat this, the Grand Magistrix now adopted extremely harsh measures. This reached its climax with the massacre at the &lt;a href=\"Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;. Elisande mercilessly ordered Duskwatch and demon forces to slaughter everyone dwelling in and around the Waning Crescent district of the city, a known base for rebel activity. As a result, large amounts of citizens were killed outright, an act which horrified the majority of nightborne, including many of Elisande's loyal supporters. \nMuch of the populace was both outraged and frightened, the rebellion took more direct action. Around this time, the Grand Magistrix also began the process of having large groups of the population abducted and taken to &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the city. There, the nightborne citizens were transported to the Burning Legion base at &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Advance\"&gt;Felsoul Advance&lt;/a&gt; outside Suramar. The prisoners then awaited execution at the hands of the Legion, who used their souls to feed their magic and machinery. Having discovered this, the Nightfallen eventually launched an assault on the camp, freeing many prisoners and slaying the overseer. Despite this, these operations continued. \nAs a result of these recent events, an armed conflict began to erupt in Suramar's very streets. The actions of the Grand Magistrix had, at this point, alienated a great deal of the nightborne people, and the majority no longer viewed Elisande as having the best interests of Suramar at heart. Even members of the once-loyal &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; began to desert from its ranks in response to Elisande's actions.\nWhen Elisande's forces attacked the Waning Crescent, one of the Nightfallen leaders, &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt;, was captured. To further emphasize her point, the Grand Magistrix ordered that an example be made of the prisoner. She assigned her Second Blade, &lt;a href=\"Thoramir\"&gt;Thoramir&lt;/a&gt;, to guard Vanthir's cage on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Order\"&gt;Terrace of Order&lt;/a&gt; as the nightborne slowly degenerated into a &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; state. &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and her allies were successful in discerning Vanthir's location, however, and they quickly moved to slay Thoramir and rescue the prisoner. To send their own message, the insurgents placed the sign of the Dusk Lily, a notorious symbol of Thalyssra and her movement, above the now-empty cage. When she became aware of it, Elisande was both furious and deeply shaken by the display, as were many of her remaining supporters. Since the beginning of the conflict, Elisande had been troubled to learn of Thalyssra's potential involvement, even going so far as to order the dismantling of the former First Arcanist's estate in the city. She would eventually appoint a replacement to Thalyssra's post in the form of the &lt;a href=\"felborne\"&gt;felborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Andaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt;.\nFall of the Nighthold.\nA major turning point in the rebellion came with the arrival of forces from the other &lt;a href=\"elven\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; races of Azeroth, who joined the Nightfallen rebels in their fight for Suramar. Elisande and her lieutenants quickly deployed Duskwatch soldiers to the city's outer districts as the new elven army, consisting of &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; rebels, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, started to mass at Suramar's gates. After preliminary attacks that targeted the Duskwatch and Legion defenses, the combined elven forces launched a massive assault on the city proper, eventually clearing a path directly to the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nAs the gathered forces approached the walls of Elisande's citadel, the Grand Magistrix herself appeared as an immense projection and addressed the elven commanders. She proceeded to point out, with distaste, the various failings of each of the gathered races, before claiming that their failure would act as a symbol to any who would challenge the Nightborne. With her speech concluded, Elisande cast an enormous spell which trapped the entire force gathered before the Nighthold in a great time spell. Frozen in place, the assault of the Grand Magistrix's enemies was completely halted. The sheer magnitude and power of the spell was said to rival that of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and left the fates of those caught inside unclear. \nBefore long, however, in an attempt to salvage the situation, Nightfallen agents guided by &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; gained access to the Nighthold via an underground breach. With her champions by her side, Thalyssra and the other Nightfallen pushed their way through the great citadel, defeating many of Elisande's chief lieutenants, such as the captain of her guard, &lt;a href=\"Spellblade%20Aluriel\"&gt;Spellblade Aluriel&lt;/a&gt;. The party even succeeded in breaking the time spell holding the elven forces in stasis outside, who quickly joined the assault. \nUltimately, the Nightfallen champions confronted Elisande herself atop the &lt;a href=\"Nightspire\"&gt;Nightspire&lt;/a&gt;, where they found her in the midst of an important ritual. After her courtesans were defeated, Elisande addressed her enemies, claiming to have foreseen their coming. She defended her actions to those gathered, revealing that she had looked at every possible outcome in which the nightborne defied the Legion, and that each outcome ended in disaster. Before engaging the champions, Elisande justified killing them, believing it to be vital for the survival of the nightborne race. \nIn the battle that followed, the Grand Magistrix drew on the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;'s power, using her skill with time magic launch attack after attack against her foes, and even rewinding time itself to overcome them. Despite her efforts, Elisande was ultimately slain. Shortly afterwards, an 'echo' of the Grand Magistrix once more spoke to the Nightfallen champions. Stunned by their victory, which Elisande had not foreseen in her exhaustive scrying of the future, she rescinded her allegiance to the Legion and chanced her people's future on Gul'dan's defeat to atone for the decisions she made. In the final battle against Gul'dan, an echo of Elisande provides champions with a measure of &lt;a href=\"Time%20Dilation\"&gt;power over time&lt;/a&gt;. \nFollowing Gul'dan's defeat, Elisande is not seen again, her echo having faded during the final moments of the battle. The death of Gul'dan and the failure of his ritual marked the end of the Legion's influence within Suramar and over the &lt;a href=\"shal%27dorei\"&gt;shal'dorei&lt;/a&gt; people.\nDRAGONFLIGHT\nThroughout \"Dragonflight\" and its subsequent patches, \"World of Warcraft\" introduced an important questline centered around bringing back Tyr, the Keeper responsible for empowering the Dragonflights, after his death thousands of years ago. Patch 10.2, Seeds of Renewal, saw the climax of this \"WoW\" questline, culminating in the giant\u2019s resurrection in the aftermath of Fyrakk\u2019s defeat. However, the quests leading up to Tyr\u2019s revival brought back another character players never would have expected to see. During the sidequest, players go to an alternate timeline before Grand Magistrix Elisande, the former leader of the Nightbourne, was killed. Elisande is in possession of a disc needed to revive the Keeper, and the players must convince her to hand over the artifact. She agrees, citing she had already learned what she needed to know from it, and then departs through a portal, seemingly escaping from the alternate \"World of Warcraft\" timeline and becoming an active player in the story once more.\nSpeculation.\nThere is speculation that Elisande's visions, which convinced her that allying with the Legion was the only way to save her people, may have been influenced or manipulated by Gul'dan (or another member of the Legion). Gul'dan had showed that he could teleport an image of himself even through the Nightborne's bubble, and the comic depicts Elisande's visions with a green tint. Some commentary on this alliance from other parties also suggests that the nightborne becoming the Legion's allies would have led to destruction: &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; claims that it is the Legion's modus operandi to betray those who join their side, and &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, who was personally overseeing the Legion's forces in the Nighthold, strongly implies that the Legion plans to \"reward\" the nightborne in a very different way than they imagine. Of course, it is also a re-occuring theme that the heroes of Azeroth go against destiny and forge their own.\n&lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; also mentions that Elisande \"claims to know the future\" but that \"her desperate bid to remain in control dooms her people\", while &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt; mockingly notes that Elisande's attempts to control time's flow are futile, and that subtle and unimaginably powerful forces work against her, further implying that unseen powers have been secretly opposing or disrupting Elisande's own abilities.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The band's virtual alter ego, The Tauren Chieftains and the Elite Tauren Chieftain, appear in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" as a band comprised of members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and retain the logo used by the Level 70 Elite incarnation of the real-life band. Their gimmick revolves around writing content that is based on mainly subjects related to the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt;, though they have more recently extended into &lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20franchise\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20franchise\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; lore as well. The band debuted in 2003 with their first song, \"&lt;a href=\"Power%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Power of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\", which was featured in the credits of ' and '.\nHistory.\nElite Tauren Chieftain originated as a band of Blizzard employees doing cover songs, eventually graduating to performing their own unique songs. During the development of \"\", the idea came up that the band could do something fun in the game's end credits, specifically a \"Warcraft\"-inspired song. Since there was not enough time to write entirely new music, &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt; took one of the band's existing songs\u2014\"The Serpent and the Slave\"\u2014and altered the lyrics to be \"Warcraft\"-themed, thus creating \"&lt;a href=\"Power%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Power of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\". Since people \"weren't offended by it enough\", Elite Tauren Chieftain eventually kept doing more songs.\nThe band has been known by several monikers since it was established; originally being known as Tenth Level Tauren Chieftain \u2014 level 10 being the highest &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"tauren%20chieftain\"&gt;tauren chieftain&lt;/a&gt; hero could be in ' and its expansion. The name was changed to Level 60 Elite Tauren Chieftain for &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202005\"&gt;BlizzCon 2005&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 level 60 then being the highest level attainable in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". The band was later dubbed Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain following the release of World of Warcraft's expansion, ' \u2014 as The Burning Crusade raised the game's &lt;a href=\"level%20cap\"&gt;level cap&lt;/a&gt; to 70. They have since been renamed to their current title, Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain, to comply with World of Warcraft's second expansion, ' \u2014 which once again has raised the game's level cap to 80. With the coming of the third expansion, ', and the raising of the game's level cap to 85, the band has eschewed traditionals labels to become The Artists Formerly Known as Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain. In the distant future of \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20franchise\"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", a TV advertisement viewable in the \"Hyperion's\" Cantina shows that they will rename themselves \"Level 800 Elite Tauren Chieftain\", and will actively tour the galaxy.\nOn July 16, 2007, the band, then known as Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain, released their second song, \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Am%20Murloc\"&gt;I Am Murloc&lt;/a&gt;.\" On August 4, 2007 at that year's BlizzCon, the band performed two new songs, \"&lt;a href=\"Rogues%20Do%20it%20from%20Behind\"&gt;Rogues Do it from Behind&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Terran%20Up%20the%20Night\"&gt;Terran Up the Night&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn June 29, 2008 at the &lt;a href=\"Worldwide%20Invitational\"&gt;Worldwide Invitational&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, France, Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain performed \"Power of the Horde\", \"Rogues Do it from Behind\", \"Terran Up the Night\" (a new song), \"&lt;a href=\"Raise%20Some%20Hell\"&gt;Raise Some Hell&lt;/a&gt;\" (referring to Blizzard's newly announced development of \"Diablo III\"), and \"I Am Murloc.\" After each song, the band \"levelled up\" twice before ending their set as Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain. The band has yet to release any studio recordings under their current name.\nE.T.C. hasn't played since closed the show for them during the &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202014\"&gt;BlizzCon 2014&lt;/a&gt; Closing Ceremony. Samwise Didier has stated that the band definitely wants to play again, but at the time, the \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" team was also the \"StarCraft\" team. This meant that the team had to work on two games at the same time before BlizzCon, which \"ate into practice time\".\nOther names.\nETC have been known by various names throughout the history of &lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent locations.\nAt rest.\nThe Tauren Chieftains can otherwise be found at rest in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Walk%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Walk of Elders&lt;/a&gt; on a balcony overlooking the walk. Their stage manager and stage tech, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Schweitzer\"&gt;Michael Schweitzer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roitau\"&gt;Roitau&lt;/a&gt; respectively, both sit below the band. Their purpose in Silvermoon City was initially uncertain, but it has since been learned that the band is placed there as part of the &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt; quest chain for Horde players, which begins in Shattrath City. Performing &lt;a href=\"emote\"&gt;emote&lt;/a&gt;s to them, such as cheer, will cause them to respond in turn. The band and their manager remain friendly to Alliance players and will still respond to emotes.\nWoW's 15th Anniversary.\nThe Tauren Chieftains performed during the duration of the &lt;a href=\"WoW%27s%2015th%20Anniversary\"&gt;WoW's 15th Anniversary&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nBand-related announcements.\nBlizzCon 2005.\nLevel 60 Elite Tauren Chieftain (L60ETC) is undoubtedly best known for their multimillion-selling single, \"The Power of the Horde,\" a track that appeared on their 2003 album \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.\" In addition to the hard-rocking, heart-thumping tunes it contained, that album might best be remembered by music lovers everywhere for the popular little computer game that was included as a bonus feature on the disc.\nThe band performed at BlizzCon 2005 on October 29, 2005. This performance was recorded and included on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade%20Behind-the-Scenes%20DVD\"&gt;The Burning Crusade Behind-the-Scenes DVD&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlizzCon 2007.\nComin' straight outta &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;: Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain invades Southern California once again to perform at BlizzCon. Taking a break from their massive multi-world tour of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and Outland, Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain is gracing the mortals in Anaheim, California with another evening of power, majesty, and metal! The group's last non-Azerothian performance, the final show of the highly successful Storm, Earth, and Fire World Domination tour, took place at BlizzCon 2005, where they received a hero's welcome and even had the multi-platinum recording artists, The Offspring, close the show for them. Now, having levelled past their previous name -- Level 60 Elite Tauren Chieftain -- the crunching chords and pounding war drums of the newly dubbed Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain will once again be echoing throughout the Anaheim Convention Center's main arena at BlizzCon 2007. Exclusive to BlizzCon attendees, the concert will start at 7:30pm on Saturday, August 4, preceding the other live entertainment that evening. Get there early because seating will be first-come, first-served.\nWoW BlueTracker.\nTo celebrate the upcoming BlizzCon event on August 3rd and 4th, Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain will be making a guest appearance beginning tonight at midnight at the new Darkmoon Faire location outside of Shattrath city! They\u2019ll be shaking Shattrath to the ground with their performances at the top of every hour for the duration of BlizzCon, and showing everyone the true Power of the Horde!\nSpeculation.\nThe possibility of &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s related to The Tauren Chieftains has been suggested due to comments by the band's manager, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Schweitzer\"&gt;Michael Schweitzer&lt;/a&gt;, who has alluded to the possibility by saying, \"We're not currently hiring for the show or the crew, but you can always check back later.

Elite creatures benefit from various integrated buffs, increasing their power and survivability, and sometimes possess additional &lt;a href=\"abilities\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;. Elites should usually only be tackled by groups, or higher level players.\nThe role of elite mobs depends on their location in the game world. Elite mobs encountered in questing areas and most outside &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s are usually the focus of specific group &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s requiring players to kill them, often as the culmination of a storyline. These are fairly rare and are often unique, named mobs. In contrast, almost all mobs inside &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s are elites, with multiple players required to defeat even small groups, ensuring adventurers don't try to tackle group content alone. Elite NPCs include many &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt;s and key lore characters, serving to protect key areas and functions and deter against unwanted &lt;a href=\"player%20vs%20player\"&gt;player vs player&lt;/a&gt; combat.\nElite creatures can be recognized by golden-winged dragons set around their portrait. \"Rare elite\" mobs, also known as \"silver elites\", are &lt;a href=\"rare%20mob\"&gt;rare mob&lt;/a&gt;s with elite status, featuring a silver dragon instead of gold. Note that only dragons with wings indicate elite status: non-winged dragons merely indicate a non-elite rare mob.\nNotes.\nElite status generally denotes that the content is more difficult than should be usually expected for its &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;, and most often requires a group of appropriately-leveled players to overcome. Most elite content is very hard to &lt;a href=\"solo\"&gt;solo&lt;/a&gt;, at least at the intended level. While an increase of +30% for &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; of a normal mob is quite a good guideline for most outdoor elites, outdoor rare elites, and elite mobs within instances or battlegrounds seem to be much stronger.\nAdditional notes:\nIn the RPG.\nSome monsters are especially tough. Adventurers call these creatures \"elite\". Whereas a normal specimen of a certain breed might fall easily to a lone hero, to defeat an elite creature of the same type requires careful planning, a group of heroes, excellent tactics, or all three. Elite creatures often look different than their non-elite counterparts, being larger, having barbs on their horns and claws, possessing glowing eyes, or evincing other such indication of their power. Some elites, however, look just like normal creatures of their kind, and it is not until a hero engages it that he realizes \u2014 perhaps too late \u2014 that it is far tougher than he expected. While elite creatures are decidedly stronger and faster than non-elites, they are infamous not for size and speed but for their durability. They are able to withstand the punishment that would kill non-elites several times over. Elite specimens appear in every creature type."}

{"id": "211646", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=211646", "title": "Elite mode", "text": "Elite mode (previously and informally called Hard mode), not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt;, refers to the increase in difficulty of a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; boss encounter resulting in increased &lt;a href=\"reward\"&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt;s and/or &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s. This is accomplished by doing or not doing certain things that increase the difficulty of the boss fight. It is not possible to set an encounter to elite mode from the &lt;a href=\"user%20interface\"&gt;user interface&lt;/a&gt; (as compared to Heroic mode where it is possible), rather, specific objectives in the encounter must be completed to enable elite mode.\nElite mode versions of item drops were introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\". Before then, items awarded from an elite mode of an encounter were unique to that mode and were not dropped at all if the encounter was completed normally.\nOverview and history.\nAhn'Qiraj.\nPrior to the release of and the coming of real elite mode encounters, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; was the first raid instance to have an &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Royalty\"&gt;encounter&lt;/a&gt; where the difficulty and loot were determined by the order you kill each boss (&lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Royalty\"&gt;Silithid Royalty&lt;/a&gt;). Also worth noting that the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj was also the first instance to have optional bosses (&lt;a href=\"Viscidus\"&gt;Viscidus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ouro\"&gt;Ouro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Royalty\"&gt;Silithid Royalty&lt;/a&gt;).\nZul'Aman.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; was the second raid where loot varied depending on what the players did. In this case the loot was on a timer, the more bosses that were defeated before the time ran out the better loot was rewarded. In total four chests, one at each of the four first bosses were possible to obtain. The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20War%20Bear\"&gt;Amani War Bear&lt;/a&gt; from the last chest was removed in Patch 3.0.2.\n&lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eredar%20Twins\"&gt;Eredar Twins&lt;/a&gt; initially dropped loot based on kill order: it was easier for the group to kill &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlock%20Alythess\"&gt;Grand Warlock Alythess&lt;/a&gt; before killing &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sacrolash\"&gt;Lady Sacrolash&lt;/a&gt;, but killing Sacrolash first would yield more gear drops. When &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.3\"&gt;Patch 2.4.3&lt;/a&gt; went live, the kill order ceased to matter, and the Twins would drop identical loot regardless of which one was killed first.\nObsidian Sanctum.\n&lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; was the first Wrath of the Lich King raid instance released with a elite mode boss encounter. If Sartharion was defeated while one or more of the Twilight Drakes was still alive, he would drop an additional item with a higher item level than his other loot. Sartharion gained additional abilities if one, two, or all drakes were left alive, and would receive aid from the minibosses during the fight. This lead to many groups overgearing for the encounter and hoping to kill Sartharion before the other drakes arrived. Even if the drakes killed the group, as long as Sartharion was defeated, he would drop the extra gear, and the drakes would despawn.\nUlduar.\n&lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; took the concept further with 10 of the 14 bosses having elite modes. These are: &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Leviathan\"&gt;Flame Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"XT-002%20Deconstructor\"&gt;XT-002 Deconstructor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20Iron\"&gt;Assembly of Iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freya%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hodir%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thorim%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mimiron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Vezax\"&gt;General Vezax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt;. Algalon is WoW's first elite mode only encounter, and for this reason was made optional (skippable) as far as completing the instance is concerned.\nTrial of the Crusader and beyond.\nAfter the introduction of Ulduar in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.1\"&gt;Patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard moved from calling 25-player raids \"Heroic mode\" (where 10-player raids were \"Normal mode\"), to having four modes, selected via the user interface: 10-player, 10-player Heroic, 25-player, and 25-player Heroic. Elite modes of encounters were phased out in favor of making the switch (to Heroic mode) via the UI.\nThis paradigm began with &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2\"&gt;Patch 3.2&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;), and continued through the rest of \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" and all of \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\". Although, &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt; was tied to a specific system of limited tries to beat all bosses during the same lockout period and the more tries remaining at &lt;a href=\"Anub%27Arak\"&gt;Anub'Arak&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the more/better loots were in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade%20Tribute%20Chest\"&gt;Tribute Chest&lt;/a&gt;. The same tries system was used in Heroic &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; for some bosses but wasn't giving any additional rewards to players. \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" first raid tier was also featuring an Heroic-Only Boss with limited tries : &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" reintroduced (And formally named) Elite mode, with the &lt;a href=\"Protectors%20of%20the%20Endless\"&gt;Protectors of the Endless&lt;/a&gt; encounter in &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt; gaining an Elite mode in addition to Heroic mode. Similarly to Sinestra, &lt;a href=\"Ra-den%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Ra-Den&lt;/a&gt; was an Heroic-Only Boss with limited tries in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; raid.\nThis, and future, encounters now have 9 tuning levels, with health pools, damage levels, and presence of abilities different for each tune:\nElite mode encounters.\nSilithid Royalty.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Royalty\"&gt;Silithid Royalty&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; offers players 3 different methods. The easiest way to complete this encounter is to kill Lord Kri first, then Princess Yauj and finally Vem. The 'medium' way is to kill Lord Kri in second. The hardest way is to kill Lord Kri last. The rewards are determined by the order you kill the Bug Family. Each bug has some unique items in its loot table, while others are shared. \nSartharion.\n&lt;a href=\"Sartharion\"&gt;Sartharion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; has 3 different hard modes. The three drakes, &lt;a href=\"Vesperon\"&gt;Vesperon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadron\"&gt;Shadron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tenebron\"&gt;Tenebron&lt;/a&gt; can be killed to make the Sartharion encounter of normal difficulty or it can be increased to elite mode by leaving one or more of the drakes alive when starting the Sartharion encounter. Defeating Sartharion with the drakes up rewards an achievement and additional loot, increasing with additional drakes: / (one drake left), / (two drakes left) and / (all drakes left).\nFlame Leviathan.\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Leviathan\"&gt;Flame Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; has 4 different hard modes, with loot and badges increasing for each tower which is not destroyed, similar to Obsidian Sanctum. There are four towers in the area before the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Leviathan\"&gt;Flame Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; and leaving 1 or more of these towers up is increasing the fight difficulty by buffing the boss damage and abilities as well as its HP. On top of that, each tower is allowing the boss to enable the corresponding Orbital Countermeasure.\nSeveral achievements are also given out depending on the number of towers destroyed. They are / (three towers destroyed), / (two towers destroyed), / (one tower destroyed), and / (all towers left up).\nXT-002 Deconstructor.\n&lt;a href=\"XT-002%20Deconstructor\"&gt;XT-002 Deconstructor&lt;/a&gt; has one elite mode. At 75%, 50%, and 25%, XT-002 Deconstructor's heart will be exposed. Destroying the heart (which has a multi-million HP pool) activates the elite mode, which heals XT-002 Deconstructor to full HP and gives him the buff Heartbreak, which increases XT-002 Deconstructor's damage done by 15% and his HP by 50% (60% in Heroic). Defeating XT-002 Deconstructor while killing his heart awards players the achievement / and additional loot.\nThe Assembly of Iron.\nThere are two different hard modes for the &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20Iron\"&gt;Assembly of Iron&lt;/a&gt;. The normal strategy is to kill &lt;a href=\"Stormcaller%20Brundir\"&gt;Stormcaller Brundir&lt;/a&gt; last (/). The medium elite mode is to kill &lt;a href=\"Runemaster%20Molgeim\"&gt;Runemaster Molgeim&lt;/a&gt; last (/) which allows the &lt;a href=\"Archivum%20Data%20Disc\"&gt;Archivum Data Disc&lt;/a&gt; to drop, which begins the quest to unlock the Celestial Planetarium (And thus &lt;a href=\"Algalon\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt;). The hardest way to do the encounter (And the method that rewards the hard mode loots) is to kill &lt;a href=\"Steelbreaker\"&gt;Steelbreaker&lt;/a&gt; last (/). The rewards are increased loot and achievements.\nHodir.\n&lt;a href=\"Hodir%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;'s elite mode requires the raid to down him in under 3 minutes, preventing him from shattering the &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Cache%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Rare Cache&lt;/a&gt; in the room (/). As of Patch 3.1.1, Hodir will not shatter the cache if he is downed mid-cast.\nThorim.\nReaching &lt;a href=\"Thorim%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; within 3 minutes causes &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt; not to despawn and assist Thorim in the fight. Meanwhile, she cannot be targeted and she nukes the raid. Unlike the normal mode Sif does not put the debuff &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D62565\"&gt;Touch of Dominion&lt;/a&gt; to reduces his HP and damage by 25% (means 25% more damage and HP than normal mode) (/).\nFreya.\n&lt;a href=\"Freya%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; has 3 different hard modes. The three Ancients, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brightleaf\"&gt;Elder Brightleaf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Stonebark\"&gt;Elder Stonebark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Ironbranch\"&gt;Elder Ironbranch&lt;/a&gt; can be killed to make the encounter of normal difficulty or it can be increased to elite mode by leaving one or more of the Ancients alive when starting. Defeating Freya with the Ancients up rewards additional loot and an achievement: / (one ancient left), / (two ancients left), / (all ancients left).\nMimiron.\n&lt;a href=\"Mimiron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;'s elite mode is activated by pressing the \"Big Red Button\" prior to the encounter. Pressing the button puts a 10-minute enrage timer on the encounter and increases the health and damage done of all the vehicles in the encounter by 25%, while fires spawn through the area as Mimiron's workshop self-destructs. (/)\nGeneral Vezax.\nTo access &lt;a href=\"General%20Vezax\"&gt;General Vezax&lt;/a&gt;'s elite mode, do not use the &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Vapors\"&gt;Saronite Vapors&lt;/a&gt; to regain mana. If nobody in your raid makes use of the Saronite Vapors, when the 8th (and last) Saronite Vapor is spawning, they will combine to create the Saronite Animus meanwhile a Saronite Shield spawns around General Vezax (which turns him immune to damage). After you killed the Saronite Animus, the shield will despawn and you can kill General Vezax. General Vezax will drop improved loot and reward the achievement /.\nYogg-Saron.\nThere are four different hard modes for &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. The normal mode involves using the assistance of the four keepers - &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. The hard modes involve using the assistance of fewer Keepers. Yogg 1 Keeper was the common hard mode of the fight, as it was the one rewarding hard mode loots and required for the Ulduar Raid Glory. Yogg 0 Keeper was a way harder fight that was rewarding you with the Mimiron's Head mount (Which now drops at 1% chance).\nThe achievements related to this fight are: / (use three or fewer Keepers), / (use two or fewer Keepers), / (use one or fewer Keepers), and / (do not accept the help of any Keepers).\nAlgalon the Observer.\n&lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that he has no normal mode. He is considered a \"elite mode only\" boss by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; because to confront him you must defeat multiple bosses on elite mode.\nProtectors of the Endless.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Protectors%20of%20the%20Endless\"&gt;Protectors of the Endless&lt;/a&gt; encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt; is the first encounter to reintroduce elite mode since Ulduar. The new elite mode is separate and distinct from heroic mode, and there are \"five\" versions of loot available for this encounter: Raid Finder (ilvl 483), Normal (ilvl 496), Elite (ilvl 503), Heroic (ilvl 509), and Heroic Elite (ilvl 516).\nThe normal mode of the encounter requires killing Protector Kaolan first, then Elder Regail and Elder Asani in either order. Elite mode happens when the two elders are killed first and Protector Kaolan is killed last. Kaolan both has more health than the two elders, and much more annoying abilities."}

They are seen as people who will refuse to help other players reach the same level that they are in the game, and are seen as childish when berating others that ask for help on forums or in-game, usually accusing the other person of \"trolling\" with what could be seen as a legitimate question that they see as something every player should know from the creation of their first player character. They usually only make friends with those who share the same elitist viewpoints as they do.\nThere are several ways some players use to determine when another has an elitist attitude towards the game. These include, but are not limited to:\nBeyond these, an Elitist might also believe that since they believe they are more skilled than others who play the game, that they are the only ones entitled to complete high end game content, or to receive certain rewards from the high-end content. They will often complain about the game becoming \"too easy\" or \"catering to casuals\". This usually happens when Blizzard rolls out nerfs to certain dungeons even when the majority of players will agree to the nerfs, or if the nerfs are actually bug fixes that make the game more playable. \nElitists may also take the game too seriously and playing too religiously, making others around them feel as though the game has become more of a job than a fun experience. They might see some of the lighter hearted WoW aspects as being too goofy for them to accept."}

They along with other kinds of &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, are the primary prey of wolves and other predators. These food animals are not simple targets, however. The males and (in some cases) the females have antlers capable of devastating attacks. In herds, even mighty wolf packs and great cats may be hard pressed to down their target. \nElk cows are primarily aggressive when protecting young. Larger herds will huddle, forming a circle of mothers with children in the middle. The mother will attack, though if seriously injured she will attempt to flee. Bulls are likely to avoid conflict, but they can be aggressive in larger groups and when startled. They are quite agressive during mating season in the fall, and only at this time are they commonly associated with females. Antlers are present almost exclusively in males. They are shed in late winter or early spring and grown anew. Damage from a gore attack is slight in spring, and worse during the summer, with antlers reaching a decent size by fall."}

He resided in the ancient grove &lt;a href=\"Thas%27talah\"&gt;Thas'talah&lt;/a&gt;, where he communed with nature and instructed his acolytes in the ways of healing and the preservation of lore. During the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Elothir was one of the three &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; called for help in saving the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; from his curse and for fighting the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe numberless years of his life have been dedicated to learning and perfecting the arts of healing and restoration. Elothir claims that nothing in this world pains him more than taking a life.\nHowever, a vile &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; coven led by the Witchmother &lt;a href=\"Magula\"&gt;Magula&lt;/a&gt; had emerged and sought to claim his grove as their own. They inflicted a petrifying disease which, given time, would destroy the infected. Not being able to save everyone, Elothir asked a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;class leader&lt;/a&gt; to prioritize saving his elder disciples so they could protect the grove in his absence, and to slay Magula.\nWith his grove safe, Elothir was free to meet &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Grove of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. All the Archdruids gathered together and summoned &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, the Dreamer, to the Grove. Unfortunately, despite all their efforts, Cenarius was consumed by the Nightmare. In a moment of rage, Malfurion left alone to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, but the latter eventually overwhelmed and abducted him.\nAfter Malfurion was taken by Xavius, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and the class leader followed his trail and stumbled upon Elothir. He was in a dire state, as the Nightmare was slowly consuming him. He mustered all his remaining strength locate Malfurion, asking for one last favor. His age-old friend, Varethos, had fallen to the Nightmare's torment too. He and Elothir once worked in unison to protect the land, and Varethos' close ties to the land brought him low in this dark hour. However there was no cure for the Nightmare, so he asked the class leader to bring him peace.\nAs the Nightmare consumed Elothir's thoughts, his sight faded, and he started hearing the voices of the twisted trees. The waking world slipped further and further from his mind, and he lost the ability to understand the words of the forest. He clang to sanity long enough to aid Tyrande and the class leader. Using Nightmare-corrupted petals, he was able to find Malfurion while his mind was still his own. With his last breath, Elothir's noble, desperate efforts revealed that Malfurion was being held in Shala'nir, amidst the roots of &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; gone, the corruption disappeared and the afflicted were saved. Those taken by the Nightmare that had a strong tie with the Dream also survived and their spirits forever live on in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;."}

The king of Lordaeron was aware of Blackmoore's &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;ial games and allowed them personally, as long as the royal coffers would see the proper percentage of his earnings. The enslavement of orcs has been practiced among the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Lorin%20Remka\"&gt;Lorin Remka&lt;/a&gt; keeping &lt;a href=\"Greekik\"&gt;Greekik&lt;/a&gt; as her own personal slave while &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Agrovane\"&gt;Lord Agrovane&lt;/a&gt; bought &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt; and used him as his gladiator. After the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, few cases of humans using slaves remain. In the fallen kingdom of Alterac, &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; believed in slavery and sought to place the\u00a0orc\u00a0race back into chains \u2014 to return, in fact, to the days of Alliance internment camps under\u00a0Aedelas Blackmoore.\n&lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; and later his son &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; planned to take the orcs as slaves.\nIt is possible that &lt;a href=\"Bizmo%27s%20Brawlpub\"&gt;Bizmo's Brawlpub&lt;/a&gt; is still an underground example of forced gladiatorial combat (at least for some of the combatants) going on in Stormwind. According to Thrall, he believed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; may still practice slavery, as he mentioned that he would be paraded as a trophy and a slave in the capital after his capture. However, it is unknown if this is true or elicited by Thrall's past experiences with the orc internment camps that were run by humans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; house of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; force their workers into exhaustion, and also employ child labor by snatching children off the streets of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; then deporting them to the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Foundry\"&gt;Ashvane Foundry&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that Kul Tiran slavers would blush before the depravity of a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; slaver by the name of &lt;a href=\"Subjugator%20Zheng\"&gt;Zheng&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Redrock%20Harbor\"&gt;Redrock Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; enslave &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; to work in the &lt;a href=\"Redrock%20Mines\"&gt;Redrock Mines&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrcish slavery.\nThe practice of slavery has historically existed in orc society, and while in modern times it seems to occur less, the practice still continues among some orcs, though it is unclear how widespread it is. Despite Thrall's work to ensure that no orc would be cast into slavery ever again, a small number of orcs have been found enslaved by other orcs in the Horde, for example &lt;a href=\"Bloodeye%20Redfist\"&gt;Bloodeye Redfist&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that some orcs are also willing to enslave members of other races, both Horde and Alliance. Many of these slaves were however once criminals who were brought to justice. It is unclear why the orcs still allow slavery, and to what extent, or why they choose to ignore it.\n&lt;a href=\"Okrilla\"&gt;Okrilla&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, enslaved some of the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20tribe\"&gt;Dreadmaul tribe&lt;/a&gt; after recapturing the old orc city.\nNight elf slavery.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; subjugated some of the nascent &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s to use them as slave labor.\nOgre slavery.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; captured many races of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to labor in mines and fight in arenas. Some ogre clans like the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; also practice slavery and arena fighting.\nTroll slavery.\nZandalari trolls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; are above the use of slaves, they're strong and capable of seeing to themselves. Even the sight of slavery within their city is insulting to them. Additionally, they see it as a sign of weakness, and as such when they met the mogu\u2013who built their empire with slaves\u2013over 12,000 years ago, they saw themselves above the slavers.\nThough for some reason, years after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; over 10,000 years ago, a number of Zandalari came to &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; and after some time ended up enslaving the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s there. Why they did so and whether they were members of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; is unknown, as it was against the Zandalari's beliefs.\nInconsistencies.\nPrior to the release of \"\", the trolls responsible for the enslavement of the goblins on Kezan were in fact &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s, which is still referenced by quests today, and in the character creation screen for goblins.\nJungle trolls.\n&lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Zanzil&lt;/a&gt;, an infamous &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; exiled from the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt; was known for his mind-bending concoctions that when ingested, turned the imbiber into a mindslave. He didn't care about who or what drank his mind-altering potions as the mindslaves under his control range all the way from &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;, after going mad, enslaved many trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; by taking away their minds and making them do his bidding as &lt;a href=\"Mindless%20Troll\"&gt;Mindless Troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;'s pledge to aid the Gurubashi back to greatness, Zanzil set out to attack both &lt;a href=\"Hardwrench%20Hideaway\"&gt;Hardwrench Hideaway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League%20Digsite\"&gt;Explorers' League Digsite&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, poisoning their food and turning &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; into voodoo zombies.\nSlavers / slave masters and slavedrivers.\nSlavers are wealthy merchants who sell &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; slavers, obviously, run &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;'s slave rings, or simply own several slaves of their own for personal use. Although the trade princes condone slave rings, the slavery trade is kept quiet. Goblins have no wish to offend potential customers who might object to this controversial but highly lucrative line of business.\nSlaves.\nIn a lot of cases, enslaved mobs will rebel against their masters once the nearby slavedriver/slavemaster is killed."}

Keep him away from critters!\"\nNotes.\nWilly has a non-combat pet ability (also possessed by Lil KT, Toxic Wasteling and Scorchling pets) in that he can kill almost any creature in the game classified as a \"&lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s, etc). Willy will automatically attack a random, single critter that is within a 10-yard radius, and the attack occurs once every 3-minutes (if no critter is within the attack radius then that attack is simply skipped at the appropriate time and the timer resets). The timer resets when Willy is first summoned (or unsummoned/re-summoned), and continues counting as long as Willy remains summoned. He also has a tendency to fall asleep and wake up with a start.\nThe other item reward options from the quest line are &lt;a href=\"Elekk%20Training%20Collar\"&gt;Elekk Training Collar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Egbert%27s%20Egg\"&gt;Egbert's Egg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legs%20%28companion%29\"&gt;Legs (companion)&lt;/a&gt;. Only one can be chosen per year, but the quest is annually repeatable. \nTrivia.\nNote that Willy has a single eye; many players assume he is a pun on the phrase \"One Eyed Willy\", which is crude slang for a male reproductive organ. It is also possible that the name \"Sleepy Willy\" is a reference to the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; One-Eyed Willy from the movie \"\"."}
