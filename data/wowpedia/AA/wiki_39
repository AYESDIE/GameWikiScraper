Due to its proximity to &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;Frostwolf Village&lt;/a&gt;, it is commonly captured by the Horde. At the beginning of the battle, the mine is owned by &lt;a href=\"Whitewhisker\"&gt;Whitewhisker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Taskmaster%20Snivvle\"&gt;Taskmaster Snivvle&lt;/a&gt;. Coldtooth Mine, like its counterpart &lt;a href=\"Irondeep%20Mine\"&gt;Irondeep Mine&lt;/a&gt;, produces supplies for ground assaults (to be transported by a player) and 1 reinforcement to the faction owning the mine.\nMobs.\nTo gain control of the mine, the boss of the faction in the mine must be killed by a hostile player (who must do the killing blow). The mobs in the mine differ depending on the ownership of the mine:\nWhen you have killed the leader, a message will be announced in the chat across the battlegrounds and your fraction\u2019s NPC will begin spawning and fighting any remaining mobs of the previous fraction. If the battle lasts more the 30 minutes, the neutral NPC boss and his followers (&lt;a href=\"Snivvle\"&gt;Snivvle&lt;/a&gt;) will respawn to attempt to recapture the mine again.\n\"Note: Although your NPC will spawn and begin fighting any remaining mobs, they are weak and can therefore sometimes be killed by the previous faction mob. Also, to much annoyance, the area around the spawning points of &lt;a href=\"Coldtooth%20Supplies\"&gt;Coldtooth Supplies&lt;/a&gt; may not spawn any friendly NPC so players may still have to kill enemy mobs dotted around the mine.\"\nGround Assault Supplies.\nOnce the mine is under a faction's control, it will produces supplies for players of that faction to carry back to their base to gather a ground assault. The amount needed depends on the faction:\nA player can not carry more then 10 supplies at a time. These supplies are then handed back to the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Stormpike Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Frostwolf Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; back at base. Having a &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Insignia%20Rank%206\"&gt;Stormpike Insignia Rank 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Insignia%20Rank%206\"&gt;Frostwolf Insignia Rank 6&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful for returning the supplies back to base."}

They were enormously large, could possess either one or two eyes and were the ones who first shaped Draenor. The colossals were the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, and by extension the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe only signs of their passing were the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Temples of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; built during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Several massive colossal skeletons can be found across the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems these remains were destroyed along with the rest of Draenor in the main universe.\nBackground.\nThe colossals are literal pieces of &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, the great giant created by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to combat the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt;. As Grond fought the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s, pieces of his body fell off and came to life as the colossals due to the life essence that stirred within. Even though Grond was killed by &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, the final Sporemound, hope swelled within Aggramar at the sight of the colossals. They were not as mighty as Grond, but they were many and their shadows still loomed over the land. Aggramar crafted great discs inscribed with titan runes from the body of Grond and fused them to the colossals, creating armor that granted them strength and resilience. In the meantime, the Evergrowth had begun to retake lands Grond had taken from it. As Aggramar unleashed the colossals against Botaan and the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; - creatures that were pieces of the Sporemounds just as colossals were pieces of Grond - he felt a &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; dying somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and left to investigate with the promise he would return one day. He never did.\nThe colossals would never know of Aggramar's fate at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and fully expected their master to return. They were determined to bring balance to Draenor before that happened, but it was an enormous task for the Evergrowth had enveloped much of the world and Botaan now eclipsed Grond in size. It would have to be drawn away from the Evergrowth if the colossals had any chance of succeeding, and so they drew its ire by hacking way at the forests at the Evergrowth's edge. Botaan rallied the genesaur and they stormed toward the colossals, which retreated into barren ravines and hills that would give them the advantage. Botaan followed them as it saw the colossals as only pale imitations of Grond, and when it left the borders of the Evergrowth the colossals attacked with their full might. The ensuing war shook Draenor for thousands of years, with control of the world constantly moving back and forth between the two forces.\nThe battles over time took their toll on the colossals. Just as they had broken off from Grond, pieces of their bodies that broke off came to life as the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;. The colossals called on the magnaron to fight the Evergrowth but they did not obey. Some did indeed battle the forces of Botaan, but not out of loyalty to the colossals, and others simply left the battlefield to seek out areas of volcanic activity. The colossals' numbers were dwindling and they had to take drastic action or they would fail. The titan discs that made their armor contained immense power, and that power would stop the Evergrowth. The colossals piled onto Botaan and unleashed the energy in unison, creating a massive explosion. It shattered the bodies of Botaan and the colossals and sent the pieces all across Draenor. Over time, the scattered pieces of their bodies would sink into the ground and become veins of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Ore\"&gt;blackrock ore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBotaan's death released spores infused with the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;. It affected some magnaron, turning a number of them into &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, but legends say that a few surviving colossals were affected as well. As millennia passed, their bodies diminished and became flesh. When mortal civilizations came to power on Draenor, the colossals were long dead and only their skeletons remained. Creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s would discover their bones and fashion trinkets, dwellings, and weapons from them. The colossals' remains were believed to contain power.\nTemples of the Damned.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Temples of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"grombolar\" or \"bowels of the giant\" in &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, were said to be \"formed from petrified carcasses of the race of giants that inhabited the Orcish homeworld.\"\nAlternate Draenor.\nThe massive skeletons of several colossals can be found in various locations throughout the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt; orcs are said to have hunted the giants and commonly construct their homes and hunting halls from the creatures' gigantic bones.\nThe skeleton of a particularly large colossus, rumored to be the last of its kind, served as the Thunderlord's home city of &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gar\"&gt;Grom'gar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. The similar but smaller location of &lt;a href=\"Colossal%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Colossal's Fall&lt;/a&gt; was considered sacred by the Thunderlord, as they claimed that it was their clan who felled it many decades ago. According to an orcish &lt;a href=\"Flavor%20lore\"&gt;legend&lt;/a&gt;, the largest beast to ever walk the world was a colossus named Gorgrond, and when it fell its body became the large landmass of the &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;. Its spine became the mountains, its blood the ore and its will the savagery that rules Gorgrond's inhabitants. This legend may have been inspired by the story of Grond.\nThe remains of two other colossals \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Agurak%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Agurak's Fall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boneslag\"&gt;Boneslag&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 can also be found in Frostfire Ridge. The skull of another looms over &lt;a href=\"Deadgrin\"&gt;Deadgrin&lt;/a&gt;. Another skull can be found far to the east off the coast of Gorgrond, submerged near two small islands that are not marked on the map. It has fungi growing out of its eye and mouth. A seventh can be found directly west of , overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Grounds%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ancestral Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Horde%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Horde Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" says that \"ogres were one of the last races of Draenor's giants.\" This is implying that there has been more than one race of giants that have lived on Draenor, which was later confirmed."}

{"id": "327588", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=327588", "title": "Pet Battle System", "text": "The Pet Battle System allows players to use their &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; pets in turn-based mini-games to capture wild pets to add to their collection, battle NPC &lt;a href=\"Pet%20tamer\"&gt;Pet tamer&lt;/a&gt;s, and test their skills against other players. Winning a battle rewards the participating pets with experience, which allows pets to gain levels, increasing their power and unlocking new abilities to use in battles.\nTo participate in pet battles, players must learn the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pet%20Training\"&gt;Battle Pet Training&lt;/a&gt; skill from a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pet%20Trainer\"&gt;Battle Pet Trainer&lt;/a&gt;, available at level 5 for . The skill applies to all characters on the player's &lt;a href=\"battle.net\"&gt;battle.net&lt;/a&gt; account.\nPet battles are similar to the widely popular video game series \"\", and are designed to be \"fun and casual\", only tracking the number of wins and not the number of losses.\nDescription.\nAzeroth is home to a variety of creatures, some large and threatening, some very small. Heroes traveling the world can collect pets to call their own. But Azeroth's smallest denizens are just as fierce as the monsters that face champions of the world in epic battles. With the Pet Battle system, players can capture wild pets, train them to grow stronger, create teams for battling, and even pit their pets against other players. \nBattle pets.\nAlmost all &lt;a href=\"companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; are battle pets, and can participate in pet battles. Battle pets gain experience, and eventually level up (up to the current level cap of 25), by battling other pets. Reaching levels 1, 2, 4, 10, 15 and 20 unlocks new abilities, though each pet may only select three of their six possible abilities to use in battle. \nTypes.\nThere are ten pet types or families, each with a unique passive ability. Each pet type is strong against one type of pet damage (taking only 67% damage from that type of attacks), and weak against one other type of pet damage (taking 150% damage). For example a Beast pet takes 50% additional damage from a Mechanical attack, but takes 33% less damage from a Humanoid ability. However, a pet often has abilities different from its type - for example the &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Chicken\"&gt;Mechanical Chicken&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Peck\"&gt;Peck&lt;/a&gt; which is a Flying type attack, while the Mechanical Chicken itself is a Mechanical type. Damage modifiers are therefore determined by the type of the attacker's ability, and the type of the defender itself; the type of the attacker does not actually have any bearing on this.\nAlthough generally reasonable, a pet's type may not always match expectations. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Peanut\"&gt;Peanut&lt;/a&gt;, the baby elephant, is of the Critter type, while &lt;a href=\"Maggot\"&gt;Maggot&lt;/a&gt; is considered a Beast. Similarly, the undead &lt;a href=\"Blighted%20Squirrel\"&gt;Blighted Squirrel&lt;/a&gt; is of the Critter (not Undead) type, while the undead flying &lt;a href=\"Blighthawk\"&gt;Blighthawk&lt;/a&gt; is of the Undead (not Flying) type.\nCritter, Beast and Flying types have (in that order) the highest number of unique pets, while Humanoid, Undead, and Magic types have (in that order) the lowest number of unique pets.\nStats.\nEach pet has 3 stats: Health, Power and Speed.\nEach species of pet has its own base stat values, with a bias toward certain stats. For example, snakes and mice tend to have higher Speed, while turtles and bears tend to have higher Health. Gaining a level will increase all of a pet's stats. However, just how much each stat is increased by is determined by the pet's quality and breed. Higher quality pets enjoy larger gains overall, while different breeds of pet gain more in different stats. Each pet's stat bias is fixed and will persist through levelling and quality gains.\nQuality.\nCollectible pets come in four types of quality: , , and . Quality functions as a direct multiplier for each pet's stats; quality pets have the lowest stats, followed by pets, then pets, with pets having the highest stats of all. The quality of pets can be determined through the corresponding color of their names.\nWhile player pets are limited to the above qualities, and pets do exist. Most max-level pet tamers use pets, while pets feature in the &lt;a href=\"Beasts%20of%20Fable\"&gt;Beasts of Fable&lt;/a&gt; battle pet quests. There are currently no pets of these qualities that are obtainable by players.\nThe quality of collected pets can be improved through the use of &lt;a href=\"Battle-Stone\"&gt;Battle-Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, which can upgrade pets to and qualities.\nBreed.\nBreed determines the exact balance of stats that any individual pet will boast. While each species of pet has its own stat bias, each individual pet may be one of a number of breeds. Which breeds are available is determined by species, with most featuring several possibilities. Pets that have been purchased or gained through achievements or promotions (such as &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20Pup\"&gt;Core Hound Pup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Feline%20Familiar\"&gt;Feline Familiar&lt;/a&gt;) have only one possible breed, ensuring that all such pets are created equal. Some breeds place a strong emphasis on a single stat, while others are split between two or even all three stats.\nEach breed effectively grants a bonus to one or more stats, increasing the amounts of those stats gained by the pet for each level it possesses. Balanced breeds offer the lowest overall point total, while single-stat breeds offer the highest point total, but are obviously less versatile. There are 10 total breeds, although only a handful of these are usually available to any given species of pet.\nThe effect of breed on stats can have a significant impact on a pet's abilities. For example, a pet with abilities like &lt;a href=\"Thrash%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Thrash (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horn%20Attack\"&gt;Horn Attack&lt;/a&gt; may benefit substantially from having higher Speed, while those without such abilities may have more to gain from extra Health or Power. Desired breeds therefore vary by pet, as well as by preferred strategy and team composition.\nBreed represents the one factor which cannot be changed for each pet; they can be leveled-up to gain in overall power, and improved with Battle-Stones to increase their quality, but their breed is fixed and cannot be changed. Because of this, ideal breed is more important than level or quality when seeking an optimal pet for max-level play. \nFor detailed information on pet breeds and related calculations, see WarcraftPets.com's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warcraftpets.com/wow-pet-battles/breeds/\"&gt;Guide to WoW Pet Breeds and Breed IDs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nEach battle pet has six abilities in total, placed in three tiers: level 1 &amp; 10, 2 &amp; 15, and 4 &amp; 20, with abilities learnt at the corresponding level. Pets can only choose one of each pair of abilities to use in each battle, and these pairings cannot be rearranged. For example a &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20Pup\"&gt;Core Hound Pup&lt;/a&gt; learns &lt;a href=\"Howl\"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt; at level 2 and &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Dodge (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; at level 15, so a player who has a level 15 Core Hound Pup can choose to use either Howl or Dodge. Selected abilities can be easily changed through the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Journal\"&gt;Pet Journal&lt;/a&gt;, but not during battles. Each pet can only use a choice of three abilities in combat.\nAbilities are not exclusive to the pet's type, so a Mechanical type pet may have a Flying ability. Different ability types may deal increased or decreased damage to the target depending on their type, making different abilities more desirable against different opponents.\nWhile each species of pet possesses a different set of available abilities, the same set is usually shared by most or all species of any given kind. For example, all snakes share the same ability set as &lt;a href=\"Black%20Kingsnake\"&gt;Black Kingsnake&lt;/a&gt;, while all bears share abilities with &lt;a href=\"Baby%20Blizzard%20Bear\"&gt;Baby Blizzard Bear&lt;/a&gt;, and all moths share abilities with &lt;a href=\"Silky%20Moth\"&gt;Silky Moth&lt;/a&gt;. However, there some exceptions; pets such as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Beetle\"&gt;Fire Beetle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scalded%20Basilisk%20Hatchling\"&gt;Scalded Basilisk Hatchling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feline%20Familiar\"&gt;Feline Familiar&lt;/a&gt; defy expectations to offer some more unusual abilities for their types. While different species may feature the same ability sets, it should be noted that they often offer different stat and breed possibilities.\nAbilities come in many varieties, and can be affected by various factors such as hit chance and Speed. For an explanation of abilities and their use, &lt;a href=\"%23Using%20abilities\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;. For the list of abilities, .\nExperience.\nLike player characters, each battle pet has a level, and an &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; (XP) bar. Gaining enough XP will cause your pet to gain a level. Gaining a level will generally increase your pet's stats, and instantly restore their health to its new maximum. Reaching certain levels also allows access to new abilities. The current battle pet level cap is 25.\nPets gain XP through winning battles. XP is awarded only at the end of a battle; defeating individual opponents will not reward XP until the battle as a whole is won. If the player loses the battle, no XP will be gained.\nThe amount of XP earnt in a battle is rewarded according to the calculated difficulty of the encounter; this appears to largely relate to the relative levels of the involved pets. Pets earn more XP for defeating pets which are of a higher level than them, and less XP for defeating pets which are of a lower level than them. Opponents 5 or more levels below the pet's level reward no XP. Trapped pets reward only a portion of the usual XP.\nPets at max level cannot gain XP, but can still earn it through battle. Any XP earnt by max-level pets will instead be divided among any participating non-max-level pets, similarly to the below rules concerning dead pets. However, battles involving only max-level pets will yield no XP. Pets are considered participating if they attack, or are targeted by an enemy ability. A lead pet that swaps out in the first round is not treated as participating, but one in the back row which is affected by an attack is.\nXP distribution varies depending on the type of battle. Battles played against the computer divide XP between all surviving participants, regardless of their actual contribution to the battle. In the event that the player wins, but all participating pets die, leaving one or more non-participating survivors, the XP reward will be divided among the surviving pets. Queued PvP pet battles simply divide XP between all participating pets on the winning team, dead or alive. Duels do not reward any XP. Battles which conclude with the death of all involved pets do not reward XP, regardless of the order of death.\nXP is divided among eligible pets according to level, with lower-level pets gaining a slightly larger portion than higher-level pets. XP distribution is not affected by the amount of damage dealt by each pet, whether they started or ended the match, or the number of opponents they faced.\nThe overall amount of XP granted is calculated as:\nexperience = (your_pet_level + 9) * (opponent_pet_level - your_pet_level + 5) * N \nWhere N is dependant on the number of opponents faced (N=1 for one opponent, N=2 for 2 opponents and N=2.5 for 3 opponents)a bonus based on the number of opponent pets faced.\nPvE encounters (such as tamers) also have a trainer multiplier to make their fights more or less rewarding.\nPet experience gains can be increased by 10% with &lt;a href=\"Safari%20Hat\"&gt;Safari Hat&lt;/a&gt; (a reward from &lt;a href=\"Taming%20the%20World\"&gt;Taming the World&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Pet%20Treat\"&gt;Lesser Pet Treat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Treat\"&gt;Pet Treat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Top%20Hat\"&gt;Darkmoon Top Hat&lt;/a&gt; and during the Pet Experience Bonus Event.\nWild pets.\nWild pets are &lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt;-like creatures that are found throughout the game world. Players with Battle Pet Training can choose to battle them using their own battle pets. Aside from their involvement in the battle pet system, wild pets are very similar to critters, having extremely low health and usually refusing to attack the player even if attacked. Players can enter battle with wild pets by right-clicking on them. Wild pets can be captured, and thus added to the player's collection. See &lt;a href=\"%23Wild%20pet%20battles\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nWild pets can be distinguished from non-combat critters and mobs in a number of ways. Firstly, mousing over a wild pet will cause the cursor to transform into the wild pet icon . The icon will be green if the pet is within range for battling, or grey if it is out of range. Wild pets can also be distinguished by an icon next to their portrait representing their Type (see below), and capturable wild pets will display the text \"Capturable\" if moused over.\nPlayers with &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pet%20Training\"&gt;Battle Pet Training&lt;/a&gt; can also choose to track pets. This displays nearby wild pets on the mini-map, allowing players to find them easily. It also causes the wild pet icon and the pet's name to be displayed above wild pets, making them easily distinguishable from non-combat critters. \nWild pets appear throughout Azeroth, with some being more rare than others. Weather, time of day and even time of year can play into when the creatures appear as well. For example some wild pets won't appear unless it's raining or night time, possibly even both.\nAlmost every zone in the game features wild pets, and almost every zone that features wild pets has at least one pet that is unique to that zone. The main exceptions are the cities, the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt;s and a handful of other zones.\nManagement.\nAs &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;s, battle pets can found in the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Journal\"&gt;Pet Journal&lt;/a&gt;. The Journal lists the player's current collection, displaying name, type, level and quality, and features a search function and various filters. Detailed information on each pet and its stats and abilities can be obtained through the top-right pane. Players can choose to release a pet back into the wild by right-clicking the pet and selecting 'Release'.\nThe bottom-right pane consists of three Battle Pet Slots, representing the player's current battle pet team. Dragging a pet to one of these slots will make it part of your team, replacing any pet previously occupying that slot. Each Battle Pet Slot displays a review of the pet, showing the pet's name, type, abilities, level, health and experience. Pets' abilities can also be chosen in this pane. Pets will be displayed in-combat in the order of the slots that they occupy; when battling wild pets, the pet in the first slot will always open combat (if alive). By default, the pet in the first slot is also summoned as the player's companion.\nAt the bottom-left of the window is the 'Summon' button, allowing a pet to be summoned as the player's in-game companion. At the top-right can be found the &lt;a href=\"Revive%20Battle%20Pets\"&gt;Revive Battle Pets&lt;/a&gt; ability, while at the bottom-right is the 'Find Battle' button, queueing the player for a PvP pet battle match against another player with a reasonably similar team of pets.\nHealing and resurrection.\nA number of options exist for restoring your battle pets. All have the effect of resurrecting and healing all of your battle pets to 100% health.\nPet battles are designed to be highly accessible, and this is reflected in the range of options for restoring pets. Note that only PvE pet battles affect the health of your actual pets; none of these options are therefore needed when dealing solely with PvP battles. This allows players to enjoy PvP without constraint, but still places some small price upon death against computer opponents. However, players still cannot participate in PvP pet battles without a full team of live pets. Note also that all the above options restore all pets to 100% health, whether or not they are part of your current team.\n&lt;a href=\"Revive%20Battle%20Pets\"&gt;Revive Battle Pets&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient for basic levelling purposes; it is generally only when facing repeated failure in PvE encounters that the other options become necessary. A &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pet%20Bandage\"&gt;Battle Pet Bandage&lt;/a&gt; is of course the most convenient option after that, but supply of them is limited. &lt;a href=\"Stable%20master\"&gt;Stable master&lt;/a&gt;s are a great option if there is one nearby, as they can be visited as often as desired at a very low price, and there is usually one within a few minutes of most locations. Alternatively, players may prefer to simply wait until Revive Battle Pets' cooldown expires. If none of these options appeal, players are always free to play with other pets for a few minutes.\nBattling.\nPet battles are turn-based, rather than in real-time like other combat in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". Players can battle with their pets in solo matches or teams of up to three pets. Players can leave a pet battle at any time by forfeiting the match. Players cannot start a pet battle while in combat, flying or falling.\nDuring battle, any characters (players or NPCs) which stray too close to the field of battle will disappear and not be shown to the participants. This prevents interference with pet battles through obstructing players' view of the fight. Nearby mobs will not attack players who are engaged in pet battles, although they may do so immediately after the player finishes battling.\nWhen fighting another player, you cannot see the other player's name or communicate with them.\nPets can have a boost in one area: health, attack or speed. For example a speed pet is essential for moves that does additional damage if done first, but is more vulnerable to an attack pet, and has a harder time defeating a health pet (unless it has a bigger advantage - see &lt;a href=\"%23Types\"&gt;types&lt;/a&gt; section below).\nSome pets may have some different abilities or feature cosmetic differences, but no player will ever have a significant advantage based simply on the rarity of a pet.\nTypes of battle.\nPlayers can battle their pets against both computer opponents and other players. Pet battles can occur in four different ways:\nEach of these methods of finding battle results in a slightly different experience.\nWild pet battles.\nA wild pet battle can be started by right-clicking on any wild pet. Battle will commence immediately, with the pet that is highest on the player's team automatically starting combat. Wild pet battles take place in the player's immediate area, and any obstructions within that area may prevent battle from commencing - moving into a slightly different position will usually solve this problem.\nSince wild pet battles are PvE battles, played against the computer, there is no time limit in this type of battle. Players can take as long as they want to choose which actions to take each round, and do not have to wait for their opponent(s) to make their decisions.\nThe most significant difference between wild pet battles and other types of battles is that pets in wild pet battles can be captured by the player. Any time a wild pet falls below 35% health, the player can attempt to trap the pet. Attempting to trap a pet counts as the player's action for that round, and will take place in the appropriate sequence, determined by the speed of the player's current pet. Attempting to trap a pet may or may not succeed. If it succeeds, the pet will be removed from combat and added to the player's collection. If it fails, the player is free to try again next round, with a 25% increase in their chance of success for each previous attempt. However, only one pet can be captured in each battle. Captured pets are only claimed upon the player winning the total battle - if the player fails, the captured pet will be lost. Captured pets appear to reward only a portion of the XP usually gained by defeating them.\nPlayers cannot attempt to trap a pet if they already have three of that pet in their collection, or if they already have the maximum number of pets (650 pets as of &lt;a href=\"patch%205.1.0\"&gt;patch 5.1.0&lt;/a&gt;). Players can choose to release pets at any time outside of battles, freeing up space for new pets to be captured, but not during battle. Players may therefore wish to leave spaces in their collection to ensure that they have room should a rare specimen pop up. Mousing over a wild pet will display the number of that kind of pet the player currently has in their collection, making this somewhat easier to anticipate, but does not of course account for any additional pets that may join the battle.\nCapturing a wild pet may also reduce its level:\nAlthough encountered individually, entering battle with a wild pet may lead to one or more additional pets entering combat to assist it, with the announcement \"Another pet has joined the battle!\" or \"Two more pets have joined the battle!\". These additional pets need not match the original pet's type. Additional pets are generally determined by level, with low-level wild pets battling alone and higher level pets reliably bringing two friends to the fight. \nWild pet battles and tamer battles are the only kinds of battles in which the health of the player's pets is not restored at the end of battle. However, surviving participants do benefit from Battle Restoration, a healing effect which restores a portion of the health lost by the pet during the battle. Pets that have died during battle do not benefit from Battle Restoration.\nWhile battling wild pets, characters will still appear in the game world, and can still be attacked. To compensate for this vulnerability, characters attacked by enemy players while engaged in pet battles will gain a three-second damage absorption shield, giving them time to cancel their pet battle and attend to their attacker. In these cases, the wild pet will be respawned. This should mostly affect players on PvP realms. \nOnce a player begins a pet battle with a wild pet, the pet itself will be removed from the game world, preventing other players from attempting to battle it. Wild pets will not re-spawn in the game world even if the player is defeated, or surrenders. However, if the player leaves the battle after being attacked by another player, or in order to enter a queued pet battle match, the pet will be re-spawned, provided it has not yet been killed.\nPet tamer battles.\n&lt;a href=\"Pet%20tamer\"&gt;Pet tamer&lt;/a&gt;s are special NPCs whom players can challenge to battle through corresponding quests. Pet tamer battles are very similar to wild pet battles, except that tamers' pets cannot be captured. All pet tamers also come with three pets, and these are all present in the game world before battle begins. Tamers open every battle with the same pet, and tend to offer a very similar fight experience every time. Their pets also use the same three abilities for every fight. This gives players the chance to devise specific strategies to counter tamers' pets. At higher levels pet tamers can offer quite a challenge, and this level of strategy and customisation of the player's team is often necessary to defeat them. \nMost max-level tamers have pets. All tamer pets have individual names, and most higher level pets are somewhat unique, often featuring appearances or ability sets that do not exactly match any pets available to players. \nUnlike wild pet battles, where entering battle removes the wild pet from the game world, entering battle with a pet tamer instead phases the player out of the regular game world, meaning they cannot be seen or attacked while battling a pet tamer. Because of this, pet tamers can battle multiple players simultaneously. However, players currently engage in tamer battles can sometimes be detected by the presence of their current companions, who remain visible to other players. Players on &lt;a href=\"PvP%20realm\"&gt;PvP realm&lt;/a&gt;s should take care when battling tamers, since these NPCs may attract a regular flow of players from both factions, and while battling players are protected from attack, they may leave the fight to discover enemy players close at hand, or even waiting eagerly for their return.\nQueued pet battles.\nPlayers can queue for PvP pet battles through the 'Find Battle' button in the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Journal\"&gt;Pet Journal&lt;/a&gt;. Queueing for a pet battle causes the player to enter a queue very similar to those used for queueing for dungeons, battlegrounds, etc. Once a match is found, the player will be given 30 seconds to decide whether to accept or decline the match.\nAccepting the match will temporarily transport the player to a random battle zone on the player's current continent, where they will do battle with their opponent. Although appearing within the location (including witnessing NPCs and player characters in the area) players and their pets cannot be seen by others in the area, nor interacted with. Battle zones include many unlikely locations, such the bustling center of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and amid fighting &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. At the conclusion of the battle, players are returned to their previous locations. Since the location experienced by each player always corresponds to their current continent (and not that of their opponent), it is likely that each player's location is determined separately (the battle itself not actually taking place in either location).\nDuring queued pet battles, the player's opponent is represented by a randomly selected player character. They may be of any playable race, of either gender and faction, and may wear any of a variety of often quite impressive armor. The opponent's representation does not appear to be related to their actual character; meeting the same player twice in a row will yield an apparently entirely different opponent, albeit possessing exactly the same pets. This is provable due to the one feature of queued pet battles that allows for identification: any personalised pet names are still shown in battle. \nPvP pet battles feature a reasonable time limit when choosing which action to take each round. A meter across the top of the action bar indicates the time remaining to choose this round's action. As with PvE battles, each opponent must choose their action at the start of the round. The round will commence once both players have chosen their actions, or when the timer expires. If a player does not choose an action before the timer expires, they will 'pass' that round. Round timers will also get progressively shorter for players who take more than 15 seconds to issue a command during their turn. Battles begin with an inspection period, during which no actions can be taken, but players are free to examine their opponent's pets. After this, players are given a small period in which to select one of their pets.\nPvP pet battles (both queued battles and duels) do not alter the health or status of your actual pets; after battle, your pets are restored to the state in which they were beforehand. Pets therefore do not need to be healed or resurrected after these types of battle. Players cannot queue for a pet battle if any of their pets are dead. However, if one of your pets dies while you are queued, accepting the invitation will lead you to enter the battle with only your surviving pets available. Regardless of its health, as long as a pet is alive when the invitation is accepted, that pet will enter the battle at full health. Players also cannot adjust their lineup or their currently selected pets' abilities while queued for a pet battle.\nForfeiting a queued pet battle will grant the winning player full XP rewards, even if no combat has taken place. Battles which conclude with the death of all involved pets are counted as a draw.\nAlthough claiming to match you \"against a player of similar skill\", with teams featuring below max level pets the battle queueing system would appear rather to select matches based on the combined level of the pets in each player's team. For example, a player with pets of levels 6, 6, and 7 (for a combined total of 19 levels), might find themselves matched against a player with pets of levels 7, 7 and 5, levels 6, 5 and 8, or even levels 10, 8 and 1. However, the match is not always exact.\nWhile queued, players can engage in other activity with their character, including battling wild pets. If the player's queue match comes up while they are engaged in a battle with a wild pet, they can still choose to enter the new match; the battle against the wild pet will be abandoned. Leaving combat using this technique appears to re-place the wild pet in the game world, potentially allowing you to battle it again once your queued match is completed. However, players cannot queue for pet battles while currently in a battle.\nPet battle duels.\nPet battle duels, initiated by challenging a nearby player through right-clicking their portrait, are broadly similar to queued pet battles, with a few differences. The most important difference is that pet battle duels \"do not award experience\" - duels therefore cannot be used for levelling pets. Similarly, they do not count towards achievements such as &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Fight%21\"&gt;Cat Fight!&lt;/a&gt;. These aspects were likely added to ensure that all player-vs-player pet battles that grant experience or achievements are randomly matched, and to prevent players from exploiting the system by repeatedly throwing premade battles.\nWeather.\nVarious abilities can create weather effects, or take advantage of existing ones. Creating a new weather effect will replace the current one. All weather effects last 9\u00a0rounds, except for Darkness, which lasts 5 rounds. \nStatus.\nVarious statuses can be applied to pets. Statuses may be applied by abilities or caused by weather effects. While statuses have no effect in and of themselves, other abilities can take advantage of them. All statuses expire once battle ends.\nOrder of battle.\nOnce starting pets have been determined, the first round begins. At the start of each round, each player (or computer opponent) must decide their action for that round. There are 6 main options:\nAll of the above options, with the exception of forfeiting, take the place of the player's chosen action for that round, and only one of those options can be chosen each round. Players can choose to forfeit the match at any time, even mid-action. Forfeiting the match will declare your opponent the winner, and in the case of wild pet battles will reduce the current health of all pets on your team by 10%. Choosing to switch your pet will perform the switch before your opponent has the chance to take action, and effectively grants your opponent a free turn; any attack or ability used by them that round will be applied to your new active pet. \nThe order of all actions besides switching pets is determined by the speeds of the currently active pets, with the pet with the higher Speed taking action first. If the pets have equal Speed, order is determined randomly each round. This order of action also applies to players attempting to capture wild pets; their attempt will take place at the time at which their pet would normally act. Note that certain abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Surge\"&gt;Surge&lt;/a&gt; supersede the usual order. \nThe order of attack is often of greater significance than simply who has the chance to kill whom first; some abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Prison%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Crystal Prison (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; incapacitate opponents, preventing them from taking action, while others such as &lt;a href=\"Burrow%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Burrow (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; protect the user from the next attack directed against them. Numerous abilities also grant additional effects depending on the Speed of the user or the target.\nDamage over time effects and delayed effects from abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Tomb\"&gt;Ice Tomb&lt;/a&gt; always take place at the end of the round, and will take effect whether or not the victim's opponent is still alive. Personal effects from abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Fang\"&gt;Poison Fang&lt;/a&gt; will affect the afflicted pet whether or not they are currently the active pet, while general effects such as damage over time effects from weather and delayed effects usually only affect the currently active pet. Since these effects take place at the end of the round, if the pet dies during the round, any such effects will be wasted.\nOnce a pet's health reaches zero, the pet will die. If the player has another pet available, they will be allowed to choose which to use next. If not, the battle is over. Victory is decided by whichever team's pets are defeated first. If all surviving pets die within the same round, the battle will be deemed a draw, regardless of order of death.\nUsing abilities.\nBattle pets come with a variety of abilities at their disposal. Some are straight damage abilities, while others may heal pets, grant buffs or strategically weaken opponents. While the ultimate goal is to defeat the enemy team, this array of abilities presents a range of possible approaches to any battle.\nEach ability has a hit chance. You can find this displayed in each ability's tooltip. Most direct damage abilities have a 100% hit chance, while some powerful attacks like &lt;a href=\"Burrow%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Burrow (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; have a substantial chance of missing. Additionally, abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Flash\"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt; which apply a Blinded status effect, and the Darkness weather effect caused by &lt;a href=\"Call%20Darkness\"&gt;Call Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, may reduce pets' chance to be hit by up to 100%. Pets also have a chance to miss when fighting higher-level opponents, equal to 2% for each level. Abilities with lower hit chances are often extremely powerful, but can be unreliable.\nDirect damage abilities also miss when the target is protected or unattackable, such as when using &lt;a href=\"Burrow%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Burrow (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt;. Such effects may or may not cause damage over time effects to miss. \nDirect effects.\nDirect effects are those that are applied immediately. This includes abilities that immediately deal damage, apply buffs and debuffs, and provide healing.\nThe majority of pet abilities incorporate some element of direct damage. Direct damage is damage that is dealt immediately, as opposed to damage over time. Direct damage is usually the main method of defeating pets, although it can be less reliable than damage over time effects when fighting pets that are capable of shielding themselves. Note that many direct abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Fang\"&gt;Poison Fang&lt;/a&gt; deal direct damage while also applying periodic damage over time effects.\nMulti-round abilities.\nWhile almost all abilities take place within a single round, some take longer. Multi-round abilities take the place of the player's actions for the duration, and once the player has committed to this course of action, they cannot cancel the ability or choose another action until the ability has completed, even if the current opponent is defeated. Multi-round abilities display their number of rounds in their tooltips. \nSome multi-round abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Stampede%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Stampede (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; deal damage each round, while others such as &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Breath%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Deep Breath (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; are spent in preparation. Some such as &lt;a href=\"Lift-Off\"&gt;Lift-Off&lt;/a&gt; also make the user unattackable for the duration, although this does not prevent them from suffering damage from non-direct sources such as already applied damage over time effects.\nRamping abilities.\nSome direct effects known as \"ramping\" abilities, while taking place within a single round, increase in power each time they are used.\nThere are currently 6 ramping abilities: &lt;a href=\"Vicious%20Fang\"&gt;Vicious Fang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frog%20Kiss\"&gt;Frog Kiss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blast%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Arcane Blast (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Focused%20Beams\"&gt;Focused Beams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Gas\"&gt;Sleeping Gas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Blast\"&gt;Nether Blast&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeriodic effects.\nPeriodic effects are those that take place over time. This includes damage over time effects and healing over time effects. Most periodic effects take effect for several rounds in a row, while others such as &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Tomb\"&gt;Ice Tomb&lt;/a&gt; only take place once, a set number of rounds after they are applied. Periodic effects almost always happen at the end of the round. Most periodic effects take effect for the first time at the end of the round in which they are applied. Weather effects also take the form of battle-wide periodic effects, usually affecting all active pets or even all pets in play.\nDamage over time effects don't deal damage immediately, but instead tend to take the form of a debuff, dealing a regular amount of damage at the end of each round for a set number of rounds. They can be useful when planning to use a protective or multi-round ability, because the enemy pet will still receive damage even without your pet attacking them. Damage over time effects may or may not be prevented by effects that cause enemy attacks to miss (since the effect has already been applied) but may still be prevented by protective and blocking effects. As a rule, effects which involve a pre-inflicted wound, such as that from &lt;a href=\"Woodchipper\"&gt;Woodchipper&lt;/a&gt;, will still deal damage even if the target cannot be hit; while effects that involve repeated strikes, such as that from &lt;a href=\"Nut%20Barrage\"&gt;Nut Barrage&lt;/a&gt;, will not.\nMost damage over time effects are applied to individual pets, and will continue to deal damage to them even if they are no longer the active pet. Other sources of damage over time, such as that provided by certain weather effects, are applied to whichever pets are currently active, or simply to all involved pets.\nDelayed effects such as &lt;a href=\"Elementium%20Bolt\"&gt;Elementium Bolt&lt;/a&gt; have no apparent effect until several rounds later, when they take effect at the end of the round. Strategically, these usually represent a superior effect (be it damage or crowd control) to that offered by more direct means, but at the price of delayed application. These effects are usually battle-wide effects, affecting whichever pet is active when the duration expires. However, if the active pet dies before the end of that round, the effect will be wasted.\nProtective abilities.\nMany abilities offer some kind of short-term protection or immunity to attack. Some multi-round abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Burrow%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Burrow (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; leave the user unattackable for the rest of the round, causing non-periodic effects to miss them, or grant them a 100% chance to block or dodge attacks.\nMany protective abilities protect the user against the next attack. These usually refer to a single direct attack, and abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Stampede%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Stampede (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; which deal several small strikes will therefore be only partly mitigated.\nOf special note is &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Apocalypse (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt;, which generally cannot be blocked or avoided through such abilities. However, certain protections do exist: all Cockroaches and Beetles always survive Apocalypse; as do pets using &lt;a href=\"Survival%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Survival (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt;. Magic-type pets may also survive it due to their passive type ability which prevents them from taking more than 40% of their maximum health in damage in any one attack.\nMulti-target abilities.\nWhile most abilities focus on a single target, others affect a whole team of pets at once. This includes abilities which heal your entire team, and attacks which damage all opponents. Since non-active pets cannot fight back, multi-target attacks, while typically dealing less damage to each individual pet than a single-target attack, can often be an effective way of defeating opposing teams through dealing unavoidable damage. Whole-team heals are the natural counter to these attacks, with some pets often selected for battles solely for their ability to heal the rest of the team. All multi-target abilities are more effective when facing a full team, usually making them more desirable early in matches.\nWeather, condition and object abilities.\nCertain abilities can create weather effects. Weather effects last 9 rounds, or until another weather effect is created, and can confer various effects and benefits to pets, essentially battle-wide buffs and debuffs. For a list of weather statuses and related abilities, see &lt;a href=\"%23Weather\"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;. \nOther abilities are able to create temporary conditions or even objects on the battlefield. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Quicksand\"&gt;Quicksand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Geyser\"&gt;Geyser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Trap\"&gt;Magma Trap&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these are extremely similar to weather effects, but are not counted as such. They may take effect each round or only trigger upon certain events. Certain abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Wave\"&gt;Magma Wave&lt;/a&gt; can destroy pet-created objects.\nBuffs and debuffs.\nBuffs are found as part of many pet abilities. Some abilities simply provide buffs, while others also perform other functions such as dealing damage. Many abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Adrenaline%20Rush%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Adrenaline Rush (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; that generate buffs as part of an attack, do not actually need to hit the target to provide the buff. The most common kinds of buff include increasing the user's speed and damage output, or decreasing their damage taken.\nThe counter to buffs, debuffs are also applied by many abilities. Debuffs are usually applied to enemies, although they are sometimes acquired by pets as a tradeoff for an ability's other effects. Some debuff-applying abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Howl\"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt; will not apply their debuffs if the attack misses, or the target is protected.\nAll ability-applied buffs and debuffs have a limited duration. This is usually a certain number of rounds, but some instead last for a set number of attacks, made by or against the pet. Buffs from some passive type abilities do not have a duration, but may have their own conditions for taking effect.\nDebuffs are generally pet-specific, and their duration will continue to expire whether or not the afflicted pet is currently the active pet. Players will therefore often swap out a particularly afflicted pet until the debuff has expired (especially if it was generated by an ability with a lengthy cooldown). Certain abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Eggnog\"&gt;Eggnog&lt;/a&gt; can directly remove buffs and debuffs.\nMany buffs and debuffs, such as speed and damage effects, expire at the end of the appropriate round. These often therefore offer twice the utility to higher-speed pets. For example, using &lt;a href=\"Survival%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Survival (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; protects the user until the end of the next round. Higher-speed pets will therefore be protected from the next two attacks made against them, since they can cast this before their opponent's attack that round; while lower speed pets will only be protected against one, having already suffered their opponent's attack for the current round.\nOther effects, such as stuns and other crowd control effects (see below) instead expire exactly one or more rounds after they were applied. This means that use a one-round stun on an opponent before they have time to act will prevent them from acting for that round (but they will be free to act in the next), while using it on a pet after they have acted will prevent them from taking action in the next round.\nCrowd control abilities.\nSome debuffs directly affect the abilities of the target. Abilities which stun, put to sleep, or otherwise incapacitate the target, prevent that pet from taking any action for the duration. However, players can still choose to swap stunned pets. Some abilities root, trap or web pets, preventing them from being swapped for a number of rounds, but not restricting the actions of the pet itself.\nConditional abilities.\nSome abilities have additional effects which take place depending on the stats of the user and/or the target. Additional effects include dealing more damage and generating additional strikes. \nThe most common kind of conditional ability is probably the speed ability. Some such as &lt;a href=\"Thrash%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Thrash (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt; have additional effects if the user is faster than the target, while others function only if the user is slower than the target. Others provide additional effects if they are used first in the round. Speed is already a strategic stat, with numerous abilities existing to increase the user's Speed or decrease the target's. Speed abilities make this difference more significant than ever, allowing the stat to easily determine the outcome of a match, and making abilities that affect it extremely useful.\nHealth abilities generate additional effects dependent on the pets' health levels. Some take effect when the user or target is below 25%, while others simply look at the relative health of the combatants. These can be extremely helpful for finishing opponents, or for use in even more strategic approaches.\nOther types of conditional abilities include status abilities, which dependent on status effects such as Bleeding and Stunned, and weather abilities, which require certain weather effects to provide their bonuses.\nType abilities.\nEach type of pet comes with a unique passive ability. These vary widely, with some active all the time, and others taking effect once per battle at specific times. As passive abilities, these do not need to be activated by the pet; they take place automatically.\nWhile each passive offers its own benefits, a few use more complex mechanics which it is worthwhile to clarify. \nMechanical pets' passive causes them to return to life once pet battle at 20% health. This resurrection takes place immediately after the pet's health reaches zero, and does not end the round; following the pet's resurrection any incomplete attacks or pending periodic effects will still take place, making it quite possible for a mechanical pet to be killed twice in one round. Similarly, any actions waiting to be taken by the pet will still be taken, in the usual order, following its resurrection.\nThe undead passive is a little different, returning the pet to life immortal for one round when killed. Like the mechanical passive, this takes place immediately after the pet's health reaches zero, and does not end the round. The description 'for one round' is a little unclear - the pet will in fact survive in its immortal form until the end of the round after the round in which it was killed, potentially granting two additional actions. Immortal pets cannot be killed by any normal means; however, once the effect expires the pet will die without any further attack. Prudent opponents may therefore wish to focus on healing, buffing or pet switching, or simply choose to hide somewhere for the duration of the undead's second life, since attacking it will do no good. Note that battles which end with the death of all involved pets are ruled as a draw, regardless of order of death, and do not reward XP.\nFor a full list of passive type abilities, see &lt;a href=\"%23Types\"&gt;Types&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiscellaneous abilities.\nWhile the majority of battle pet abilities fall under one or more of the above categories, the system features many unique abilities which offer some outlandish effects to their users. Whether trampling enemies with &lt;a href=\"Horn%20Attack\"&gt;Horn Attack&lt;/a&gt;, switching out with &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death%20%28pet%20battle%20ability%29\"&gt;Feign Death (pet battle ability)&lt;/a&gt;, or delaying death with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rebirth\"&gt;Dark Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;, there are many unusual abilities which are not easily categorised. When encountering new pets for the first time, expect the unexpected!\nRewards.\nAside from pet experience, pet battles can provide the winner with a range of rewards, including:\nPet battles completed as part of quests (see below) often offer additional rewards, including gold and items such as &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Spirit%20Pet%20Supplies\"&gt;Pandaren Spirit Pet Supplies&lt;/a&gt;.\nPet tamers.\n&lt;a href=\"Pet%20tamer\"&gt;Pet tamer&lt;/a&gt;s are NPCs that have their own pets that they use to battle with. Players will automatically get a quest to challenge the local pet tamer when one of their pets reach level 3. Quests to challenge higher level pet tamers are unlocked as they defeat previous pet tamers.\nQuests and scenarios.\nQuests.\nOnce a player visits a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pet%20Trainer\"&gt;Battle Pet Trainer&lt;/a&gt; and learns Pet Battle Training, they learn how to battle, level, heal and capture pets with a short questline.\nPlayers later receive a series of quests leading them to challenge powerful pet tamers on Azeroth and beyond, and at higher levels more unusual quests such as &lt;a href=\"Beasts%20of%20Fable\"&gt;Beasts of Fable&lt;/a&gt; become available. A number of repeatable daily quests also become available as reward for defeating each region's pet tamers.\nScenarios.\nThere are a handful of solo &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt;s (or pet battle dungeons) that require the player to complete a series of challenging pet battles. Each scenario has its own unique rewards, including battle pets and battle pet supplies.\nAchievements.\nA plethora of achievements exist for pet battling, divided into the sub-categories of Collect, Battle and Level. Many achievements offer rewards, including numerous battle pets, progressively stronger traps for capturing wild pets, and titles such as &lt;a href=\"Zookeeper\"&gt;Zookeeper&lt;/a&gt;. Achievements awarded for defeating each region's tamers act to unlock that region's corresponding pet battle daily quests.\nAddons.\nSeveral addons are available for the Pet Battle System, collected in a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/companions/battle-pets\"&gt;category&lt;/a&gt;.

A pet's family, which is generally based on its species, dictates what food it can eat; what abilities it will have; and what requirements, if any, a hunter needs to meet in order to tame it.\nIn ', there are 60 pet families. In ', there are 32 pet families. In \"\", there are 17 pet families.\nRestricted families.\nExotic families.\nCertain pet families, known as &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt;, can only be tamed and used by &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Mastery\"&gt;Beast Mastery&lt;/a&gt; hunters. These families are often composed of unusual species like &lt;a href=\"core%20hound\"&gt;core hound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"spirit%20beast\"&gt;spirit beast&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSkill families.\nA small number of families can be used by any hunter &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;, but the hunter must first know how to tame them. Generally this involves reading a tome to learn the required skill.\n&lt;a href=\"Mechanical\"&gt;Mechanical&lt;/a&gt;s are a special case among skill families; &lt;a href=\"gnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;gnomes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mechagnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt;, being &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;-oriented races, can tame them by default. Other playable races have the usual requirement of using an item to learn about the family.\nAlthough they are not standalone pet families, some specific species of pets belonging to otherwise normal families have similar requirements:\nAbilities.\nAll pets have access to the common abilities &lt;a href=\"Growl%20%28pet%20ability%29\"&gt;Growl (pet ability)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dash%20%28pet%20ability%29\"&gt;Dash (pet ability)&lt;/a&gt;; beyond that, a pet's abilities are decided by what family it belongs to.\nEvery pet family has two &lt;a href=\"pet%20specializations\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;-specific abilities and two family abilities. Some families are allowed additional abilities as well; see \"&lt;a href=\"%23Other%20abilities\"&gt;other abilities&lt;/a&gt;\" below for a general explanation on these extra abilities, or \"&lt;a href=\"%23List%20of%20families\"&gt;list of families&lt;/a&gt;\" for all families and what abilities they have.\nSpecialization.\nEach pet family has a specific &lt;a href=\"pet%20specializations\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;, which grants a passive ability and an active ability:\nPrior to \"\", pet specialization could be changed after taming, and it had a more profound effect on a pet's role in combat. Cunning pets, for example, did less damage than Ferocity pets but offered a variety of &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;-oriented abilities. Now, each specialization deals the same amount of damage, and the two spec-specific abilities are the only difference.\nFamily abilities.\nEach family has a damaging ability and a utility ability. The three damaging abilities\u2014&lt;a href=\"Bite\"&gt;Bite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claw%20%28pet%20ability%29\"&gt;Claw (pet ability)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Smack\"&gt;Smack&lt;/a&gt;\u2014are all functionally identical. The utility ability can fall into one of six types:\nOther abilities.\nCertain pet families have additional abilities beyond the \"default\" ability types listed above. These include:\nDiet.\nEach pet family has its own dietary preferences that dictate what it will eat when using &lt;a href=\"Feed%20Pet\"&gt;Feed Pet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Food\"&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt; items are divided into six types for this purpose: &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;. Certain families, such as &lt;a href=\"gruffhorn\"&gt;gruffhorn&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s, are able to eat a wide variety of food; others, such as &lt;a href=\"rodent\"&gt;rodent&lt;/a&gt;s, will only eat a single type. Several pet families are exclusive meat-eaters.\n&lt;a href=\"Mechanical\"&gt;Mechanical&lt;/a&gt; pets are an exception, as they eat \"mechanical bits\" instead of food. Mechanical bits are items like bolts, wiring, and other gizmo parts; many of them are created by &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; or sold by &lt;a href=\"engineering%20vendor\"&gt;engineering vendor&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Raw%20food%20types\"&gt;Raw food types&lt;/a&gt; were briefly introduced as sub-types of meat and fish that only a few families would eat, but they were phased out with \"\"."}

{"id": "55865", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55865", "title": "Pets in Raids", "text": "The following guide is a helpful tool for &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s who would like to use their pets in end-game raids.\nIntroduction.\nAll hunters should use their pets in a raid. A good pet, regardless of the hunter's talent build, will do at least 10% of the hunter's total DPS. Refusing to utilize this extra damage would be similar to giving up a 50 DPS weapon you can use in addition to your normal weapons. The only thing you have to do is feed the weapon, keep it healthy and happy, and know when to put it away.\nThe number one rule about using pets in raids is this - make sure you know what you're doing. Nothing is worse than having a pet in a situation it's not supposed to be in. Certain encounters require you to dismiss your pet, others require you to set them aside. There are pathing issues, facing problems, and other such things you need to keep track of if you're going to use your little friend in these instances.\nSecond - okay it with your guild. Most guilds will allow a hunter to bring pets with them, but mostly as a buff. &lt;a href=\"Furious%20Howl\"&gt;Furious Howl&lt;/a&gt; is a good buff, and having your wolf cast it is a good way to raise DPS. If, however, you want to actually utilize your pets, that's where guilds start to get a little iffy. Hunters have a bad reputation with pets. Pathing issues aside, pets have received a (false) reputation of not dealing enough damage or not surviving long enough to be of any use.\nThird - bring food. Your pet \"will\" die. This is a fact of life, and you've got to be ready for it. Bring enough food for an entire raid. If you have a meat-eating pet, then you're going to have to bring a lot of meat. Those pets that eat bread are definitely an asset, because your mage makes free food for them. I usually bring one stack of meat on a raid, and my pet eats through it quickly. Keeping a happy pet is worth a few gold.\nSkills and training.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Pet_%28Hunter%29%23Training_your_pet\"&gt;Training your pet&lt;/a&gt; for further clarification on training pets and skill points.\nIn end game, the most useful skills your pet can be trained are the resistances. This helps them survive the most damaging aspects of the raid environment. Each 120 point resistance training costs 90 Training Points. If you wanted, you could train your pet with up to three Resistances, but this would leave you with 30 points for 1 ability. On some pets (raptors, for example) this is not that big of a deal since they get no special abilities aside from &lt;a href=\"Bite\"&gt;Bite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claw%20%28pet%20ability%29\"&gt;Claw (pet ability)&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of a raptor, training three resistances and claw is the best thing to do.\nEach different instance requires different resistances, as is well known. Fire resistance is good in &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, Shadow resistance is good in Blackwing Lair and &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, Nature resistance is good in &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; and Naxxramas, and Frost resistance is good in Naxxramas. If your guild has Molten Core and Blackwing Lair on farm status, then it would be a good idea to retrain your pet in Nature and Shadow resistance.\nThe other abilities a pet gets are useful as well. Pets with &lt;a href=\"Dash\"&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dive\"&gt;Dive&lt;/a&gt; can get into and out of battle quickly. Bite and Claw increase damage, claw is better DPS, but bite deals more damage. All pets should have &lt;a href=\"Growl\"&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt;, but turn it off for raids.\nPet family abilities.\nPet family abilities are useful in end game as well. Saving training points for these is a very good idea. The highest rank of these abilities costs 25 training points.\nFurious Howl.\nThe most useful ability is Furious Howl. Only &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; can train this ability. Every 10 seconds, party members within 15 yards of the wolf get an increased damage on their next attack. At rank 4, this ability increases damage by 45-57 points. Wolves with Furious Howl are most often just sat next to the Hunter, the ability cast every 10 seconds, but if a Hunter with this ability is put in a group with &lt;a href=\"Rogues\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Warriors\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, it would be better to send the wolf into battle with their target.\nFurious Howl rank 4 can be learned from the &lt;a href=\"Bloodaxe%20Worg\"&gt;Bloodaxe Worg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nScreech.\n&lt;a href=\"Screech%20%28pet%20ability%29\"&gt;Screech (pet ability)&lt;/a&gt; is also a useful ability. This is available to &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vulture\"&gt;carrion birds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;s. Screech is an AoE debuff that deals minor damage and lowers attack power of enemies by a certain amount. At rank 4, it decreases the attack power by 100 points. This debuff is overwritten by most other debuffs, however, so it's rare that it sticks too long. In the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the debuff limit will be increased, so Screech will be more useful.\nScreech rank 4 can be learned from the &lt;a href=\"Monstrous%20Plaguebat\"&gt;Monstrous Plaguebat&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20Screecher\"&gt;Winterspring Screecher&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharge.\n&lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; is an ability available to &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s. It stuns the target for 1 second and increases boar's melee attack power for the next attack. At rank 6, this increase is 550 attack power. \nCharge rank 6 can be learned from &lt;a href=\"Plagued%20Swine\"&gt;Plagued Swine&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern Plaguelands.\nLightning Breath.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Breath\"&gt;Lightning Breath&lt;/a&gt; is an ability for &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Serpent\"&gt;wind serpents&lt;/a&gt;. This is a high-focus cost ability that deals nature damage from 20 yards away. At rank 6, it deals 99-113 damage. Note: When training Wind Serpents, be aware that those with mana bars in the wild will have higher spirit and intellect when trained. These stats are not advantageous, because hunter pets do not use mana and thus have no need for intellect or spirit.\nLightning Breath rank 6 can be learned from the &lt;a href=\"Son%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Son of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible, and quite easy, to solo tame this pet.\nProwl.\n&lt;a href=\"Prowl\"&gt;Prowl&lt;/a&gt; is an ability available to &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s. It puts the cat into stealth mode, and reduces their speed. The first attack out of stealth has an increased damage. At rank 3, it deals 50% extra damage immediately out of stealth.\nProwl rank 3 can be learned from the &lt;a href=\"Frostsaber%20Stalker\"&gt;Frostsaber Stalker&lt;/a&gt; in Winterspring or the &lt;a href=\"Jaguero%20Stalker\"&gt;Jaguero Stalker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. \nScorpid Poison.\n&lt;a href=\"Scorpid%20Poison\"&gt;Scorpid Poison&lt;/a&gt; is an ability available to &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt;s. This ability deals nature damage over time, and can stack up to five times on the same target. At rank 4, it deals 40 damage over 10 seconds, or 20 damage per one second when stacked up to 5 times.\nScorpid Poison rank 4 can be learned from the &lt;a href=\"Firetail%20Scorpid\"&gt;Firetail Scorpid&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Stonelash%20Pincer\"&gt;Stonelash Pincer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stonelash%20Flayer\"&gt;Stonelash Flayer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nShell Shield.\n&lt;a href=\"Shell%20Shield\"&gt;Shell Shield&lt;/a&gt; is an ability available to &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s. This ability reduces the damage dealt to these pets by 50%, but increases the time between attacks by 43%. There is only 1 rank of this ability, and it lasts 12 seconds on a 3 minute cooldown.\nShell Shield rank 1 can be learned from &lt;a href=\"Aku%27mai%20Fisher\"&gt;Aku'mai Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aku%27mai%20Snapjaw\"&gt;Aku'mai Snapjaw&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Ghamoo-Ra\"&gt;Ghamoo-Ra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Surf%20Glider\"&gt;Giant Surf Glider&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kresh\"&gt;Kresh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Snapjaw\"&gt;Snapjaw&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;.\nThunderstomp.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunderstomp\"&gt;Thunderstomp&lt;/a&gt; is an ability available to &lt;a href=\"gorilla\"&gt;gorilla&lt;/a&gt;s. This ability deals AoE nature damage to targets within 8 yards. It's got a high focus cost, and a 1 minute cooldown. Rank 3 deals 115 to 133 damage to all targets.\nThunderstomp rank 3 can be learned from &lt;a href=\"U%27cha\"&gt;U'cha&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Un%27goro%20Thunderer\"&gt;Un'goro Thunderer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing Your Pet in Raids.\nNow that you know what abilities and resistances you need for the instances, the next thing to know is how exactly to use these companions in a situation which tends to be difficult for them to survive. Unlike players, they are not high on the healing list. They also cannot use consumables when they are in trouble. Their survival rests on you as a controller.\nYou have to know a few things about what it is you are fighting. Certain encounters it is bad to have a pet (&lt;a href=\"Skeram\"&gt;Skeram&lt;/a&gt;), others the pet will die too quickly for them to be of any use (&lt;a href=\"Sartura\"&gt;Sartura&lt;/a&gt;). When your pet can be used, there are a few simple things to remember.\nIf you remember these tips, your pet will be a great addition to any end-game raid."}

Usually it is a teasing oversimplification of what DPSers are expected to do in a group: hit things quickly and repeatedly. It is also referenced in the expression \"less &lt;a href=\"QQ\"&gt;QQ&lt;/a&gt;, more pewpew\", admonishing players to stop delaying play with discussion about nerfs, &lt;a href=\"damage%20meter\"&gt;damage meter&lt;/a&gt;s, or general arguing and simply just try harder at the task at hand.\nMore pejoratively, it is used by &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s who argue not only is \"every\" class is able to DPS &lt;a href=\"off%20spec\"&gt;to some degree&lt;/a&gt;, but some classes do it \"exclusively\" regardless of spec or the potential for alternate roles, making them ubiquitous, replaceable, and disposable in groups. This contrasts with the danger an underperforming tank or healer creates for the entire party. Thusly, such players are only interested in the damage ultimately performed by DPSers rather than the associated &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"twink\"&gt;twink&lt;/a&gt; minutiae."}

Slay silithid at these hives and take from them a fragment of their carapace. When you can carry no more, return to me and I shall strengthen your resolve.\nProgress.\nThere is much history rooted in their distrust of the mortal races; but alas, such is a tale better left for the &lt;a href=\"Brood%20of%20Nozdormu\"&gt;Brood&lt;/a&gt; to tell when the time is right.\nCompletion.\nYou are not alone, hero.

That player will thus be able to loot carapace fragments too.

Each boss will drop between one and three of his particular tokens, with a chance for a rare item as well. Each boss's loot table is small and entirely unique; these rare items are available only from them.\nThere are tablets on the walls describing each boss; one of these tablets will indicate which boss will spawn by commenting that he is \"close to the edge of madness.\" The particular boss which spawns is chosen according to a spawn calendar, going by the day the instance ID was created. This is somewhat convenient when multiple players are trying to create their trinkets; however, since a player needs all four tokens to create his trinket, this also means that it will take at least a month and a half to acquire the needed parts ... assuming, of course, that there is minimal competition for these tokens.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.hogit.org/eom/\"&gt;Edge of Madness Spawn Calendar&lt;/a&gt;\nTrash mobs: the Imps\nImps do heavy amounts of damage. Plus, when you kill them they open a portal and 2 elite &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s with a damage aura will come out. So you need to kill one imp at a time. They are demons so you will be able to &lt;a href=\"banish\"&gt;banish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Enslave%20Demon\"&gt;enslave&lt;/a&gt; them. At least two warlocks are recommended, although you can get by with less if your raid follows directions well and can stop dps on &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s and wait for voidwalkers to spawn and be killed. The mad Voidwalkers that are summoned after the Imps are killed are not banishable.\nAnother trick is to use enslave on the imps. Their physical attacks are slowed when using this spell, but their ranged fire attack can be spammed, resulting in a high DPS output. Used correctly, they can even help to bring down the harder bosses in ZG."}

A disagreement with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; led VanCleef to found the criminal organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. VanCleef was considered one of the greatest threats to the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; until he was killed by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nHistory.\nThe reconstruction of Stormwind.\n&lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; was a childhood friend of Edwin, and personally trained him as a rogue. Edwin also knew &lt;a href=\"Baros%20Alexston\"&gt;Baros Alexston&lt;/a&gt;, who saw him as a peerless fighter, an idealist, and a romantic.\nEdwin VanCleef was the elected Guildmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt;. He was originally one of the architects that worked on the rebuilding of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; after its destruction at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. He also led the construction of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which was commissioned to keep watch over the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. After the city's reconstruction was finished, the House of Nobles refused to adequately pay and offered only meager compensation, while the Stonemasons continued to demand extravagant sums. Both sides were under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. notes that the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;nobles of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. The massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy and stripped Edwin VanCleef and his Stonemasons of their promised rewards. Edwin spoke out, demanding restitution for their works. In response, the Stormwind House of Nobles ordered the Stonemasons' Guild disbanded, which angered VanCleef.\nVanCleef and the Stonemasons set to rioting in the streets of Stormwind. The riot was dangerous and chaotic and in the confusion, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s young queen, &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin&lt;/a&gt;, was brutally murdered. Varian vowed to punish those responsible and dealt with the rioters more severely. The Stonemasons, fleeing the city, hid in the rural areas of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; to escape prosecution. Knowing Varian's anger would never fade, many were forced to remain in hiding. Edwin VanCleef fled Stormwind with the Stonemasons, united them, used his training in the arts of stealth and subterfuge to form the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the riots, VanCleef's lieutenant and most trusted assistant, &lt;a href=\"Bazil%20Thredd\"&gt;Bazil Thredd&lt;/a&gt;, was captured and placed in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter he led the remnants of the Stonemasons out of Stormwind, he took advantage of the relatively unprotected state of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and used his considerable manpower to run many of the farmers off, and take over the handful of &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;s. Taking advantage of the resources at his disposal, VanCleef hatched a plan of retribution against the government of Stormwind.\nFrom aboard the ship located deep within the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, VanCleef awaited the moment at which he would strike at his hated foe. Before this could take place, however, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance, having previously learned of the headquarters of the Defias Brotherhood, entered the Deadmines and assaulted VanCleef's ship. After a battle, they managed to defeat VanCleef. The adventurers took an &lt;a href=\"An%20Unsent%20Letter\"&gt;unsent letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Baros Alexston on his body and severed his head for &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;, who said that this event marked the end of the Defias Brotherhood. Yet they were left with the disconcerting worry that not all matters with the Brotherhood were yet resolved, subsequent events would prove that despite VanCleef's death, the plans of the Defias Brotherhood were underway. Conspirators with in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; were plotting against the king and were disposed of by agents. VanCleef's death and his machinations were later informed to King &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; Wrynn who thanked the adventurers in their part in foiling the kingpin's schemes. Many with in the Alliance thought that the Defias was broken. Later on, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the Defias had been active in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and had played a part in King Varian's kidnapping.\nCataclysm.\nWhile Edwin VanCleef is dead, the Defias Brotherhood did not die with him. His daughter &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa&lt;/a&gt;, hiding under an alias, has arisen to become the new leader of the Defias Brotherhood. She has unleashed a plot to bring down Stormwind after witnessing the assassination of her father some five years before.\nQuests.\nHe was involved in the following quests:\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nEdwin VanCleef was one of the greatest human engineers in history, the unquestioned leader of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; Small and wiry, the man has a mousy look about him. He wears the sweaty, oil-stained clothes typical of a peasant laborer, along with a short cloak and thick leather gloves. The man\u2019s overall appearance is so common, in fact, that he would be almost instantly forgettable if not for the spotless, scarlet bandana fastened around his neck. Despite his unseemly appearance, he has a cunning look in his eyes and a partially concealed blade sheathed underneath one arm. His face is now wasted and hollow; he is no longer the noble figure he once was, but is obviously corrupt. Edwin VanCleef relies on his unassuming appearance to avoid most fights. When engaging in battle, he always prefers to take the offensive; he is known to frequently retreat from combat only to circle around and strike a few minutes later when his enemies have lowered their guard. VanCleef uses his longbow to surprise enemies from a great distance away, then draws his rapier and sneaks to a second hiding spot. When his enemies approach, investigating the location from which the arrows originated, he springs forth and attempts a sneak attack. He prefers to strike at lightly armored targets first in the hope that he might be able to incapacitate or kill them outright with a single sneak attack. He is classified as &lt;a href=\"Expert\"&gt;Expert&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and Stormwind.\nEdwin VanCleef was once a \"roofwalker\" in Stormwind with a speciality in defeating mechanical defenses. Yet, when the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the city, he was called upon because of the skills he learned as a child at the side of his father, a master stonemason, and was one of the first to offer his talents to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reconstruction of Stormwind was an arduous task, but with such a genius as VanCleef masterminding the operation, the project was completed smoothly and in less than ten years.\nAfter the reconstruction, however, the nobles paid the Stonemasons much less than they expected. Some of the more senior of the Stonemasons, including VanCleef, were offered governmental jobs if they\u2019d just be quiet and play along. However, Edwin VanCleef was not willing to betray his workmen. He spat on the floor and walked out of the halls he'd built, vowing that he'd make the city pay one way or another. Shortly afterward, at VanCleef's urging, workers rioted in Stormwind City. Several people died, and VanCleef with other artisans were the first to be cast out of the city gates.\nVanCleef took the group of artisans and tinkers sitting in the mud outside the gates of Stormwind and turned them into the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Brotherhood begins.\nAfter teaching the Stonemasons the skills he learned from the city's thieves, he helped them adapt to the wild until they had perfected their ability to ambush travelers. When the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt; began to respond, VanCleef and the tinkers in their group augmented the abilities of the renegades with mechanical devices and weapons.\nVanCleef then turned to more ruthless tactics: Merchants who brought goods to Stormwind were robbed, farmsteads that provided Stormwind with food were razed, or infested with harvest golems. As VanCleef strangled Stormwind, stone by stone, he used the money he stole to pay for bands of mercenaries. Some of his men were captured, but VanCleef played even that to his advantage; inside the Stockade of Stormwind City, his men gathered a force for rebellion. Stormwind and its loyal townships found themselves under an unexpected siege, and thanks to sinister machinations of others, the towns' cries for help went unheard.\nVanCleef's search for a secure location where he could build a tinker's works led him across Westfall to the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;. Once his laboratory was constructed, he entered the mines. The brotherhood hired bandits and captured the goblins of Westfall at Edwin's command. Mercenaries, brigands, criminals, soldiers, outlaws and rebels also joined the brotherhood, and buoyed by his success, VanCleef christened his gang &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. And so, the Defias Brotherhood was created, founded as an instrument of revenge.\nVanCleef and the other commanders prefer its members to master a wider variety of skills than those of a pure soldier. Later on, the Defias Brotherhood, led by Edwin VanCleef, attempted to take Elwynn Forest but failed.\nAfter the Third War.\nHe rarely left the Deadmines in more than two decades, yet he knew of everything happening across central Azeroth, particularly where the Brotherhood was involved. Rumors said that in the more recent years he had grown particularly zealous in his belief in technology's means to defeat Stormwind.\nBeneath the famed Deadmines of Westfall, located beneath the former &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;, VanCleef commissioned the reconstruction of a huge war machine, an ogre &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

VanCleef initially had two level 19 - 20 &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Blackguard\"&gt;Defias Blackguard&lt;/a&gt;s. When VanCleef's health dropped below 50%, two additional level 19 - 20 blackguards would spawn. Some people said that ignoring the adds and just attacking VanCleef was the best tactic to kill him. Another method that worked was standing on the cannon to the left, just before you would step into the area Captain Greenskin patrolled. Then you'd get a mage on the cannon, and get a tank to draw VC and his adds out after killing Greenskin. You'd then draw them to the cannon, and get the mage to use some ranged attacks (a wand preferably) to distract the adds. The adds would *evade* the ranged attacks, but remain incapacitated until you'd stop. After killing VC, you could move onto the other mobs, one at a time."}

{"id": "31562", "revid": "452956", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=31562", "title": "Efficiency", "text": "Efficiency is defined as \"the ratio of the effective or useful output to the total input in any system\" or, more colloquially, as \"getting the most bang for your buck\". In \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", nearly every viable strategy is based on some kind of efficiency, generally minimizing or maximizing some value or concept. This makes efficiency complicated as a topic, however, because any given process can be optimized more than one way. What is efficient in one sense may not be efficient in another.\nThere are many ways to be efficient in World of Warcraft; however when most people mention \"efficiency\", usually they mean efficiency in one of the following (related) ways:\nOther effects, such as maximizing the &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20second\"&gt;damage you do per second&lt;/a&gt;, while technically a form of efficiency, tend to be referred to as \"maximizing\" or \"optimizing\".\nMinimizing downtime.\nDowntime is thought to be the enemy of &lt;a href=\"grinding\"&gt;grinding&lt;/a&gt;. The less you have to travel or stop to eat or drink, the more you can focus on getting &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. Minimizing downtime is usually equivalent to maximizing XP per second (or, more realistically, XP per minute). Some general tips on this:\nMana efficiency when healing.\nA subset of mana efficiency is healing efficiency, and this is arguably the area where efficiency is the most important. If a healer is not mana efficient, he or she is likely to run out of mana before the fight is over and be unable to continue healing, likely resulting is player deaths and potentially &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt;s. With the large number of healing spells, &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s that manipulate the math involved, it can be difficult to determine which heals are the most efficient. Further, there are multiple ways in which healing can be thought of as efficient. The two that tend to matter most are \"hit points healed per point of mana\" (HPM) and \"hit points healed per second\" (HPS).\nGenerally speaking, slower healing effects tend to cost less mana per point healed while faster spells such as &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;Flash Heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Lesser Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt; are less efficient, though this is not always the case (&lt;a href=\"Flash%20of%20Light\"&gt;Flash of Light&lt;/a&gt; being a notable exception). &lt;a href=\"Spell%20power\"&gt;Spell power&lt;/a&gt; from gear serves to make things even more complicated, as some spells scale better than others with spell powers. For example, the druid spell &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; is relatively weak without any spell power, but scales to become one of the most mana efficient single-target healing spells in the game as spell power increases. As a general rule, however, spells which heal a lot per second (high HPS) will have fairly poor mana efficiency (low HPM) and vice versa.\nFortunately, there are web sites that allow you to play with all of these values. Having a rough idea of the relative HPM and HPS of your healing spells is vital to doing a good job as a healer, as frequent use of low-HPM spells in the wrong situations will drain your mana, while using low-HPS spells in emergencies will lead to deaths. Many times, the differences between different healing spells can be summed up in terms of HPM and HPS.\nMana efficiency when dealing damage.\nDetermining the method that delivers the most damage per point of mana spent depends highly on class. Gear and talents also matter a great deal. The formulas used in determining damage are varied, and can be manipulated in many ways."}

After Alodi became involved with &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, his new duties to the secret Council strained their relationship. She grew distressed when her mother, her land, and her people were being plagued by the demon &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; and caused her father's death. Having to leave Dalaran to look after the family lands and estate as the only heir, she urged Alodi to leave with her and get married, but he explained that he couldn't because of his duties. Becoming highly upset, she broke off their engagement to his sadness.\nThe next time she saw Alodi was when he flying a &lt;a href=\"phoenix\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt; to Brightwater Lake, while she was caring for her ailing mother at her bedside. At first she thought he had come for her and called out to him, but then realized he was there to confront Kathra'natir. She witnessed Alodi vanquish the demon, and was overjoyed to have her mother's health greatly improve because of it. Through this experience, she came to realize that Alodi's staying in Dalaran and his role as &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; had helped her and all her people much greater than if he left it behind and married her, and by extension, how he could help the world as Guardian. She made her peace with the end of their relationship, understanding that Alodi being Guardian was more important and thus wished him well in her heart."}

He is a veteran of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s. After an encounter with &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, the two warriors came to respect each other and later became friends despite the animosity between their two races.\nEitrigg served the Horde as an advisor to the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. His wise counsel was considered valuable by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, but disregarded by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. He also joined Tirion in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; as a commander of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; division. After the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg served to keep the orcs strong, and by the time of , he became the chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe First and Second Wars.\nBorn into the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg is an aging but still powerful &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; warrior who was in his late fifties by the time of the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, 5 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, he named Eitrigg, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; as his lieutenants, and they helped oversee the Blackrock war machine as it prepared for the war with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Blackhand was killed and replaced as Warchief by Orgrim, Eitrigg continued to act as one of the new Warchief's most trusted lieutenants. 4 years after the Dark Portal, Orgrim managed to capture the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; assassin &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; and tortured her until she revealed the whereabouts of the Shadow Council. Garona swore fealty to the Horde, prompting Orgrim to spare her life and charge Eitrigg to act as her handler. Garona continued to live under Eitrigg's watchful eye throughout the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. She initially viewed the Blackrock warrior as just another mindless, fanatical follower of Blackhand, but over time she began to see a fading glimmer of pride and honor in him. Garona believed she could win Eitrigg's trust and told him everything she knew about &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the Shadow Council, as well as her knowledge of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and the Horde's true purpose. However, Eitrigg distrusted the assassin and treated her words as poisonous lies. Garona abandoned any hope of helping him see the truth and instead bided her time until an opportunity to escape presented itself. During the chaotic battles in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, she managed to slip into the forests and vanish. Eitrigg considered hunting her down, but waging war on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was more important than recovering a single prisoner, and some part of him sympathized with Garona's tortured past. As long as she did not turn her blades against the Horde, he would let her go, and perhaps she would be able to find a true home.\nAfter the Horde was defeated by the Alliance at the end of the war, many orcs scattered into the wilderness. One of the solitary survivors was Eitrigg, who dwelled on everything Garona had told him. He began to believe the half-orc's words, and his unquestioning loyalty to the Horde faded. With shame and anger in his heart, Eitrigg disavowed the Horde and struck out north in search of a place to spend the rest of his days and die in peace.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nEitrigg was discovered years later living in the ruins of an abandoned &lt;a href=\"watch%20tower\"&gt;watch tower&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. At first regarding each other as nothing but enemies, the two began to fight one another. Their fight caused the tower to collapse, and Eitrigg ended up saving the unconscious Tirion's life by pulling him out of the ruins. From that point forward, Tirion felt he owed a debt of honor to the orc.\nHowever, this was not enough to prevent Eitrigg from being captured. It is certain that the orc would have been put to death in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, but thanks to the timely intervention of Tirion and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he was saved. He regarded Tirion as his &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; brother after suffering such losses to save him.\nAfter meeting &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg found that his people had rediscovered their &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic roots, and returned to life among his own kind. Before he left with his people, Eitrigg proclaimed that Tirion and he were brothers, bound by blood and honor.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nEitrigg served the Horde as an advisor and supporter to Thrall, and can be found in Thrall's &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. He also served as Warchief's Honor Guard. Thrall also tasked him to oversee new recruits of the Horde.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nHe announced a human spy that told Thrall about the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; landing on Azeroth and joining the Alliance. Later, he was present when Thrall learned about the uncorrupted orcs, the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall commanded him to send ambassadors to Hellscream.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"To%20Thrall%2C%20Warchief%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; was carried to Warchief Thrall by a Horde &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, sent Tirion Fordring - now the Highlord of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; - who made a postscript sending his regards to Eitrigg and requesting that Thrall send him to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, as he needed a good orc at his side.\nThe Warchief appeared to have approved this request as Eitrigg could be found at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Stand\"&gt;Argent Stand&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade outpost in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, he became friends with &lt;a href=\"Metz\"&gt;Metz&lt;/a&gt;, as the surly human paladin even called him brother.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"Korfax\"&gt;Korfax&lt;/a&gt;, Metz, &lt;a href=\"Rimblat%20Earthshatter\"&gt;Rimblat Earthshatter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rayne\"&gt;Rayne&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg asked to perform a set of physical and magical tests on the &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;, in order to see why this ore was so important to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Faced with the disastrous consequences of the experience, Eitrigg announced that this would get them nowhere and that they would take the cursed ore to &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; for further study, in order to uncover its secrets.\nThe Shattering.\nEitrigg returned from Northrend and was present at a celebration for &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his warriors' return from Northrend. After an attack on night elves, Eitrigg accompanied Thrall to Dustwallow Marsh, where Thrall had a secret meeting with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. When the meeting was over, Eitrigg discussed with Thrall about the current situation of elements, and Thrall decided to leave Azeroth and venture to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, where he would speak with the Furies. Before leaving, Thrall appointed Garrosh as a leader of the Horde and tasked Eitrigg and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; to be Garrosh's advisers. Garrosh had Orgrimmar rebuilt with an architecture similar to that of the old ways of the Horde, which Eitrigg disliked.\nAfter another attack in Ashenvale occurred, Cairne challenged Garrosh into a ritual &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, but to the death. &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; poisoned Garrosh's weapon, &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, instead of blessing it in order to have Cairne killed easily. Eitrigg and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; noticed how Cairne felt and Eitrigg realized the deception and informed Garrosh. While Garrosh was reeling from being played a fool, Eitrigg wasted no time in informing him that while he and his loyalists partied over his falsely earned victory Magatha performed a coup and now controlled &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged at being used and his honor forced into question Garrosh pleaded with Eitrigg to believe that he knew nothing of Magatha's actions. Tough informing Garrosh that he believed him, he also said that the others wouldn't be so understanding as him.\nCataclysm.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension to the position of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall told Garrosh to use Eitrigg as well as &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; to advise him in leading the Horde while Thrall himself traveled to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; to speak with the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;furies&lt;/a&gt; about the strange symptoms experienced by &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Although cautious of the new Warchief Hellscream's motives and actions, Eitrigg tried to advise the warchief and guide him away from repeating the mistakes of the past.\nEitrigg later learned about the Alliance's plans to invade &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and wanted to ask the Warchief about sending reinforcements.\nEitrigg was later seen in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; with his son &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt; and worked with &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to stop his former clan, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orcs, from invading the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. While the Blackrock &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlock%20Xi%27lun\"&gt;High Warlock Xi'lun&lt;/a&gt; was successful in summoning a &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg's efforts caused the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; to run amok and wipe out most of the Blackrock forces.\nTides of War.\nEitrigg was present during the meeting of the Horde leaders, where Garrosh's plan to conquer &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was explained. Eitrigg was against the plan and even &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; supported him. The orc &lt;a href=\"Margolag\"&gt;Margolag&lt;/a&gt; accompanied the Horde army and was said to be Eitrigg's representative. After Theramore was destroyed, Eitrigg wrote a letter explaining all that had happened and sent an orc courier to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; to inform Thrall.\nEscalation.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall told Vol'jin that he was going to Orgrimmar to find several orcs, Eitrigg included, who opposed Garrosh.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nEitrigg, after discovering Garrosh's new &lt;a href=\"The%20Underhold\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; below Orgrimmar and his corruption by &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, sides with the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces to end Garrosh's reign. Discovered in a badly wounded state inside &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Dark%20Shaman\"&gt;Kor'kron Dark Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, he reveals to the attackers the true scale of Garrosh's lust for power. Despite his wounds, Eitrigg survived the siege.\nWar Crimes.\nEitrigg accompanied Go'el and &lt;a href=\"Varok\"&gt;Varok&lt;/a&gt; to the trial of Garrosh Hellscream. &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; suggested him to be Garrosh's defender, but Eitrigg declined, remarking that he would have his chance to speak should he desire so. Ultimately, Baine was chosen to defend Garrosh, which Eitrigg supported.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg appears on the pier at &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; and directs &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to see &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;. He is later present when &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; names &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Vol'jin's funeral ceremony, the latter of which he then helps defend against the attacking &lt;a href=\"Felblade%20Assassin\"&gt;Felblade Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEitrigg greeted the Horde warriors and told them that there was an urgent matter concerning Varok Saurfang. They accepted and the orc would find Thrall to see if he could provide assistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Danica%20the%20Reclaimer\"&gt;Danica the Reclaimer&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde Battlelord&lt;/a&gt; that Eitrigg was being held captive on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Felrage\"&gt;Felrage&lt;/a&gt; naga and needed to be rescued as soon as possible. Upon arrival, the orc was glad to have been found and released from the cage. Several squads were taken by the naga and needed to be rescued before they were sold to slavery or for worse, as well as dealing with &lt;a href=\"Felbeard\"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kaz%27jatar\"&gt;lieutenants&lt;/a&gt;. He then went to &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt; and awaited the Battlelord's return. Eitrigg eventually became a champion of the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, and later provided the Battlelord with supplies in the Trial of Rage to obtain their class mount.\nEitrigg attended a dinner with the Horde leaders after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Soon later, he arrived to the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; with the other leaders.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg carried &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar, the Warbreaker&lt;/a&gt; if the player was not a warrior, representing the Valarjar.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nEitrigg is aboard \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;The Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. He aids &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; in establishing the Horde's base in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, and in the process reveals that he is afraid of &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es.\nHe is one of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; commanders during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg traveled to the to recruit the that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; saved from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. With the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde champion&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg was able to establish a connection between Azeroth and Draenor through the use of the shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; in his possession. However, upon arriving to Draenor, the two Horde agents were taken prisoner on suspicion of being &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; spies. While being interrogated by &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; they are approached by who recognized the two as coming from Azeroth. After hearing Eitrigg's request for aid, Geya'rah would object on the grounds that the Mag'har couldn't pledge soldiers to aid the Horde when they faced enemies of their own. Believing that having a common foe would calm Geya'rah's wariness, Warchief Hellscream requested that the two Horde emissaries assisted Geya'rah in putting down an ogre uprising led by &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%2C%20Greatson%20of%20Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt;. After slaying the traitorous ogre, Geya'rah would inform Eitrigg and the Horde champion about the threat of the Lightbound.\nEitrigg would subsequently aid the Mag'har when the Lightbound attacked &lt;a href=\"Beastwatch\"&gt;Beastwatch&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning that the entire Lightbound army was en route to Beastwatch, Eitrigg held the line against them while the Mag'har were gathered by . During the battle, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;High Exarch Yrel&lt;/a&gt; herself appeared on the battlefield and offered the Mag'har one last chance to embrace the light. As Warchief Hellscream and Lantresor charged against the Lightbound, Eitrigg activated the shard of the Vision of Time in his possession in order to return to Azeroth. With Mag'har now on Azeroth, Eitrigg led their new leader Overlord Geya'rah to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; where she subsequently pledged the Mag'har's loyalty to the Horde.\nEitrigg was present in &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s coronation.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from Horde captivity, Eitrigg recalled Tirion's sacrifice to save him in the name of honor and did not agree with Sylvanas's decision to punish Baine.\nRevolution.\nEitrigg was amongst the Horde heroes to answer &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s call to arms and joined his revolution. However, while the other revolutionaries journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg went back to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to Eitrigg, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Lenara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lenara&lt;/a&gt; had spied on the Saurfang's secret meeting and reported it to Sylvanas. Thus knowing that Eitrigg had sided with Saurfang, Sylvanas ordered for &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; to capture him and bring him to &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;. When confronted about meeting Saurfang in secret, Eitrigg openly admitted to it while remarking that he grew tired of the deceit. Believing that Sylvanas is driven by something dark, Eitrigg vowed to draw blood for her no longer. He then revealed his intention to join Saurfang's army outside of Orgrimmar and asked the loyalists to stand with him. Should the loyalists agree, then they both exit Orgrimmar together and join the revolution, however, should the loyalists refuse, Eitrigg declared that their choices have been made.\nDeclaring that there is a difference between loyalty and blind obedience. Eitrigg vowed that he was done following the Banshee's orders. Despite his strength, Eitrigg lost the fight to the loyalists, was captured, and delivered to Nathanos. During the conflict between loyalists and revolutionaries, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. Eitrigg was subsequently freed after Sylvanas's and Nathanos's departure and attended Saurfang's funeral.\nWithin Grommash Hold, Eitrigg told loyalists that he would not hold the choice they made against them as they each did what they thought was right. He implored them to leave it in the past and focus on reuniting the Horde. Meanwhile, he informed Saurfang's revolutionaries that honor had saved the lives of thousands and saved his own life more than once. He admitted that while he couldn't live with the shame of the terrible deeds he committed under &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s command, Saurfang helped other orcs most past their guilt and strive for lost honor. Eitrigg declared Saurfang a fearsome warrior but what made him a hero was giving the Horde hope when it needed it most.\nDragonflight.\nSeeking to bring back the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg recruited orc champions who found themselves having to prove themselves before the assembled clans. He accompanied &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rehze\"&gt;Rehze&lt;/a&gt; alongside an orcish champion to the lands of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;. There, they consulted with the aged farseer, &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, who gave his blessing to the ceremony. Unable to make the trip to Kalimdor himself; Drek'Thar anointed Aggralan as the new farseer of the Frostwolves.\nHeading back to Kalimdor, the first festival was decided to be held in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. There, Eitrigg gathered alongside the other leaders of the orcish people, where it was revealed that he took leadership of his clan, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrocks&lt;/a&gt;. He met with other members of his clan, such as &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt;, and his son, &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed that he had found peace for the first time in many years, now that the orc people were reunited.\nWhen the clan leaders gathered inside of the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Barracks\"&gt;Razor Hill Barracks&lt;/a&gt; to pitch their clan to prospective orcish recruits; Eitrigg highlighted the role that the Blackrock have played in the Horde. He emphasized the importance of their honorable warriors, as well as their blacksmiths, as key tenants of the clan. Upon the champion requesting to join the Blackrock, Eitrigg declared that they had honored him. He subsequently instructed them with hunting tracking and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Eitrigg accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of his clan.\nAfter the Kosh'harg was brought to a close, Eitrigg declared that a new age had dawned on the orcs and presented the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Heritage of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to orc champions, while declaring them the champion of their people.\nMemorable quotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLegion.\nGossip.\nNow is not the time, &lt;name&gt;.\n\"Note: this dialogue was datamined but never seen in-game\"\nThrom-Ka, Highlord &lt;name&gt;.

If so, it may also indicate that the description from \"Of Blood and Honor\" is correct as well, since the \"fellow orcs\" could refer to the rivaling chieftains.\nThe \"s\" list Ariok as Eitrigg's only son and the two deceased ones are not mentioned at all."}

It can be entered through &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Spire\"&gt;Sulfuron Spire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. It is a domain of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;, from where he endlessly sends his elemental and mortal minions in order to fulfill his ultimate goal of destroying &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe raid consists of 8 bosses (one only accessible through the legendary quest chain), as well as outdoor and indoor environments. It is intended to be one grade in difficulty above raids implemented at the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", just as &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; was in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe ash-choked Firelands is the least hospitable of the elemental domains. What serves as air in this harsh place is laden with scalding, noxious fumes. The only safe havens from the Firelands' ever-churning magma ocean are islands of jagged rock. Yet even the dangers of this merciless landscape pale in comparison to the raging fury of the elementals who dwell there.\nDescription from the preview.\n\"For ages, the &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt; Plane served its purpose as a secure realm to imprison &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s primordial spirits... until the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; ruptured its boundaries. Without warning, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;'s armies surged toward &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, intent on burning the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; to the ground. In the ensuing conflict, many brave heroes gave their lives to protect Hyjal from destruction. By their noble sacrifices, the impossible was achieved: the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; pushed Ragnaros's minions back into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Now, the battle to protect Hyjal rages in Ragnaros's smoldering realm. As territory is gained and Azeroth's champions edge closer to the Firelands' inner sanctums, a monumental task lies ahead. Entrenched around Ragnaros's lair -- &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt; -- are his most trusted guardians, including the turncoat &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and their mysterious leader. Yet Hyjal's defenders cannot afford to shy away from any of these dangers. Should Ragnaros prevail against the incursion and succeed in destroying Nordrassil, Azeroth will suffer a blow from which it might never recover.\"\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The Firelands is the molten domain forged by the titans to house Ragnaros and his wayward minions. Following Deathwing's emergence into Azeroth, Ragnaros and his servants surged onto the slopes of Mount Hyjal before being driven back by the sacred mountain's valiant defenders. Now Ragnaros is rallying his loyalists to defend the Firelands from Azeroth's champions.\"\nDungeon denizens.\nEncounters.\nThe first five bosses of the instance can be killed in any order, but after they are defeated the instance follows a linear progression from Majordomo Staghelm to Ragnaros."}

A new currency, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20World%20Tree\"&gt;Mark of the World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, is introduced. Marks are rewarded from completing daily quests and can be used to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;, areas within it, and purchase high-level items at the following vendors: &lt;a href=\"Zen%27Vorka\"&gt;Zen'Vorka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayla%20Shadowstorm\"&gt;Ayla Shadowstorm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varlan%20Highbough\"&gt;Varlan Highbough&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Damek%20Bloombeard\"&gt;Damek Bloombeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement &lt;a href=\"The%20Molten%20Front%20Offensive\"&gt;The Molten Front Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefending the World Tree.\nBefore adventurers can take the fight to Ragnaros, they must contend with his forces attacking &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Both Ragnaros' forces and those of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; seek to burn &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the world tree. It is up to adventurers to push the foot soldiers back and interact with five Ancients: &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aessina\"&gt;Aessina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tortolla\"&gt;Tortolla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, and rescue the legendary commander &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. Once these five Ancients are back in the fight, Malfurion, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; and Cenarius lead a charge against Ragnaros in &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Spire\"&gt;Sulfuron Spire&lt;/a&gt;, driving him back to the Firelands.\nOpening the portal.\nOnce Mount Hyjal is reasonably secure (at least after players have completed &lt;a href=\"Aessina%27s%20Miracle\"&gt;Aessina's Miracle&lt;/a&gt;), forces start gathering at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt; in southern Hyjal. There, Malfurion attempts to open a portal to the Firelands. That attempt does not go well. The fight escalates to the point that Malorne is resurrected to help with the defense.\nAdventurers are tasked with earning &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20World%20Tree\"&gt;Mark of the World Tree&lt;/a&gt; x20 in order to continue. This can be accomplished within one day by completing the initial quest line, ending with the resurrection of Malorne, plus one set of dailies that open up once the quest line ends. Once twenty Marks have been collected and remitted, the area transitions to the next phase.\nMaking a beachhead.\nResources gathered, it is time to make a push into the breach. However, Hamuul has a side quest that goes disastrously wrong. Putting that aside for the moment, follow Malfurion through the portal on &lt;a href=\"Nordune%20Ridge\"&gt;Nordune Ridge&lt;/a&gt; to cross into the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion and his party are immediately set upon by an Obsidian Slaglord. Help kill it, then start securing the toehold. Malfurion shortly offers an opportunity to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt; to the fight by handing either faction's leader &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20World%20Tree\"&gt;Mark of the World Tree&lt;/a&gt; x150. Players can earn a maximum of 12 or 14 marks per day (six from the quests starting at the Sanctuary of Malorne, and six or eight at Malfurion's Breach), so this will take roughly two weeks to complete.\nProgressing inland.\nBased on whether players choose to complete &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;The Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Druids of the Talon (quest)&lt;/a&gt; first, players will either make a push up to the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Spire\"&gt;Forlorn Spire&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, or the &lt;a href=\"Furnace\"&gt;Furnace&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest. Eleven marks are rewarded daily for completing the daily quest chain, in addition to the fourteen possible from phase one and phase two daily quests.\nAfter recruiting one of the two sub-factions, the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tree\"&gt;Sentinel Tree&lt;/a&gt; will grow larger.\nShould players have both factions unlocked, they will be given the choice to complete \"either\" faction's quests each day, not both. \nCrimson Lasher.\nA short side one-time questline (worth five marks) and one further daily (worth one mark each day) can be unlocked by killing a &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druid of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;:\nFurther progression.\nWhen you complete both &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;The Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Druids of the Talon (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, the phase at Malfurion's Breach advances slightly, with the Sentinel Tree growing significantly, and three NPCs appearing, each requiring &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20World%20Tree\"&gt;Mark of the World Tree&lt;/a&gt; x125 to unlock their wares:\nCompleting these final three unlock quests turns these NPCs into vendors who sell item level 365 gear for gold. Additionally, the Writs of Commendation sold by &lt;a href=\"Zen%27Vorka\"&gt;Zen'Vorka&lt;/a&gt; become available for purchase.\nThe quest &lt;a href=\"Well%20Armed\"&gt;Well Armed&lt;/a&gt; also becomes available if you have turned in 125 marks to Damek Bloombeard. That unlocks quest-giver &lt;a href=\"Ricket\"&gt;Ricket&lt;/a&gt; who offers the player one of the following:\nCompleting &lt;a href=\"Calling%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Calling the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; to activate Varlan Highbough grants you access to one of these (depending on whether you choose to do the Talon or Shadow Warden quests that day)\nSince players may earn up to 27 Marks of the World Tree each day at this phase, it should take five days worth of marks per NPC to convert them from quest givers to vendors.\nThe End.\nWhen you complete &lt;a href=\"Filling%20the%20Moonwell\"&gt;Filling the Moonwell&lt;/a&gt; (the other two are not required), Malfurion offers the quest &lt;a href=\"Into%20the%20Depths%20%28Molten%20Front%29\"&gt;Into the Depths (Molten Front)&lt;/a&gt;, in which you kill &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;Leyara&lt;/a&gt;. When you complete &lt;a href=\"Into%20the%20Depths%20%28Molten%20Front%29\"&gt;Into the Depths (Molten Front)&lt;/a&gt;, Theresa Barkskin sends you a thank-you letter containing gold. Completing the quest yields the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20Leyara\"&gt;Legacy of Leyara&lt;/a&gt; achievement, which rewards the &lt;a href=\"Smoke-Stained%20Locket\"&gt;Smoke-Stained Locket&lt;/a&gt;. This in turn starts the Leyara's Past questline, which reveals the past of Leyara and in the end, rewards the Smoke-Stained Locket now as an item that transform you into a &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druid of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; for 5 minutes.\nThe questline:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

While being neutral heroes in &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;, they are vicious &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;s in World of Warcraft, found in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, when the world was in a state of constant turmoil, the Elementals (Earth, Wind, Fire and Water) faithfully served their &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old-God masters&lt;/a&gt;. When the Old Gods were defeated by the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s, the Elementals were banished to an &lt;a href=\"elemental%20plane\"&gt;alternate plane of existence&lt;/a&gt;. Over time the world became &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s learned how to call back the Elementals through the art of summoning. The Firelord is one of these liberated Elementals. Consumed by hatred for all organic life, he roams the world he once called home, sewing chaos, wreaking vengeance, and inflicting pain with extreme prejudice.\nHero names.\nRagepyre, Hatespark, Blazefury, Heatflayer, Volcanus, Flashfire, Kar the Everburning, Smolderas, Singeslayer.\nInformation.\nThe Firelord is specialized at causing damage, prioritizing the offensive a lot more than the defensive. Because of this, he is rather fragile, having a relatively small amount of HP (and mana). A good description of him would be \"glass cannon\". Other than this he is also very fast and agile, being able to run faster than most other heroes. He is also one of the heroes able to attack units from a distance.\nIt has been suggested that his lava spawns be of first priority because they assist him in taking down creep camps further. Their ability to split and prolong their lives, even if only a short duration, also adds fuel to the fire.\nFor his remaining two abilities, it all depends on how the Firelord will be worked towards. Against strong armies that generally prioritize heavy units and heroes, Soul Burn would take higher priority, because it acts as a single-targeting Howl of Terror and Silence in one, which can stop enemy Heroes from casting spells and high-damaging units from dealing as much damage. If going against armies with no bulk, Incinerate would take higher priority.\nVolcano is a risky move as while it can stun the enemy, it also damages your own.\nAs mentioned, due to the Firelord's low HP, it is possible to kill him swiftly if you focus your attacks on him. Most of his spells can also (probably) be neutralized with dispels, so bring units with dispel-abilities to be sure.\nSpells and abilities.\nSoul urn.\nSoul Burn is a versatile spell. It is highly effective against enemy heroes and lone powerful creeps. For example, casting it on a &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Lord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Bandit Lord&lt;/a&gt; would temporarily prevent him from using Divine Shield, where he can be quickly killed before he has a chance to use it. It is essentially a one-target version of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Ranger&lt;/a&gt;'s Silence spell and Pit Lord's Howl of Terror.\nAs a general negative effect, it may be dispelled of to remove its effects.\nSummon Lava Span.\nLava Spawn can be used to creep efficiently, as well as to stage a rush if you can get a large enough pack of Lava Spawns while creeping near an enemy base. \nThe Lava Spawn multiplies after performing 15 attacks. It goes through a rather lengthy spewing animation - if the spawn is killed during this animation, then the additional spawn will not appear. The spawn darkens after each multiplication and also adds an additional 12 seconds to its timer. They're essentially a mobile version &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shadow Hunter&lt;/a&gt;'s Serpent Wards. \nUsing Unholy Frenzy and Bloodlust can increase the amount of lava spawns due to their increased attack speed..\nIf you focus your fire on the Lava Spawns as soon as they are summoned, you might kill them before they do too much damage to your own unts. You will also prevent them from multiplying. Similar to how you counter the other spells used by the Firelord, you can use dispels to cause powerful damage to the Lava Spawns as they are summoned units.\nIninerate (Autocast).\nThis spell is similar to the Searing/Cold Arrows spell, dealing additional, although very minor, damage to his attacks. Each attack adds additional bonus damage, and if the unit is killed under this status, it explodes and damages everything else near it. The damage only affects enemy units, so there is no risk of unintentional friendly fire from these explosions. Like the Dark Ranger's Black Arrows spell, units killed by Incinerate leave no corpse behind. This is important for any player seeking to resurrect, reanimate or store corpses.\nolcano (Ultimate).\nVolcano is typically used to destroy bases, but it can also be used against clustered units, or if you are really desperate, to disrupt channeled spells. It will damage your own units as well, so be careful when using it. As the spell must be maintained to get the full effect (it is channeled), it might be a good idea to have the Firelord use a potion granting him invulnerability before starting it.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;'s Infernal summon and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Mage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blood Mage&lt;/a&gt;'s Flame Strike, the volcano can destroy trees.\nIf the Firelord moves or is stunned, the spell will be canceled and not do its full damage."}

When he summons a Lava Spawn all melee DPS should focus on killing it. If it is not killed quickly it will split into two.

{"id": "23562", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23562", "title": "Firemaw", "text": "Firemaw is the fourth &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, found patrolling the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Laboratories\"&gt;Crimson Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Broodlord%20Lashlayer\"&gt;Broodlord Lashlayer&lt;/a&gt; and before &lt;a href=\"Ebonroc\"&gt;Ebonroc&lt;/a&gt;. He may drop &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; gloves for all classes.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Firemaw has a lightning shield that deals damage when he is attacked. In addition, whenever a player takes damage they gain a stack of Static Electricity. Upon reaching 10 stacks, the debuff will erupt in a chain lightning attack against all nearby players.\nTactics and tips.\nFiremaw should be tanked in the entrance to the room he guards, where the &lt;a href=\"Broodlord%20Lashlayer\"&gt;Broodlord Lashlayer&lt;/a&gt; was stationed. He should not however be pulled without clearing the first few packs of &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s in the room, the amount needing to be cleared depending on the skill of the raid, but most likely three.\nHe should be aggroed so that he is attacking the main tank inside the doorway and can be put out of sight by the raid if they hug the walls either side of him. This is necessary to negate the stack of Flame Buffet that quickly accumulates. One tank should stand in front of him to take aggro for most of the fight being healed from the right side of the room, however during his &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;s the tank behind him will have to take over, healed by the left side. The main tank will keep getting hit with debuffs, so there should be a second tank prepared to switch in for the Main Tank until the MT's debuffs fall off.\nDPS should stand, with the majority of the healers, on the right hand side of the room and get out of &lt;a href=\"LoS\"&gt;LoS&lt;/a&gt; when stacks reach about 5-10, depending on your health. Bandaging should be used on non tanks as much as possible, as mana will be needed to heal tanks taking more damage from their lessened fire resistance.\nAs with all the other drakes, Firemaw's most deadly weapon is his shadowflame. In order to reduce the impact that this has it is considered wise to have priests cast a Power Word Shield on the MT just prior to this. Other tactics include having one or two healers using big heals and attempting to time them so they land the second after the shadowflame hits.\nAs with all &lt;a href=\"BWL\"&gt;BWL&lt;/a&gt; fights, it is important to manage aggro heavily here as wing buffet reduces the aggro on the tank who is hit by it. In a perfect kill the MT will never take a buffet and will be able to keep ahead of aggro, however if he does get hit by one aggro can get finicky later in the fight.\nHis knockbacks are about 30\u201335 seconds apart, and his shadowflames about 15\u201318 seconds apart. \nKeys to the Fight.\n1. Constantly watch your health. Everyone besides the healers is taking constantly increasing damage this fight; not watching your health will allow the debuffs to stack up and eventually kill you. \n2. Positioning for this fight is everything. You've heard it before, but it's really true here. All efforts should be taken to ensure that Firemaw does not change location while the fight goes on. The buffet-eater should get right on Firemaw to taunt, as being at the edge of his hit box forces him to move to the OT. The replacement tank should stand on the spot the MT is at before taunting Firemaw off. However your guild does positioning, be wary of the possibility of Firemaw shadowflaming while the buffet tank has aggro; if the raid is behind the eater, it can lose 10-20 people in one breath. As bosses go, Firemaw does not hit hard. If you can get your positioning down, you've won the fight.\nLoot.\nItems marked with a * in the table are shared between Firemaw, &lt;a href=\"Ebonroc\"&gt;Ebonroc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Flamegor\"&gt;Flamegor&lt;/a&gt;. Only two &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; gloves will drop between the three drakes each reset.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

A Firestone increased all spell direct damage done by 1% and increased &lt;a href=\"spell%20critical%20strike\"&gt;spell critical strike&lt;/a&gt; by 7/14/21/28/35/42/49. They were bind on pickup, but unlike other &lt;a href=\"Conjured%20Items\"&gt;Conjured Items&lt;/a&gt;, Firestones and &lt;a href=\"Create%20Spellstone\"&gt;Spellstones&lt;/a&gt; did not vanish after logged out for any amount of time (Much like a Wizard Oil created by &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;). \nFirestones and &lt;a href=\"Create%20Spellstone\"&gt;Spellstones&lt;/a&gt; were the preferred temporary weapon enchants for Warlocks. Firestones were preferred for Warlocks that favor direct damage spells (Destruction and Demonology warlocks), while Spellstones were preferred for Affliction Warlocks, who favor damage over time spells.\nOriginal Firestones.\nThe original Firestone was an &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"conjured%20item\"&gt;conjured item&lt;/a&gt; which was later moved to the &lt;a href=\"wand\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt; (technically a &lt;a href=\"relic%20%28slot%29\"&gt;relic&lt;/a&gt;), created by the warlock Create Firestone spell, allowing warlocks to &lt;a href=\"enhance\"&gt;enhance&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=\"main%20hand\"&gt;main hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; to do additional &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; and gain a fire spell damage bonus &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; for as long as the Firestone existed. When active, a Firestone stacked with weapon enchantments, and placed a small fireball that circled the Warlock's weapon. Both the Firestone and Spellstone were widely unused for multiple reasons. They did not provide comparable stats to wands and, like other conjured items, would disappear if logged out for more than 15 minutes."}

He was originally a member of &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Al\"&gt;Cartel Al&lt;/a&gt; and led an expedition to search for the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, a mission that ended with his disappearance and the other brokers labeling him a madman and &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn reality, his expedition succeeded in reaching Zereth Mortis, the land of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, but once there Firim was turned into a pariah again: his colleagues renamed themselves the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; and declared him an apostate for wanting to continue to study the mysteries of the First Ones instead of simply revering them, eventually leading them to banish him from their town of &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;. Firim himself, who now lives in &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Exile's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, is of the opinion that the Enlightened are dogmatic and too small-minded to appreciate his self-proclaimed genius.\nFirim plays a central role in the &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis%20campaign\"&gt;Zereth Mortis campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nIn search of the Sepulcher.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Al\"&gt;Cartel Al&lt;/a&gt; outbid &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Ta\"&gt;Cartel Ta&lt;/a&gt; on leading an expedition to search for the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and found a clue to its location, seemingly a piece of writing from the First Ones, Al'firim\u2014who had earned a reputation for translation and codebreaking\u2014began deciphering it. Despite his self-proclaimed genius, he almost faltered due to the difficulty of the task. According to him, it felt like an eternity passed before he had the first inkling of what the glyphs represented. His cartel brought in helpers and apprentices to assist him, none of which lasted for long, and later told him to stop as they had found another broker to take up the work. Al'firim refused, since he knew that their planned replacement was an old female rival of his whom he had vowed would never \"usurp\" his position again. As he continued his work, he eventually reached a realization that was so startling that it caused reality itself to seem to \"melt away\" and which Al'firim himself described as \"the most wondrous revelation of my storied career\" and \"the greatest discovery of our time\". However, he also admitted that he was still only just starting to understand the language of the First Ones. The fact that he decoded any of the glyphs at all was more progress than other brokers had made in ages of study. However, as the expedition's search for the Sepulcher continued from afterlife to afterlife, each dispatch they sent back became less and less coherent. In &lt;a href=\"Tazavesh%2C%20the%20Veiled%20Market\"&gt;Tazavesh&lt;/a&gt;, the brokers began to talk of Al'firim as \"the Mad Scribe\".\nAl'firim embarked on journeys throughout the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and sought out scholars and explorers, but found few who shared his interest in the \"great mysteries\". At one point he joined a trade expedition to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, where he met a &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; aspirant willing to bring him to the &lt;a href=\"Eonian%20Archives\"&gt;Eonian Archives&lt;/a&gt;. However, one of the &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;Ascended&lt;/a&gt; was alerted of this, and Al'firim's expedition was escorted out of the realm and warned never to return.\nAges later, he secured an invitation to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt;. While his companions enjoyed the sport in the arena, Al'firim traveled alone across the wasteland to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Sepulcher of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; and sought outs its most ancient history texts. When he asked the tower's guarding &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es if there were any older tomes, they replied that those were reserved for the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; and told him to leave immediately.\nA thousand truths.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, he finally found someone who shared his curiosity: the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Kah-Sher\"&gt;Overseer Kah-Sher&lt;/a&gt;. Kah-Sher enjoyed sharing what he knew with Al'firim, but the broker found little of value in what he said. When Kah-Sher mentioned that he'd had a similar conversation with Al'firim's old rival, the broker decided that the conversation was pointless and left. On his way out, he ran into the soul of an insectoid mortal named &lt;a href=\"Irik-tu\"&gt;Irik-tu&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;mortal plane&lt;/a&gt; was populated by countless worlds of varied beings who, unlike those in the Shadowlands, did not trade in &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a concept that seemed strange and foreign to Al'firim. The broker asked Irik-tu what he knew of the origin of the mortal plane, but to his disappointment, the soul replied with a creation myth that Al'firim dismissed as nothing more than a superstitious fable.\nHowever, one thing Irik-tu said stuck in Al'firim's mind: the soul spoke of \"a thousand truths\". The broker eventually realized that the key to interpreting the First Ones' writing lay in setting aside his preconceptions and seeing a greater reality beyond them. He suddenly saw the pattern not as one truth, but as layer of intersecting truths. He concluded that each of the cosmic forces could be ruled by a pantheon of powerful beings, just like the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; ruling over the force of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;; that the mortal plane (which was believed by brokers to simply be a \"distant corner of reality\" created by the First Ones to supply the Shadowlands with souls and anima) could be \"the very nexus of existence\" where several different forces hold sway; and that if the different forces compete with one another to claim it, they might be driven by the unconscious knowledge of another outside force that seeks it as well. Al'firim concluded his last report to his cartel by stating that he refused to abandon the search for the Sepulcher until he was proven right and \"all truths\" were revealed to him.\nEventually, many cycles passed without any more contact from Al'firim's expedition, and it was widely believed that he, like others before him, had gone mad from his study of the First Ones' fractals. The rest of Cartel Al ascribed his disappearance to his \"troubled condition\" and dismissed his reports as the writings of a lunatic, heretic, and criminal. They appointed Al'firim's rival as his replacement in the search for the Sepulcher and assigned operatives in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to the task of tracking down the \"criminal\" and those who decided to join his \"doomed expedition\". As &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt; of Cartel Ta delved into the First Ones' mysteries for himself, however, he started doubting this version of events and suggested that Al'firim had in fact succeeded in finding the Sepulcher and that he simply couldn't yet return because of the sheer amount of knowledge that had been revealed to him.\nFirim in exile.\nThis was indeed the case: the fractals had aligned and Al'firim and his expedition found the way to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of the First Ones. According to the broker himself, no one else but him could have come up with the incredibly complex portal formulae required to succeed. Upon arrival, some expedition members tried to plunder the land's mysteries but were killed by the First Ones' servants. The survivors heeded Al'firim's warnings and founded the village of &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; from which they could begin their work.\nAs the Al delved deeper into the land's mysteries, they began to regard the knowledge they gleaned as sacred. They decided they couldn't send word of their discoveries back to their cartel and allow outsiders to plunder and disrupt the realm. They destroyed their portals and Al'firim blotted out his own translocation equations from his mind, thereby willingly stranding themselves in the realm. They named themselves &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; and renounced their cartel prefixes, with Al'firim from then on being known simply as \"Firim\". However, a schism soon appeared in the ranks: Firim was still determined to reach the Sepulcher, but the others claimed that it was too sacred and began sabotaging his research when he wasn't looking. Their feud stretched on until the Enlightened declared Firim a heretic and apostate and banished him from Haven. He moved to &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Exile's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, determined that he'd outpace his former colleagues in exile.\nAlthough access to the Sepulcher remained elusive, Firim learned much by observing Zereth Mortis' caretakers, the &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt;. He realized that they were responsible for helping to forge new afterlives, and that they and everything in the Shadowlands was part of the First Ones' grand pattern. However, despite his linguistic skills, he found it a challenge to understand their language, the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Cypher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, which he realized was the key to understanding the First Ones' creations. One day when he was studying the rarest type of automa, an &lt;a href=\"Automa%23Oracle\"&gt;oracle&lt;/a&gt;, he heard (or rather felt) its voice. He realized that the oracles spoke in both one truth and a thousand at the same time, which led to more realizations: that the minds of the First Ones themselves must be even more complex, that all of the lesser cosmic beings were limited by nature as the First Ones had given each of their \"children\" only a portion of their gifts, and that this was why the cosmic forces were in constant conflict. At this insight, Firim fell unconscious as, in his own words, he had \"once again transcended into a new plane of thought\".\nFor a long time, Firim considered his earlier realization about the six cosmic forces pointing toward a seventh unknown one to simply be a contradiction he had to solve. However, as the oracle's song continued to reverberate in him, he reached another insight: that the number of forces was both six and seven (\"The six were one, and the seventh the other\"), and that \"Both were, yet only one could be\". It was not a variable to solve, but a solution awaiting its opportunity. He concluded that \"the song\" must not be allowed to end, but wondered who would continue to sing it if the First Ones did not.\nEternity's End.\nFirim was gathering data at the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Inception\"&gt;Path of Inception&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"vombata\"&gt;vombata&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barnaby%20%28vombata%29\"&gt;Barnaby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Polly%20%28vombata%29\"&gt;Polly&lt;/a&gt; when two outsiders arrived to Zereth Mortis: &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;. He agreed to help guide them to Haven, where they could reconnect with the allies they'd left behind in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, if they helped him by obtaining an automa hand and using it to retrieve a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Core%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;primordial core&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20Vestibule\"&gt;Genesis Vestibule&lt;/a&gt;. Once they'd done so, he guided them to Haven, which was under attack from &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; forces. Despite the differences between him and the Enlightened, Firim didn't want to see Haven destroyed and\u2014before leaving\u2014told the Maw Walker to help protect the place.\nThe Maw Walker later opened a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Waystone\"&gt;portal connection&lt;/a&gt; between Zereth Mortis and Oribos, allowing &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Xy\"&gt;Cartel Xy&lt;/a&gt; to start sending assassins after Firim in the hopes of getting their hands on his research. Firim was able to fend off most of the attackers with hidden traps around Exile's Hollow. Meanwhile, Pelagos and the Maw Walker found &lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;an unconscious oracle&lt;/a&gt; and\u2014after not getting any help from the Enlightened\u2014went looking for Firim, who insisted that they should be the ones helping him since they'd led the assassins right to him. While the Maw Walker took out some of the Xy assassins and reset Firim's traps, Pelagos brought the oracle from Haven. Her presence activated the core the Maw Walker had obtained for Firim earlier, causing it to awaken into a tiny automa. The automa was attracted to the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20Console\"&gt;Cypher Console&lt;/a&gt;, a device Firim kept in his cave but which he'd never gotten to work, before suddenly running out of the hollow and leading the broker and Maw Walker on a trip to several similar consoles around Zereth Mortis, revealing more of the cyphers' meaning to them in the process. The automa then returned to the console in Exile's Hollow, helped the Maw Walker use it, and revealed its name: &lt;a href=\"Pocopoc\"&gt;Pocopoc&lt;/a&gt;. Firim reflected on the fact that the automa seemed to have chosen the Maw Walker to be the one to unlock Zereth Mortis' secrets, and stated that he'd be watching the hero closely."}

{"id": "13063", "revid": "44452608", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13063", "title": "First Aid", "text": "First Aid is a secondary &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; which enables a player to heal players and to remove &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;s, notably through a variety of &lt;a href=\"bandage\"&gt;bandage&lt;/a&gt;s. Bandages can be made from &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt;s, with higher quality cloth producing more effective bandages. Bandages can only be applied to a same character once every 60 seconds, until the &lt;a href=\"Recently%20Bandaged\"&gt;Recently Bandaged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; disappears. First Aid practitioners can also make anti-venom consumables from venom sacs dropped by various poisonous monsters (e.g., &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s), though they are not as powerful as those created by &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemists&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of , First Aid is no longer available on Retail realms. Making bandages is now part of the &lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt; profession, and liquids are part of the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; profession, with individual types only limited by level requirements for use.\nUses.\nFirst Aid is highly recommended to all classes as a way of reducing &lt;a href=\"downtime\"&gt;downtime&lt;/a&gt; between battles, by quickly restoring health after combat. Even classes with healing spells can benefit, since using a bandage after combat will conserve mana, saving the time otherwise spent drinking. Bandages can also be applied to the combat pets. They can also be useful in combat if you have a way of getting out of combat, for example vanish for rogues.\nBandages, usable in or out of combat, also have a large role in groups and raids. Characters who are not tanking or healing can back away from the battle at hand and apply a bandage to themselves, to help save the healer's mana. However, be warned that being hit (including damage over time spells) while applying a bandage will cancel its channeled heal. A remedy to this problem is to stun, fear, or find some other means to lose the aggro of that monster long enough to get some use out of the bandage. In addition, if you're in a raid instance or boss fight where your classes skills are ineffective (Such as anything with an Anti-Magic Field), or you're silenced or something similar, you can use Bandages to back up the healers temporarily (Just stay away from AOE attacks and you'll be fine)\nAn attempt to apply the bandage during the fight has a risk of losing it without any use if the aid procedure has been interrupted by the enemy strike.\nSkill level guide.\nTo begin your first aid career, seek out the First Aid trainer in the starting zone for your race. There are no prerequisites for learning First Aid other than the 10 copper you'll be charged. Once you've acquired the First Aid skill, you can begin making Linen Bandages immediately and your potential skill level will be 75. Thereafter, consult the following table as you progress in First Aid skill.\nA level 1 character (with enough gold) can raise their first aid skill to 225, high enough to use providing another character creates them.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20knights\"&gt;Death knights&lt;/a&gt; begin with 270 First Aid skill and knowledge of all trainer-taught recipes up to .\nTraining locations.\nTrainers are located in each city and in several other population centers.

He enlists &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to help him enact a mutiny against the tyrannical Zem'lan.\nBiography.\nIn life, First Mate Jamboya was a member of &lt;a href=\"Pirate-King%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;Pirate-King Zem'lan&lt;/a&gt;'s crew of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s. One day, the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;Port of Zem'lan&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;. As Zem'lan did not have enough crews to win a fair fight, Jamboya searched for a potential advantage among the port's contraband caches, eventually discovering a set of dark, powerful idols.\nJamboya witnessed how Zem'lan slaughtered a group of Zandalari refugees seeking safe passage on the Pirate-King's boats to escape the sethrak. The first mate could have stopped Zem'lan right there and prevented the crew's eventual fate, but instead he led them straight into it, much to his immense guilt. When the sethrak army approached the port, Jamboya reported to Zem'lan, who ordered the first mate to rally the crew to defend the port with their lives. When it became clear that the Faithless were too many, Zem'lan told Jamboya to gather the cursed idols and round up the crew. Jamboya protested that there had to be some other way, but Zem'lan was adamant, stating that the sethrak would never take the pirates' home from them. Zem'lan's crew traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Isle\"&gt;Golden Isle&lt;/a&gt;, where the Pirate-King used the idols in a ritual to kill Jamboya and curse him into an undead &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. Jamboya was the first that Zem'lan cursed and \u2014 as he regrets to this day \u2014 he did nothing to stop the captain from cursing the rest of the crew. This was the first of countless deaths of Jamboya's, each spent fighting and dying for Zem'lan and his treasure hoard.\nYears later, a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; heads into Zem'lan to search for the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; scout &lt;a href=\"Meeki\"&gt;Meeki&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the treasure-seeking vulpera at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Lastwind\"&gt;Camp Lastwind&lt;/a&gt;. They find Meeki dead and Jamboya strung up on a nearby pillar, having been tied up after his last escape. Jamboya offers the adventurer the opportunity to help obtain vengeance and treasure, but first he gives the hero a medallion to witness a vision of the day the port fell, to show that he himself is not without blame. The adventurer agrees to cut Jamboya loose and help him mutiny against Zem'lan. Jamboya sends the adventurer to rescue his fellow crew members &lt;a href=\"Gunner%20Bosanya\"&gt;Gunner Bosanya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jukanga%20the%20Snitch\"&gt;Jukanga the Snitch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Tulmac\"&gt;Quartermaster Tulmac&lt;/a&gt;, who have all been similarly strung up around the port as punishment and who all agree to help in the first mate's mutiny. He also sends the hero to witness two more visions of the day that the Port of Zem'lan was cursed. After the crew members have been recruited, Jamboya asks the hero to retrieve the idols that Zem'lan used to curse the port and burn the boats in the harbor, after which the group travels south to the Golden Isle, where Zem'lan hoards all his treasure.\nJamboya tasks the hero with stealing as much of Zem'lan's booty as they can and accompanies them in an attempt to destroy the cursed idols atop the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Altar%20of%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;altar&lt;/a&gt; where Zem'lan conducted his ritual. However, instead of being destroyed, the altars simply release another memory of the past, this time of Jamboya's first death. Jamboya and the hero proceed to challenge Pirate-King Zem'lan himself by ringing the gong at the top of the isle. After a battle, Zem'lan is finally killed. However, with his dying words he tells Jamboya that he will not remain dead for long. Realizing the truth in the captain's words and that Zem'lan's minions will likely be looking for them on the seas, Jamboya, his crewmates, and the adventurer head back to shore and travel northeast with the treasure in hand to hide out with the adventurer's vulpera friends at Camp Lastwind. Jamboya tells the camp's leader &lt;a href=\"Norah\"&gt;Norah&lt;/a&gt; of their mutiny against Zem'lan, that they're looking for a new crew to join, and of the immense amounts of treasure that can be found off the coast of Zem'lan's port. Norah happily welcomes Jamboya and his pirates into the caravan, and the first mate and his skeletons can thereafter be found sitting atop their pile of treasure in the camp.\nAfterward, Jamboya used the treasures of Zem'lan to buy his own ship and became its &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;. Along with his crew, he set sail to the seas."}

{"id": "676445", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=676445", "title": "First Ones", "text": "The First Ones (also known as the Progenitors) are enigmatic &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;like beings who shaped the cosmos and the fabric of all realities. They conceived and put in place the &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;six governing forces&lt;/a&gt; of reality\u2014&lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disorder\"&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as well as the pantheons that embody them\u2014such as the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon of Order&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Pantheon of Death&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;realms&lt;/a&gt; that they inhabit. The First Ones are shrouded in mystery, and very little is known for certain about them: it is unknown when they first walked the cosmos, whether they still do, or if their existence ended ages ago.\nThe First Ones' magic and architecture are so advanced that they resemble mathematics, and are characterized by geometric fractals and patterns. They and their servants\u2014the &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt;\u2014speak a complex runic language that is incomprehensible to most mortals. One of their recurring symbols is that of a coiled serpent, which is believed by &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; scholars to be a representation of \"their infinite cycle\".\nHistory.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Firim\"&gt;Al'firim&lt;/a&gt;'s interpretations of the First Ones' writings, the cosmos began with six forces (or possibly a different number) existing in opposition to each other until they came together (or were brought together) and gave form to a design. Each \"architect\" gave a portion of themselves, and thus \"the pattern was drawn\". With a framework in place, all things in the universe came to be, like a fungus growing upon the frame. The six forces were now in balance, and others arose from their intersections\u2014a simple structure growing infinitely more complex.\nThe brokers believe that the First Ones made the endless cycle of Life and Death the central part of their creation. The First Ones created the realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; to be a workshop where they and their servants\u2014the &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt;\u2014made everything in the Shadowlands and the realms beyond. Zereth Mortis is also home to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, a structure containing knowledge that could unmake the cosmos. It was within the Sepulcher that they created beings like the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;, the rulers of the Shadowlands.\nThe First Ones notably crafted &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, the entry point for mortal souls in the Shadowlands, along with several other centers of knowledge, including &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baraneth\"&gt;Baraneth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nirem-Ahn\"&gt;Nirem-Ahn&lt;/a&gt;. Their &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Obelisk\"&gt;spirit obelisks&lt;/a&gt; can be found throughout the realms of Death. In addition, a First One &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;waystone&lt;/a&gt; allowing passage to Oribos can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and was reactivated from dormancy by a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, to the great surprise of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; who had thought it impossible for a relic of the First Ones to respond to a mortal. The broker &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt; notes that the waystone's existence is curious, since the Maw was seemingly intended to be an inescapable prison. One possibility is that the infallible First Ones placed the stone in the Maw as a failsafe, while another is that they foresaw the coming of the Maw Walkers and ensured the waystone was put in place for their benefit; if so, the Progenitors must possess a gift of foresight far beyond even the Eternal Ones. The &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Bonds\"&gt;Forge of Bonds&lt;/a&gt;, devices that allow for the ritual of &lt;a href=\"soulbinding\"&gt;soulbinding&lt;/a&gt;, also bear a clear resemblance to artifacts attributed to the First Ones.\nThe Eternal One Zovaal\u2014who originally served as the Arbiter of mortal souls\u2014long ago defied the will of the First Ones and sought to unmake the balance of the cosmos. Recently, after obtaining the &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;s of his fellow Eternal Ones, he opened a portal to Zereth Mortis with the intent of breaching the Sepulcher and remaking reality. He has also stated that he created the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; in order to claim \"the final prize\", a secret that the First Ones sought to hide.\nThe brokers long ago set out from their home realm to search for the First Ones' secrets, believing that whoever first managed to harness their power would become the most influential of all brokers.
