{"id": "116110", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=116110", "title": "Accessing the public test realm", "text": "Here is a full and complete step-by-step set of instructions for copying characters, downloading/installing the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Test%20Realm\"&gt;Public Test Realm&lt;/a&gt;, running the PTR, patching and reinstalling the PTR, and getting on the public test realm and TTR. This guide is written for a beginner-level audience, but expects basic knowledge of using a web browser and getting around the filesystem.\nThe most common errors posted on the PTR forum are caused by people not following the bolded instructions. Make sure to follow them!\nNew for 3.3.5 PTR: Players MUST copy a character to the PTR before they will be able to log in to the client.\nCopying characters.\nIn order to do useful testing on the Public Test Realm, QA has given us the ability to copy our own characters or to potentially use premade max-level and well-equipped characters to test on the PTR so we don't have to begin a level 1 character and level it instead of testing. To use premades, you must have updated your account to &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; at least 6 weeks before the PTR opened!\nTo actually copy a character, go to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/charcopy/character-copy.html\"&gt;character copy page&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions. Make sure you are not playing WoW when attempting to copy your character. Make sure you choose a realm that fits your play style, as there are both PvP and PvE test realms.\nCopying characters is a one-way operation: You will be copying your character from the real server you play on to the PTR, as it was when you last logged out. What you do on the PTR has no effect on your real character on the live realms. Your PTR character and all of its &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, items, and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; will not be getting transferred back to the live realms, either.\n\"Premade\" character copies may or may not be available, so take a quick look at the stickies on the Test Realm Forums.\nThere tend to be issues with copying characters due to the immense demand that is placed on the servers handling the copies. If you are seeing errors, please cancel out and try again later. QA is usually aware of problems with the copy servers instantly, so please do not flood the forum with character-copy threads. That being said, the Estimated Queue Time is usually accurate, so simply be patient and wait until the character is copied. As long as the characters status is \"pending\", the character will be copied.\nDownloading and installing the PTR.\nNow that your character is hopefully in the process of getting copied over to the test server that you selected, it's time to download the PTR.\nThe PTR is a special version of WoW that stands on its own from your regular copy of WoW. Go to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/charcopy/downloads.html\"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; and select \"PC\" or \"Mac\" in order to download the client. Click \"PC\" if you're running Windows, \"Mac\" if running OS X and above. Linux users should probably downloading the Windows version to run via Wine.\nOnce the PTR installer is done downloading (it's around 100MiB or so), run it. It should ask you where you want to install the PTR. The default location typically works fine. If it \"doesn't\" ask, and instead complains about WoW not being installed: right-click on whatever shortcut you use to start World of Warcraft and choose the \"Run as administrator\" option. Log in, then exit. Then rerun the PTR installer.\nRemember where you choose to install the PTR, so that you can access it later if need be. The base PTR install is a \"second copy\" of World of Warcraft on your computer, at version 4.0.0 (build 12824). Since we're past that now, there will be a large amount of downloads to follow to patch it up to the latest build of the PTR (about 1-2GB). \nOnce you have finished installing the Launcher for the Public Test realm will come up. If necessary it will download a small update to update the Launcher and run again. Depending on how many patches it needs to download it will loop the patching process until finished. This is normal. It will download a patch installer, update the PTR then download the next patch it needs. Your patience is required with this :)\nPlease note that as the PTR phase progresses Blizzard will put out new builds regularly. These need to be downloaded and installed one by one in order to get on the PTR. A good idea to keep your PTR updated is to log on the PTR at least once per week or whenever they put out a new build. Make sure you are starting the PTR up by opening the Launcher inside the World of Warcraft Public Test folder. This is to make sure you download any needed Launcher updates\nUpdating the PTR.\nFor the last few PTR's Blizzard have actually made it possible to update your Old PTR folder. That's right you don't have to wipe your \"World of Warcraft Public Test\" folder at the end of a PTR phase.\nYou can just update it simply by opening the \"World of Warcraft Public Test\" folder and opening the Launcher.exe inside that folder. The Launcher should automatically download a patch installer to upload your old Public Test Realm folder to the new PTR.\nPublic Test Realm Version Numbers.\nThe public test realm uses a different version numbering system then Live.\nAll PTR version numbers will begin with zero. This it to prevent the installer mistakenly installing the Data from the PTR over live.\nEG\n0.2 = 3.2 PTR\n0.3.0 = 3.3 PTR\n0.3.3 = 3.3.3 PTR \n0.3.5 = 3.3.5 PTR \nIt will also have a build number as well at the end. EG 0.3.5.11993 is PTR 3.3.5 build 11993.\nThis can also assist you in understanding what each patch updater is going to do. \nEG WoW-0.3.3.11685-to-0.3.5.11993-enUS-ptr-patch.exe will update the 3.3.3 PTR to the 3.3.5 PTR\nRunning the PTR.\nTo get back to the PTR, there are a few options:\nPlease note that you must use the password you had when the PTR activated. Your account as a whole must also have been active for at least seven weeks before the PTR was activated, if not since the date specified on the Character Copy page.\nIf you would like to use the Launcher to access the PTR, but it doesn't show by default, click the \"Show Launcher\" checkbox in the lower-left corner of the login screen, log in and then exit out of WoW. The Launcher should then show.\nIf you're getting stuck at \"Connecting\" or \"Handshaking\" while attempting to log in, follow the upcoming instructions, remembering to try to log in after completing each step:\nIf you're frequently getting disconnected, follow the instructions at the following US Blizzard support articles: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml%3FarticleId%3D19824\"&gt;Why do I keep getting disconnected?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml%3FarticleId%3D21017\"&gt;Do NPCs and/or players show up as 'Unknown?'&lt;/a&gt;.\nThat's it, good luck, and don't forget to report all of the bugs you find with the /bug tool in-game!\nPatching the PTR.\nThere are often a multitude of small patches required in order to get the PTR up to date. For most users, simply running the PTR (and/or the Launcher) will download and install the patches without any issues.\nIf you're having trouble getting all of the patches because the PTR is trying to download the same patch over and over, try this:\nYou should see some files ending with \"-patch\". Run the highest -patch program you have. Make sure you run it as an administrator if you're on Vista. If you don't get an error when you run that patch, try logging in.\nIf you're still getting directed to download the same patch again, or are having errors patching, try reinstalling the PTR.\nReinstalling the PTR.\nQuick instructions for a clean reinstall:\nMake sure you always run patches with administrator privileges. Also make sure that your whole WoW folder is not set to read-only.\nUninstalling the PTR.\nIf you no longer wish to take part in the Public Test realms you can uninstall the PTR if you wish.\nAfter the PTR is finished being tested, the patch will be pushed to the Live Servers, and the PTR realms and forums will close\nUnsupported platforms.\nFor Linux, see &lt;a href=\"Wine\"&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt;. There's also an &lt;a href=\"http%3A//appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php%3FsClass%3Dversion%26amp%3BiId%3D9244\"&gt;AppDB entry for the 2.2.2 PTR&lt;/a&gt;. No doubt &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.cedega.com/\"&gt;Cedega&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/\"&gt;Crossover Office&lt;/a&gt; have their own support channels. Blizz does not support WoW on any of these platforms - however they've been known to be co-operative with those prepared to do the legwork to ascertain causes of bugs that are from upstream. Please, if you're going to use an unsupported platform to play WoW, caveat emptor and be prepared to do a lot of your own legwork if things don't go well. Just don't complain to Hortus in the Test Realm Forum, or to the Tech Support Forum, if/when things go wrong. Use your normal support channels for that.\nInstalling UI modifications.\nPlayers can install UI mods for the PTR client much the same way that they would for the regular client, but with a few caveats:\nCourtesy of from :\nA simpler way to update character/server name in your WTF folder.\nCourtesy of An\u00fabereth from Earthen Ring EU:\nThe above procedure described by Valyria can be accomplished more easily if you have a command line and perl. This is the case for OS X or Windows with cygwin or if you mount your Warcraft folder on a unix box. If you meet these requirements you can simply run the following two commands in your WTF folder to replace your character and server name in all files:\nReplace my character/server name with your name/server and you're done.\nAnother way to update character/server name in your WTF folder.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Migrate%20WTF%20script\"&gt;Migrate WTF script&lt;/a&gt; for copying your WTF to the test realm installation.\nCommon technical problems and fixes.\nBluspacecow has quite a good thread with a lot of common technical problems and fixes for the PTR on wowinterface at : \n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php%3Fp%3D187943%7CPTR\"&gt;Public Test Realm install guide and common bugs &amp; fixes &lt;/a&gt;"}

It's however not required for writing addons and it's recommended to understand the basics first before using Ace3.\nGetting started.\nWe'll begin with creating a codice_1 folder and a .&lt;a href=\"TOC_format\"&gt;TOC&lt;/a&gt; file inside with the same name:\nWelcomeHome.toc\n ## Interface: \n ## Version: 1.0.0\n ## Title: WelcomeHome\n ## Notes: Displays a welcome message when you get to your home zone\n ## Author: YourName\n Core.lua\nThen create an empty text file called Core.lua in the same directory and start up WoW. After logging in, you should be able to see that your AddOn is being recognized by the game.\nBringing Ace3 to the Party.\nDownload Ace3 from https://www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/files and unzip it into a subfolder called codice_2\nThere are lots of Ace3 libraries for you to use, but for this tutorial we only need to keep the following libs and you can delete the rest:\nWe also need to tell WoW to load the Ace3 files when it loads your addon.\n ## Interface: \n ## Version: 1.0.0\n ## Title: WelcomeHome\n ## Notes: Displays a welcome message when you get to your home zone\n ## Author: YourName\n ## SavedVariables: WelcomeHomeDB\n ## OptionalDeps: Ace3\n Libs\\LibStub\\LibStub.lua\n Libs\\CallbackHandler-1.0\\CallbackHandler-1.0.xml\n Libs\\AceAddon-3.0\\AceAddon-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceEvent-3.0\\AceEvent-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceDB-3.0\\AceDB-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceDBOptions-3.0\\AceDBOptions-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceConsole-3.0\\AceConsole-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceGUI-3.0\\AceGUI-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceConfig-3.0\\AceConfig-3.0.xml\n Core.lua\nWe've included the &lt;a href=\"TOC_format%23SavedVariables\"&gt;SavedVariables&lt;/a&gt; TOC field which we will need eventually. The &lt;a href=\"TOC_format%23OptionalDeps\"&gt;OptionalDeps&lt;/a&gt; field is in case a user of your addon wants to use Ace3 as a standalone addon instead of the embedded libraries in your Libs folder.\nSaying Hello.\nOpen the Core.lua file and add the following:\nWelcomeHome = LibStub(\"AceAddon-3.0\"):NewAddon(\"WelcomeHome\", \"AceConsole-3.0\")\nfunction WelcomeHome:OnInitialize()\n -- Called when the addon is loaded\n self:Print(\"Hello World!\")\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:OnEnable()\n -- Called when the addon is enabled\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:OnDisable()\n -- Called when the addon is disabled\nend\nThis is the basic structure of an Ace3 addon. The first line creates an instance of the AceAddon class using the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-addon-3-0%23title-18\"&gt;NewAddon&lt;/a&gt; method.\nSince we will also be printing to the chat window and accepting slash commands, we include the codice_4 which e.g. includes the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-console-3-0%23title-3\"&gt;Print&lt;/a&gt; method.\nFollowing that are three method overrides: codice_10, codice_11, and codice_12 respectively. The first is executed only once when the UI loads and the next two are executed when the addon is enabled and disabled. You can codice_13 and codice_14 Ace addons at will.\nOpen or &lt;a href=\"MACRO_reload\"&gt;/reload&lt;/a&gt; the game client, you should be able to see your chat message! Before we go any further, go back over to your code and remove the print message. It is generally considered bad form for your addon to toss a bunch of text into the chat window just because it has loaded. Too many addons do this already. You can also remove the codice_12 method since we won't be using it.\nResponding to Events.\nThis addon will give a welcome message to the player when they arrive in their home zone. How will we know they are in their home zone? Simple, we will respond to the game &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; which the game fires when the player enters a new (sub)zone.\nBefore we can register an event, we need to include the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-event-3-0\"&gt;AceEvent&lt;/a&gt; mixin into our addon.\n WelcomeHome = LibStub(\"AceAddon-3.0\"):NewAddon(\"WelcomeHome\", \"AceConsole-3.0\", \"AceEvent-3.0\")\nOnce we've done that, we can use &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-event-3-0%23title-1\"&gt;RegisterEvent&lt;/a&gt; to respond to the ZONE_CHANGED event.\nfunction WelcomeHome:OnEnable()\n self:RegisterEvent(\"ZONE_CHANGED\")\nend\nWe also need to add the handler for that event. There we can compare our hearthstone location from with .\nfunction WelcomeHome:ZONE_CHANGED()\n local subzone = GetSubZoneText()\n self:Print(\"You have changed zones!\", GetZoneText(), subzone)\n if GetBindLocation() == subzone then\n self:Print(\"Welcome Home!\")\n end\nend\n\"You might be wondering if we should call &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-event-3-0%23title-4\"&gt;UnregisterEvent&lt;/a&gt; from our OnDisable override, but we don't have to do that because codice_16 already does it for us.\" \nNow have your character leave the area he/she is presently in. You should see your message in the chat when you change zone and if you're in the same subzone as your hearthstone location it should give you a friendly message.\nChat Commands.\nNow let's add support for slash commands with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-console-3-0%23title-5\"&gt;RegisterChatCommand&lt;/a&gt;.\nfunction WelcomeHome:OnInitialize()\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"wh\", \"SlashCommand\")\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"welcomehome\", \"SlashCommand\")\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:SlashCommand(msg)\n if msg == \"ping\" then\n self:Print(\"pong!\")\n else\n self:Print(\"hello there!\")\n end\nend\nGUI and Blizzard Interface Options.\nBut why stop at chat commands? All cool addons have a Graphical User Interface these days so WelcomeHome shouldn't be any different!\nFirst we define our &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/ace-config-3-0-options-tables\"&gt;options table&lt;/a&gt;.\nlocal options = { \n name = \"WelcomeHome\",\n handler = WelcomeHome,\n type = \"group\",\n args = {\n msg = {\n type = \"input\",\n name = \"Message\",\n desc = \"The message to be displayed when you get home.\",\n usage = \"&lt;Your message&gt;\",\n get = \"GetMessage\",\n set = \"SetMessage\",\n },\nAnd the getters/setters for our message. It knows where to look since codice_17 is defined.\nfunction WelcomeHome:GetMessage(info)\n return self.message\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:SetMessage(info, value)\n self.message = value\nend\n\ud83d\udcdd \"Note: the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/ace-config-3-0-options-tables%23title-4-1\"&gt;info&lt;/a&gt; table is an advanced topic, so you can ignore that for now.\"\nNow to include our addon options to the \"AddOns\" tab, all we need to do is call &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-config-3-0%23title-1\"&gt;RegisterOptionsTable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-config-dialog-3-0%23title-1\"&gt;AddToBlizOptions&lt;/a&gt;. The latter method returns a frame we need for opening our options panel, so we save it in codice_18\nfunction WelcomeHome:OnInitialize()\n LibStub(\"AceConfig-3.0\"):RegisterOptionsTable(\"WelcomeHome\", options)\n self.optionsFrame = LibStub(\"AceConfigDialog-3.0\"):AddToBlizOptions(\"WelcomeHome\", \"WelcomeHome\")\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"wh\", \"SlashCommand\")\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"welcomehome\", \"SlashCommand\")\n -- default values\n self.message = \"Welcome Home!\"\nend\nWe want the addon to open a GUI for our options if there's no other input and otherwise we'll handle it like a normal chat command.\nfunction WelcomeHome:SlashCommand(msg)\n if not msg or msg:trim() == \"\" then\n -- https://github.com/Stanzilla/WoWUIBugs/issues/89\n InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToCategory(self.optionsFrame)\n InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToCategory(self.optionsFrame)\n else\n self:Print(\"hello there!\")\n end\nend\nMaking the Message More Prominent.\nNow let's add display the message somewhere that is a bit more prominent, for example the codice_19 with . We'll also add an option for it.\n local options = { \n name = \"WelcomeHome\",\n handler = WelcomeHome,\n type = \"group\",\n args = {\n msg = {\n type = \"input\",\n name = \"Message\",\n desc = \"The message to be displayed when you get home.\",\n usage = \"&lt;Your message&gt;\",\n get = \"GetMessage\",\n set = \"SetMessage\",\n showOnScreen = {\n type = \"toggle\",\n name = \"Show on Screen\",\n desc = \"Toggles the display of the message on the screen.\",\n get = \"IsShowOnScreen\",\n set = \"ToggleShowOnScreen\"\n },\n function WelcomeHome:OnInitialize()\n LibStub(\"AceConfig-3.0\"):RegisterOptionsTable(\"WelcomeHome\", options)\n self.optionsFrame = LibStub(\"AceConfigDialog-3.0\"):AddToBlizOptions(\"WelcomeHome\", \"WelcomeHome\")\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"wh\", \"SlashCommand\")\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"welcomehome\", \"SlashCommand\")\n -- default values\n self.message = \"Welcome Home!\"\n self.showOnScreen = true\n end\n function WelcomeHome:ZONE_CHANGED()\n if GetBindLocation() == GetSubZoneText() then\n if self.showOnScreen then\n UIErrorsFrame:AddMessage(self.message, 1, 1, 1)\n else\n self:Print(self.message)\n end\n end\n end\nfunction WelcomeHome:IsShowOnScreen(info)\n return self.showOnScreen\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:ToggleShowOnScreen(info, value)\n self.showOnScreen = value\nend\nSaving Configuration Between Sessions.\nYou may have noticed is that your settings aren't persisted between sessions. When you logout and back in, you will have the default settings again. WoW provides a way to save your settings with &lt;a href=\"Saving_variables_between_game_sessions\"&gt;SavedVariables&lt;/a&gt;, but there is an Ace way to do it with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-db-3-0%23title-2\"&gt;AceDB:New&lt;/a&gt;.\nlocal defaults = {\n profile = {\n message = \"Welcome Home!\",\n showOnScreen = true,\n function WelcomeHome:OnInitialize()\n self.db = LibStub(\"AceDB-3.0\"):New(\"WelcomeHomeDB\", defaults, true)\n LibStub(\"AceConfig-3.0\"):RegisterOptionsTable(\"WelcomeHome\", options)\n self.optionsFrame = LibStub(\"AceConfigDialog-3.0\"):AddToBlizOptions(\"WelcomeHome\", \"WelcomeHome\")\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"wh\", \"SlashCommand\")\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"welcomehome\", \"SlashCommand\")\n end\nAfter that we need to update our old variables to the new ones, e.g. codice_24 to codice_25\n function WelcomeHome:ZONE_CHANGED()\n if GetBindLocation() == GetSubZoneText() then\n if self.db.profile.showOnScreen then\n UIErrorsFrame:AddMessage(self.db.profile.message, 1, 1, 1)\n else\n self:Print(self.db.profile.message)\n end\n end\n end\n function WelcomeHome:GetMessage(info)\n return self.db.profile.message\n end\n function WelcomeHome:SetMessage(info, value)\n self.db.profile.message = value\n end\n function WelcomeHome:IsShowOnScreen(info)\n return self.db.profile.showOnScreen\n end\n function WelcomeHome:ToggleShowOnScreen(info, value)\n self.db.profile.showOnScreen = value\n end\nReload your UI and nothing should change. Except now if you change any of the settings, they will be persisted across restarts.\nUser Profiles.\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-dboptions-3-0\"&gt;profiles tab&lt;/a&gt; lets users change and reset profiles.\n function WelcomeHome:OnInitialize()\n self.db = LibStub(\"AceDB-3.0\"):New(\"TestDB\", defaults, true)\n LibStub(\"AceConfig-3.0\"):RegisterOptionsTable(\"WelcomeHome_options\", options)\n self.optionsFrame = LibStub(\"AceConfigDialog-3.0\"):AddToBlizOptions(\"WelcomeHome_options\", \"WelcomeHome\")\n local profiles = LibStub(\"AceDBOptions-3.0\"):GetOptionsTable(self.db)\n LibStub(\"AceConfig-3.0\"):RegisterOptionsTable(\"WelcomeHome_Profiles\", profiles)\n LibStub(\"AceConfigDialog-3.0\"):AddToBlizOptions(\"WelcomeHome_Profiles\", \"Profiles\", \"WelcomeHome\")\nConclusion.\nYou have started from nothing and created an addon that uses chat commands, responds to events and provides feedback to the user in a couple of different ways. Here is the final version in case you want to cheat and go right to the end.\nWelcomeHome.toc\n ## Interface: \n ## Version: 1.0.0\n ## Title: WelcomeHome\n ## Notes: Displays a welcome message when you get to your home zone\n ## Author: YourName\n ## SavedVariables: WelcomeHomeDB\n ## OptionalDeps: Ace3\n Libs\\LibStub\\LibStub.lua\n Libs\\CallbackHandler-1.0\\CallbackHandler-1.0.xml\n Libs\\AceAddon-3.0\\AceAddon-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceEvent-3.0\\AceEvent-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceDB-3.0\\AceDB-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceDBOptions-3.0\\AceDBOptions-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceConsole-3.0\\AceConsole-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceGUI-3.0\\AceGUI-3.0.xml\n Libs\\AceConfig-3.0\\AceConfig-3.0.xml\n Core.lua\nCore.lua\nWelcomeHome = LibStub(\"AceAddon-3.0\"):NewAddon(\"WelcomeHome\", \"AceConsole-3.0\", \"AceEvent-3.0\")\nlocal AC = LibStub(\"AceConfig-3.0\")\nlocal ACD = LibStub(\"AceConfigDialog-3.0\")\nlocal defaults = {\n profile = {\n message = \"Welcome Home!\",\n showOnScreen = true,\nlocal options = {\n name = \"WelcomeHome\",\n handler = WelcomeHome,\n type = \"group\",\n args = {\n msg = {\n type = \"input\",\n name = \"Message\",\n desc = \"The message to be displayed when you get home.\",\n usage = \"&lt;Your message&gt;\",\n get = \"GetMessage\",\n set = \"SetMessage\",\n showOnScreen = {\n type = \"toggle\",\n name = \"Show on Screen\",\n desc = \"Toggles the display of the message on the screen.\",\n get = \"IsShowOnScreen\",\n set = \"ToggleShowOnScreen\"\n },\nfunction WelcomeHome:OnInitialize()\n self.db = LibStub(\"AceDB-3.0\"):New(\"WelcomeHomeDB\", defaults, true)\n AC:RegisterOptionsTable(\"WelcomeHome_options\", options)\n self.optionsFrame = ACD:AddToBlizOptions(\"WelcomeHome_options\", \"WelcomeHome\")\n local profiles = LibStub(\"AceDBOptions-3.0\"):GetOptionsTable(self.db)\n AC:RegisterOptionsTable(\"WelcomeHome_Profiles\", profiles)\n ACD:AddToBlizOptions(\"WelcomeHome_Profiles\", \"Profiles\", \"WelcomeHome\")\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"wh\", \"SlashCommand\")\n self:RegisterChatCommand(\"welcomehome\", \"SlashCommand\")\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:OnEnable()\n self:RegisterEvent(\"ZONE_CHANGED\")\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:ZONE_CHANGED()\n if GetBindLocation() == GetSubZoneText() then\n if self.db.profile.showOnScreen then\n UIErrorsFrame:AddMessage(self.db.profile.message, 1, 1, 1)\n else\n self:Print(self.db.profile.message)\n end\n end\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:SlashCommand(msg)\n if not msg or msg:trim() == \"\" then\n -- https://github.com/Stanzilla/WoWUIBugs/issues/89\n InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToCategory(self.optionsFrame)\n InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToCategory(self.optionsFrame)\n else\n self:Print(\"hello there!\")\n end\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:GetMessage(info)\n return self.db.profile.message\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:SetMessage(info, value)\n self.db.profile.message = value\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:IsShowOnScreen(info)\n return self.db.profile.showOnScreen\nend\nfunction WelcomeHome:ToggleShowOnScreen(info, value)\n self.db.profile.showOnScreen = value\nend\nSee also\nReferences"}

It is a new approach to addon development, a rethinking from the ground up. \nAce provides developers with the tools needed by most addons, freeing them from repeating common tasks and allowing them to jump right into the creative part of building their addons. New and experienced addon coders alike can benefit from Ace's features.\nThe current version is &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowace.com/projects/ace3\"&gt;Ace3&lt;/a&gt;\nAce's design philosophy.\nThe primary design philosophy of Ace is simple: less is more. This means less code, fewer resources used, less effort designing an addon, less stress on the UI. Every aspect of Ace is scrutinized for efficiency, not only in code design but in ensuring that only the necessary amount of memory and processing is used to perform a given task.\nAce seeks to consolidate this knowledge into a central resource, providing developers with a full addon framework that is easy to use, very flexible, and very powerful. This framework provides the most common components addons need, like data management and chat command handling, and it also provides a glue that links addons together and allows them to share system resources smoothly and efficiently."}
{"id": "67840", "revid": "41339159", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=67840", "title": "Ace (class)", "text": "An ace is a flying fighter or a &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; pilot credited with shooting down several enemies during aerial combat.\nIn the RPG.\nAs the saying goes, any &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt; can pilot a vehicle, but only the truly gifted can be the vehicle. The thrill of high-flying combat sings to a particularly few foolhardy types, who forgo all worldly pursuits to become one with their vehicles, flying barons of destruction. These few brave and exemplary souls are known as aces.\nAn ace is a master of the wheel, a vehicular expert with no equal. The thrill of the dive-bomb - the rush of wind past his goggled face, the roar of the &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt; engines beneath him, these are the things that give life meaning to aces. While the ace is a master of any vehicle he can get his hands on, the ace is truly free only while in the air. Throughout his training, the ace gains sharp wits and quick hands, and even outside the cockpit he is always on the verge of moving. Every action is graceful, every word sharp and cocky, and his eyes forever look toward the horizon. For the flyboys of the world, every day is a new experience, and every moment on the ground is wasted when one could be soaring in the heavens.\nBy large, aces are members of the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; create some of the slickest, meanest aerial machines &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; has ever known, and in all three wars they proved their mettle again and again. Aces proved their worth in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, where they dished aerial death to enemies of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from atop their steam-powered vessels; many aces claim that, without them, the end of the war would have been quite different. In times of relative peace, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; aces still fly sorties when needed, and often enlist as guards escorting cargo over aerial pathways.\nA large part of the aces, like the renowned Gaevel Thunderblast, are also trained in the arts of fighting on the ground, and while the sword is not a favourable weapon for the aces, most of them practice martial arts.\nMany &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s also find the path of the ace irresistible, plying their madness-enhanced skills while piloting upgraded war &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s and other aeronautical nightmares. At least one notable goblin ace spreads fear in the airways of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; via an intricate rocket pack strapped to his back and several mounted weapons. Most goblin aces, unfortunately, turn into deadly aerial &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href=\"buccaneer\"&gt;buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;s of the air inspire terror over caravans, keeping guards near the east coast of Kalimdor looking to the sky.\nWhether &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; or enlisted, the ace attempts to stretch and break the boundaries of his skills, seeking other aces to prove that he, alone, is the greatest pilot ever. This tendency forces many an ace to travel the world in his vehicle, stopping only in bars to brag about his exploits, or repair shops to correct the inevitable wear and tear he puts his machine through. Many aces hold personal contests or issue proclamations of talent; and more than one city hosts fairs where aces of different generations, races and talent come together in epic contests of skill.\nAdventuring provides aces with \"exercise,\" a chance to hone their skills and possibly earn some money to upgrade their crafts. Most aces take advantage of a special &lt;a href=\"technological\"&gt;technological&lt;/a&gt; device or a spell or magic item to bring their vehicles with them. Some even cobble together tank treads or other devices, grounding their vehicles to go underground.\nUnderstandably, aces get along best with tinkers, as they themselves must have some experience as tinkers to understand and control their vehicles. While most quickly abandon the art of tinkering for more martial pursuits, they recognize the skills of other tinkers in designing and upgrading the next greatest ship. Often an ace has a small group of followers, at least one a dedicated aeronautical engineer who forever tinkers on his idol's prized machine, and defends his master's honor whether he needs it or not.\nAces also respect the prowess of &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s, seeing them as ground-bound cousins. Aces hold a general distrust of magic and its users, though not as great a distrust as other tinkers do. They can certainly see the usefulness of a well-placed healing aura or fireball from above, however, and many larger ships have a mage or priest, to serve as medic or artillery as needed. Aces take other classes on a case-by-case basis. While many observers on the ground think aces should get along with &lt;a href=\"windwarrior\"&gt;windwarrior&lt;/a&gt;s, the two masters of the air often fall into clashes over which is superior.\nAn ace is a master at piloting any vehicle he gets his hands on. The ace learns how to fire on the move while piloting a vehicle. The ace can pull himself out of danger with ease while flying.\nA skilled ace has mastered the techniques of aerial defensive fighting, also known as dogfighting. This applies even if the ace is flying under his own power, such as from a fly spell or a rocket pack or the like. A skilled ace learns how to maximize the effects of vehicular combat. An ace deals an extra damage with integrated vehicle weapons and with explosives dropped, thrown or fired from vehicles. A skilled ace\u2019s knowledge of vehicles allows him to exploit the weaknesses in their construction. The skilled ace increases the maneuverability of any vehicle he pilots.\nThe highly skilled ace learns how to maximize his engine\u2019s output, gaining a short burst of speed when he truly needs it but damaging his engine in the process. Afterward, his vehicle\u2019s speed drops by \u201320% for 1 hour. This speed reduction cannot be repaired."}

Or is it simply ignorance? Soon we shall know...\nI am a seasoned trainer of the graceful drakes of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. My business here is to study the enemy and teach my precious pets the tactics that will be most effective when we face the master of the blues.\nTo demonstrate your nerve and ability, I will allow you to ride one of my drakes against the enemy's minions.\nThe opportunity is yours for the asking... \nCompletion.\nMy drake tells me that with practice, you might become a capable combatant.\nVery well, then. In the interest of our war on Malygos, I shall allow you to practice with my pets at your leisure.\nMake ready, &lt;race&gt;, for he is a fierce and unforgiving opponent.\nRewards.\nYou will receive: \nYou will also be able to choose one of these rewards:\nNote: Becomes a Daily Quest after first completion.\nNotes.\nTalk to Corastrasza again to get on the drake.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nAbilities of the red drake.\nOn the drake you'll get six different abilities:\nYou can only have combo points on a single target. For example, casting Revivify places a combo point on your heal target, and so \"removes all combo points\" from your enemy target. Casting Revivify or Engulf in Flames refreshes the duration of your stack already on the target.\nTactical notes.\nThis quest WILL be a pain to those who are doing it for the first time. Here are some tips to avoid unnecessary keyboard destruction: \nThe following macro will help during this quest: codice_1. Simply place it on an action bar and bind it to a key that isn't used while you are on the drake. You can then just spam this macro while fighting. Think of it as easy mode.\nBecause the Arcane Surge can come up at any moment, you MUST always watch the enemy's cast bar, else you get a nasty surprise. If you're lucky, you may not even see Surge at all. Good luck!\nThis rotation focuses on stacking the DoTs from Engulf in Flames; once there are two stacks, it deals more damage (per energy) than Flame Spike. The combo points from Flame Spike only increase the duration of Engulf in Flames, not the damage dealt, so there's no point stacking more than two (giving you 10 seconds to rebuild the 80 energy needed for each cycle).\nAfter you've stacked Engulf in Flames a few times, expand the cycle to using three Flame Spikes, to allow more time for energy regeneration. At that point, most of the damage is being done by the stacked Engulf in Flames, and energy may be running low.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

The death knight was then sent into the realm by Salanar to challenge the dark rider. If successful in killing the dark rider (most are not), the deathcharger permits the death knight to ride it. Returned to the world of the living, Salanar presents the deathcharger as the death knight's new, personal mount.\nMount Journal.\n\"Some horses merely adopt the dark. This horse was born in it, molded by it.\"\nTrivia.\nThe Mount Journal entry is a reference to a quote spoken by to in the movie \"\": \"You think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark.

They were added with the \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. The default keybinding is .\n\"World of Warcraft\"'s achievements system features achievements covering every aspect of gameplay, including world exploration, &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s, and character development; from the purely whimsical to the truly epic, there is something for everyone. Some achievements come with in-game rewards such as &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt;s. All of these rewards are purely cosmetic. \nThe achievement list is expandable so additional achievements are continually added with each new \"World of Warcraft\" content update. Some of the new achievements can be awarded retroactively to players that have already met the criteria. These are mostly done for achievements that are tied to questing or item drops.\nThe achievements window.\nBeginning with &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, a new button was added() in the &lt;a href=\"micro%20menu\"&gt;micro menu&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the main &lt;a href=\"action%20bar\"&gt;action bar&lt;/a&gt;. Clicking the button (or using the default keyboard shortcut \"Y\") opens up the achievements window.\nThe top of the window displays the total number of &lt;a href=\"achievement%20point\"&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; received for completing achievements. Below, each achievement appears with its name, description, point value, the completion date, and a progress bar (if applicable). Some achievements expand to display a list of individual components, highlighted to show which parts the player has finished. Players can also select achievements to track as they play, similar to the quest tracker.\nAt the bottom of the Achievements window are the Achievements and Stats tabs. The Statistics tab shows a &lt;a href=\"Statistics%20panel\"&gt;Statistics panel&lt;/a&gt;.\nCategories.\nWorld of Warcraft's achievements come in several varieties. Some simply require specific actions to unlock, such as getting a haircut or defeating a member of each race in your opposing faction in PvP. Others involve a progress bar and require you to do something several times \u2014 such as give out 10 hugs. Some achievements are progressive; for example, once you complete an achievement to collect 10 vanity pets, you might next be asked to collect 25. Finally, meta achievements unlock when you complete other achievements \u2014 unlocking all World Exploration achievements (see below) unlocks a World Explorer meta achievement. Some achievements, including those that involve quests, honorable kills, items currently in your possession, skills (including professions), exploration, and &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;s, are applied to your character retroactively.\nTo help keep track of all the different achievements you can unlock, players find the following categories in the achievements window:\nComparing achievements.\nIt\u2019s great to be able to see your own achievements \u2014 but it\u2019s even better to let the world know what you\u2019ve accomplished. By right-clicking other players and selecting the appropriate option, you can compare your achievements to theirs. Every time you earn a new achievement, your accomplishment is announced to your guild and everyone in your immediate vicinity \u2014 and the custom achievement animation and sound effect are unmistakable. Also, your achievements are viewable on the Armory, allowing you to track and show off your accomplishments via the web.\nAvailability.\nNew &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; users cannot view the Achievements panel until they've reached level 10 on one character. If they have at least one character with an achievement, all the other characters may access the Achievements panel.\nHowever, plenty of achievements are obtainable prior to level 10 (such as opening an account bound &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20Pup\"&gt;Core Hound Pup&lt;/a&gt;), and earning one will unlock the achievement interface no matter what level.\nIt is also possible to open the Achievement window without any achievements by using the following macro:\n /script AchievementFrame_LoadUI();\n /script AchievementFrame_ToggleAchievementFrame(stats);\nExternal links.\n "}

Acidmaw can be tanked with a ranged class, but a melee class with high health is recommended. Acidmaw has an AOE paralytic toxin attack that can only be removed by a player that has Dreadscale's debuff called Burning Bile. He must be tanked facing away from the rest of the raid, and the raid should be spread out at least 10 yards from each other. He also does Slime Pool which is similar to Grobbulus's green clouds. Every once in awhile he will inject a player with paralytic toxin, a stacking debuff that will slow you down to zero movement if not cured. \nAt one point during the encounter they will submerge under ground and become unattackable, they will reappear but in switched positions, Dreadscale will be anchored and Acidmaw will be mobile. Again they are best tanked away from the raid and kind of close together to allow players with the burning bile to cure the paralytic toxin. Once you kill one Jormungar, the other one will enrage so it's best to concentrate on Acidmaw, and casting DoTs on Dreadscale.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They are usually &lt;a href=\"spellcaster\"&gt;spellcaster&lt;/a&gt;s and depending on their affiliation they might be &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s in training. Many are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; members of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; or part of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Some use dark magic to summon or unsummon &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;s in order to regain some of its resources. As part of the Scourge, &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;acolytes&lt;/a&gt; are loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. If they are part of the Forsaken, they are loyal to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; has acolytes among its ranks, who are novices learning the way of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; in the clergy. During the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, great numbers of acolytes were present in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, where they were used as troops against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"Felsworn\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; across the world.\nScourge.\nAcolytes are human beings who have given themselves over to the power of the Lich King and Scourge. These bitter, fanatical men and women will stop at nothing to promote the Lich King's will and maintain the secrecy and dominance of the Cult of the Damned. They view their own deaths and the possibility of becoming undead as the ultimate rewards for service to Ner'zhul.\nThe unsummoning of buildings allows the acolytes of the Scourge to reduce fully constructed buildings to their base forms of matter and energy in order to recover some of their resources. Some of this matter and energy is lost in the conversion, as are most things that are pulled through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcolytes who wish to serve as the eyes and ears of Ner'zhul are capable of shedding their bodies and taking on the forms of invisible &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVarious Scourge acolytes can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the undead-controlled portion of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the Cult training center of &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, and of course &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. The Acolytes from \"Warcraft III\" can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"\", Acolytes served as worker units as well as light infantry for the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and were members of Kel'Thuzad's &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nCult of the Damned.\nAcolytes of the Cult of the Damned - who are also called simply \u201cthe Damned\u201d - are promised eternal life and complete equality beneath the iron fist of Kel\u2019Thuzad and the Lich King. In exchange, they serve the temple and proffer their magic and their souls to the power of the Cult. Their faith in the Light is perverted into an utter belief in Darkness, and they offer fanatic loyalty to their leaders and to their temple.\nForsaken.\nNovice priests are most often used in grunt work, summoning and repairing buildings and structures with their magic. Occasionally, an acolyte enters battle as a &lt;a href=\"medic\"&gt;medic&lt;/a&gt;, though few are strong enough to actually engage directly in battle. They are typically dressed in dark robes covered in arcane writing. Most of their face is covered by a dark scarf and the hood of their robes; they clutch wicked wavy-bladed daggers. The acolyte is absolutely pitiful in battle, and so must let other Forsaken forces fight for them. Their main role is to summon buildings and repair damage to vehicles and other undead units. If pressed, the acolyte casts spells like \"Lesser Death Coil\" or stabs with their &lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlliance.\nAcolytes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are people training to be priests or priestesses and work under a priest or priestess. Fresh-faced acolytes often lose hope and the true meaning of the Holy Light when they realize that it takes a lifetime to serve the philosophy of the Three Virtues. These acolytes are not associated with the undead, and instead practice the same magic as their mentors.\n&lt;a href=\"Gareth%20%28acolyte%29\"&gt;Gareth&lt;/a&gt; is a human acolyte that serves a night elf priestess of Elune."}

These bitter, fanatical men and women will stop at nothing to promote the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s will and maintain the secrecy and dominance of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. They view their own deaths and the possibility of becoming undead as the ultimate rewards for their service to Ner'zhul.\nInformation.\nAcolytes can be sent to the &lt;a href=\"Sacrificial%20Pit%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Sacrificial Pit&lt;/a&gt; to turn them into &lt;a href=\"Shade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAcolytes do not need to maintain buildings under construction. Buildings will continue construction on their own (like &lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20franchise\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt; ). \nIn order for Acolytes to summon buildings into existence, they must be built on blighted ground, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haunted%20Gold%20Mine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Haunted Gold Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Blighted ground is created whenever Undead buildings are created or when a Sacrificial Skull is used. The Necropolis and Haunted Gold Mine generate a large patch of blight, whereas all other buildings create smaller patches. Blight also allows Undead units to heal outside of fountains and other healing effects and causes Undead heroes to regenerate health at a much faster rate.\nWhen it comes to defensive building, Acolytes are worst in doing so, because the &lt;a href=\"Ziggurat%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ziggurat&lt;/a&gt; costs a significant amount of gold and upgrading it into the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Spirit Tower&lt;/a&gt; costs even more resources, while the &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Nerubian Tower&lt;/a&gt; doesn't deal enough damage, along with requiring a patch of blighted ground to start off with.\nAcolytes can also unsummon their buildings when the player decides to. This destroys the said building over a short period of time, but the player is granted 50% of the resources used in its construction if it not damaged during unsummoning. Acolytes automatically unsummon a Haunted Gold Mine when it has been depleted of its gold. This is typically useful when the player needs to get some resources in a hurry late-game.\nGenerally, the player will only need Acolytes equal to the amount of gold mines currently in use plus an additional Acolyte. The additional Acolyte is used to assist in building up your base, since taking an Acolyte off the gold mine will slow the rate at which you obtain gold. A second Acolyte may also be trained to become a &lt;a href=\"Shade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt; if necessary.\nSpells and abilities.\nather.\nNotes: Only 5 Acolytes mines gold from Haunted Gold Mine.\nnsummon.\nNotes: Acolytes automatically Unsummon Haunted Gold mines after they are empty.\nIf you are low on resources, unsummon unnecessary buildings. Don't unsummon too much though or you'll find yourself lacking something later on until you can get another gold mine.\nIf an expansion is under attack and cannot be saved, Unsummon the buildings. Though this will yield reduced resources because the enemy is attacking it, some resources returned are better than nothing."}

{"id": "69253", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69253", "title": "Relational DKP", "text": "One central issue of many &lt;a href=\"Loot%20system\"&gt;Loot system&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Fixed%20price\"&gt;Fixed price&lt;/a&gt; systems in particular) is that they provide disproportionate rewards to people who are able to &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; more often. This means that if someone raids maybe half as frequently as more hardcore raid members competing for the same gear, that less-often raider will never be able to get highend gear until the hardcore players have all they want. For some raids this effect is OK (because regular members are crucial to progress), other raids may feel that the ratio of gear to effort should be the same, no matter whether somebody raids 3x/week or 1x/month. In standard &lt;a href=\"Fixed%20price\"&gt;Fixed price&lt;/a&gt; systems the loot order is determined by the current DKP totals - in effect by the difference between DKP earnt and spent by each player. \nA solution to the problem is not to use the difference, but rather the quotient. Each member of a relational DKP (RDKP) system has two scores - his earned points, and his spent points (sometimes also called EP \"Effort Points\" and GP \"Gear Points\"). When loot drops, the quotient of (points earned) divided by (points spent) is used to determine the hierarchy. The person with the highest current quotient who wants the item gets it, and gets their points spent score increased by the item value.\nAdvantages.\nSuch a system will still allow hardcore members to gain first pick most of the time, but will give less frequent raid members a fair chance too. It allows to use the standard rewards - points for attending in-time, bonuses for first kills and learning runs, point expenditure for bank items. RDKP at the same time are fixed-price systems with their inherent drawback (what happens to minor upgrade / sidegrade loot?). Similar to &lt;a href=\"Zero-sum%20DKP\"&gt;Zero-sum DKP&lt;/a&gt; this system also allows newer members to get a few good items fast, but after that keeps a good balance between casual and hardcore players in the same guild: a hardcore player that raids twice as much as a casual player will receive twice as many items.\nThe end result is a system that is fair, simple to understand, and friendly to new raid members.\nExample and comparison to zero sum, fixed price.\nTraditionally, zero sum, fixed price (ZSFP) systems are considered to be most fair to newbies. In reality that's not true, but let's compare for the sake of simplicity a RDKP to ZSFP.\nAssume that Anna runs 3 raids per week, whereas Bob can take part only once a week. Each run yields 30 points, and the average drop costs 60. After 10 weeks, Anna has earned 900 points, Bob only 300. In ZSFP, Anna can win 9 drops (leaving her with 360 points), and still claim first pick over Bob, even if he took not a single item, outranking him on every contested item. If by some stroke of luck Bob managed to grab something, his chance to compete for top of the line drops will be even lower.\nIf the raid was using relational DKP instead, Bob would be able to compete for the second item (after Anna got her first drop). After that, he will at all times be able to compete again when he has won less than one-third of Annas' items. If she had 9 drops, Bob would be able to claim 3 items over her. If he had three, he would be able to call \"first dibs\" after she got her 10th (but then would have to wait until she had 12).\nVariations.\nAs other major DKP systems have variations, Relational DKP systems have their particular flavors as well. One major issue of RDKP is that its memory must not be too good, lest it becomes unfair to longterm members. After a few months, it becomes very difficult for members to significantly change their ratio, because the amount of points earned in a single run is rather small compared to the sums involved in the calculation. Thus most RDKP include some kind of &lt;a href=\"Loot%20system%23Taxes\"&gt;Tax&lt;/a&gt; mechanism."}

Instead of four different types of relics, each one only usable by one class, all relics became usable by any class capable of using a relic.

Whereas some druids seek to command nature or bond with it, the savagekin surrenders himself to the natural world, abandoning much of his humanity to live with the beasts. Those who adopt this role may find they pay a steep price for power.\nSavagekin are druids who spend most of their time in animal form. They travel in packs with their fellow beasts. As animals they gain strength and finesse, but come close to becoming irreversibly feral. Savagekin constantly battle the inner beasts that threaten to consume them, clinging to their last vestiges of sentience.\n&lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;Half-elves&lt;/a&gt;, who straddle the world between &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; are the most common savagekin, though hermitic humans who wish to be closer to the animal world occasionally adopt this class. Most people think of savagekin only as \"druids who've gone feral.\" Savagekin hate species that practice cruelty toward animals (particularly &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, though some &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s qualify), and usually adventure solely to hunt them down and kill them.\nThe savagekin may remain in animal form indefinitely. In addition, returning to his natural (humanoid) form is difficult; savagekin enjoy their wild shapes and prefer remaining in animal form. The savagekin may speak with animals at will, while in wild shape. While in animal form, the savagekin may fly into a rage. A savagekin can invoke the power of tooth and claw. When in animal form, the savagekin\u2019s natural weapons sharpen and his hide toughens. The savagekin can draw upon the feral forces of nature to increase his physical abilities. The savagekin may adopt the shape of her animal companion, if he has one. The savagekin may use wild shape to assume the shape of any animal with which she is familiar."}

{"id": "13740", "revid": "819614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13740", "title": "Saving variables between game sessions", "text": "An addon may need to save settings and data between game sessions - that is, some information may need to persist through a user log out. To enable this, the addons may specify a number of variables to be saved to disk when the player's character logs out of the game, and restored when the character logs back in. Variables that are saved and restored by the client are called SavedVariables.\nSummary: to save a global variable codice_1, add codice_2 or codice_3 to an addon's .toc file.\nSpecifying which variables to save.\nTo tell the WoW client that you want a variable to persist through log out, you need to add it to your addon's .toc file. There are two directives you may add to your .toc file, both should be followed by a colon and a comma-delimited list of variable names in the global environment (for most addons, this means variables that haven't been defined using the local keyword) that the addon wants to persist.\nThe loading process.\nThe variables saved by those directives are not immediately available when your addon loads; instead, they're loaded at a later point. The client fires events to let addons know that their saved variables were loaded. \nAddons should generally use codice_8 to initialize their saved variables; the first argument of the event is the name of the addon for which it is being fired.\nSaving to disk.\nThe client automatically writes the values of the the variables you list in your .toc file to disk when you log out, disconnect, quit the game, or reload your user interface (codice_9).\nIf an addon needs to make last-minute changes before the variables are saved, use the codice_6 event: it fires just before the character logs out, and is the last event before your saved variables are written to disk.\nCode Example.\nTo illustrate the concepts, let's consider a simple addon, HaveWeMet, shown below. The greets your characters when you log on: if it's seen you log into that character before, it outputs \"Hello again, &lt;Character Name&gt;\", and it if has not, it outputs \"Hi; what is your name?\" to the chat frame. When its slash command, /hwm, is used, it tells the player how many characters it has met before.\nThere are two pieces of information that need to persist between sessions: the number of characters the addon has met, and whether it has met any particular character. To save the count, a global variable, codice_11 is used (and saved on a per-account basis through #SavedVariables); while codice_12 is saved per-character and used to determine whether the addon has seen \"this\" character before. When the addon is loaded for the first time, the codice_11 variable will be codice_14 after (assuming no other addon overwrites the global); similarly, when a character previously unknown to the addon is encountered, codice_12 will be codice_14.\nHaveWeMet\\HaveWeMet.toc.\n ## Interface: \n ## Title: Have We Met?\n ## SavedVariables: HaveWeMetCount\n ## SavedVariablesPerCharacter: HaveWeMetLastSeen\n HaveWeMet.lua\nHaveWeMet\\HaveWeMet.lua.\n local frame = CreateFrame(\"Frame\")\n frame:RegisterEvent(\"ADDON_LOADED\")\n frame:RegisterEvent(\"PLAYER_LOGOUT\")\n frame:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", function(self, event, arg1)\n if event == \"ADDON_LOADED\" and arg1 == \"HaveWeMet\" then\n -- Our saved variables, if they exist, have been loaded at this point.\n if HaveWeMetCount == nil then\n -- This is the first time this addon is loaded; set SVs to default values\n HaveWeMetCount = 0\n end\n if HaveWeMetLastSeen == nil then\n -- Haven't yet seen this character, so increment the number of characters met\n HaveWeMetCount = HaveWeMetCount + 1\n print(\"Hi; what is your name?\")\n else\n local name, elapsed = UnitName(\"player\"), time() - HaveWeMetLastSeen\n print(\"Hello again, \" .. name .. \"; you've been gone for \" ..

They have a mana bar which regenerates very slowly. They have two spells, a fire nova, that burns enemies in its radius for approximately 700 damage at 70, and a single-target Fire Blast. Because of their limited mana pool and poor regeneration, it should not be expected that the elemental cast either spell more than 4 times per summon. For the rest of its life, the elemental follows its target and punches them, dealing a varying amount of fire damage. The elemental also has a fiery aura, which burns nearby enemies for small amounts of damage every 2 seconds. Fire elementals are very fragile, and cannot survive attacks even from normal mobs. Much like &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Totem\"&gt;Magma Totem&lt;/a&gt;, this totem is best used when all adds are dealt with.\nThe fire elemental is linked to its totem, and if the totem is killed, so is the elemental. Casting another &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Totem\"&gt;Fire Totem&lt;/a&gt; will also negate the fire elemental. Despite this limitation, the elemental has a long tether, and may cause trouble if it runs off to attack new targets, much like &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Totem\"&gt;Searing Totem&lt;/a&gt;. Elementals move surprisingly fast, and this can cause a moment of panic, but unlike other fire totems it is not aggro-linked to the shaman so if it runs off and attacks a new group it can be dismissed or left to die without pulling adds.\nThe Fire Elemental benefits from 55% of its master\u2019s spell power.\nTips and tactics.\nThe fire elemental can be used against &lt;a href=\"Nethermancer%20Sepethrea\"&gt;Nethermancer Sepethrea&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mechanar\"&gt;Mechanar&lt;/a&gt;, as it is a valid target for her fire elementals to chase and is immune to them.\nAn enhancement Shaman with &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Spirit\"&gt;Feral Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, Healing Spring Totem, Strength of Earth Totem, Windfury Totem and a Fire Elemental totem is one of the best group quests group in the game. The sheer damage output, and the mechanics of Feral Spirit usually bring down all but the toughest of outdoor enemies with relative ease.\nThe Fire Elemental Totem is great for hard burns on boss fights and can often put out a fair amount of extra damage. Because the totem itself is considered a Fire Totem, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Nova\"&gt;Fire Nova&lt;/a&gt; can be used when the totem is up.\nSpeculation.\nIt is not known if either +&lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; gear or Elemental passives that affect critical effects or fire totems benefit the elemental. Considering the fire elemental is not benefited by any party-wide abilities, and seems to be the \"pet\" of the totem, it is doubtful."}

Four domains were created within this primordial realm to serve as ideal environments for each type of elemental. One of the Elemental Plane's domains, a molten domain known as the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, is home to the fire elementals. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nAround three hundred years ago the ambitious and ruthless &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; initiated a war against their dwarven brethren, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;. During this &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to summon a supernatural minion that would turn the tide of the war back to his favor, called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world. To Thaurissan's surprise, and ultimately his doom, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare he could have imagined. Now, freed by Thaurissan's call, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into Azeroth shattered the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation. Many &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; remained within the lower areas of the mountain, especially Blackrock Depths, toiling away at the behest of Ragnaros and his lieutenants. The Firelord and his minions then made war on the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, which served as the seat of power for &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; the black dragon.\nFirst War.\nThe creation of a simulacrum of the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. While these servants can be constructed and controlled by powerful &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, many have proved too difficult to hold in the summoner's power. Should they escape their creator these creatures rage uncontrollably, determined to destroy all those who are like the one that imprisoned them in this domain.\nWhile their watery brethren fall under the domain of the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, these creatures serve no other. They only seek to destroy anything or anyone that they come in contact with. No one knows if these are summoned beings, or the result of some rogue &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt;. The only sure thing is that they are deadly, and seem to take some dark pleasure in the pain they inflict.\nThird War.\nOver time human wizards learned how to call back the Elementals through the art of summoning. The &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt; is one of these liberated Elementals. Consumed by hatred for all organic life, he roams the world he once called home, sewing chaos, wreaking vengeance, and inflicting pain with extreme prejudice.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s death, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; made sure that the involvement of the fire elementals with the Dark Irons was known to the world. In response, the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt; recruited scores of powerful adventurers of the Horde and Alliance to enter the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; and defeat his army and the Firelord himself. Ragnaros and his elementals were banished back into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; and his destructive re-emergence into Azeroth, the Elemental Plane collided with the physical realm and resulted in drastic geographical upheaval, causing chaotic elementals to pour out into the world of Azeroth. With the world still reeling from the disaster, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and his minions joined &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s camp and have made it their goal to set aflame the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, one of the remaining symbols of healing in the shattered lands of Azeroth. In the ensuing conflict, many brave heroes gave their lives to protect Hyjal from destruction. By their noble sacrifices, the impossible was achieved: the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; pushed Ragnaros' minions back into the Firelands.\nThe battle to protect Hyjal then raged in Ragnaros's smoldering realm. As territory was gained and Azeroth's champions edged closer to the Firelands' inner sanctums, a monumental task awaited ahead. Entrenched around Ragnaros's lair -- &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt; -- they had to face his most trusted guardians, including the turncoat &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;mysterious leader&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Firelord's incredible destructive forces, the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the champions eventually destroyed him within his own fortress.\nLegion.\nThe death of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; has left the Firelands in utter chaos. The fire elementals residing there became engaged in an epic battle for supremacy. Eventually &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyroth\"&gt;Pyroth&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhyolith\"&gt;Lord Rhyolith&lt;/a&gt;, would emerge as the top contenders for the position of Firelord.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; attempted to recruit the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20Lord\"&gt;elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and their minions to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Upon witnessing the civil war raging in the Firelands, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; decided to back Smolderon as the new Firelord, as he was more willing to work with mortals over Pyroth. To that end, the Earthen Ring retrieved &lt;a href=\"%3AEmberscar%2C%20Brand%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;:Emberscar, Brand of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; for Smolderon to wield, and then slew Pyroth. Now free to rule uncontested, Smolderon became the new Firelord and accepted the Earthen Ring's plea in exchange for their help. He sent &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Scaldius\"&gt;Baron Scaldius&lt;/a&gt; to represent him at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and to aid the mortals against the invading &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDragonflight.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Unleashed\"&gt;Tempest Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;, many fire elementals were summoned alongside the &lt;a href=\"Raging%20Fire%20Lord\"&gt;Raging Fire Lord&lt;/a&gt; to cause chaos across the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;. After the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, hostile fire elementals were among the enemies encountered there. A number of them were also called forth by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned them as their reinforcements through elemental gateways linked to the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a shaman pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s are able to summon an elemental &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt; that calls forth a greater fire elemental to rain destruction on the caster's enemies.\nIn the RPG.\nThey are beings formed of blazing flames held together to create the appearance of a muscular humanoid torso. Black metal bracers encircle the thing's arms, and its torso trails off into a fiery tail. Fire elementals are beings of hate and cruelty. They enjoy causing pain. Fire elementals ignite all that they touch and consume the air around them. Fire elementals prefer close combat, where they can set their opponents alight and take no damage from the resulting blaze. They initiate combat by suffocating to weaken their enemies before engaging in melee. Cunning foes, fire elementals lure their opponents into dangerous areas, such as dry forests the elemental can set alight. Fire elementals are intelligent enough to attack only those who seem easy targets, and they usually flee when the battle turns against them."}

It takes them less than two days to fully grow. They exhibit much of the same behavior as birds on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nLegends state that the &lt;a href=\"Pureblood%20Fire%20Hawk\"&gt;pureblood line&lt;/a&gt; may be traced back to the very creation of the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. Fire hawks are as wild as any of the creatures in the Plane of Fire, yet there is beauty in their form. While the &lt;a href=\"storm%20crow\"&gt;storm crow&lt;/a&gt;s struggle to fly in the high density air, the fire hawks on that ridge seem to soar with ease. The fire hawks of &lt;a href=\"Fireplume%20Peak\"&gt;Fireplume Peak&lt;/a&gt; can withstand incredible temperatures. While fire hawks are often found circling the skies above, they're also known to swim in molten lava.\nThey are not birds. Certainly, they fly, their wings have appearance of feathers, and even called hawks, but that is where the comparisons to bird stops. In fact, it would appear they have more in common with &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s: an affinity with fire, a solitary nature, and some indications of intelligence. However, they do differ from dragons when it comes to their lifespan. Whereas the dragons can live for millennia on end, these fire hawks live brief lives, passing quickly from egg to adulthood in 2 days after birth to death. In the &lt;a href=\"Fireplume%20Peak\"&gt;Fireplume Peak&lt;/a&gt; volcano the fire hawks make their home. The &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Hawk%20Matriarch\"&gt;Fire Hawk Matriarch&lt;/a&gt; and her eggs can be found at the top.

This totals to 297 FR unbuffed. When buffed with either +70 FR from a Paladin's fire aura or shaman's fire resistance totem, you will comfortably arrive at 367 FR (365 FR is the cap, anything over is wasted). This gear set is recommended because it allows using almost completely epic gear, generally carrying the most stamina, when using as few pieces as possible. As the adds during the Illidan fight can crit, using as few pieces of FR gear allows the rest of the gear to make up the much needed 490 defense skill needed to be crit immune."}

They bite, they spin webs, they spit burning venom, and they capture their prey in cocoons of searing silk for later consumption. The fire spiders grow to huge sizes \u2014 the 12-foot-long ones in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt; are actually the small ones. Fire spider venom is boiling hot, and the fluid they use to spin their webs is unbelievably viscous.\n&lt;a href=\"Beth%27tilac\"&gt;Beth'tilac&lt;/a&gt;, the enormous matriarch of the Cinderweb brood, and her merciless offspring feed by sucking the magma and fire from the corpses of &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. Not only are the Cinderweb spiders vicious and predatory, their numbers appear to be endless. The &lt;a href=\"Cinderweb%20Spinner\"&gt;Cinderweb Spinner&lt;/a&gt;s appear to be the caretakers of Beth'tilac's brood, and they lay their eggs among the stone pillars of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Clutch\"&gt;Widow's Clutch&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;. Cinderweb eggs are squishy, gel-like sacs in which tiny spiders incubate.\nFire spiders are not allied with &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in a literal sense, but they are still a danger to the cause of the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and should be treated as such.\nThe blisteringly hot &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Hatchling\"&gt;molten hatchlings&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; camouflage themselves by blending in with oozing magma."}

The nearby &lt;a href=\"Firebeard%20Cemetery\"&gt;Firebeard Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; is located to the west.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; launched surprised attacks all over the Highlands, Firebeard's Patrol was one of the Wildhammer settlements most damaged by it. The Hammer made the &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Breach\"&gt;Devouring Breach&lt;/a&gt; appear, tilting the dwarven town a little while &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s oust from the rift attacking the dwarves. Amidst the chaos though, the Firebeards were one of the few who kept their heads straight. &lt;a href=\"Keegan%20Firebeard\"&gt;Keegan Firebeard&lt;/a&gt; led the defense of the town forming lines on all sides of the settlement to keep back the enemy. The battle was fierce, there were only a handful of dwarves, and they were getting tired by the fighting. Keegan decided to split into shifts, one hour of rest for every hour on the lines.\nThe town had been hit hard and much lied in ruins while some of the buildings still standing were in flames. Despite Keegan saying no matter what happened to their home they would keep fighting even if all that was left were ruins, he preferred that not be the case so he sent people to set the fires out. While some of the dwarven citizens were running frantically across the town, a group found refuge in one of the buildings. In doing so, they left some of their belongings in their ruined homes. An &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; helped them to keep the line, extinguish some of the fires and find some of their lost belongings.\n&lt;a href=\"Iain%20Firebeard\"&gt;Iain Firebeard&lt;/a&gt;, who was at the &lt;a href=\"Firebeard%20Cemetery\"&gt;Firebeard Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; to the west, was tasked by Keegan to reform a wing of &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s from whatever scattered forces he could find. With the help of the adventurer he managed to do so, including getting some recently made weapons from &lt;a href=\"Brom%20Forgehammer\"&gt;Brom Forgehammer&lt;/a&gt;. Although the &lt;a href=\"Doyle%20clan\"&gt;Doyles&lt;/a&gt; had fallen and the &lt;a href=\"Thundermar%20clan\"&gt;Thundermars&lt;/a&gt; were not answering their pledges of help, Iain still managed to get the help of the &lt;a href=\"Mullan%20clan\"&gt;Mullan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moore%20clan\"&gt;Moore&lt;/a&gt; clans. While doing that, the forces of Keegan at Firebeard's Patrol manage to push back the elementals and were prepared to make their last stand.\nWith the gryphon riders ready, the Firebeards alongside the Mullans and the Moores led a counterattack against the Twilight's Hammer forces in the Devouring Breach killing the Hammer minions stationed there, including their leader &lt;a href=\"Servias%20Windterror\"&gt;Servias Windterror&lt;/a&gt;. With that, Firebeard's Patrol and the nearby areas were liberated from the Twilight's Hammer's control."}

It was created eons ago by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of imprisoning most of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThe Firelands are the molten domain forged by the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s to house the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and his wayward minions. Following &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s emergence into Azeroth, Ragnaros and his servants surged onto the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; before being driven back by the sacred mountain's valiant defenders. Ragnaros then rallied his loyalists to defend the Firelands from Azeroth's champions.\nIn the ages since the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s ordered Azeroth, the Firelands served as a prison - not only for the mighty Firelord, Ragnaros, but also for the flame-born legions who serve him without question. The elementals had spent the innumerable years of their imprisonment reveling in the chaos innate to their being, until the Cataclysm ruptured the barriers between the Firelands and Azeroth. With the world still reeling from the disaster, Ragnaros and his minions have made it their goal to set aflame the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, one of the remaining symbols of healing in the shattered lands of Azeroth.\nVictory against the Firelord's servants is a possibility, however slim. While the druids of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and their allies work to establish a permanent foothold in the Firelands at the Molten Front, brave heroes fighting under the banner of the Avengers of Hyjal hope to push through the gates of Ragnaros's lair, &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and face off against the Firelord himself. Ragnaros bristles with unfathomable powers within the safety of his bastion, a far cry from his \"borrowed\" sanctuary in Blackrock Mountain's &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. Here, surrounded by hand-picked followers and cradled amid the sweltering heat that boils forth from the ground and sky, he is an elemental lord in his prime. If Ragnaros cannot be defeated, then a conflagration unlike anything ever seen will erupt from the Firelands and engulf the whole of Azeroth in fire and ash for millennia to come.\nFor ages, the Elemental Plane served its purpose as a secure realm to imprison Azeroth's primordial spirits... until the Cataclysm ruptured its boundaries. Without warning, Ragnaros's armies surged toward Mount Hyjal, intent on burning the World Tree of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; to the ground. In the ensuing conflict, many brave heroes gave their lives to protect Hyjal from destruction. By their noble sacrifices, the impossible was achieved: the Guardians of Hyjal pushed Ragnaros's minions back into the Firelands.\nNow, the battle to protect Hyjal rages in Ragnaros's smoldering realm. As territory is gained and Azeroth's champions edge closer to the Firelands' inner sanctums, a monumental task lies ahead. Entrenched around Ragnaros's lair -- Sulfuron Keep -- are his most trusted guardians, including the turncoat &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;mysterious leader&lt;/a&gt;. Yet Hyjal's defenders cannot afford to shy away from any of these dangers. Should Ragnaros prevail against the incursion and succeed in destroying Nordrassil, Azeroth will suffer a blow from which it might never recover.\nAs Malfurion Stormrage rallied Hyjal's defenders in a massive counterattack, the Circle stormed into the Firelands. Soon, the Circle was reinforced by the Alliance and Horde who pushed further into the Firelands until they reached Sulfuron Keep. Ultimately, Ragnaros fell before the might of Azeroth's champions.\nLegion.\nThe death of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; has left the Firelands in utter chaos. The elementals residing there became engaged in an epic battle for supremacy. Eventually &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyroth\"&gt;Pyroth&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhyolith\"&gt;Lord Rhyolith&lt;/a&gt;, would emerge as the top contenders for the position of Firelord.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; attempted to recruit the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20Lord\"&gt;elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and their minions to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Upon witnessing the civil war raging in the Firelands, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; ordered his forces to scout the area and learn about the two leaders. After learning that Smolderon was more willing to work with mortals over Pyroth, the Farseer decided to back Smolderon as the new Firelord, as he was more willing to work with mortals over Pyroth. To that end, the Earthen Ring retrieved &lt;a href=\"%3AEmberscar%2C%20Brand%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;:Emberscar, Brand of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; for Smolderon to wield, and then slew Pyroth. Now free to rule uncontested, Smolderon became the new Firelord and accepted the Earthen Ring's plea in exchange for their help. He sent &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Scaldius\"&gt;Baron Scaldius&lt;/a&gt; to represent him at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and to aid the mortals against the invading &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Cult of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; were attempting to revive &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, because they saw &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; as a weak leader for the Dark Irons. They were stopped by an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anvil-Thane%20Thurgaden\"&gt;Anvil-Thane Thurgaden&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to the Firelands to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and weren't initially aware of the cult's existence. However, the cult's apparent leader &lt;a href=\"High%20Justice%20Grimstone\"&gt;High Justice Grimstone&lt;/a&gt; still lives.\nAs part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Alliance War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anvil-Thane%20Thurgaden\"&gt;Anvil-Thane Thurgaden&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; summoned a &lt;a href=\"magma%20giant\"&gt;magma giant&lt;/a&gt; from the Firelands and sent it to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Bonanza\"&gt;Bilgewater Bonanza&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; warned Thurgaden to be careful with the summoning, and the thane acknowledged that he is not as foolish as &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; was when he summoned &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Portalkeeper%20Cimbra\"&gt;Portalkeeper Cimbra&lt;/a&gt; trained in the Firelands. After the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, many fire elementals were called forth by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned them as their reinforcements through elemental gateways linked to the Firelands. After Cimbra joined the Primalists, he was later defeated by the adventurer, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, and reminisced that the Firelands was not so hot.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, thought to &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; to have been eradicated, re-emerged on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and allied with the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris thinks that some must have escaped into the Firelands and rekindled their cult.\nGeography.\nThe ash-choked Firelands is the least hospitable of the elemental domains. What serves as air in this harsh place is laden with scalding, noxious fumes. The only safe havens from the Firelands' ever-churning magma ocean are islands of jagged rock. Yet even the dangers of this merciless landscape pale in comparison to the raging fury of the elementals who dwell there. Despite this, the apparently uninhabitable land houses an ecosystem of its own, beyond elemental beings.\nThe fire spider brood of &lt;a href=\"Beth%27tilac\"&gt;Beth'tilac&lt;/a&gt; sate their appetites by sucking the magma and fire from the corpses of elementals. They can be observed catching &lt;a href=\"Molten%20giant\"&gt;Molten giant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20hawk\"&gt;Fire hawk&lt;/a&gt;s with their webs. The &lt;a href=\"Hell%20hound\"&gt;Hell hound&lt;/a&gt;s were the only things not being webbed or eaten by the spiders, but rather are trying to get at the spider eggs. The hellhounds can also be observed eating one of the &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker\"&gt;Flamewaker&lt;/a&gt; trappers. The &lt;a href=\"fire%20turtle\"&gt;fire turtle&lt;/a&gt;s are eating the scorpions. The local flora, which may either be native or imported and transformed by Druids of the Flame, appears to draw nutrition from molten lava.\nIn Cataclysm.\nIn World of Warcraft, the Firelands became accessible in the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\". Players can enter it through several &lt;a href=\"flamegate\"&gt;flamegate&lt;/a&gt;s found in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; which Ragnaros and his minions have invaded. The places within the Firelands can roughly be divided in three categories:\nIn the RPG.\nDeep beneath the earth and &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; lurks the Firelands, a place of heat and ash. Although it is a harsh land, visitors can survive, for in one of those cruel paradoxes that define the universe, fire needs air to live and fuel to feed upon. Within the Firelands, these things exist in a constant cyclical state, with the very ash itself gradually transforming into fuel for future burnings.\nIn the center of a vast lake of fire stands &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the home of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;. Until comparatively recently, he ruled his underground land with an iron fist. Three hundred years ago, he was summoned to fight in the dwarven civil war known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. This reckless act sundered the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and created Blackrock Spire. Now, in a greatly weakened state, he lies at the bottom of that volcano on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, striving to find a way home. Meanwhile, in Sulfuron Keep and elsewhere across the Firelands, his elemental princes battle constantly for dominance.\nThe Firelands occupy the theoretical bottom of the \"sphere\" of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. Just as the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; sits atop the plane, in a sort of bowl shape, the Firelands sit in the bottom of a similar curve. The \"ground\" underneath the surface is a sticky, bubbling mess of tar, ooze and rock fallen from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, which of course serves as the \"sky.\" In some places, lakes of flammable oil and combustibles form, burning constantly and filling the air with superheated smoke.

The clan was one of many that were left behind on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s, but the Thunderlords later rallied under &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;new banner&lt;/a&gt;. In the current day, the clan appears to be defunct, its members having been transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe clan had strong ties to both the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%27s%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Lightning's Blade clan&lt;/a&gt;s and was known for its skilled &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nRoughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, some of the orcs who migrated out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; settled in the bleak and icy region of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, among them the Thunderlords. The clan draws its name from an ancient chieftain who single-handedly slew a powerful &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; at the pinnacle of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Peak%20%28Draenor%29\"&gt;Thunder Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe orcs were once enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of Frostfire. In the time of the Thunderlord's formation, just as the orcs began winning their freedom from the ogres, the ancient &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; were said to be granted their powers from powerful &lt;a href=\"shamanstone\"&gt;shamanstone&lt;/a&gt;s. These stones granted the orcs with the blessings of frost and fire, which aided the Thunderlords in their liberation. During this time, an orc by the name of &lt;a href=\"Brakor\"&gt;Brakor&lt;/a&gt; wielded the legendary &lt;a href=\"%3AGronnsbane\"&gt;:Gronnsbane&lt;/a&gt;, a spear blessed by the shamanstones of frost and fire and dipped in the blood of one of the ancient black &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Stonefury%20Cliffs\"&gt;Stonefury Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;. The tales indicate that the weapon grew in power after that point, but that its power faded after leaving Brakor's hands.\nRise of the Horde.\nRoughly 11 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest son of the Frostwolf chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;, abandoned the Frostwolves and instead joined the rival Thunderlords. In his new clan, he earned the renown he craved and eventually became the clan's chieftain.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s began seizing large tracts of land from the orcs of Frostfire with an army of &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20clan\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; half-breeds, Garad called upon the Thunderlords and Whiteclaws to unite with the Frostwolves against this new threat. Due to Fenris' influence, the Thunderlords rejected Garad's call for unity, and instead decided to deal with the Bladespire in their own way. Teams of Thunderlord orcs conducted nightly raids on ogre settlements, slaughtering young and old alike.\nThe Thunderlords were present at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; announced the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; as the enemies of the orcs. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Thunderlords were among the clans assigned to act as scouts, raiders, and auxiliary forces that could quickly move from one region of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to another. Later, the Thunderlords were present during the drinking of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; atop the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few years later, Blackhand tasked the Frostwolves, Thunderlords, and Whiteclaws with wiping out Draenor's gronn, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the ogres that had refused to join the Horde. The Frostwolves and Whiteclaws saw no honor in hunting the giants down and held most of their warriors back, but Fenris and his Thunderlords did not shy away from the task and reveled in the slaughter of their ancient enemies. One of the few gronn to escape the onslaught was named &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to fend off multiple Thundelord assaults from his lair in the mountains of Gorgrond. Casualties grew so great that Fenris eventually abandoned the attacks.\nAfter the Horde had conquered much of Draenor, the threat of starvation caused many orcs to grow more agitated and turn on each other, clashing in short-lived battles that left hundreds dead. Several clans, among them the Thunderlords, completely lost themselves to the depths of madness. To protect the rest of the Horde, Blackhand banished the violent clans from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the remote areas of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in order to preserve some of the Horde's dwindling strength.\nWhen the Horde prepared to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand ordered the troublesome clans to remain on Draenor, since he believed that they would become liabilities if allowed to participate in the invasion. He knew that the clans would grow restless on Draenor, but a few months of waiting while hearing only stories of the lush new world and seeing only scraps of the war spoils would force them to be on their best behavior. If the clans were still uncontrollable, they could stay on Draenor and rot, for all Blackhand cared. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the new Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; sent messengers to Draenor to call up the remaining clans in order to replenish the Horde's numbers, but the messengers later returned to inform the Warchief that the clans on Draenor had descended deeper into bloodlust and had begun fighting with one another, allowing only a few orcs and ogres to bolster the Horde.\nAt some point, the Thunderlord &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grandmaster%20Vorpil\"&gt;Vorpil&lt;/a&gt; became a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nFollowing the Horde's defeat on Azeroth at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul rallied the clans still left on Draenor, the Thunderlords among them, under his &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;new banner&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of opening portals to new worlds for the Horde to conquer. The gathered chieftains easily agreed to Ner'zhul's plans; having sat out the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and Second Wars, they thirsted for battle, and any chance to escape their dying homeworld was worth taking. By this time, Fenris was captain of the remaining orcish &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;wolfriders&lt;/a&gt; and was eager to lead his clan to glorious battle in the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; lands. Almost immediately after Ner'zhul reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; chieftain &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; led the Warsong, &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt;, Thunderlord and &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt; in an invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; led a group of &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s and orcs, including Chieftain Fenris, away from the Blasted Lands in search of the artifacts that would allow Ner'zhul to open portals to new worlds.\nSome Thunderlord warriors were sent by the death knight &lt;a href=\"Gaz%20Soulripper\"&gt;Gaz Soulripper&lt;/a&gt; to escort Teron, Fenris, and &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; when they went to negotiate with &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, as well as when part of the raiding party sailed to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in search of the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the artifacts were retrieved, the hunting party returned to the Blasted Lands. Fenris left &lt;a href=\"Malgrim%20Stormhand\"&gt;Malgrim Stormhand&lt;/a&gt; behind as part of the forces guarding the Dark Portal while he and the rest of the Thunderlords returned to Draenor.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nFenris' ultimate fate is unknown, but he was eventually succeeded as chieftain by &lt;a href=\"Garm%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Garm Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt;, who was the last Thunderlord chieftain according to &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the Thunderlords were transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s through the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. Their village of &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Stronghold\"&gt;Thunderlord Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; was abandoned, and the Bladespire ogres soon moved in and claimed it for themselves. The ogres inhabited the stronghold for a time until the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; arrived and pushed them out to use the stronghold as a base of operations.\nWhile fighting the nearby Bladespire ogres, Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s came across several artifacts from the Thunderlord clan and brought them to &lt;a href=\"Rokgah%20Bloodgrip\"&gt;Rokgah Bloodgrip&lt;/a&gt;. Rokgah informed the adventurer that she had previously sent several others to search for the relics, but with little luck. After temporarily transforming the adventurer's spirit into a vision guide in order to reveal the location of the final artifact, the hero was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Draenethyst%20Mine\"&gt;Draenethyst Mine&lt;/a&gt;, now occupied by &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul%20clan\"&gt;Bloodmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres, to obtain &lt;a href=\"The%20Thunderspike\"&gt;The Thunderspike&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Gor%20Grimgut\"&gt;Gor Grimgut&lt;/a&gt;. When the hero returned to Thunderlord Stronghold with the spear, Rokgah informed them why the artifacts were so significant: once all five were obtained, the Horde's right to the ownership of the stronghold would be secured through the appeasement of its dead spirits. Rokgah handed over the artifacts to appease the ghosts, and the spirits of Garm Wolfbrother, &lt;a href=\"Lobo\"&gt;Lobo&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Clan%20Sub-Chief\"&gt;sub-chiefs&lt;/a&gt; appeared. Garm told the adventurer that by recovering the clan's artifacts, by taking up the fight against the Bladespire and their gronn masters and by returning the Thunderspike to Garm's hand, they had earned the Thunderlord clan's blessing and the right for the Horde to inhabit the Thunderlords' ancestral home. Garm told the hero to aid Rexxar in securing the Horde's future in the mountains and that only by forcing the ogres into submission and slaying their master, Gruul, would the Horde forces be safe. Finally, Garm told the hero to inform Rexxar of the whereabouts of his people, the mok'nathal, and that they were in danger.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nOne survivor of the clan named &lt;a href=\"Erak%20the%20Aloof\"&gt;Erak&lt;/a&gt; appeared on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;'s Great Hunt along with &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt;. He was later killed by &lt;a href=\"Headhunter%20Jo\"&gt;Headhunter Jo&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nUnlike the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw&lt;/a&gt; clans, the Thunderlords valued acts of bravery and valor above all others and sought to dominate the land rather than adapting to their environment. They roamed the frozen wastes of Frostfire Ridge in huge packs, often embarking on dangerous adventures to hunt Frostfire's fearsome &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;. A single gronn kill could sustain them for weeks, but when a hunt failed, the orcs would suffer great hardship. A brave and cunning people, the Thunderlords' culture was greatly focused on synergy, and they derived strength from their togetherness, though there were still those who strived to become like &lt;a href=\"Brakor\"&gt;Brakor&lt;/a&gt; and other such ancestral heroes of legend. The Thunderlords relied on their numbers and spent their days training to hunt as a team, but as individuals they were weak. The Frostwolf chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the Thunderlords were willing to lose ten orcs for every gronn they killed, and that they considered no sacrifice too great in the pursuit of victory.\nThe Thunderlords were the greatest big game hunters in all of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. For centuries they used riding beasts and coordinated assaults to slay game and gronn alike. Known for their mastery of beasts, the clan used numbers and tactics to conquer animals of all types, from raising &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s as air support and wrangling &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; for pack animals to shackling and subjugating &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s and even gronn.\nMuch like the Frostwolves, the Thunderlords were known to engage in seasonal migration. The clan constructed their hunting halls from the bones of the long-dead &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s who once roamed Draenor. It was said that the last colossal was killed by the Thunderlords generations ago, and that the Thunderlord capital of &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gar\"&gt;Grom'gar&lt;/a&gt; had been constructed from its corpse. The similar location of &lt;a href=\"Colossal%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Colossal's Fall&lt;/a&gt; was considered sacred by the clan, as the orcs claimed that they were the ones to have felled it many decades ago. However, these claims are doubtful, as the last colossals were already long dead by the time that mortal civilizations arose on Draenor.\nThe clan was known to possess five powerful artifacts: the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Clan%20Artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Clan%20Drum\"&gt;drum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Clan%20Arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Clan%20Tablet\"&gt;tablet&lt;/a&gt; and the great spear known as &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Thunderspike\"&gt;:the Thunderspike&lt;/a&gt;. Amazingly, the fletchings on the arrow remain mostly intact to the present day, a testament to the skill of the Thunderlord hunters.\nIn Warcraft II.\nManual.\nLeader: &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris the Hunter&lt;/a&gt;\nColor: Violet\nThe Thunderlord clan has strong ties to both the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%27s%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Lightning's Blade&lt;/a&gt; clans. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, rose to power through the Thunderlord clan. Fenris, captain of the remaining &lt;a href=\"Raider\"&gt;Wolfriders&lt;/a&gt; and Chieftain of the Thunderlords is eager to lead his clan to glorious battle in the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; lands.\nCampaign.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;'s return to Draenor, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt; to influence warriors from the Thunderlord clan to join in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt;, who possessed the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Slayer\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; was sent to help rally the Thunderlords and destroy the Bonechewers with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly afterward, Ner'zhul met with opposition to his plans from both Fenris and the Bonechewer chieftain &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar&lt;/a&gt;, as they desired to journey to Azeroth and have their clans triumph where Orgrim Doomhammer had failed. Ner'zhul did not share this vision and sent the Slayer to lead the Shadowmoon forces against the two chieftains' strongholds and \"remove\" them and their clans in order to prevent them from interfering with his schemes.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Draenor campaign&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt; sought to betray their Horde allies and gain dominance over the northern clans of Draenor. The clan asked the Alliance forces to secure the passes across the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and destroy the Thunderlord stronghold in the area. In return, the Laughing Skull would grant the Alliance the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, which the orcs had stolen from Ner'zhul's stronghold some time earlier.\nSpeculation.\nSince the spirits of Garm Wolfbrother and his companions are depicted with brown skin, it's possible that there are uncorrupted survivors of the Thunderlord clan among the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having been forced to join the Fel Horde, the Thunderlord have no representation among the various NPCs that show up; leaving it unknown where their clan is stationed, or if they still exist.\nFenris is the only Second War-era chieftain whose fate is entirely unknown, last seen returning to Draenor through the Dark Portal. While the existence of Garm as the chieftain infers that his clan looked to new leadership, it's unclear if he abdicated the position or died. Furthermore, two orcs with the surname \"Wolfbrother\" also show up in Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Durkot%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Durkot Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Omakka%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Omakka Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt;. While both serve rather minor roles, Durkot notably continues the Thunderlord traditions of animal husbandry. He also works with the Warsong; which is who the Thunderlords that were left behind on Azeroth were stationed to aid. It is unknown if these two simply share a last name, which is uncommon, or are children of Fenris (or Garm) as well.\nFenris had three sons in the alternate , &lt;a href=\"Hatock%20the%20Gronnmaster\"&gt;Hatock the Gronnmaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grotan%20the%20Herald\"&gt;Grotan the Herald&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skal%20the%20Trapper\"&gt;Skal the Trapper&lt;/a&gt;. Given they're fully grown orcs, if they existed in the main universe, they would have been adults by the time of the Second War. Nothing is seen of them, however, and Garm is not mentioned at all in the alternate universe. As a result, it's unknown if these sons existed, or if they were possibly replaced by the other three Wolfbrothers seen in the main universe."}

For centuries they have used riding beasts and coordinated assaults to slay game and gronn alike. Their clan draws their name from an ancient chieftain who single-handedly slew a powerful gronn at the pinnacle of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Peak%20%28Draenor%29\"&gt;Thunder Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is rumored that the last of &lt;a href=\"earth%20giant%20%28Draenor%29\"&gt;Draenor's colossals&lt;/a&gt; was taken down by the Thunderlord clan generations ago, and that the clan built their home in its &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gar\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;. Similar skeletons can be found at &lt;a href=\"Colossal%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Colossal's Fall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agurak%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Agurak's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. The Thunderlord regard Colossal's Fall as a sacred location, claiming it was their clan who felled that Colossal many decades ago.\nIn ancient times the Thunderlords were enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of Frostfire. During this time of enslavement, the Thunderlords would come to revere a warrior named &lt;a href=\"Brakor\"&gt;Brakor&lt;/a&gt; as a hero. At an unknown point in history, the Thunderlords successfully rebelled against their ogre masters and secured their freedom.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Thunderlords answered the call for orcish unity joined the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, where they supplied their allies with beasts such as &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Steps\"&gt;fall of the Bladespire citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the clan besieged &lt;a href=\"Wor%27gol\"&gt;Wor'gol&lt;/a&gt;, the Frostwolves' home, but were pushed back by the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; and their new allies in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Following the assault on Wor'gol &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ga'nar's&lt;/a&gt; sought justice for his dead clansmen. To that end he rallied his forces and ensured the sons of the Iron Wolf (&lt;a href=\"Hatock\"&gt;Hatock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grotan\"&gt;Grotan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skal\"&gt;Skal&lt;/a&gt;) were killed.\nDespite the setback at Wor'gol, the Thunderlords continued their offensive against the Frostwolves by striking at &lt;a href=\"Stonefang%20Outpost\"&gt;Stonefang Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Though the underestimating village's resilience. the Thunderlords were able to take many of the villagers prisoner where they placed them in the &lt;a href=\"Boneslag\"&gt;Boneslag&lt;/a&gt;. However &lt;a href=\"Karg%20Bloodfury\"&gt;Karg Bloodfury&lt;/a&gt; was transported to &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gar\"&gt;Grom'gar&lt;/a&gt;, which turned out to be an error when he was liberated and struck back at the Thunderlords. \nSeeking to put an end to the Thunderlords the Frostwolf clan and the Horde would move in and strike at their leader, the Iron Wolf. To the shock of the Frostwolf clan the Iron Wolf turned out to be Durotan's and Ga'nar's older brother. Refusing to surrender Fenris engaged his enemies in a fierce fight and was ultimately slain. After Fenris's death, the Thunderlord clan backed by the Iron Horde attempted to breach the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Frostwolf clan awaited and stopped their progression. In the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;ensuring battle&lt;/a&gt; the Thunderlords and their allies would be defeated, with &lt;a href=\"Malgrim%20Stormhand%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Malgrim Stormhand&lt;/a&gt; killed and the closing of the pass by of the Frostwolf clan.\nWith the deaths of Fenris, his sons, and his second in command it was unknown who, if anyone, led the Thunderlord clan for the duration of the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;War in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their loses in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; the Thunderlords remained a committed part of the Iron Horde. They were personally responsible for the captured of the &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oshir\"&gt;Oshir&lt;/a&gt; and were tasked with breaking and training beasts for the Iron Horde within the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt;. They were responsible for breaking the gronn &lt;a href=\"Durn%20the%20Hungerer%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Durn the Hungerer&lt;/a&gt;, who was subsequently tasked with protecting &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter 's defeat, it is assumed the Thunderlord join the rest of Draenor in recovery.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn time, the Thunderlord clan joined with the other &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mag'har orc clans&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Warchief Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. As the Mag'har and [[Lightbound]] [[war between the Lightbound and the Mag'har|clashed]], events on [[Azeroth]] would see to a [[Fourth War|new war]] between the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]]. In the midst of this, [[Eitrigg]] sought to travel to the [[Draenor (alternate universe)|alternate Draenor]] and call upon the debt the Mag'har owed to the Horde for liberating them from [[Garrosh Hellscream]]'s meddling and the [[Burning Legion]]'s corruption.\nAs the entire Lightbound army was marching towards the Mag'har, Grommash ordered for the Mag'har to follow Geya'rah and fallback to Azeroth.

After their arrival on Azeroth, Overlord Geya'rah took her place as leader of the Mag'har and pledged the loyalty of her people to [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner]] and the [[Horde]].\nReferences.\n[[Category:Thunderlord clan| ]]\n[[Category:Alternate universe organizations\u200e]]\n[[pl:Thunderlord Clan (alternate universe)]]"}

He was a well-respected &lt;a href=\"Commoner\"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt; of the town and an old friend of &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Kella%20Nightbow\"&gt;Huntress Kella Nightbow&lt;/a&gt;. He graciously served as the elder of Auberdine, offering sage and just stewardship of the day to day affairs of the village.\nHistory.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Smith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Stilwell\"&gt;Jordan Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; was helping Thundris with something. The &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; didn't strike him as an impudent man.\nObserving the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, Thundris noticed a shrine with a strange blue aura. Later, he sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to find the source of the aura in the ruins, overrun with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic minions who fed on the magical energies there, but avoided the shrine.\n&lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; told him about the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; persisting in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; who also wielded their ancient &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al implements. Thundris sent adventurers to the ruins to recover the &lt;a href=\"Highborne%20Relic%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Highborne Relic&lt;/a&gt;, intending to have them appropriated and destroyed. As soon as he was handled them, he felt as if he could almost feel the taint of foul Highborne magic upon them, though he considered it a figment of his imagination. As a thanks, he casted a druid spell to briefly empower the adventurer.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Terenthis\"&gt;Terenthis&lt;/a&gt; assessed the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20tribe\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, he sent them to Thundris who was dealing not only with the forest dwellers, but also with their corruption. As the &lt;a href=\"Cliffspring%20River\"&gt;Cliffspring River&lt;/a&gt; began turning foul and corrupted, Thundris feared the wash would affect Auberdine. He suspected the Blackwood furbolgs up-river were the cause of the taint, and that they weren't the true root of it. As such, he gave adventurers a &lt;a href=\"Empty%20Sampling%20Tube\"&gt;sampling tube&lt;/a&gt; in order to draw a sample from a waterfall pool in the north. He hoped the sample would \nhelp the elves formalize a plan of attack, as well as to confirm the source of corruption being from &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, one that he has seen in the past. He also hoped Auberdine would be able to enact a cure for it.\nWith the source of the furbolgs' corruption being confirmed as coming from the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, he sent adventurers to fill a &lt;a href=\"Empty%20Cleansing%20Bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt; at their &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; and take samples of the furbolgs' food from their northern camp. After mixing them, furbolgs were cleansed just long enough to lure out the satyr corruptor, &lt;a href=\"Xabraxxis\"&gt;Xabraxxis&lt;/a&gt;. After the satyr was killed, adventurers took his &lt;a href=\"%3ATalisman%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;:Talisman of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for the plight of the furbolgs, to Thundris in order to dispose of it.\nIn Jordan Stilwell's stead, a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; asked Thundris for a Kor gem. The elf directed them to find the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt;. Once in his possession, Thundris was able to purify &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Kor%20Gem\"&gt;Corrupted Kor Gem&lt;/a&gt;s for the blacksmith, and mentionned that he trust their kind more than some of his kin, as he do not judge the entire order on the actions of just &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;one of their fallen kind&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the events on the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, he was visited by a &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sent by Kella. He promised them to send aid to &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Paetheus\"&gt;Anchorite Paetheus&lt;/a&gt; after speaking with townspeople and the Sentinels.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Raene%20Wolfrunner\"&gt;Raene Wolfrunner&lt;/a&gt; pulled Thundris from harm's way.

Her father is the half-brother of Varok and Broxigar, having the same mother but different fathers.\nBiography.\nThura was only a child during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, but when Broxigar returned as the only survivor from helping to hold a vital mountain pass against hordes of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, even she could sense his survivor's guilt. When she came of &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; age and proved her skills, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; himself gave her the &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Axe of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, the enchanted wooden axe Brox wielded in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; after he had traveled to the past. The axe had been left with Thrall by &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;. Brox's only other living relative that could have been given the weapon was her other uncle, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, as her cousin &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; had recently died (&lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. One of the Saurfangs might have been given the axe before her, but Thrall's most trusted &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; had seen in a dream that it should go to Thura. No one knew why the dream had occurred, but Thrall had listened to it, and Thura felt honored to wield such a fabled weapon.\nThura had been given false dreams about Broxigar's death, in which &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; killed him. She believed that they were showing her the truth, and thus declaring a blood oath. She decided to avenge her uncle and kill Malfurion. Not long after, Thura entered a &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; forest, where she found, and started following two night elves and a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe had reached the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; thanks to &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt;, who she \"convinced\" to take her there. After parting with him, she eventually found the tree into which Malfurion was transformed, and after struggling with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, Thura was able to cut him with her axe, freeing him by doing so. It was later revealed that it was Malfurion himself who showed her those dreams, doing so in order to make her go after him and free himself from his entrapment in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. He did not like deceiving her, but the Axe of Cenarius was the only thing that could have saved him. It was then she realized that she was tricked into doing so, and, after the capture of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and the awakening of Malfurion, she was teleported out of the Nightmare together with Tyrande, Lucan and &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;. They got attacked by &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt; and fell into nightmares, where she dreamt about Thrall as he executed her for her failures. Then Lucan teleported all of them into Emerald Dream and from there into &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, where the group met &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who when he saw Thura, he wanted to attack her, though Varian was calmed down by Broll. Then she accompanied the group into an inn where a night elven ambassador lived and who had a &lt;a href=\"hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; connected to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Broll teleported there and Thura with Lucan helped Tyrande to calm the ambassador. Lucan teleported out of there, though the trio materialized in the Nightmare. There, the trio became prisoners of &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted her axe. Thanks to Tyrande, Lucan was able to teleport her, though the axe and Tyrande remained within the Nightmare.\nHer axe was the only thing that could hurt the Nightmare Lord, who was actually &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, so he desperately wanted to deprive her of it. He managed to do so, but she got it back later with Broll's help, and when Malfurion was striking the final blow to Xavius, she helped him by chopping into the shadow tree in the Emerald Dream, while he was attacking it on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. With three mighty swings on the critical spot, Malfurion showed her, she killed Xavius's shadow tree and he died quickly after that.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; was contained in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion delivered her back to her people, letting Thrall, his old compatriot, know of her significance in their struggle. At her request, she was the bearer of a message of well wishes from him to Tyrande's and Malfurion's wedding.\nDragonflight.\nYears later, Thura went to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; to attend Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. There, she stated she wanted to reconnect with others of her clan, in particular &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt;; the latter of whom she commented briefly on his transformation into a &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt;, since she last met him several years prior. She was seen with them throughout the rest of the festival. She continues to wield the Axe of Cenarius upon her back.\nParentage.\nWhile Thura is clearly listed as niece of &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, there is no listing of her parents. &lt;a href=\"Richard%20A.%20Knaak\"&gt;Richard A. Knaak&lt;/a&gt; confirmed in an interview with WoW Insider that the information about her parents was deliberately omitted in \"&lt;a href=\"Stormrage\"&gt;Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Speaking of Thura -- she's Broxigar's niece. Who's her father?\nKnaak: That's something that we haven't fully -- we can't answer that right now. That was decided.\nWas that deliberately omitted?\nKnaak: That was deliberately omitted, yes. But that doesn't mean you'll see something about it -- I think it was more omitted because we may decide to do something or we may not decide to do something. Unfortunately we have to leave a lot of things open, we can't put anything in stone\""}

At intervals he channels a Twisting Twilight beam attack. The player should run away from the beam and avoid boxing themselves in with fire. The fire does fade after a while.\nIf that were the entirety of the fight this would be trivial, but adds run up the ramp at irregular intervals. The adds have around 77K health. They are oblivious to the player while they are running up the ramp, but once they reach the top of the ramp, they attack the player. Ideally the player should kill the add before it reaches melee range. The Twisting Twilight phase often frustrates that goal, since adds and Twisting Twilight sometimes overlap.\nThe add's abilities include\nIf you end up with 2 adds alive at the same time, you are probably doing it wrong.\nWhile you are close to Tarecgosa you get her healing/mana buff which can be the difference between success and failure for weaker players.\nThyrinar will not perform Twisting Twilight if the player is too far away (the bottom of the ramp is too far away). However, the player will not have Tarecgosa's buff, nor will he be in range to blast Thyrinar. \nThis fight is unlike most raid fights (because in raids you have other players to support you). It is probably closer to a PvP battle or &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Champions\"&gt;Faction Champions&lt;/a&gt;. You will find yourself digging through your spellbook for spells that you rarely use.\nIf you are regularly taking damage from Twisting Twilight or the adds, you will probably lose the battle unless you outgear the fight.\nSpecial class notes.\nSince mages lack a way to heal themselves, Thyrinar buffs himself with HoT they can steal.\nPriests must dispel the HoT off Thyrinar.\nMoonkin, make sure your Typhoon is unglyphed so you can exploit its knockback. Adds can not be knocked into the chasm.\nEnhancement shaman, respec to Elemental. This quest is designed to exclude melee classes."}
