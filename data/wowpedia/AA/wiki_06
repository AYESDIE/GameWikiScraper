For historical purposes, this section contains strategy that was appropriate before the &lt;a href=\"nerf\"&gt;nerf&lt;/a&gt; to Durn.\nIt is recommended that at least five players who are level 66 or higher try to take him on. He does a 10-yard &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20effect\"&gt;AOE&lt;/a&gt; knock-back. Generally, his hits cause 1000-2000 damage for plate wearers, 2000-3000 damage for mail wearers, 2500-3500 damage for leather wearers, and 3000-4000 damage for cloth wearers. Thus, it is of paramount importance for cloth wearers to stay as far away from Durn as possible and still be within the maximum range of their spells.\nDurn wanders in a circular pattern around the Spirit Fields that surround &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27Gun\"&gt;Oshu'Gun&lt;/a&gt; in southwestern &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to wait at the area south of the Consortium camp and then tag him. Kiting is no longer possible since patch 2.1 He moves fast and is immune to any sort of crowd control, root, or snare.\nDurn hits very, very hard, roughly equivalent to the second-to-last encounter in the Ring of Blood event. Though the quest and Durn are marked level 67, at that level two healers and a full group of 5 are pretty much required. Durn has roughly 120,000 health. He also has a wide area point blank AoE which deals damage and knocks back. A well-geared threesome (or maybe duo) of level 70 players could probably take him down. \nFor warlocks, bringing along an enslaved &lt;a href=\"Felguard%20Legionnaire\"&gt;Felguard Legionnaire&lt;/a&gt; significantly helps with this encounter, as well as many of the other group quests in Nagrand. As of patch 3, a level 70+ demonology warlock can solo Durn with little effort, through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Felguard\"&gt;Felguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Health%20Funnel\"&gt;Improved Health Funnel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also possible to solo him with a well-equipped protection warrior with moderate block values.\nHe can also be soloed by arcane mage with good use of &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; and instant spells."}

The &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; was initially ruled by the self-absorbed drunkard Lieutenant General &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;. \nLord of the Clans.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Go%27el\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt; was found amongst the bloody bodies of his murdered parents by Aedelas Blackmoore, the orc baby was taken to Durnholde Keep. He was trained and taught by many, wet-nursed by a &lt;a href=\"Clannia%20Foxton\"&gt;human woman&lt;/a&gt;, and grew to befriend her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlackmoore renamed the boy \"Thrall\", beat and tortured him in the ring, using Thrall to obtain greater rank and prestige. Taretha began to write him letters in his prison, and he wrote back to her. eventually writing that he would escape. Taretha created a diversion while Thrall escaped from his cell. They met up outside the fortress, and Taretha gave him provisions and supplies. He then left Durnholde, hoping never to return again.\nHowever, Thrall rallied the free orcs in a &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;campaign to end the internment camp system&lt;/a&gt;, eventually liberating the smaller encampments, and finally Thrall laid siege to Durnholde. Thrall slew Blackmoore in single combat, completely destroyed the keep, calling upon the Spirit of the Earth to level the fortress. It remains in ruins today and up until recently was used as an outpost of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, which had staked a claim to many of the ruins in Hillsbrad, &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Durnholde Keep has been mostly abandoned by the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jekyll\"&gt;Captain Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Eastpoint%20Tower\"&gt;Eastpoint Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the Keep was a staging ground for Horde recruits.

{"id": "13571", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13571", "title": "Durotan", "text": "Durotan, son of &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt;, was the chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, mate of &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; and father of the future Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. He was also a contemporary of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nYoung Durotan saw &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; after she was born and his mother &lt;a href=\"Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt; told him to bless the child. He did so but noticed that Draka was ill.\nFrom chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;'s three sons, &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris&lt;/a&gt;, and Durotan, the orc was the one who embraced family and tradition most. A some point Geyah was bitten by a &lt;a href=\"drift%20lurker\"&gt;drift lurker&lt;/a&gt; which caused her to enter a coma. While Ga'nar wanted to leave her to die a natural death and move the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; out of the area, Durotan couldn't do that. After Ga'nar left, he and Geyah's companion, &lt;a href=\"Stormfang\"&gt;Stormfang&lt;/a&gt; remained with her and tended to her. At some point, a lone &lt;a href=\"garn\"&gt;garn&lt;/a&gt; attacked them but the two killed the beast. Durotan knew that a whole pack would attack soon, so he prepared for the battle. When they attacked, he lost control over his anger and fell to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fury\"&gt;bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;. While he killed everything that moved, Geyah awoke. After hearing her, he focused once more and found out that he killed Stormfang too. It is said that since that day, he wore Stormfang's fur to the end of his days as a reminder of loyalty and of a threat of savagery.\nDurotan later became the heir of the Frostwolf clan when Fenris vanished and Garad chose him instead of hot-headed Ga'nar for the role.\nDuring a &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, Durotan met a &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Clan\"&gt;Blackrock orc&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Telkar%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Telkar Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and the two became fast friends despite belonging to different clans, something very unusual in orcish society.\nWhile racing each other through &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, Durotan and Orgrim were attacked by a rampaging &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;, and would have been killed if not for the timely arrival of a &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; hunting party from &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Restalaan\"&gt;Restalaan&lt;/a&gt;. Sending word to their clans, Restalaan took the two orcs to Telmor and informed them that the draenei leader, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, was in the town and invited the two to dinner. They discussed their people's histories, Durotan even commenting that he and Orgrim had learned more about the draenei in that period than their entire race had in over a century.\nAfterwards, Durotan underwent his &lt;a href=\"om%27riggor\"&gt;om'riggor&lt;/a&gt; rite. He was also brought to the \"sacred mountain\" of &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; by request of &lt;a href=\"Tal%27kraa\"&gt;Tal'kraa&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to test whether he could become a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; as well as chieftain of his clan; alas, he did not see the ancestors, though he knew they were there somehow.\nDurotan met Draka again at a Kosh'harg celebration without first recognizing her, now that she was healthy and strong. He was not sure whether she was of the Frostwolves, but finally understood who she was after seeing her eyes. The next day, Durotan asked her to join him on a hunt, something which often meant that a male orc intended to choose a female mate. Draka responded that she was too young to be anyone's mate. Durotan then offered that it would be simply a hunt between equal warriors and nothing more. Draka agreed, and they set out together, hunting a &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; but ending up ambushed by a great black &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. However, together the two orcs were able to survive and kill the beast, at the cost of a wound on Durotan's arm. After nursing him, Draka admitted that while the day prior she wasn't lying when saying she was too young, this day was actually her birthday and she was now adult. They kissed, marking the beginning of their relationship, and then had sex while unknowingly being observed by the &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt;.\nChieftain of the Frostwolves.\nSome time later, Durotan's father Garad was killed in battle against a group of ogres and a &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, and Durotan became the chieftain of the Frostwolf clan by hereditary right. It was not long after this that &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the spiritual leader of the orcs and chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, called the clan chieftains and shaman to Oshu'gun. Ner'zhul told them what he believed the ancestors revealed to him - that the draenei were enemies of the orcish people. This was part of an elaborate scheme concocted by the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, one of the lieutenants of the Dark Titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Kil'jaeden had led the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in a hunt for the draenei\u2014renegade eredar who fled when Sargeras came - over the eons, but in the past had found only remnants of where they had been.\nDurotan was dispatched by Ner'zhul to meet with a party led by Velen himself near Oshu'gun, where the Prophet revealed that what guided the spirits of the ancestors there was in fact a dying &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;, who had aided the draenei escape from &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; thousands of years earlier. This was met by suspicion and outright hostility by the orcs\u2014particularly &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, the Frostwolf clan shaman, who called Velen a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemer&lt;/a&gt;. Despite orders to bring the Prophet and his party to Ner'zhul, Durotan decided to release them, reasoning that there was no honor in taking a willing prisoner, but the orc still took two of the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt; shards that Velen carried, the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Heart of Fury&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Star\"&gt;Brilliant Star&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a battle in which they were defeated by Restalaan's forces, the Frostwolf shaman realized they had been cut off from the spirits. Durotan and Draka took this as a sign that something was seriously wrong, even though Ner'zhul had told them the ancestors had told them that this was a just war. It was at this time that the orcs - under the guidance of the ambitious &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul's apprentice - began to take the path of warlock magic. Durotan, not seeking to bring attention to himself by opposing the official stance, allowed Drek'Thar and his shaman to receive warlock training.\nThrough Gul'dan's manipulation - empowered by Kil'jaeden - the clans were united into the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and several clan chieftains, including Durotan, ran for the position of Warchief. However, the clear favorite (and thus the one who received that title) was the battle-hungry &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the Blackrock Clan. No one knew, of course, that Blackhand was in fact Gul'dan's puppet.\nWith the information given to him by Orgrim (now known as Doomhammer, his father dying around the same time as Durotan's), Blackhand ordered Durotan to assault the city of Telmor, which was close to the Frostwolf clan grounds. While in Restalaan's care as a boy, Durotan had seen the guard captain pull a green crystal from a hidden place in the forest floor - Leafshadow, one of the shards of the &lt;a href=\"ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;, which projected an illusion that hid the city from ogres, gronn and other external threats. Orgrim had told Blackhand that Durotan possessed a keen ability of recall (which he did), and could remember the incantation to dispel the illusion. Durotan reluctantly did so, and thus the Horde sacked Telmor and killed everyone they could find, including Restalaan, who was defeated by Durotan and his wolf &lt;a href=\"Nightstalker%20%28wolf%29\"&gt;Nightstalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the attack on the draenei capital of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan called the clans to a mountain he named the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; in what is now &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, to partake of Kil'jaeden's \"gift\" - the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. Durotan\u2014having been warned by the now-subservient Ner'zhul - refused to partake, as did his friend Orgrim...causing both to fall under the suspicion of Gul'dan.\nAfter the fall of Shattrath and the disappearance of Kil'jaeden, the Horde turned on itself, with no enemies left to fight. It was at this time that Gul'dan was visited in his dreams by the human sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who was possessed by the Dark Titan. Medivh commanded Gul'dan to construct a gateway, and that together they would open a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;great Portal&lt;/a&gt; between Draenor and the world of Medivh. Durotan continued to voice opposition against the Horde leadership during this time, publicly questioning Gul'dan's motives and protesting against the use of fel magic. Despite his disgust with the Horde's leadership, he had brought his people through the Dark Portal for there was no future on Draenor; only on Azeroth could they survive another generation.\nBefore leaving Draenor, Durotan and Draka visited &lt;a href=\"Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt;. Draka told her she was pregnant and Durotan added that he would be named as Go'el.\nFrostwolf defiance.\nThe Frostwolves initially fought against the humans alongside the other clans, but their destiny did lie with the Horde. Gul'dan later confronted Durotan in secret. The warlock told him that his clan was no longer part of the Horde and that the Frostwolves had to leave the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; immediately. If they ever returned, if they ever contacted any member of the Horde, Gul'dan promised to destroy every Frostwolf male, female, and child. Durotan was loath to part from his fellow orcs, but he had just learned that his mate, Draka, was pregnant. He did not want to risk her, or their unborn child, by testing Gul'dan. And he knew why Gul'dan was letting them live for if Durotan were killed, it would make him a martyr and give his warning weight among the rest of the Horde.\nApparently accepting their fate, Durotan and the Frostwolf clan settled deep in a &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;hidden valley&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, far to the north of the Kingdom of Azeroth. While there, Drek'Thar had forsaken the path of the warlock and was able to regain the favor of the spirits, and return to shamanism. His aid would be invaluable in surviving in the harsh lands which the Frostwolves now called home; in addition to ensuring that the encampment was not flooded in the spring thaw, they also befriended the white wolves that made the valley their home. In the year 1, Draka, Durotan's mate and most stalwart supporter, gave birth to Durotan's son and heir, the orc who would become known as Thrall. Realizing that there was far more at stake now that his legacy would live on, Durotan decided to take action against the evil Gul'dan, and made a meeting with the only other orc who had stood by him: Orgrim Doomhammer.\nDurotan explained what he knew - about Gul'dan, the Shadow Council, the demonic bargain, and Orgrim decided it was time to stop the evil warlock. He urged Durotan and Draka to take shelter in the north until he sent word to them. Orgrim commanded his guards to accompany the Frostwolves on their journey home and keep them safe. That would be a mistake that Orgrim would regret to his dying day. His guards were not loyal to him, but to the Shadow Council.\nThe guards had heard every word between Orgrim and his visitors. They decided they didn't need Gul'dan's permission to eliminate the Frostwolves - clearly, he would want Durotan, Draka, and their child dead. After traveling north for several days, the guards fell upon Durotan and Draka. The Frostwolves fought bitterly against their attackers, killing one of them. But the remaining guards struck down Durotan and Draka, and Go'el was left to die in the frigid cold.\nWith his arms sliced off to prevent him from holding his child again, Durotan died slowly as the lifeblood drained out of him, the last thought in his mind being a sense of relief that he would not see his son torn apart by the creatures of the forest.\nLegacy.\nDurotan is buried in Alterac Valley, under a monument known as the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20of%20Durotan\"&gt;Rock of Durotan&lt;/a&gt;. The inscription on the memorial plaque reads:\nThrall survived after Durotan's death, found by the human officer &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; and raised as a slave and gladiator. He would eventually escape, be trained as a shaman by Drek'Thar, and lead in the liberation of his people, thus freeing them from the taint of demonic corruption that had plagued them for so long, vowing at the same time that no orc would be cast into slavery - by humans or demons alike - ever again. Thrall would go on to become &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Warchief of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; after Doomhammer fell in battle. Then, after leading the exodus to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and his people settled in the eastern &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, at last taking a land of their own for the first time since the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. He named the new kingdom &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of his slain father.\nWhile Draka's soul was sent to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, it's not known what part of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; Durotan was sent to. Nevertheless, the two life-mates' souls were at some point reunited. During Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in Durotar, Durotan and Draka briefly manifested alongside the spirits of other famous orcs in response to an offering prepared by an orc adventurer and Durotan's grandson, &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first time Durotan saw his namesake land in person, and he stated that he would always feel honored that his son had named the place after him. Before disappearing, Durotan thanked the adventurer for being a friend and ally to Go'el.\nAlternate timelines.\nThrall could relive the last moments of Durotan and Draka's life in an alternate history. Thrall and an orc named &lt;a href=\"Grukar\"&gt;Grukar&lt;/a&gt; were tasked to escort them to the safety. However, Grukar was a traitor who summoned the assassins. The assassins killed everyone, except Thrall. To avoid changing history, Thrall let them escape. In the last seconds of life, Thrall told Durotan that Go'el will be great hero, and that orcs will become proud and powerful. With this knowledge, Durotan dies.\nAnother appears on the alternate in the past during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\n from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath discrepancies.\nThe novel \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Clans\"&gt;Lord of the Clans&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt; depicted unnamed spies of Gul'dan as the assassins of Durotan and Draka. On the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//media.worldofwarcraft.com/bc-minisite/index.htm\"&gt;Burning Crusade flash site&lt;/a&gt; it is told that Thrall's parents were assassinated by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, which contradicts all sources.

It was originally said that Durotan and Draka met Orgrim Doomhammer in the southlands, while \"\" described the place as &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, in Year 0. \"Chronicle Volume 2\" changed this to have occurred in Year 1.\n\"Lord of the Clans\" described that one guard accompanied the Frostwolves (named &lt;a href=\"Grukar\"&gt;Grukar&lt;/a&gt; in \"Twilight of the Aspects\"'s timeline) who later summoned the assassins, but the \"Chronicle\" used plural for guards.\nDurotan was originally stated to have killed one assassin by snapping his neck, while the others killed the traitorous guard and ultimately the Frostwolves as well. Now, it is stated that the Frostwolf orcs killed one guard before being defeated, omitting / not mentioning any betrayals between the hostile attackers. It is also interesting to note that while \"Lord of the Clans\" described four orcs being killed, the next page says that only three dead orc bodies were found.\nIn \"Twilight of the Aspects\", Aedelas found the orcling not long after the massacre. \"Lord of the Clans\" states that the ambush must have happened \"recently\". According to the \"Chronicle\", Aedelas and Tammis found the orcling one day after the massacre.\nIt is also unclear where exactly they were killed. While \"Twilight of the Aspects\" said that Durotan and Orgrim met in Hillsbrad Foothills and were killed not long after they left Orgrim's camp, \"Chronicle\" stated that they met on the edge of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; and once the meeting ended, they were traveling north for several days. It described that Durotan's body was left to die in the frigid cold and that Aedelas was from the northern stronghold of Durnholde Keep, but the exact region is unclear. \"&lt;a href=\"Afterlives\"&gt;Afterlives: Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;\" depicted the area they fell as a forest. Originally, Orgrim wanted them in a chosen safe location, while in the \"Chronicle\"'s version, Orgrim wanted them to be safe but sent them home to Alterac Mountains.\nIt could be speculated that the events of \"Twilight of the Aspects\" occurred as described in the book as it is a different universe.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", it was mentioned that Durotan, &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; were three blood brothers. However, after &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; started manipulating Blackhand, Durotan and the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; were sent north to await orders that were never intended to arrive instead of being straight-up and officially exiled. &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, the sons of Blackhand, later assassinated Durotan.

He stood as a rare voice of reason in a world where war and brutality reign. Durotan saw his clan, friends, and allies as he would a pack of wolves, each looking out for each other and pulling their own weight. As one of the few orc chieftains who refused to join the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he allied himself and his clan with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He was also one of the main protagonists of \"\".\nBiography.\nDurotan was a son of , the chieftain of the Frostwolf clan. He had two brothers. Of the three\u2014, the oldest; , the firebrand; and Durotan, the youngest\u2014Durotan was the one who embraced family and tradition most.\nEarly life.\nAs the Frostwolf clan was migrating, Durotan's mother was bitten by a &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Lurker\"&gt;drift lurker&lt;/a&gt;, which caused her to enter a coma. When his brother Ga'nar voiced to leave her to a natural death and get the clan out of the area, Durotan refused. As the rest of the clan moved on, Durotan and &lt;a href=\"Stormfang\"&gt;Stormfang&lt;/a&gt; remained with Geyah. At nightfall, the pair were attacked by a lone &lt;a href=\"Garn\"&gt;Garn&lt;/a&gt; and though the pair were able to kill the beast, Durotan knew that more of its pack would come at sundown and thus prepared for the onslaught. When they attacked, Durotan found himself gradually losing control of his anger and fell into a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fury\"&gt;bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;, which caused him to kill everything that was moving. Soon after, Geyah awoke, and Durotan discovered that he killed Stormfang in his fury. Durotan decided to wear Stormfang's fur as a reminder for the old wolf's loyalty and courage, and to remind himself that even the noblest of Orcs may fall prey to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fury\"&gt;savagery within&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen his ambitious brother Fenris vanished, Chieftain Garad chose Durotan as his new heir apparent, over the hotheaded Ga'nar. Yet the troubles for the Frostwolves didn't end there. The other clans banded together to forge an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, an army bent on conquering Draenor. Garad refused to join the murderous campaign and isolated the Frostwolf clan in its home in Frostfire Ridge. The other orc warlords mobilized to bring the Frostwolves to heel. At this critical moment, Chieftain Garad and his son Ga'nar disappeared in the frozen wastes. As the now sole leader Durotan began to struggle to preserve what remains of the clan. Young, idealistic, and outnumbered, Durotan must decide the fate of the Frostwolves. If he fails, the last bastion of hope for orcs on Draenor will be lost.\nLoyal to his allies and terrifying to his enemies, Durotan has led the Frostwolf clan to a life in one of the most hostile lands imaginable. Durotan\u2019s people rejected the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s call for orcish unity to focus on their own survival. They now subsist in the biting cold of Frostfire Ridge by cloaking themselves in furs and taming the massive frostwolves that accompany them, snarling and howling, in battle after battle.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nFrostfire Ridge.\nDurotan is first encountered after the Horde forces arrive on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. Though wary of the newcomers (due in part to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s green skin), Durotan accepts 's vouching and welcomes them as friends to the harsh, icy home of the Frostwolf clan. Out of gratitude for saving his people in Tanaan, he assisted the Horde champions in building an &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;outpost&lt;/a&gt;, and soon left for &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Citadel\"&gt;Bladespire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the ogre empire's local bid for dominance. Durotan marshaled a Frostwolf raid to besiege the fortress, fighting his way to its heart and claiming it for the Frostwolves. He and Ga'nar clashed in the battle's aftermath, the elder brother seeking to push the advantage and drive out the , the neighboring clan who had gladly joined the Iron Horde's call and had begun attacking Frostwolf outposts across Frostfire. Durotan remained behind in Bladespire, hoping to conserve the clan's strength and strike when the timing was appropriate. He sent the Horde champion to fight with , hoping to reunite with his mate soon, when the Thunderlords attacked &lt;a href=\"Wor%27gol\"&gt;Wor'gol&lt;/a&gt; but soon participated in the fight. Afterwards, he sent the adventurer to help Ga'nar in the north and &lt;a href=\"Lokra\"&gt;Lokra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonefang%20Outpost\"&gt;Stonefang Outpost&lt;/a&gt;.\nDurotan eventually returned to the garrison, where he met with Draka and a victorious Ga'nar, the latter fresh from killing the 's three sons. Ga'nar challenged Durotan to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; for the leadership of the Frostwolves. Durotan refused, dropping his axe, and telling his brother to strike him down in cold blood if this is truly what he wanted for the Frostwolves. Ga'nar relented, unwilling to kill his brother, and reaffirms his loyalty to Durotan as chieftain. With the clan united, Durotan prepares to settle matters with the Thunderlord clan and staged a raid with Ga'nar on their warlord's stronghold. The brothers are stunned to learn that the Iron Wolf is their own elder brother, thought dead, who reveals he had killed their father in his bid to join the Iron Horde. Durotan and Ga'nar grudgingly slay Fenris, putting an end to the Thunderlord threat but also closing an unhappy chapter in their family's history.\nThough the Thunderlords were broken, the Frostwolves learned that a huge Iron Horde army was marching on Frostfire from &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Durotan then led the Frostwolves in repelling the attack, which ended when Drek'Thar mustered his power to collapse the pass and keep the invaders out. However in order to ensure that Drek'Thar had enough time Ga'nar made the ultimate sacrifice to buy the shaman time. In his parting words, Ga'nar encouraged Durotan to defend their family.\nThough remaining in the dark about Thrall's identity as his son, the two developed a close bond throughout their battles together.\nGorgrond.\nWith the halted invasion behind him, Durotan comes to understand that neutrality will not spare his clan from the Iron Horde's rampage. He and Draka left for &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; to take the fight to them, and enter into a bizarre alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt;, orcs of questionable sanity who were also hostile to the Iron Horde. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Penny%20Clobberbottom\"&gt;Penny Clobberbottom&lt;/a&gt;, the new alliance settles in a new outpost &lt;a href=\"Beastwatch\"&gt;Beastwatch&lt;/a&gt;. While Durotan guards the outpost, Draka accompanies the commander and the Laughing Skull shaman &lt;a href=\"Kaz%20the%20Shrieker\"&gt;Kaz the Shrieker&lt;/a&gt; in their travels through Gorgrond. He directed &lt;a href=\"Bony%20Xuk\"&gt;Bony Xuk&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurers to fight on the north against the units of the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;. When the orcish women and Bony Xuk managed to get the artifacts of the enemies - Heart of the Magnaron and Will of the Genesaur, he sent the Horde forces to the Iron Docks to fight against an army of the Iron Horde. The adventurer also killed powerful beasts during the journey throughout Gorgrond and brought the trophies to Durotan.\nTalador.\nWhen the Iron Horde's army approached Talador, Durotan, Draka, &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde adventurers moved to &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the threat of the orcs. After spying, battling and destroying their machinery in the coast, Durotan became disheartened upon learning his childhood friend of the had joined the Iron Horde, whose brutal conquest had led to the deaths of many draenei in Talador. Durotan maintained that his friend can see sense, and eventually confronted Orgrim; however, Orgrim refused to waver from his path. Durotan joins forces with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the draenei, headed by &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and the group planned to relieve from the Blackrock war machine. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Shattrath\"&gt;Battle for Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, Durotan's faith in Orgrim proved justified, when his old friend refuses to aid in the deaths of innocent draenei and turns against Blackhand. Durotan, Orgrim, Maraad, and Yrel begin battle with an angered Blackhand, but are overwhelmed after Blackhand kills Orgrim and an explosion detonates, killing Maraad. Durotan is disarmed and forced to the ground, where Blackhand looms over him and sears him with his great mace, reflecting that Durotan never belonged with the Iron Horde. \nHowever, Yrel had also survived the explosion. She confronts Blackhand herself, goading him into battle, and uses the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to heal Durotan's wounds. Fighting together (Durotan using Maraad's discarded hammer, Yrel wielding Durotan's discarded axe), the two beat Blackhand down until Khadgar teleports them to safety and blows up the Blackrock warlord's command ship.\nThe victory is a bitter one for Durotan, having lost Orgrim just as the two found themselves allies. He swears vengeance on Blackhand, promising to destroy him when the opportunity presents itself. Afterwards, he returned to Vol'jin's Spear.\nNagrand.\nDurotan accompanied Thrall and the commander to the plains of , home of the . While Thrall and Draka led the attack from the north, Durotan led his forces from the south against &lt;a href=\"Lok-rath\"&gt;Lok-rath&lt;/a&gt;. When the adventurer visited Riverside to ensure Durotan's help for the upcoming battle, he asked to deal with the captured orcs at Lok-rath. Although the enemy orcs didn't surrender they were dealt with and Durotan eventually joined Thrall, Draka, &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde forces in assaulting &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s base of &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt;. Durotan and the adventurer face Garrosh head-on, with the son of Hellscream eventually gaining the upper hand after a brutal battle. Thrall intervened then and challenged Garrosh to one last &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. After Garrosh is finally killed, Durotan is eager to completely destroy the Iron Horde, their allies and Hellscream himself.\nHe is ultimately seen with the Horde at the Gates of Tanaan after the death of &lt;a href=\"Azuka\"&gt;Warlord Azuka&lt;/a&gt; as Warchief Grommash challenged them to enter Tanaan.\nFury of Hellfire.\nAfter took over the Iron Horde, Durotan arrived to Frostwall and met with Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and Khadgar and began planning the Tanaan attack. He was surprised by the Warchief and he liked his fearlessness. Durotan accompanied the commander to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt; and released the captured Iron Horde orc &lt;a href=\"Solog%20Roark\"&gt;Solog Roark&lt;/a&gt; who had been imprisoned by Gul'dan for speaking against him. He convinced the shipwright to build a shipyard for the Horde. He then returned to Frostwall and during the invasion of Tanaan he led the Frostwolves in attacking by land, while the Horde attacked by sea. Upon breaching the Tanaan Gate, his forces met with the resistance in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Front\"&gt;Iron Front&lt;/a&gt;. He was soon contacted by the commander who in the meantime established &lt;a href=\"Vol%27mar\"&gt;Vol'mar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDurotan sent &lt;a href=\"Frogan\"&gt;Frogan&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20Refuge\"&gt;Rangari Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep an eye on the Laughing Skull orcs and the draenei Rangari and refugee. He also commanded three orcs to scout the terrain of Tanaan and eventually sent the commander to check on them.\nDurotan was later seen in the , watching as the commander and his ring received an elemental blessing. He then participated in the attack and was seen after &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was defeated standing with Yrel and Grommash.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFor years after Archimonde's death, the draenei and orcs lived in peace until conflict arose, with the orcs blaming it on the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival on Draenor and the draenei on the desiccation of the planet caused by the orcs. Forming the [[Lightbound]], the draenei tried to stop the orcs with the [[Light]]. While some orcs joined willingly, others had it forced upon them. Durotan and Draka had a child named [[Geya'rah]], and Durotan died in a battle against the Lightbound.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nDo you hear the howling winds? It is a lonely sound. Make no mistake - if you are not careful, the land will claim you for its own.\nIf we are to defeat the Iron Horde, we will need power beyond that which we possess. It is my hope that this land will reveal answers we had not thought of yet.\nOrgrim's forces are formidable. He may have betrayed me, but I will not allow vengeance to force me into folly.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Orc characters]]\n[[Category:Mag'har orc characters]]\n[[Category:Warrior characters]]\n[[Category:Frostwolf Orcs]]\n[[Category:Quest givers]]\n[[Category:Frostfire Ridge NPCs]]\n[[Category:Gorgrond NPCs]]\n[[Category:Nagrand (alternate universe) NPCs]]\n[[Category:Talador NPCs]]\n[[Category:Tanaan Jungle NPCs]]\n[[Category:Alternate universe characters]]\n[[Category:Savage World characters]]\n[[Category:Unique models]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[es:Durotan (Warlords of Draenor)]]"}

Although he resisted the invitations of the warlock , with his homeworld of dying, Durotan was forced to join Gul'dan's in order to preserve his clan. After travelling through the Durotan chose to forge an alliance with the humans of Stormwind in order to save his people from the dark influence of Gul'dan and his magic, but was betrayed by his childhood friend . His clan slaughtered, Durotan challenged Gul'dan to a , where he was dishonorably killed by the warlock's magics.\nHis weapons were &lt;a href=\"Sever%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Sever&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderstrike%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Thunderstrike&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDying Draenor.\nAs heir to the Frostwolf clan, Durotan would be personally taught by his father, &lt;a href=\"Garad%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;. As a youth Durotan would befriend &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and the boys would forge a lifetime friendship.\nDurotan bore witness to &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Gul'dan's&lt;/a&gt; parlay with with father, where Garad refused to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the parlay Garad would be given the ceremonial dagger required for it and be poisoned, and later die in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Walker%20clan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Red Walker clan&lt;/a&gt;. A grieving Durotan, unaware of Gul'dan's role in his father's death, would be blessed by the spirits after &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; asked them to find the new Chieftain worthy. Despite his grief and awe at the situation Durotan and Drek'thar would come to realize that something was off with the spirits.\nOver time the Redwalkers would grow bold and directly attack the Frostwolves but would be repelled and with the death of their hunting party the Redwalkers would retreat north. While leaving a few scouts to watch over the Frostwolves the Redwalkers would through unknown means take their strength from the spirits, all the while anticipating that the Frostwolves would come to their aid. In the mean time Durotan would welcome the once exiled &lt;a href=\"Draka%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; back into the clan, where the two would become close with another. However unknown to Durotan the dormant volcano near their home was close to erupting and in their weakened state Drek'Thar and the other shaman were unable to hear the spirit's warning. As such the clan would be caught off guard but Durotan would be able to successfully save the bulk of the clan. Sometime later he and Draka would become mates, with Draka later becoming pregnant with his child.\nIn this time of uncertainly Gul'dan would try to once again to gain Frostwolf support for the Horde and Durotan would be greatly tempted to join. However he ultimately rejected convinced that doing so would make them the warlock's slaves. A surprised &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; would use the Draenei tongue to warn them that Gul'dan was dangerous, and Draka (who had learned the tongue in her exile) informed her that they knew, though when Gul'dan demanded to know what was said Drake informed that warlock that Garona had called them fools. Accepting this Gul'dan then called Durotan stubborn but remarked that should he see wisdom and change his mind all he had to was head to Tanaan Jungle. While the likes of Doomhammer and Drek'thar would praise Durotan, other Frostwolves were in disagreement with rejecting the Horde and Durotan would be challenged by &lt;a href=\"Nokrar\"&gt;Nokrar&lt;/a&gt; and despite winning Durotan would refuse to kill arguing that too many Frostwolf lives had been lost. Nokrar, still convinced to join the Horde, would take his family and leave and Durotan would give chase to prevent the loss of Frostwolf lives. While Nokrar's family would be recovered Nokrar would be killed and eaten by the Redwalkers, a fact that would horrify Durotan.\nSometime later the spirits would be able to get a message of sorts to Drek'Thar and Durotan decided to lead a party north to aid the spirits, while leaving Draka and Doomhammer in charge. With Durotan and his war party gone the opportunistic Red Walkers decided to strike out against the Frostwolves in order to wound them and use them as a food supply. Unknown to the Redwalkers the weakened spirits still had enough energy to give one final gift to the Frostwolves and Durotan and his party rushed south and the Frostwolves under the command of Draka and Orgrim Doomhammer fought to kill their enemies. As a result Durotan would arrive in the midst of the fighting and the Redwalkers would ultimately be destroyed, and it's Chieftain would only live long enough to inform Durotan of how a once noble clan had fallen. While the Frostwolves wanted to leave their corpses rot, Durotan would order that the Redwalkers would be buried because despite their sins, they were still orcs and by them treating with respect the Frostwolves would remind themselves of what they never would become.\nThe war with the Redwalkers and hardships had taken a toll on the Frostwolves and Durotan in order to ensure the clan's survival ordered them to march south to join the Horde.\nWarcraft.\nAfter entering the Great Gate Draka would give birth to a still birth &lt;a href=\"Go%27el%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt; but Gul'dan's magic would quickly give him life. Durotan and Draka would dote upon their child and become worried about his future.\nDurotan would join the Horde in attacking the humans but would would refuse to raid the defenseless towns seeing no honor in attacking those who could not defend themselves. As Gul'dan's fel magic starting destroying the land around them Durotan, wishing the best for his son and his people, would decide to work with the humans to stop Gul'dan. However Doomhammer unable to see how working with the humans would secure victory would betray the Frostwolves and cause the parlay to become an ambush. The Frostwolves would be brought to the Horde encampment and Durotan would be imprisoned. Soon after the Frostwolves would be destroyed with only Durotan, Draka, Go'el, and a guilt driven Doomhammer as the only known survivors.\nDurotan would later be freed by Doomhammer, who he would knock down with the latter doing nothing to stop it. After agreeing to work with another Durotan would challenge Gul'dan to a . Though evenly matched at first, as Durotan began to win Gul'dan would use fel magic to win. A furious Doomhammer and other orcs would call Gul'dan a cheater who had no respect for their ways and only by killing these dissidents would Gul'dan's hold over the Horde remain secure. However Doomhammer would remain alive and Durotan's corpse would be placed as a warning to the other orcs. \nDoomhammer would later take it down and take one of Durotan's tusk from his corpse in order to bring it to his son, Go'el.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It borders the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the coastal lands of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; to the north. The land of Durotar is rocky, and the soil is cracked and red, not unlike the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' homeland of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The land has many crags and canyons, where dangerous creatures take residence. It is a harsh land to survive in, very dry and hot, and the vegetation is sparse. The orcs, however, see a harsh beauty in the land. Durotar is a proving ground for young orcs, who are sent to the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt; to complete several rites of passage before they are considered fit for the challenges that lie ahead. Durotar forms the new homeland of the orcs and is the site of the orcs' principal city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Since the orcs founded Orgrimmar, Durotar has become something of a haven for all of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; races, especially the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who are mainly settled on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Durotar changed greatly. Flooding caused by the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; caused much of the western Durotar to be overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Southfury%20River\"&gt;Southfury River&lt;/a&gt;, while agitated earth and water elementals clash west of Orgrimmar's gates. Following the rise of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, the region has been reinforced into a vision of military might with battlements and training grounds constructed along the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe land was originally part of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and was mostly controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20tribe\"&gt;Razormane tribe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde arrived and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s led by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; drove much of them away.\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20Hatreds%20-%20The%20Colonization%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Old Hatreds - The Colonization of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough victory was theirs, the mortal races found themselves in a world shattered by war. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had all but destroyed the civilizations of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and had almost finished the job in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. There were forests to heal, grudges to bury, and homelands to settle. The war had wounded each race deeply, but they had selflessly banded together to attempt a new beginning, starting with the uneasy truce between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; led the orcs to the continent of Kalimdor, where they founded a new homeland with the help of their &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; brethren. Naming their new land Durotar after Thrall's murdered father, the orcs settled down to rebuild their once-glorious society. Now that the demon curse was ended, the Horde changed from a warlike juggernaut into more of a loose coalition, dedicated to survival and prosperity rather than conquest. Aided by the noble tauren and the cunning trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and his orcs looked forward to a new era of peace in their own land.\nThe remaining Alliance forces under &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; settled in southern Kalimdor. Off the eastern coast of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, they built the rugged port city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. There, the humans and their dwarven allies worked to survive in a land that would always be hostile to them. Though the defenders of Durotar and Theramore kept the tentative truce with one another, the fragile colonial serenity was not meant to last.\nThe peace between the orcs and humans was shattered by the arrival of a massive Alliance fleet in Kalimdor. The mighty fleet, under the command of Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; (Jaina's father), had left Lordaeron before &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; had destroyed the kingdom. Having sailed for many grueling months, Admiral Proudmoore was searching for any Alliance survivors he could find.\nProudmoore's armada posed a serious threat to the stability of the region. As a renowned hero of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina's father was a staunch enemy of the Horde, and he was determined to destroy Durotar before the orcs could gain a foothold in the land.\nThe Grand Admiral forced Jaina to make a terrible decision: support him in battle against the orcs and betray her newfound allies, or fight her own father to maintain the fragile peace that the Alliance and the Horde had finally attained. After much soul-searching, Jaina chose the latter and helped Thrall defeat her crazed father. Unfortunately, Admiral Proudmoore died in battle before Jaina could reconcile with him or prove that orcs were no longer bloodthirsty monsters. For her loyalty, the orcs allowed Jaina's forces to return home safely to Theramore.\nCycle of Hatred.\nApproximately three years after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; invaded Durotar and caused problems in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drygulch%20Ravine\"&gt;Drygulch Ravine&lt;/a&gt;. Thunder Ridge's dense forest was razed which prompted its &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s to move to Drygulch Ravine. Thrall requested Lady Jaina Proudmoore's aid in relocating the thunder lizards.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter many years of construction, the orcs had finalized the establishment of their warrior city, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs look forward to a shining new future for their people. Though they are no longer driven by dreams of conquest, they stand ready to destroy all who would challenge their sovereignty or their supremacy. The orcs strive to uphold their duty by crushing the enemies of Durotar, including the nefarious agents of the Burning Legion that still wander the land.\nThe Darkspear trolls originally settled in the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, but they were betrayed by one of their own, a sorcerer named &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;. Forced to flee from their island holdings, the Darkspears created the fishing village of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; on the Durotar coast. The Horde tried to deal with the traitorous Zalazane, but without success. They also continued fighting Razormane quilboar and the Burning Blade.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, both orc and troll players started out in the Valley of Trials with the same quests. &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; still held some remnants of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore's&lt;/a&gt; forces, which were dealt with over time.\nDuring the first &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Durotar was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; launched simultaneous assaults on both Stormwind and Orgrimmar, first through a &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Infestation\"&gt;Zombie Infestation&lt;/a&gt; and then a &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;direct attack&lt;/a&gt;. A zeppelin was added to the Durotar zeppelin tower which allowed transportation to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nZalazane's Fall.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; behind them, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; began a war effort to &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;take back the Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; rallied warriors of his tribe and the rest of the Horde to his side, gaining additional aid from the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt; and the Death &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;. Zalazane's voodoo-possessed forces were annihilated and the mad witch doctor was slain. With their home and new druid allies, the Darkspear moved their forces out of Orgrimmar and began construction of their new home.\nCataclysm.\nPrior to the great &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief Thrall found that he needed to leave his position as Warchief to another in order to help heal the world. He gave the title to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. With much of Orgrimmar burned down during the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; and Durotar's geography changing from the over flooded &lt;a href=\"Southfury%20River\"&gt;Southfury River&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief Garrosh began reinforcing the city and Durotar with iron battlements, barricades, and training grounds. The &lt;a href=\"harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; and many &lt;a href=\"watch%20tower\"&gt;watch tower&lt;/a&gt;s were also added to aid in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, the northern area of Durotar became a spot of gatherings of concerned citizens and the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult.\nGeographically, the Southfury River caused roughly a fourth of Durotar to change from desert to wetlands. This disrupted the local wildlife and exterminated the population of &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s but provided the orcs with a new source of water.\nThe Cataclysm also caused lava to appear near &lt;a href=\"Tor%27kren%20Farm\"&gt;Tor'kren Farm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. It was drained by the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nFollowing the end of the Cataclysm and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; continued to escalate. Warchief Garrosh attempted to use his fleet to encircle &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to block it off from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;destroyed Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance retaliated with a large naval battle occurring in Durotar's &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;. As the tide turned against him, Garrosh used his &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; to summon &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; to tip the scales. The Alliance under King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; eventually broke the blockade.\nEscalation.\nWith the campaign in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; nearing its end, &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; freed the Echo Isles from Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"De-Subjugation\"&gt;oppression&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; took the Isles, Sen'jin Village, Razor Hill and the rest of southern Durotar back from the Kor'kron. In response, Garrosh reinforced Orgrimmar's front gates with troops, wolf riders, and farseers. He also allied himself with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, bringing in a number of &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt;'s mount &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt; to defend Bladefist Bay.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; began with a united naval assault consisting of ships from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; assaulting Bladefist Bay. Meanwhile, Vol'jin and Baine made a direct land assault on the city's front gates, assisted by an Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;. The siege ended with Garrosh's defeat, the death of most of his Kor'kron, ascension of Vol'jin as the new warchief, and a tenuous agreement of peace between the Alliance and Horde.\nFollowing the siege, the battlements in front of Orgrimmar remained, but many orc grunts in both Orgrimmar and Durotar have been replaced by, or supplemented with, Darkspear tribe and Thunder Bluff guards.\nLegion.\nNorthern Durotar was once again a meeting place for the Horde armies that set sailed from here to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Horde forces gathered in front of Orgrimmar gates yet again and later marched through Durotar into the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale to participate in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Durotar saw some Alliance presence and skirmishes.\nSome &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; followed the from onto &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and fled into southern Durotar.\nLater, the Alliance staged a raid on Durotar and in the melee stole information on the location of a Worldvein from &lt;a href=\"Valusha\"&gt;Valusha&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Campaign and aftermath.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Campaign\"&gt;Nazjatar Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde and the Alliance gathered at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;push toward&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and to prepare for a siege against &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and the forces loyal to Sylvanas. But before attacking Orgrimmar, Sarufang declared &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; against Sylvanas which resulted in the Banshee Queen killing Saurfang and abandoning her role as Warchief and the Horde.\nAfter the Fourth War, Tiragarde Keep remains occupied by the Alliance's Northwatch Expeditionary Unit, the water from the Southfury River in the Southfury Watershed remains undrinkable, and there is now &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20Downs\"&gt;Razormane Downs&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in the southern Durotar.\nShadowlands.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, Durotar came under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. To fight against the undead, troops of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; were mobilized in order to protect the region and its inhabitants.\nDragonflight.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, the first Azerothian &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival took place in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. As part of their &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, the orc champion tracked and killed &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt; that nested near &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and was responsible for the death of peons from the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt;. The champion also went to Thunder Ridge and aided the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Owa%27nohe\"&gt;Owa'nohe&lt;/a&gt; in restoring the life to the area, promising that trees and thunder lizards will return here.\nGeography.\nThe area is dry, baked red by the sun and littered with cacti and watering holes. The landmass itself is a long expanse separated from mainland &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Southfury%20River\"&gt;Southfury River&lt;/a&gt;. To the south and east of Durotar is the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The center of its eastern coast is littered with sunken ships and considered to be a prime scavenging spot. Near the southeastern tip is &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Troll\"&gt;Darkspear Troll&lt;/a&gt; village. Off the southern coast are the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the main settlement of the Darkspear Trolls. The wildlife of the land includes &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are also quarries throughout Durotar abandoned by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; war machine, though these quarries are not seen in-game.\nThere are no &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"raid%20dungeon\"&gt;raid dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"micro%20dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s in Durotar. However, &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, a dungeon for levels 15 - 21, can be found in the Horde capital city, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, which is located at the north side of this zone.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D8\"&gt;Topographic map of pre-Shattering Durotar&lt;/a&gt;\nTravel hubs.\nThe Horde capital city, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, is located in this zone and is a major travel hub for Horde characters. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; towers inside Orgrimmar can carry players to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, to either &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Grom%27Gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'Gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; and also the continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable characters.\nDurotar is home to several orcs and trolls of status. &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Trolls\"&gt;Darkspear Trolls&lt;/a&gt;, dwells in &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Hold\"&gt;Darkspear Hold&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, off the east coast. In nearby Sen'jin Village, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; battles &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; efforts to gain a foothold in Durotar. From &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuests.\nDurotar is the starting zone for &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Orcs start in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt;, while the trolls start on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The quest range here is levels 1 - 10. Quests in Durotar include a rescue of denizens lost during the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, battles against the human soldiers of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, helping to 'tune up' gladiators, and a cautionary tale from a &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer\"&gt;Far Seer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"\", Durotar was the main map of the &lt;a href=\"To%20Tame%20a%20Land%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;To Tame a Land&lt;/a&gt; mission of the &lt;a href=\"Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; campaign. It already contained areas such as &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Besides &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, it featured many orcish and goblin outposts, such as &lt;a href=\"Gar%27Thok\"&gt;Gar'Thok&lt;/a&gt;'s outpost, &lt;a href=\"Neeloc%27s%20Outpost\"&gt;Neeloc's Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Storehouse\"&gt;Goblin Storehouse&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Observatory\"&gt;Goblin Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aicila%27s%20Marketplace\"&gt;Aicila's Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. The Echo Isles also appeared, with &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles%23In%20Warcraft%20III\"&gt;their own unique setting&lt;/a&gt;, far enough from the mainland that a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; ride was necessary to get there.\nDurotar then had some wildlife which didn't appear later in \"World of Warcraft\":\nIt also had the following dungeons: &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Tunnels\"&gt;Orgrimmar Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Den\"&gt;Beast Den&lt;/a&gt;, and some uninstanced monster areas such as a &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; den, a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"coven\"&gt;coven&lt;/a&gt;, several murloc villages and wildkin nests, a &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; landing area, a thunder phoenix breeding area and a bronze dragon's lair.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunderbloom\"&gt;Thunderbloom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3Ashimmerweed\"&gt;:shimmerweed&lt;/a&gt; were plants native to the region.\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nFor many years, Durotar was home to the quilboar. Then Thrall, Warchief of the orcs, brought his race to Kalimdor in search of a new homeland. The quilboar were tenacious but ultimately no match for the unified might of the orc clans. The bristled \"boar men\" were driven back in a series of decisive orc victories along the northern canyons and ultimately pushed to the most remote regions of Durotar and even into the Barrens. The orcs claim the coastal realm as their own, but the quilboar vow to reclaim it someday. The realm of Durotar - named by Warchief Thrall in honor of his father, Durotan - occupies the east coast of Kalimdor, just across the river from the Barrens. The goblin port of Ratchet stands to the south, with the ruined shores of Azshara some distance to the north. The region is warm and rocky, but not as arid as the rest of the Barrens. A fair amount of vegetation grows thanks to the warm easterly winds blowing in from over the ocean, but truly fertile soil is rare, making farmland precious. Sagebrush on the plains and thin pine forests at higher elevations combine with rugged hills and canyons to break up the landscape. Orcs are by far the major inhabitants of Durotar.\nQuilboar cluster in the canyons along the northwestern borders and encroach from the Barrens to the west. Centaur warbands make the occasional foray, and furbolgs and undead have been seen in more than one instance. Herd animals such as deer and goats roam the land, preyed upon by wolves and coyotes.\nA number of Horde settlements have been established throughout the region, but much of the land has yet to be tamed. The cities and towns scattered along the frontier are heavily fortified against attacks from quilboar raiders, centaur warbands, rogue furbolgs, and even sudden appearances by undead and the occasional demon. Caravans are common targets, creating a strong market for caravan guards.\nThe few large cities are distant from one another, with a variety of smaller encampments and villages scattered in between. Given that Durotar is the orcs' new homeland, Horde races and independents are welcome throughout the region. Alliance races risk their lives when they venture into Durotar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; landed here after their exodus from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. They proceeded to explore the area, helping the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; drive out the cruel &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s who were harassing &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and his people.\nAfter the war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Durotar was founded as a nation and the new orcish homeland by Thrall. The young warchief named the land after his father, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;. Upon this land, he laid the ground for the orcs' new capital city &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, named for the previous warchief and hero of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe capital, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, is host to 14,000 inhabitants. In all, Durotar has a population of 21,000, the majority of which is of orcish blood. 65% of those living here are orcs, 20% are trolls, 15% are tauren, 8% Forsaken, and the smallest, humans, at 2% of the population. It is ruled as a tribal chiefdom by &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Major settlements include Orgrimmar, &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;, with respective populations of 14,000, 3,000, and 2,000. Spoken here are the languages of Orcish, Common, Low Common, Taurahe, and Zandali, otherwise known as Troll.\nPeople and culture.\nDurotar is the most populated of all Horde-controlled regions, as well as their cultural center. Here, young orcs, tauren, and trolls study shamanism and hunting. There is a strong sense of unity here, although a number of Horde members are disturbed by the growing presence of the Forsaken in their lands. I expected this central point for the Horde to also be a major battlefield, and that I would be attacked on sight \u2014 I couldn't have been more wrong. Most of the people here are trying to live normal lives, focusing on agriculture and spiritual pursuits. That doesn\u2019t mean their guards didn\u2019t try to rough me up, but after I put the first couple of them on the floor, the rest were smart enough to realize they would be dead if I wanted them to be. After that, most of the people left me alone \u2014 a few were even willing to talk to me. I suspect some of them had never seen a dwarf before. \nBeyond the Horde, harpies, centaur, and quilboar are prevalent in specific regions of Durotar, attacking caravans and neighboring villages. These prove to be some of the first challenges for young warriors before they move on to bigger battles; these creatures are hardly organized enough to pose a major threat.\nSpeculation.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" multiplayer melee map &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe%27s%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt; states that an unexplored city was excavated near Durotar by Gazlowe's engineers. Its origin is unknown, but coupled with the presence of &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; underneath &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; it might indicate the presence of a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; site beneath the zone.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It borders [[Barrens (Classic)|the Barrens]] to the west and the coastal lands of [[Azshara (Classic)|Azshara]] to the north. The land of Durotar is rocky, and the soil is cracked and red, not unlike the [[orc]]s' homeland of [[Draenor]]. The land has many crags and canyons, where various dangerous creatures take residence. It is a harsh land to survive in; it is very dry and hot, and the vegetation and freshwater access is sparse. The orcs, however, see a harsh beauty in the land that reminds them of their home world. Durotar is a proving ground for young orcs, who are sent to the [[Valley of Trials]] to complete several rites of passage before they are considered fit for the challenges that lie ahead. Durotar is the new homeland of the orcs and the site of the orcs' principal city of [[Orgrimmar]]. While the orcs founded their city of Orgrimmar here, Durotar has become something of a haven for all of the Horde races, especially the trolls.\nHistory.\nFor many years, Durotar was home to the quilboar.

Caravans are common targets, creating a strong market for caravan guards.\nThe few large cities are distant from one another, with a variety of smaller encampments and villages scattered in between. Given that Durotar is the orcs' new homeland, Horde races and independents are welcome throughout the region. Alliance races risk their lives when they venture into Durotar.\n[[File:Razor Hill.jpg|thumb|Razor Hill]]\nThe [[orc]]s and the [[Darkspear]] [[troll]]s led by [[Thrall|Warchief Thrall]] landed here after their exodus from the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. They proceeded to explore the area, helping the [[tauren]] drive out the cruel [[centaur]]s who were harassing [[Cairne]] and his people.\nAfter the war against the [[Burning Legion]], Durotar was founded as a nation and the new orcish homeland by Thrall. The young warchief named the land after his father, [[Durotan]]. Upon this land, he laid the ground for the orcs' new capital city [[Orgrimmar]], named for the previous warchief and hero of the [[Horde]], [[Orgrim Doomhammer]].\nThe capital, [[Orgrimmar]], is host to 14,000 inhabitants. In all, Durotar has a population of 21,000, the majority of which is of orcish blood. 65% of those living here are orcs, 20% are trolls, 15% are tauren, 8% Forsaken, and the smallest, humans, at 2% of the population. It is ruled as a tribal chiefdom by [[Warchief Thrall]]. Major settlements include Orgrimmar, [[Razor Hill]], and [[Sen'jin Village]], with respective populations of 14,000, 3,000, and 2,000. Spoken here are the languages of Orcish, Common, Low Common, Taurahe, and Zandali, otherwise known as Troll.\nPeople and culture.\n[[File:Durotar1.jpg|thumb|The crags of Durotar.]]\nDurotar is the most populated of all Horde-controlled regions, as well as their cultural center. Here, young orcs, tauren, and trolls study shamanism and hunting. There is a strong sense of unity here, although a number of Horde members are disturbed by the growing presence of the Forsaken in their lands. I expected this central point for the Horde to also be a major battlefield, and that I would be attacked on sight \u2014 I couldn't have been more wrong. Most of the people here are trying to live normal lives, focusing on agriculture and spiritual pursuits. That doesn\u2019t mean their guards didn\u2019t try to rough me up, but after I put the first couple of them on the floor, the rest were smart enough to realize they would be dead if I wanted them to be. After that, most of the people left me alone \u2014 a few were even willing to talk to me. I suspect some of them had never seen a dwarf before. \nBeyond the Horde, harpies, centaur and quilboar are prevalent in specific regions of Durotar, attacking caravans and neighboring villages. These prove to be some of the first challenges for young warriors before they move on to bigger battles; these creatures are hardly organized enough to pose a major threat.\nGeography.\nThe geography of Durotar is similar to that of the orcs\u2019 original homeland of [[Draenor]], which is probably part of the reason why they are so comfortable settling here. The land is dry, baked red by the sun and littered with cacti and watering holes. The landmass itself is a long expanse separated from mainland [[Kalimdor]] by the [[Southfury River]]. Durotar is south of [[Azshara]]. The southern tip of Durotar ends at the [[Great Sea]]. The eastern coast is littered with sunken ships and considered to be a prime scavenging spot. The wildlife of the land includes boars, scorpids, raptors, crocolisks, thunder lizards, and makrura.\nThere are no [[dungeon]]s, [[raid dungeon]]s, [[micro dungeon]]s, or [[battleground]]s in Durotar. However, [[Ragefire Chasm]] can be found in the Horde capital city, [[Orgrimmar]], which is located in this zone.\nMaps and subregions.\n[[File:WorldMap-Durotar-old.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Map of Durotar]]\nTravel hubs.\n[[File:To Tame a Land - Valley of Honor and Hall of the Brave.jpg|thumb|Orgrimmar in \"Warcraft III\".]]\nThe Horde capital city, [[Orgrimmar]], is located in this zone, and is a major travel hub for Horde characters. In addition, the [[Zeppelin]] towers near Orgrimmar can carry players to the [[Eastern Kingdoms]], to either [[Undercity]] or [[Grom'Gol Base Camp]] and also the continent of [[Northrend]], to [[Warsong Hold]].\nNotable characters.\nDurotar is home to several orcs and trolls of status. From the base camp in the Valley of Trials, [[Zureetha Fargaze]] sends promising young orcs and trolls out into the world. In Sen'jin Village, [[Master Gadrin]] leads the effort to reclaim the Echo Isles from the evil witch doctor [[Zalazane]], and from his throne in [[Grommash Hold]], in the capital city of [[Orgrimmar]], [[Warchief Thrall]] seeks to eradicate the leaders of the [[Shadow Council]].\nQuests.\n[[File:Echo Isles.jpg|thumb|The Echo Isles]]\nSince Durotar is the starting zone for [[troll]]s and [[orc]]s, the quest range here is level 1-10.

Following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orc%20clans\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership founded the nation of Durotar and the great city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Founding of Durotar.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; over, and with it the immediate threat to the world, Thrall set out to found the new orcish homeland in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. He named the land &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; in honor of his father, and founded the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in honor of Orgrim Doomhammer. With the orcs' new allies, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and with the support of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;survivors&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall was able to build quickly. However, this was not to last. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina's father, arrived in Kalimdor (having left before the war was over to look for any surviving forces) and launched an &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; against the fledgling orc nation. During the initial assault the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; lost their new home on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; and with the help of the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, came to live with the orcs in Durotar. The &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; pledged the tribe's eternal allegiance to the Horde in return. Thrall, not knowing what humans had attacked him, initially suspected Jaina's forces, but her loyalty was proven when she helped the orcs stop the invading forces of her father Admiral Proudmoore.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe members of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; that remained in Azeroth became an integral part of Thrall's New Horde. With the foundation of Durotar, and the Horde capital of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the Shattered Hand has become the Horde's clan of assassins, training new rogues in the service of their Warchief.\nAt some point, a &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;expeditionary force&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; in order to explore a new land and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gor%27shak\"&gt;Commander Gor'shak&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. While there, he allowed himself to be captured by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in order to gather intelligence. Gor'shak learned that Princess &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; had been captured. Though Thrall sought a strike team to liberate her in order to strengthen relations in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, it was ultimately Alliance forces who entered the Blackrock Depths and killed &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor of the Dark Irons.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;second War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of Durotar was sent to the front lines in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; who acted as the Supreme Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the first &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the gates of Orgrimmar were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhen word reached Warchief Thrall that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; had reopened, he immediately gathered his advisors to plan an expedition through it, eager to find new insights into the history of his people on the other side. After the forces of the Horde, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, repelled an invasion through the Dark Portal from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, their combined forces pressed through it into the shattered world &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the homeworld of the orcs, &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Horde expedition, led by Thrall's loyal advisor &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, founded the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde came into contact with the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; - orcs corrupted by the blood of a &lt;a href=\"pitlord\"&gt;pitlord&lt;/a&gt; and the servants of the ruler of Outland, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. The Fel Horde was lead by none other than &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; and one of the greatest orc heroes of the younger history. The Horde forces stormed the stronghold of the Fel Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, conquered it and killed Kargath Bladefist. His fall to corruption and death was a heavy blow to the orcs, but they nonetheless honor the memory of the orc Kargath once was, as well as the lesson learned from his downfall.\nLater in the campaign, a detachment of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; were active in the region of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, where they serve as the defenders of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Village\"&gt;Shadowmoon Village&lt;/a&gt;, the closest Horde outpost to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. From there, they wage war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as well as the legions of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; was once again &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by the Scourge during the duel between Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The duel was interrupted as orcs and some other leaders of the Horde went to defend the city.\nAfter mopping up the few Scourge left, the warchief decided to form and send the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of all Horde forces under Garrosh Hellscream's command, towards &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, thus properly beginning the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. The Expedition battled its way to the doorstep of the Scourge, &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; put aside their differences and combined their forces in a showdown between them and the Lich King. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; renegades led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; unleashed the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; on living and Scourge alike in a surprise attack meant to rid themselves of all their enemies in one fell swoop.\nThe Horde forces suffered heavy casualties from this betrayal, including &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. Putress' actions were outside the orders of the Forsaken and, concurrently with the Wrathgate attack, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and hordes of his demonic brethren overran the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, slaying all those who would not submit to their dark rule. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; herself was nearly killed in the coup, but managed to escape with a number of loyalists and fled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Determined not to allow the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlords\"&gt;Dreadlords&lt;/a&gt; a foothold in Horde territory, Thrall and Sylvanas planned an immediate counter-attack. Unwilling to abandon the Undercity to the traitors, Sylvanas, Thrall, and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; lead a &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Horde counterattack&lt;/a&gt; in order to remove Varimathras from power and restore the Undercity to the Forsaken. After fighting their way through a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;-controlled Undercity, the Banshee Queen and the Warchief succeed in killing Varimathras and retaking the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt;. As they prepare to strike at Putress, however, King Varian enters and declares his intention to end it all there. Before the battle can increase in intensity, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; swiftly teleports the Alliance forces out of the Undercity, resulting in a successful Horde restoration.\nThough tensions remained high, the Horde and Alliance reluctantly remained focused on the Lich King for the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;; with only skirmishes between the two factions occurring to supplement their war effort in the war. Members of the Horde and the Alliance launched separate campaigns in Northrend, and their efforts resulted in the Lich King\u2019s crushing defeat. Under Overlord Garrosh's leadership, the orcs of Durotar led the Horde to victory against the Lich King in Northrend.\nCataclysm.\nPrior to the great &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief Thrall found that he needed to leave his position as Warchief to another in order to help heal the world. He gave the title to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. With much of Orgrimmar burned down during the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; and Durotar's geography changing from the over flooded &lt;a href=\"Southfury%20River\"&gt;Southfury River&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief Garrosh began reinforcing the city and Durotar with iron battlements, barricades and training grounds. The &lt;a href=\"harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; and many &lt;a href=\"watch%20tower\"&gt;watch tower&lt;/a&gt;s were also added.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, the northern area of Durotar became a spot of gatherings of concerned citizens and the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult.\nFollowing the Cataclysm, Garrosh evicted the majority of non-orc races from central Orgrimmar, as he believed only the orcs possessed the strength to truly defend the city, leading to tensions between Durotar and the other members of the Horde and began to take a far more ferocious stance in his &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;war with the Alliance&lt;/a&gt; - leading his forces in a rampage through &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; in order to secure the much sought after supplies his people need. His actions have caused the orcish people to avoid the famine that threatened &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; prior to his ascension. He believed that if the blood of the selfish Alliance was required to give his people the essentials they need to exist, then so be it. Hellscream's ascension has been applauded by most orcs, who felt that his brash warrior instincts and unwillingness to negotiate for needed resources were more in tune with the true orc way.\nGarrosh ordered the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to invade &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, as the Horde needed a port in the Eastern Kingdoms. Though Gilneas was initially conquered, the Gilneans were able to counterattack and push the Forsaken forces out of the city. Growing irritated, Garrosh sent his own forces to support the Forsaken, and a stalemate was reached. Garrosh later met with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and was present during her demonstration of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;'s great necromantic abilities. Though the Forsaken were appeased enough by this solution to their plight as a people, Garrosh was disgusted. He dispensed &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; to \"guard\" Lady Sylvanas, and after an insulting exchange with her, left.\nThe Horde forces under Garrosh's command launch assault into the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, organizing an impressive air fleet to obliterate the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult and claim the land for the Horde. Garrosh was informed of an Alliance fleet nestled below- and ordered his air support to destroy them. This backfired when - due to treachery from within - the Horde fleet was ambushed, undefended, by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his twilight drakes. Although Garrosh was personally able to fend one such drake off, his ship itself suffered massive damage and fell into the ocean below. The remainder of the fleet suffered a similar fate, crashing down into the sea. Garrosh himself was considered missing in action.\nWithout Garrosh's direct leadership, the Horde turned to the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to strike up an alliance. After failed negotiations with their master, &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Overlord Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde forces joined a Dragonmaw rebellion led by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, successfully dethroning Mor'ghor and his &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Garrosh, who had survived the crash, arrived at &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Port\"&gt;Dragonmaw Port&lt;/a&gt; and officially inducted Zaela and the Dragonmaw into the Horde.\nTides of War.\nMany members of the Blackrock clan were later granted amnesty and joined the new Horde at the behest of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. His own bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, was of Blackrock descent. He also became a leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; who began acting akin to a secret police, ensuring the loyalty of other Horde races (and, in some cases, orcs), while abducting, brutalizing, and in some cases even murdering those they deemed treasonous or troublesome.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; over and the threat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; subsided, Garrosh has reinvigorated his plans for conquest. Garrosh aimed to forcibly expel the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; from Kalimdor, and claim the continent for the good of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He expressed this desire in a meeting with the other Horde leaders (&lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, along with Malkorok and &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, the only advisor remaining from Thrall's reign), much to the chagrin of the former three. Garrosh intended to scour &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; from the continent and stunt the Alliance's military presence. With that done, he then aimed to take the night elves' land.\nAfter the successful &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;destruction of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, the battle force returned to Orgrimmar to celebrate their victory. Many cheers rose to Garrosh's victory. This victory would not be without its consequences, the Alliance retaliated with a large naval battle occurring in Durotar's &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;. As the tide turned against him, Garrosh used his &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; to summon &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; to tip the scales. The Alliance under King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; eventually broke the blockade. Following these events, Garrosh made a dark proclamation: every man, woman, and child was to assist in the war effort against the Alliance, and any found shirking their duties would face the wrath of the Kor'kron.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDue to the destruction of Theramore, the Alliance has become motivated to the war effort instead of crushed as Garrosh originally intended. While being informed about the various navy battles by the newly promoted &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Warchief was shocked to learn that during a naval battle in the south, Alliance forces were run aground. Upon learning about this &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;new uncharted land&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh became enraged that the Alliance got there first and quickly ordered the General to gather his best men to secure the new land for the Horde.\nLandfall.\nRoughly two months after the initial foray into &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh himself arrived with the bulk of the Horde fleet, and quickly went about removing the local &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; presence along the shore of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde, under the weight of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s command, continued to fracture, Garrosh and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; had yet another clash of opinions about his warmongering at the newly-constructed &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in Garrosh, long-tested by the Darkspear chieftain's criticism, ordering his rival's outright murder (under the guise of Vol'jin being sent on a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; with the Kor'kron). Vol'jin survived the attempt on his life, and it was revealed that Garrosh had put the Darkspear Isles under martial law.\nEscalation.\nFed up with Garrosh's warmongering, large portions of the Horde rose up against him. Garrosh branded the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; tribe as traitors to the Horde, forcibly taking over their holdings while oppressing and executing their members. The already precarious racial division of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; took another hit, as the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt; was then dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, and various non-orc members of the city are rounded up, chiefly among them the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; took the southern Durotar back from the Kor'kron. In response, Garrosh reinforced Orgrimmar's front gates with troops, wolf riders, and farseers. He also allied himself with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, bringing in a number of &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela's&lt;/a&gt; mount &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt; to defend Bladefist Bay.\nWarchief Garrosh had sent crews into the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in search of resources to push his war machine forward. In the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, Garrosh seized the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;desiccated heart of an Old God&lt;/a&gt; to use as a tool of war, unleashing horrors upon the sacred valley, and consequently caused tensions to reach a boiling point.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the city and the northern Durotar is put under siege by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Horde rebels&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Kor'kron barricades block access to most of the city's districts. Vol'jin's revolutionary forces have entrenched themselves along the main road, launching a frontal assault on the city's gates to break into the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance frigates storm the Bladefist Bay and landing parties attempt to capture the docks around Orgrimmar. Invading forces discover a massive underground compound constructed by Garrosh's forces for his own purposes. Skirmishes at the gates occurred before a full-scale battle erupted between the forces led by Vol'jin and the defenders still loyal to Garrosh. Despite Vol'jin's attempts to ram the gate and attack the walls with siege engines, the walls could not be breached. The arrival of a combined rebel and Alliance armada under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; disabled Orgrimmar's naval defenses. Eventually, the Kor'kron were pushed back into the gates and the arrival of Night Elf reinforcements under &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Night Elf glaive throwers brought the gate down, and the allied forces charged into Orgrimmar. The Valley of Strength was quickly liberated, and the death of &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; brought the upper city under Alliance/rebel control. The Underhold eventually fell when adventurers defeated and imprisoned the Warchief Garrosh. Vol'jin was quickly nominated and initiated as the new Warchief by Thrall and the other Horde leaders. Alliance forces left the city, and the rebels began rebuilding the damage that was done during the siege, but, the rebellion caused the nation to lose its top leadership.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nFollowing the events of &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned to be tried in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Before the trial could conclude, aided by &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;an ally&lt;/a&gt; who can manipulate the timelines, Garrosh escaped to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Draenor of the past&lt;/a&gt;, and prevented the orcs from ever drinking the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, creating an untainted &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of . Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; declared &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; on the Iron Horde and formed an expedition of all Horde forces under the command of numerous talented commanders to face the enemy.\nLegion.\nThe Horde armies sailed from Durotar to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the disastrous battle &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; took the mantle of Warchief, and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; was stationed inside &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; presiding over Orgrimmar as the leader of the orcs. Several orcish forces were present in several areas of the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;assaults&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth where they established &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions%23Randomized%20military%20camps\"&gt;military camps&lt;/a&gt; to protect Horde assets.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Varok Saurfang was the last Horde leader to join the Orgrimmar parade. Though &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; grudgingly respected Varok, she also sensed that out of all the Horde leaders, Varok was most likely the one to challenge or outright oppose her should she misstep too badly.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; had been saturated with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt;. Since it would be too costly for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to uproot them all, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had chosen to tolerate their presence. With both factions debilitated in their ability to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde came up with a plan to secure Kalimdor and elicit a political crisis in the Alliance that would lead to its downfall. After luring a majority of the night elven forces to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; through misinformation, the Horde would seek to hold &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; hostage and use the political crisis to sow division in the Alliance. That can only happen if the Horde wins in an honorable victory, which Sylvanas knows the Horde doesn't trust her to do. Thus, Sylvanas authorized Saurfang to create the battle plans and execute their strategy. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; wanted to kill &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in order to kill the kaldorei's spirit and end them as a nation.\nThe orcish forces gathered in front of Orgrimmar gates yet again and later marched with their Horde allies through Durotar into the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale to participate in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fourth War.\nThe genocide at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; had rallied the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to seek retribution. Saurfang commanded the defense of &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and Durotar's forces joined with other Horde forces to defend the city. After the battle, many Forsaken refugees arrived at &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; seeking refuge.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; is one of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; commanders, leading the forces of Durotar, and carrying the banner of the nation.\nSaurfang's rebellion.\nTo protect Azeroth and depose of Sylvanas, the Horde revolutionaries and Alliance planned to strike at Orgrimmar and to that end set up camp in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; collapsed the tunnel between Razor Hill and Orgrimmar. As a response, Saurfang turned to &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; breach the canyon. With his forces established within the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang turned to dealing with Sylvanas's spies and protecting their siege weapons. Knowing that Orgrimmar's greatest weakness was its multiple entrances Saurfang's strategy relied on attacking all three entrances at once. To that end, he directed for &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;'s forces to attack Orgrimmar from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; to lead their forces to attack the city from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and he, Thrall, and Anduin would lead their forces to attack Orgrimmar from Durotar. He further ordered &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; to lead her people to protect &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; in case of Sylvanas launching a counterattack.\nHowever, before the battle could commence, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as their brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to Mak'gora, Sylvanas initially had the upper hand against Saurfang, however, when she began to mock him about hope, Saurfang got his second wind by declaring that Sylvanas couldn't kill hope. As Saurfang turned the tide against Sylvanas he claimed that she failed to kill hope at Teldrassil, failed in getting the Horde and Alliance to keep killing each other, he further declared that the Horde would endure, that Horde was strong and was able to slash Sylvanas across her eye. This turn caused an enraged Sylvanas to declare that Horde was nothing, that they were all nothing. Sylvanas then killed Saurfang quickly with a blast of unknown magic and abandoned the Horde altogether.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Horde leaders formed the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, with Thrall becoming the orc &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\nPeople and culture.\nSince Thrall took leadership of the Horde there is no discrimination between genders in orcish society. Women are able to pursue the same career choices as men, rise to positions of power and are even expected to answer to the call for battle just as men are. Strength (both physical and mental), courage, initiative, and independence are prized traits in all orcs. Traditionally, children are seen as children of the parents but are raised as children of the clan. However, because of the newly unified Horde and the current diaspora of individual orc families creating homes and settling down in various areas around Durotar, &lt;a href=\"the%20Barrens\"&gt;the Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, this typical clan scheme has been changing, and life is beginning to become more centered around the nuclear family rather than the greater clan.\nOrcs instinctively revere the rugged forces of the natural elements, and as such, shaman are held in high regard. They generally have a close relationship with the nature elements and angering them is considered a grave offense. Over the ages, shaman-like &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; have communed with these spirits and, through patience and dedication, learned to soothe roaring infernos, bring rain to sun-scorched lands, and otherwise temper the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s' ruinous influence on the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; is a barren place with little water or plant life, orcs are reliant on shamans to negotiate with the elementals to provide necessities such as drinking water from fallen rain or fire to warm their hearths.\nPolitical structure.\nThe nation of Durotar is the union of the many clans. Each clan has a different culture, tradition or behavior which sets them apart from the other clans and often also gives them their name. The Warsong clan, for example, is named because of the rhythmic songs they chant in battle, while the Shattered Hand clan is named for the tradition of their warriors to cut of their own hand and replace it with a weapon.\nEvery orc clan is led by a chieftain, the chieftain is usually the strongest member of the clan and there are two ways of becoming a chieftain. Either you challenge the old chieftain and beat him in a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; or you inherit the status of chieftain.\nWhile there are still many different clans in the Horde, they don't live as strictly separated as they once did. However, some clans still maintain a large amount of individuality and separate themselves from the other clans, like Warsong or Dragonmaw.\nMilitary.\nThe nation of Durotar possesses an array of military organizations:"}

In it players travel North through &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, starting with Sen'jin Village in the South and ending at the Dranosh'ar Blockade leading into Orgrimmar.\nSen'jin Village.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; players meet &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; who is having trouble as humans from &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; have started landing on the coasts of Durotar. They are preparing to invade the zone, as evidenced by attack plans discovered in &lt;a href=\"The%20War%20of%20Northwatch%20Aggression\"&gt;The War of Northwatch Aggression&lt;/a&gt;. Under the direction of Master Gadrin and &lt;a href=\"Lar%20Prowltusk\"&gt;Lar Prowltusk&lt;/a&gt;, players disrupt the Northwatch supply chains and destroy their plans. With the threat temporarily subdued, Master Gadrin sends players onwards to Razor Hill to ask for reinforcements.\nRazor Hill.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; players are introduced to &lt;a href=\"Gar%27Thok\"&gt;Gar'Thok&lt;/a&gt; who immediately denies Master Gadrin's request for reinforcements, claiming that he is swamped by his own problems. To start, the Northwatch forces have holed up in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and then on top of that, the &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s of the region have started acting up. While helping Gar'Thok with these problems, players encounter &lt;a href=\"Gail%20Nozzywig\"&gt;Gail Nozzywig&lt;/a&gt;, a resourceful Goblin who is seeking to turn a profit from the destruction caused by the Cataclysm.\nAfter clearing up the problems around Razor Hill, Gail remembers that her boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Thonk\"&gt;Thonk&lt;/a&gt; was looking for help some time ago and she sends players to help him. It turns out Thonk is watching over the Southfury Watershed and he needs players to rescue anyone trapped in the watershed. Players head into the Watershed in &lt;a href=\"Watershed%20Patrol\"&gt;Watershed Patrol&lt;/a&gt; and have to rescue &lt;a href=\"Raggaran\"&gt;Raggaran&lt;/a&gt;, who has them kill Quilboar first, &lt;a href=\"Grandmatron%20Tekla\"&gt;Grandmatron Tekla&lt;/a&gt;, who needs to be escorted out, &lt;a href=\"Misha%20Tor%27kren\"&gt;Misha Tor'kren&lt;/a&gt;, who is making a necklace for her dead son, and &lt;a href=\"Zen%27Taji\"&gt;Zen'Taji&lt;/a&gt;, who is trying to help the local plainstriders. After helping each of them, they will leave the Watershed and the quest can finally be completed. With all the quests in Razor taken care of, players can explore Durotar and find a few more quests around the zone. Alternatively, a breadcrumb to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; is available from &lt;a href=\"Takrin%20Pathseeker\"&gt;Takrin Pathseeker&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond Razor Hill.\nOutside of Razor Hill there are a couple of miscellaneous quests that can be picked up. The major quest line starts with &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Blade\"&gt;The Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and has players travel to the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; where they seek out &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; cultists in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Rock\"&gt;Skull Rock&lt;/a&gt; and Southfury Watershed. While at the Blockade, players enter into a minor conflict between the two commanders &lt;a href=\"Shin%20Stonepillar\"&gt;Shin Stonepillar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gor%20the%20Enforcer\"&gt;Gor the Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;, eventually taking Gor's side and clearing out the nearby Elementals.

From this decree, Durumu was given life. The clever entity stubbornly obeyed its masters until the Thunder King's death, at which time it disappeared into the citadel's labyrinthine corridors. Only recently has Durumu, all but forgotten by the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, emerged from hiding.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Years ago, players encountered C\u2019Thun, the eye of an old god beneath the Temple of Ahn\u2019Qiraj. As giant eyes are wont to do, it fired eyebeams as its primary method of attack. Durumu has many more eyes, and therefore fires many more eyebeams.\"\nStrategy.\nNormal Phase.\nTanks will need to taunt off each other at regular intervals to prevent Serious Wound from stacking too high, although a skilled paladin tank with Clemency talented can bubble the stacks off and solo-tank the encounter.\nRaid members targeted by Lingering Gaze must position the void zones towards the edges of the room, so that they do not interfere with the raid's movement during the Disintegration Beam phase. Players targeted by this ability have around 3 seconds to position themselves.\nForce of Will simply requires the raid to move out of the cones before they get knocked back (likely to their deaths).\nDealing with Life Drain requires other raid members to alternate standing between the target and the Hungry Eye so that the target doesn't die, and so that healing received by the boss is minimised.\nOn heroic difficulty, Durumu will also conveniently place ice walls, especially when the fight is about to switch into a Light Spectrum or Disintegration Beam phase. The ice walls must be broken down as a top priority, or the raid will wipe shortly after a phase change due to the severe movement restrictions imposed.\nAnother heroic-only mechanic that comes into play later in the encounter is Dark Parasite. This is a DoT on a player that does increasing damage until it is dispelled; when it is dispelled, it turns into a debuff that has the same duration remaining on it that Dark Parasite did when it was dispelled, and causes Wandering Eye adds to spawn every 3 seconds. These adds fixate on a random player and deal minor damage, but mirror all damage received to their target. Healers will need to find a dispelling balance so that Dark Parasite does not deal too much damage, but also that the number of Wandering Eyes spawned after Dark Parasite is dispelled is not too great. The Wandering Eyes themselves should be taken down by incidental cleave/multi-DoT damage and light AoE attacks; if too much burst damage is applied, raid members will die.\nMajor DPS cooldowns such as timelust should be used on the pull, as there are no distractions for the raid at this time.\nLight Spectrum Phase.\nWhen the Light Spectrum phase begins, three random raid members will be targeted by a beam of light: one red, one blue, one yellow. Shortly afterwards, they will turn into a red cone, blue cone and yellow cone. The red and blue cones will follow the initially targeted players around, whereas the yellow cone will simply rotate around the room.\nAt the same time, invisible adds will spawn on the platform, which can only be revealed by shining the cones of light on them. Attentive players will notice that the locations of the adds will be briefly indicated by appropriately-coloured flashes of light at their locations, and can throw down raid markers at these locations.\nThe red cone will reveal a Crimson Fog, and the goal of the light spectrum phase is to kill three Crimson Fogs (at which point, the fight returns to the Normal Phase). The player with the red cone will need to rotate around Durumu until a Crimson Fog is revealed, at which point the raid will kill it. The red cone then needs to be moved to the next Crimson Fog. Prematurely unrevealing the Crimson Fog will result in high raid damage, so the player with the red cone needs to be extremely careful not to move the red cone away from the Crimson Fog until it has been killed. On heroic difficulty, the raid will wipe if the three Crimson Fogs are not found and defeated after 80 seconds.\nThe blue cone will reveal an Azure Fog. NEVER reveal the Azure Fog (except on LFR difficulty), as revealing it will wipe the raid. The player targeted by the blue cone should move to a location that will not cause the Azure Fog to be revealed, and should remain there until the phase ends.\nThe yellow cone will not reveal any adds on LFR or normal difficulty; however, on heroic difficulty, it will reveal an Amber Fog. If the Amber Fog is ever revealed, the raid must immediately switch to it and kill it before the yellow cone moves on its way, as the raid will wipe if the Amber Fog is unrevealed.\nAs if this wasn't enough, the cones deal damage split out amongst all players within them, so the raid needs to stand within the cones to keep the damage at a minimum. Melee should all stand within the red cone (which will cause them to be within range of the Crimson Fogs when they are revealed), healers should stand within the blue cone (the cone will not move if the phase is correctly executed, allowing them to focus on healing without having to move), tanks should take the yellow cone as it sweeps around the room, and ranged can alternate between the blue and red beams as necessary.\nTanks will still be concerned with Serious Wound during this phase.\nDisintegration Beam Phase.\nDon't panic.\nWhile the boss is charging his beam (the first 10 seconds), the raid should actually stand within it. Shortly afterwards, the raid will notice blue squiggles on either the left or the right of the beam, and the raid should then immediately move to this point. Moments afterwards, the beam will activate (and will one-shot anyone it hits), and the room will be covered in Eye Sores that will do high ticking damage to everyone standing within them. However, the place previously indicated by the blue squiggles will not be covered in Eye Sores, so if the raid correctly stacks in this place, they will survive.\nAt this point, the boss then decides to rotate, and the beam will move towards the raid, but as the beam closes in, a maze through the Eye Sores is revealed. The raid simply needs to Keep Calm and Follow the Maze as it is revealed to avoid Eye Sore damage and to avoid being taken out by the Disintegration Beam. Once the boss does a full rotation, the phase will end.\nJust follow the maze... and don't panic!\nHeroic Mode.\nOnly Heroic additions for durumu is than the Light spectrum phase now have a time limit of 80 seconds,if players doesnt finish the phase in such time durumu case Obliterate and instant kills the raid.This is trivial for raids who understand how the phase works,as the only addition is the amber fog,than sometimes can be revealed and ranged dps must quickly kill it,since the yellow maze move on its own and will quickly stop revealing the amber fog and cause a wipe.\nAdditionally on the color phase durumu posses an additional eye,the evil eye,than sets a 30 secs debuff called dark pasasite on a player than works just like Sinestra's wrack,where it deals damage the longer it stays on its host(it deals initially 100k,which slowly increases).\nHealers must delay the dispel of the paratise and heal though it then dispel it(dispelling it with less than 15 secs remaining is ideal),because as soon as its dispelled the parasite transforms into a dark plague,than summons eye adds every 3 seconds who stick to a random player and cast devour,dealing 50k damage to them every few secs.But when damaged,they copy their damage taken into their host.\nBecause of this,players should not try to burst the eyes and simply must multi-dot/cleave to do the job.\nThe Desintregration phase works same as Normal mode,but 10 secs before durumu cast the eye he spawns the most annoning Heroic addition.3 Ice walls than has 7M on 10 man and 25M on 25 man and they have divided(and spread) sections than shares the HP of that wall(this also happens before Light spectrum phases except for the first one).The raid has roughly 15 secs to break the walls before the starts.Classes with strong aoe and dots abilities(demonology warlocks,hunters,elemental shamans) can easly damage all the sections than shares the hp and quickly break the walls to proceed with the desintegration beam phase just like on Normal mode.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "551868", "revid": "42038977", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=551868", "title": "Dusk lily", "text": "The dusk lily is a species of flower native to the region of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The plant is characterized by petals of watermelon pink with dark green serrated leaves.\nThe image of the dusk lily came to prominence at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, where it was symbolically associated with the rebellion's leader, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and grew to represent the entire movement. Following the victory of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; in the civil war against &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, and the subsequent creation of a new government in Suramar, the dusk lily became the insignia of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; race.\nUsage.\nThe potent symbolism of the dusk lily within &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; civilization appears to have been prominent even prior to the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, though it was during the civil war that it achieved its true political connotations. &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, as First Arcanist of Suramar, had long been associated with the dusk lily within nightborne society\u2014she herself adored the flower, and her personal seal bore its image. After launching a failed coup against &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and almost dying in the attempt, Thalyssra would form a resistance movement known as the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;. In time, these dissidents would also come to be called \"Dusk Lily rebels\".\nEarly in the civil war, symbols of, and references to, the dusk lily were used by Thalyssra and the rebels to make themselves known to allies and sympathizers. As the conflict progressed, images of dusk lilies were utilized to send a message to the Grand Magistrix and her allies, with a lily being left on killed combatants and in prominent instances of rebel activity, such as after the rescue of &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Order\"&gt;Terrace of Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the defeat of Grand Magistrix Elisande, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; formed a new faction under the leadership of Thalyssra. Their new emblem became that of the Dusk Lily itself, marking the beginning of a new chapter in shal'dorei history.\nIn-game.\nWhile dusk lilies are frequently mentioned in-game and seen illustrated, no growing example has been confirmed as such within the game itself. &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; does, however, host numerous flowers and other flora that share many of the dusk lily's traits.\nOne of the more promising options (pictured) possesses the correct color scheme, and can notably be found in great numbers around the &lt;a href=\"Estate%20of%20the%20First%20Arcanist\"&gt;Estate of the First Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;, the residence of &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;."}

Boasting a wide array of skilled mages and warriors alike, the Duskwatch represents the bulk of &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; armed forces.\nMembers of the Duskwatch serve largely as police for the city, enforcing the orders of the city's regime. Despite probably serving a relatively domestic role while the city was sealed off from the remainder of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for 10,000 years, the raising of Suramar's shield has led to the Duskwatch taking on a more active military role. They were regularly employed as soldiers and shock troops, being deployed throughout the greater &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; region.\nWith the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar City has become a troubled place. Dissent grew in the face of the Grand Magistrix's pact with the Legion, and the Duskwatch were often used as a tool to put down (usually violently) any form of insurrection. In spite of the order's notorious loyalty to Elisande, numerous members of the Duskwatch began to defect to the growing &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; as their leader's actions begin to grow more erratic and callous.\nMembers of the Duskwatch can be found throughout Suramar City, patrolling or standing guard at key points. The &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Promenade%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;Grand Promenade&lt;/a&gt; serves as the watch's headquarters. With the success of &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;'s rebellion, the Duskwatch began to serve the new regime, eventually becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; alongside Suramar as a whole.\nHistory.\nSuramar shielded.\nThe organization's name seeming to make reference to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, little is known about the Duskwatch's beginnings. Regardless, by the time the shield came down over 10,000 years later, the Duskwatch were firmly established as the chief peacekeeping force of Suramar, and exclusively loyal to the city's ruler, &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrival of the Legion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began its third invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, an ultimatum was delivered to the city of Suramar by the Legion's representative, . Ultimately choosing to bow to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' demands, the Grand Magistrix's decision angered many in Suramar. Chief among these, the First Arcanist &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; quickly instigated a coup against Elisande. During this insurrection, however, the dissidents were ambushed, probably by Duskwatch forces. In the wake of the attempted plot, the Grand Magistrix and her supporters\u2014including the Duskwatch\u2014became virtually unopposed in their rule.\nAs events progressed, forces from the rest of Azeroth arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to oppose the Legion. Having aligned itself with the demons, Suramar City became something of a focal point for the conflict. At this point, the city hosted a large occupying force of demons, who were known to work in tandem with the Duskwatch to maintain order and obedience.\nThe Nightfallen rebellion.\nBefore long, a resistance to Elisande's rule formed and began to grow outside the city, led by Thalyssra, who had survived the failed coup. Initially composed mainly of recruited &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; from outside the Broken Isles, the uprising quickly gained support in the face of Elisande's harsh policies. Attacks and other operations were regularly orchestrated within Suramar, ruthlessly opposed by the Duskwatch, who continued to enforce unpopular measures such as &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; rationing. As the insurrection grew unabated, the Duskwatch started to take drastic action, arresting citizens en masse (including children), and patrolling the streets alongside demons.\nDespite the steps taken by Elisande and the Duskwatch, the rebellion continued to grow in power, even launching attacks on secure areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt;, which the Duskwatch failed to defend (though security was considerably tightened afterwards). By this time, much of the city's population, particularly those in the lower castes of &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; society, were highly sympathetic to the cause of &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, and were outraged and terrified by the actions taken by Suramar's ruling powers. Even the loyalty of the Duskwatch was tested by the severe and violent stance that the Grand Magistrix and her supporters were taking.\nThe final straw for many in the Duskwatch, however, came with the massacre at &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;The Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;. Incensed by the rebels' continued successes, the Grand Magistrix sent a large force of demons and nightborne to slaughter the majority of the residents of the Waning Crescent, one of the greatest hot spots for dissent in the city. Although some escaped with the help of members of the Nightfallen, the remaining civilians were either killed or enslaved by the Grand Magistrix's forces. Though many members of the Duskwatch were ordered to take part in the operation, the horrific nature of the incident convinced many that Elisande no longer cared for the well-being of the nightborne people. Thus, members of the Duskwatch began to desert from their posts and defect to the Nightfallen insurrection.\nAs &lt;a href=\"elven\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; arrived to aid the rebellion, large scale fighting broke out in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Promenade\"&gt;Grand Promenade&lt;/a&gt;. Establishing camps from which to siege Suramar just outside the city, the invading armies clashed with considerable Duskwatch forces dispatched to defend the outskirts. During the fighting, disguised Duskwatch agents attempted to infiltrate the camps of both elven armies, though they were discovered and eliminated before they could achieve their objectives.\nDespite the Duskwatch's efforts, the rebels and their allies would eventually storm the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself and put an end to both &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s regime, as well as demon influence in the city.\nNew management.\nWith the rebellion over and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; victorious, a new government was established to rule the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;; the Duskwatch would maintain its previous role as Suramar's security force. &lt;a href=\"Victoire\"&gt;Victoire&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the watch who had changed sides during the conflict, was made First Blade and placed in charge of the Duskwatch. Thalyssra's personal security force became composed of &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch%20Sentinel\"&gt;Duskwatch Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThalyssra would ultimately pledge the loyalty of the nightborne to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in the lead-up to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.

It's mainly a DPS race &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;, with only limited tactics involved. He has sometimes been called \"Patchwerk 3.3\".\nThis boss is available since January 5, 2010 on US servers and January 6 on EU servers.\nStrategy.\nFestergut has an enrage timer of 5 minutes, which is rather short. In 25 player, this means the raid has to do 135,000 DPS overall, in 10 player it's 32,000. Depending on raid size and numbers of healers and tanks, the following table yields the average DPS needed per damage dealer (assuming 2 tanks with 2k DPS in 10 player and 2 tanks with 3k in 25 player):\nPositioning and movement.\nTank the boss right where he starts. The raid is divided into a ranged group which sets up distributed, at least 7 yards away from everyone else, and a melee group, which stands close in, everyone on top of each other, slightly behind the boss. Members of the close-in group hardly need to move at all, and can concentrate on maximum DPS. Melee dps can dps from the side of the boss, but must collapse onto the tanks for the spores. The ranged group has to move regularly, and its members may also get Vile Gas, which incapacitates them for 6 seconds.\nSince the encounter is a DPS race, the melee group should be large, while the ranged group should be small. The required minimum number for the ranged group is 8/3 in 25/10 player. If fewer raid members stand outside melee range, members of the melee group may get Vile Gas, which usually leads to a wipe.\nSo the first priority when organizing the groups is to get the minimum number in ranged. If possible, healers should be part of the melee group (this encounter is pretty healing intensive). If many ranged are available, it's even possible to put ranged damage dealers in the melee group, increasing their output substantially. On the other hand, it may be advantageous to put a few more than the required minimum at range, to reduce the probability of double spores in the melee group, and to create a safety margin if a ranged dies.\nThe ranged group members need to keep at least 7 yards away from everyone else. The simplest method is to put the required number of ranged players in a wide circle around the room. It's possible to move around the outer circle without pulling the boss prior to the fight. A more efficient way is to organize ranged in pairs, where one player stands halfway towards the melee group and the other stands outside.\nRoughly two minutes into the encounter, Festergut casts Pungent Blight, which causes about 50,000 damage to every player in the raid. Players take 25% less damage per stack of Inoculation they gain. Inoculation is gained by standing within 5 yards of a Spore when it explodes. Festergut casts three sets of Spores prior to Pungent Blight; thus players can reduce Pungent Blight damage to 25% (12.5k). It's not possible to gain more than one stack of Inoculation at the same time, that is standing within 5 yards of more than one spore results in higher damage taken, but not extra Inoculation stacks.\nThe first Pungent Blight clears all stacks of Innoculate. Festergut continues to cast Spore sets, and may cast a second Pungent Blight about 30 seconds prior to the enrage. If overall damage output is high enough to kill him early, it's safe to pop &lt;a href=\"DPS%20cooldowns\"&gt;DPS cooldowns&lt;/a&gt; after the 3rd spore and ignore the spores for the remainder of the fight. However, with marginal DPS, it's a good idea to continue stacking Innoculation, and pop cooldowns after the 6th spore.\nIn 10 player, Festergut casts 2 Spores, in 25 player it's three. After Spores are cast, all players have 10 seconds to move within 5 yards of a raid member with a spore. At the same time, raid members with spores should pay attention that two spores should not stand next to each other.\nGiven the above raid layout (minimum number of ranged and maximum number of melee), the melee group usually doesn't have to worry - it's highly probable that one Spore spawns on a melee member, so they usually don't have to move at all. For the ranged group, there are two movement tactics possible:\nStatic Spores.\nRanged members who get Spore simply stand still. All other ranged have to find the Spore closest to them, move there, wait until it bursts, and then return to their places. Advantages of this method are:\nDisadvantages are:\nStatic Collapse Points.\nTwo/one (in 25/10 player) ranged get a raid mark. These never move. One raid member with a Spore must move to each of the marked players, and all other ranged can move to the mark closest to them.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nStatic Collapse Points - 25 player PuG version.\nIf some players are unfamiliar with the fight on 25, a simplified 2 Collapse Points method can be used. 5 ranged players form a line on the outer circle surrounding the boss. The center player of the 5 is lined up with the door for easy in fight reference. 3 additional ranged players stack on the middle 5 ranged players, one on each of the 3. The Collapse Point is on the middle player in the back row of 5.\nOnce the tank has the bosses attention, the 3 stacked players move forward 10 yards and start dpsing. We now have a line of 3 in front of a line of 5. When the spores come out, all ranged collapses on their one collapse point, the middle player in the back row of 5. After the spores pop, ranged returns to their positions. Ranged watches their spacing throughout the fight, which should be 10 yards, as Gaseous Blight victims wander around a bit. The forward group of 3 must not be too close to the melee because if they are Gaseous Blight victim, it can chain on to the melee, causing a wipe.\nWhen the spores come out, a raid leader assesses them and makes any movement call outs. If the spores are 1/2 ranged/melee or 2/1 ranged/melee, people simply collapse. Only 3/0, and 0/3 spore distributions need a call out where either a ranged will run in to the melee group, or a melee will run out to the ranged group. The odds of a 3/0 spore distribution is roughly 1/27. The odds of a 0/3 is roughly 8/27. After the spores pop, anyone who ran from melee to ranged, or ranged to melee returns quickly to their original place.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages:\nTanking and healing.\nSetup and Damage Input.\nThis encounter requires at least two tanks. The boss hits very quickly for around 14,000 to 15,000 on plate. Damage output increases by 30% (additive, so +90% at 3 stacks) for each cast of Inhale Blight, after three Inhales he hits for around 24,000 to 26,000 per attack. Attack speed also increases by 30% per stack, tanks take about 260% more damage at three stacks.\nCooldown rotation.\nBecause of the massive amounts of damage received when Festergut has inhaled 3 stacks of Inhaled Blight it is required for tanks and others to rotate their cooldowns. The use of such abilities as Shield Wall, Divine Protection, Icebound Fortitude, and Barkskin should be coordinated with other non-tank player abilities such as Pain Suppression, Hand of Sacrifice and Guardian Spirit to maximize the amount of time that one of these abilities is active.\nGastric Bloat and Gastric Explosion.\nAbout once every 12 seconds, Festergut casts Gastric Bloat on the tank. This debuff increases the tank's damage, but the 10th stack kills the tank in an explosion for massive AoE damage, which is almost certainly a wipe. Therefore, the second tank must taunt at 9 stacks. This happens for the first time right around when Festergut is about to cast Inhale Blight for the third time, the second time after the 5th inhale. Switching on an Inhale is a very good idea, because while inhaling, Festergut stops DPS for a short moment. Healers need to be aware of the tank switch, particularly at the first time it happens during a high-damage period. The mechanic is quite similar to the Phase Punch of &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt's not possible to switch earlier, because the debuff lasts 100 seconds, it has timed out only after the second tank has taken 9 stacks. In 25 player it's possible to use 3 tanks and allow a less tight rotation, but this comes at the price of reduced DPS. Paladins can also clear the debuff with &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the tank switch, the prior tank does 90% increased damage (= increased threat). Therefore, the \"old\" tank must be very careful not to pull Festergut off the new tank. They should target themselves before the switch to stop their attack. &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Salvation\"&gt;Hand of Salvation&lt;/a&gt; helps. Tanks should switch off aggro generation abilities like Paladins &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Fury\"&gt;Righteous Fury&lt;/a&gt; and switch on DPS enhancing abilities (e.g. Druids &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt;, Death Knights &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Presence\"&gt;Blood Presence&lt;/a&gt;). Of course they must not forget to get back in a proper tanking configuration prior to taking over again.\nHealing.\nThis encounter is very healing intensive, at the same time it's desirable to bring the minimum number of healers (probably 5/2 in 25/10 player). Healers need to maintain the health of the active tank, as well as repair the &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage from Gaseous Blight, and heal Vile Gas victims. After each inhale, the raid damage decreases, but the damage to the tank increases more. It's a good idea to predesignate one healer for each inhale who switches from raid healing to tank healing. If possible, healers should stand with the melee group.\nHeroic difficulty.\nThe big addition in heroic mode is Malleable Goo. &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Putricide\"&gt;Professor Putricide&lt;/a&gt; periodically flings Malleable Goo from his balcony as he\nwatches the fight. Tanks, melee, and ranged are all targets for malleable goo.\nIf players are in the blast radius they take damage and suffer a 12 seconds 250% attack/casting speed debuff. If DPS are debuffed you will have difficulty beating the enrage timer. If healers are debuffed, the tank will probably die.\nIf you tank Festergut on the south side of the room you have more time to react to Malleable Goo. The target of the Malleable Goo is\nindicated by a small green puddle on the floor. It is difficult (but not impossible) to see when the Gaseous Blight is at full strength. It is also obscured by the player's polygons and by festergut's feet. To more easily spot the goo, move your player a little bit and check the floor whenever Malleable Goo is in flight. The blast radius is larger than the puddle.\nThere will be times when you have to group up for a Gas Spore at the same time there is a Malleable Goo in flight. All players must know how to position themselves to get innoculated while not getting blasted by goo.\nThe tank is often in danger when a healer has to dodge Malleable Goo and is forced to use instant heals instead of big heals. Quick\ncommunication can let the tank know to use his cooldowns and improve his survival chances.\nOnce players have learned how to dodge goo while fulfilling their roles this hard mode becomes much less intimidating.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Near the center of the Whispering Forest is a ring of giant mushrooms. Every now and again, the Fey-Drunk Darters begin to appear, one by one, and fly erratically in the general area of the mushroom ring. Over time seven of them will fade in, and at some point all seven darters seem to come to some forgone conclusion and they converge on the ring. The Fey-Drunk Darters begin to sing. As they sing, beams of light shine from each darter, converging on the center of the mushroom ring. The other animals of the glen come to watch, curious about the lights and sounds no doubt, and just as suddenly as the mysterious ritual starts, it stops. The darters slowly fly away and fade out to wherever they happened to come from, and the stags, does, and fawns wander off. Hours later, the event begins again.\nSpeculation.\nThey may perhaps be trying to heal the land from the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Zakajz\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt; who rests beneath the Whispering Forest."}

These did not have to be the same type of bullet, but each slot in the ammo pouch would hold only one kind of bullet. \nWhen the currently equipped stack of bullets ran out of bullets, an ammo pouch would automatically re-equip another stack of the same type of bullet, if one existed in the ammo pouch. This way the player would not have to worry about reloading, simply placing several stacks of the same bullets in the ammo pouch. It was advisable to not mix kinds of bullets in a ammo pouch in order to avoid having shooting occasionally halt, waiting for a manual reload.\nThough any character could equip and fill them, an ammo pouch primarily was of benefit to a hunter, whose role, mechanics, and attacks depended on using large amounts of ammo, especially due to the &lt;a href=\"autoshot\"&gt;autoshoot&lt;/a&gt; capability. Other classes that were able to use guns, mainly as devices to just pull mobs, simply used a handful of bullets in normal bags, if not a throwing weapon.\nCurrently available ammo pouches:\nNote: Prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.1.0\"&gt;Patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, ammo pouches granted a &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; effect, increasing the &lt;a href=\"Rate%20of%20Fire\"&gt;rate of fire&lt;/a&gt;, of 10 to 15 percent (depending on level). This was removed in Patch 3.1.0, replaced with hunters receiving a 15% boost to Auto Shot speed. The patch also increased the number of remaining shots that can be displayed on the action bar."}

Apparently, his is also its creator; he is credited in the book &lt;a href=\"Compendium%20of%20Fallen%20Heroes\"&gt;Compendium of Fallen Heroes&lt;/a&gt; for making the &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tartek%20the%20Enraged\"&gt;Tartek the Enraged&lt;/a&gt; which single-handedly slew more than 1,200 quilboar before falling.

He now rules the Death's Head's every move through the power of his massive consciousness.\nNotably, earlier statements suggested that the Death's Head was formed when the quilboar in Razorfen Downs willingly allied themselves with the Scourge. This contradicts the explanation found in \"Compendium of Fallen Heroes\". See the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Head%20tribe\"&gt;Death's Head tribe&lt;/a&gt;-article for details.\nIn order to put an end to this threat, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; of both factions were sent by &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Brownell\"&gt;Andrew Brownell&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the lich.\nThough he was defeated many times, Amnennar will return as his phylactery was not destroyed. One such time could be when &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; stopped him from getting a foothold when he attacked &lt;a href=\"Death%20Speaker%20Blackthorn\"&gt;Death Speaker Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt; who wanted to raise him.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Blackthorn worked on a way to revive the lich from his phylactery. &lt;a href=\"Koristrasza\"&gt;Koristrasza&lt;/a&gt; entered the downs once again as her previous attempt was not fully completed. Now, with the aid of the adventurers she aided them personally and Blackthorn was killed. However, with his death, Amnennar rose once again. After the lich was slain once more, Koristrasza took his phylactery to the Red dragonflight in order to find a way for its destruction.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The lich Amnennar and his forces participated in the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.

To that end, Amnennar has set his sights on recruiting the recently displaced and desperate &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; people, promising them power over &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; so they can repel invaders in their lands.\""}

{"id": "407505", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=407505", "title": "Amphitheater of Annihilation", "text": "Amphitheater of Annihilation is a sub-zone in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, on . \nA watery zone home to &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sporebat\"&gt;sporebat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fungal%20giant\"&gt;fungal giant&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Flytrap%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;Flytraps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slippery%20Slime\"&gt;Slippery Slime&lt;/a&gt;s can be found here to augment the powers of opportunistic adventurers. The inhabitants of this area are known as \"the Shapers\".\nDescription.\nThe Amphitheater is the closest point of the island to mainland Draenor, and the giant mushrooms that form a broken causeway between the two can be found here, leading off across the &lt;a href=\"Barrier%20Sea\"&gt;Barrier Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the distant &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently once the seat of some kind of combat or contest, this ancient ogre Amphitheater has long since given way to the encroaching ocean and plant life, with the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; that make their home here either coming with it, or actively seeking to aid its progress across the zone.\nThe main area of the zone comprises a kind of circuit around a massive ogre statue, while on the northwest edge of the circuit stands a crumbling yet still imposing structure, now home only to shambling &lt;a href=\"Marsh%20Creature\"&gt;Marsh Creature&lt;/a&gt;s. While the southeast of the zone is relatively dry, to the northwest the land gives way entirely to the sea, outcroppings of rock serving to extend the zone beyond the Amphitheater itself. The southeast exit from the Amphitheater leads across an ancient courtyard toward &lt;a href=\"Kings%27%20Rest%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;Kings' Rest&lt;/a&gt;, through which the island's other western zones can be accessed. To the northeast, a smaller exit leads out to the beach, an eastern path leading past the Horde Mine Entrance up to &lt;a href=\"Emberfall%20Tower\"&gt;Emberfall Tower&lt;/a&gt;, where the Horde prepare their advance across the zone. Directly to the north &lt;a href=\"Warspear\"&gt;Warspear&lt;/a&gt; itself can be glimpsed in the distance.\nEvent.\nRacing! is the event that takes place in the Amphitheater.\nAround the center of the area trawl two mighty riders - the Horde rider atop a giant &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance rider atop a mighty &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt; - slowly doing laps of the Amphitheater. The riders move very slowly, but for each player of their faction within their vicinity their speed is increased by 30%, allowing them to outstrip their competitor. The first faction to complete 3 laps wins the event. The escorting of the riders is complexified by the presence of the mobs in the area, causing racing players to frequently incur the wrath of the local inhabitants. The riders cannot be attacked.\nNotable features.\nSlippery Slimes.\n&lt;a href=\"Slippery%20Slime\"&gt;Slippery Slime&lt;/a&gt;s are rare spawns which sometimes appear here, moving in rapid laps around the area. If interacted with, the Slimes despawn and grant the 15-minute Slippery Slime buff, which persists through death. Every so often, the buff activates the Slippery Slime effect, increasing the player's movement speed by 150% (to 250%). The speed increase works while mounted or unmounted, and lasts for a few seconds, meaning the buff is often active a fairly large portion of the time.\nWhile the Slimes spawn fairly infrequently, the buff can be extremely useful for a variety of purposes. It can help players to traverse the map far more quickly than usually possible; to chase down fleeing opponents; to reach allies or join the fray more quickly; and to escape attackers. The buff is perhaps most remarkable in this last capacity, especially when seeking to evade world PvP encounters. The combination of the buff with regular evasive class abilities can allow the player to outrun even the most skilled and persistent hunter or warrior.\nFlytraps.\n&lt;a href=\"Flytrap%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;Flytraps&lt;/a&gt; are special static mobs which generate a Flytrap Toxins aura in the immediate vicinity, increasing damage dealt and taken by players by 50%.\nMarsh Creature buff.\nThe corpses of the &lt;a href=\"Marsh%20Creature\"&gt;Marsh Creature&lt;/a&gt;s here generate a special aura, increasing the &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; of nearby players by 50%.\nTrivia.\nAn of Ashran shows this area marked \"Forge\". During &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor%20beta%20timeline\"&gt;the expansion's beta&lt;/a&gt;, it was known as \"The Stadium\"."}

The opposite of &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt;, it increased the healing a target group member takes from each healing spell, but also increased the amount of damage the target takes from each enemy spell.\nDamage taken and healing taken was the same effect as the &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; stat found on some gear. For example, a healer casting a heal on a target buffed with Amplify Magic rank 6 would have the same effect as if they had 240 more +healing on their gear.\nTalent improvements.\n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Attunement\"&gt;Magic Attunement&lt;/a&gt; increased the damage taken and healing taken of Amplify Magic by 50% at max rank.\nTips and tactics.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt;, this spell had benefits and drawbacks and it was important to choose the correct spell. This spell could be very dangerous if used incorrectly, magnifying an enemy spell caster's power. Amplify Magic was useful in group situations where players would take mostly &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; damage. In these situations, it could save your healer some mana, and increase their healing per second. Against casters, this spell could hurt much more then it helps, since damaging spells would be cast more often than heals.\nWhen deciding whether or not to use this buff, consider the number of damaging spells likely to hit vs. the number of heals. In raid situations, when a tank had multiple healers on him at a time and would get many more heals per second than damaging spells per second, the net healing increase would be greater than the net damage increase. \"Even\" when fighting most magic-damage bosses, Amplify Magic was still often more beneficial on the tank than no buff or &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt; would be.\nWhen to use Amplify Magic:\nWhen to use &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt;:\nWhen to use neither spell:"}

The furbolg is always the same each time, the actual creature having been entrapped within the amulet and forced to serve. When the command word is spoken, the furbolg appears and immediately attacks the wearer's nearest enemy. The wearer can also give the furbolg other instructions, which the creature will obey to the best of its ability. The furbolg returns to the amulet if it is slain or after 10 minutes have passed, whichever comes first. The next time the creature appears, it is healed and ready for battle. The owner can free the beast by destroying the amulet, in which case it immediately bounds off toward its former home, eager to be reunited with its fellows."}

After creating the world and the elements, the Earth Mother went into labor and brought forth the first light of day, a radiant son she named An'she, followed by a luminous daughter she named &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;. The elements called them \"Sun\" and \"Moon\". Over time, the twins grew close to the elements, with An'she wielding fire's light and warmth and becoming close friends with the mountains, while Mu'sha similarly bonded with the waters and winds. They steadily grew in power until they were able to influence the elements themselves and use their power to forge weapons so they might spar and play: dual blades for An'she and a bow and arrows for Mu'sha. The Earth Mother was overjoyed by this and gently guided her twins through the ages, but she remained ever vigilant against the Old Ones and their shadows.\nShe eventually grew tired and knew that she needed to rest. In order to keep her children close and safe while she slumbered, she pressed them into her eyes\u2014first An'she, causing a peaceful night to fall on the land and calm her spirit, and then Mu'sha. The Earth Mother rested first with one eye shut and then the other, since her children's light was now too powerful to fully contain. However, this restless watch denied the world An'she's warmth, causing ice and snow to creep across the land. Similarly, without Mu'sha's guidance, the winds whipped up in storms. When the Earth Mother awoke, she despaired at how the elements had changed in her children's absence, but as their light returned, the cold faded and everything back to how it had once been. The elements consoled the Earth Mother and showed her how her time of rest had allowed new life to thrive, and so she named the seasons in her time of work (summer) and her time of rest (winter). From her eyes, she then showed An'she and Mu'sha how to guide the elements through these new seasons and eventually how to bring about the accompanying changes to the land at will. She told the twins that they had proven their strength and that they should watch over the world that she had made for them, but that they still had to stay safe inside her eyes.\nSorrow of the Earth Mother and An'she's wounding.\nThe Earth Mother wished for her twins to share the love and happiness she felt at seeing their growth, and so created the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;shu'halo&lt;/a&gt; (tauren). On their mother's request, Sun and Moon taught the shu'halo everything they knew\u2014how to work with the elements, build homes, acquire food, sing, dance, ferry the rivers, and hunt wild beasts. However, while Sun and Moon were almost strong enough to defend themselves from the Old Ones and their &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadows&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren were young and vulnerable. The next time the Earth Mother slept, the Old Ones stretched their influence across the land and corrupted many of the tauren with their whispers, causing them to make war on each other and throw the elements into chaos. An'she and Mu'sha watched helplessly, as their mother had only ever spoken of shadows and not the suffering those shadows might cause. They cried out, waking their mother. Upon seeing what had happened, the Earth Mother wept a single tear. Realizing that she was also susceptible to the corruption and thus no longer a safe haven for her children, she wrenched An'she and Mu'sha free from her skull, her fingers digging so deeply that their light could never return to her again. Sun and Moon tried to console their mother, but she lay paralyzed by sorrow. An'she declared that they had to set off to stop the source of the corruption, and his sister agreed.\nWord of the Earth Mother's sorrow and the twins' journey to save her was carried on the winds. The siblings soon encountered a party of uncorrupted shu'halo, who presented a radiant blue infant they'd found on the plains. When the child began to wail, the twins recognized them as having been born from the Earth Mother's lone tear. Mu'sha took the babe in her arms and An'she asked what they should call them. Mu'sha replied that their mother would know, but before the twins could return to their mother, the shadows attacked them. With the aid of the elements, the twins managed to hold back the darkness: An'she stood strong as the mountain and fought with fire's ferocity, and the light of his blades caused the shadows to retreat, while Mu'sha did the same with her arrows, wind, and water. As they began to beat back the darkness, however, one of the shadows lashed out for An'she's heart. Mu'sha destroyed it with one of her arrows, but not before it inflicted a great wound on An'she. Mu'sha tried to bind her brother's wound with water and wind, but it continued to bleed no matter what she did. Mu'sha sent a plea on the wind and the Earth Mother sought out her children. She told Mu'sha that her presence was keeping the bleeding An'she alive, but Mu'sha knew that her brother would surely die if her healing light strayed too far from him.\nKnowing that the shadows would return to take the rest of the tauren, the Earth Mother decided to sacrifice herself to contain the darkness. The twins protested, but she quieted them and told them to take permanently to the skies, from where their light would be able to chase away any shadows she could not hold. She told them to always stay in each other's sight so Mu'sha could tend An'she's wounds. She then gave the blue child\u2014whom she'd named &lt;a href=\"Lo%27sho\"&gt;Lo'sho&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to Mu'sha and told the twins to teach the infant everything they knew. Although heartbroken, the twins obeyed their mother's words and took their eternal post in the skies with Lo'sho. The Earth Mother proceeded to embrace the land a final time and give all of herself in order to keep the shadows at bay. Seeing their mother's sacrifice, Mu'sha guided the water and winds so the tauren would always be able to hear and follow their mother's voice while An'she shone his fierce light across the land so the way would be clear. All the while, Lo'sho listened to their lessons, hearing in them the wisdom of their mother. The tauren believe that An'she still bleeds every morning, sacrificing part of his light to let the tauren know that dawn is coming. But he doesn't do this alone; the \"yeena'e\" (\"those who herald the dawn\" in &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;) help him. The yeena'e are the spirits of the deceased &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; - those who died saving lives, or making new ones. An'she is honored alongside the Earth Mother, and sometimes, the tauren build pyres to honor their fallen loved ones at dawn, as &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; did with &lt;a href=\"Cloudhoof\"&gt;Cloudhoof&lt;/a&gt;, so that An'she could watch their passing.\nPowers and worship.\nTauren &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s known as &lt;a href=\"Seers\"&gt;Seers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s known as &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; aim to revere the light of An'she. &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; implies that such a focus on An'she, as opposed to the power of Mu'sha used by druids and night elves, could achieve the balance of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;, granting the tauren another blessing from her. An'she was apparently responsible for sending the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; visions of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. In their faith, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is associated to An'she, which gives them their powers. Tauren seem to use the terms \"Sun\", \"Light\" or both as synonyms for An'she, and when they refer to the Light, they use the terms \"An'she's light\", \"the light of the Sun\", and \"Sun's light\". In order to use their holy powers, they may pray to An'she silently or verbally.\nThe power of An'she can appear either as red flames emerging from a white-hot source or as golden magic similar to other &lt;a href=\"divine%20magic\"&gt;divine magic&lt;/a&gt;. As young sunwalkers continue their training, they will learn how to lead rituals to honor An'she and the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and will grow closer to the Light. Sunwalker Dezco has specifically used An'she to weave protective shields of light around others, channel holy energies through his mace to crumble enemies such as the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; to dust, and heal others' wounds with \"bright yellow light\". As they become more skilled, the Seers' skills will expand, and they gain access to many new powers. Through the powers of An'she, &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; is notably able to speak with the spirits of long departed, and can compel them to tell the truth.\nHowever, the sun god's powers have limits, as An'she could not save his son &lt;a href=\"Redhorn\"&gt;Redhorn&lt;/a&gt; from nearly dying. Dezco also mentioned that the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;'s presence and influence in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; was weakening his Sunwalker powers, and was unable to use An'she's power to save his wife &lt;a href=\"Leza%20Farwalker\"&gt;Leza Farwalker&lt;/a&gt; from dying when she was giving birth to his two sons.\n&lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; considers An'she to be another expression of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s had been empowered by the titans, but Azeroth itself gave rise to the spirits and demigods, creatures eternal in nature yet capable of ultimate sacrifice.\n&lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; is the word that &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s use to refer to powerful spirits they revere, this includes the Wild Gods.

This resulted in the seclusion of the Wild Gods. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sent his druids to rally them and bring them into the field. The death of Cenarius, however, made them almost impossible to find. Ultimately, the druids were unsuccessful.\nDark Ancients.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; feared that the Ancient Guardians may someday rise up to oppose them. They created twisted versions of the Ancients, summoned to replace them. They were a primal force of nature, but their origins were from a darker place. Those who birthed these beasts reached deep into the blackness, channeling powers never intended for this world. The Twilight's Hammer dreamed of creating their own pantheon of twisted ancients to rule over the land, sea, and air, though only two were summoned before the Twilight's Hammer was stopped.\nRacial ancestry.\nBrann also &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;speculated&lt;/a&gt; on the existence of a few Ancients and their creation of descendant races:\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that several races originate from the ancients.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt; culture speaks of both &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s and Ancients (note the capital A). Ancients (lower-case) are treelike sages and protectors. Ancients (upper-case) are old demigods, like &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, who assisted the night elves at various points throughout their history.\nPerhaps more so than other &lt;a href=\"Eternals\"&gt;Eternals&lt;/a&gt;, the Ancients of the night elves are treated like deities. Primal spirits of the natural world when it was young, they personify its most distinct and most powerful qualities. Although several of them were effectively destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and in later conflicts, they are honored still by races such as &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, night elves and &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; the Moon Goddess, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s one true deity, remains a focus of worship for the night elves and other races, while the world grows warier of what the changed Queen Azshara may attempt in the coming future.\nMost of the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 namely the night elves, but also the furbolgs and the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 worship or revere the Ancients. The night elves worship Azeroth's only deity, the eternal moon goddess Elune. They revere most of the other Ancients, especially Cenarius, the only Ancient to spend considerable time on the physical plane. They also honor the moon goddess's companions, including &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. The furbolgs venerate the bear twins, &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;; and the evil satyrs revere Lord Xavius. The Ancients rarely interfere with life on Azeroth, but these races hold fast in their fervent beliefs that the Ancients exist and are watching events unfold. The following are characters stated to be Ancients only in the RPG:"}

Having licensed his own line of fishing equipment, Nat can be found in several locations around the world, offering training to aspiring fishermen who seek him out.\nHe states he has no particular interest in fishing, but has been fishing for 20\u201330 years. He also says that fishing is \"a great excuse to drink ... heavily\", and therefore he enjoys the occasional drink now and then.\nBiography.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nNat Pagle gives the quest &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle%2C%20Angler%20Extreme\"&gt;Nat Pagle, Angler Extreme&lt;/a&gt;. A fishing skill of 225 and a minimum level of 35 are required to start the quest. After &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1\"&gt;patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt;, this quest is no longer required to attain the &lt;a href=\"Artisan\"&gt;Artisan&lt;/a&gt; fishing level. The quest now offers a special superior-quality fishing pole instead. If you already completed the quest, you can visit Nat Pagle to receive this fishing pole.\nPrior to the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, players could obtain the quest &lt;a href=\"Nat%27s%20Measuring%20Tape%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Nat's Measuring Tape (quest)&lt;/a&gt; when opening a &lt;a href=\"Battered%20Tackle%20Box\"&gt;Battered Tackle Box&lt;/a&gt; containing the tape, found at Pagle's Pointe in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. This quest involved returning the tape to Nat. When completing this quest, he said it is his favorite measuring tape and shares information about the hydra .\nAlso prior to \"Cataclysm\": In another repeatable quest given by Nat, after completing \"Nat's Measuring Tape\" and having a fishing skill of 300 or higher, he gave instructions for summoning Gahz'ranka at &lt;a href=\"Pagle%27s%20Pointe\"&gt;Pagle's Pointe&lt;/a&gt;. He also sold the lures needed for summoning Gahz'ranka. These s had to each be filled with 5 &lt;a href=\"Zulian%20Mudskunk\"&gt;Zulian Mudskunk&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used. Zulian Mudskunk were caught in Zul'Gurub itself by fishermen with 300 skill or more. This &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; boss encounter was optional and could be done only once after every reset of the instance. Note: As of &lt;a href=\"patch%205.4.1\"&gt;patch 5.4.1&lt;/a&gt;, Pagle continues to offer to tell the player how to fish up Gahz'ranka and still sells the lure, even though Gahz'ranka was not part of the new &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub instance&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3\"&gt;patch 4.0.3&lt;/a&gt; and thus can no longer be caught.\nIn-game, various items besides the ones in Nat Pagle's line of fishing equipment (below) can be found.

While at first this was done in order to provide &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with the knowledge it needed to fight against such dark magic, her studies over the years became increasingly obsessed with finding out why such &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;dark energies&lt;/a&gt; existed at all, and why she began to see the ebb and flow of such energies in the world around her. She began preaching about the necessity of balance between dark and &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, but after her death, her books were locked away in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s vaults in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe was once the owner of &lt;a href=\"%3AXal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;:Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which was one of the sources that gave her the dark secrets she used in writing &lt;a href=\"%3ASecrets%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;:Secrets of the Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLife.\nNatalie was once a bishop from Lordaeron. She lived through the First War, when the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded Azeroth and conquered &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, Seline realized that to defeat the green-skinned orcs, humanity would need to study the strange powers they wielded. She closely examined their magics, and she visited battle sites where their dark arts had befouled the land. From her investigations, she learned of &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;an otherworldly blade&lt;/a&gt; that the orcs had once used in their bloody rituals- a blade that held sway over the shadows themselves. Troubled that such a profane weapon could exist, Seline swore to hunt it down and destroy it in the name of the Light.\nThe moment she touched the blade, a name was spoken in her mind: Xal'atath. She knew then that she could not destroy the dagger. Not yet. How can one defeat a power she does not understand? Xal'atath whispered to her in waking and in dreaming. It taught her that there was more to this world than Light, there was also &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. In the ebb and flow between these two forces, one can find power and knowledge beyond anything the Church of the Holy Light has ever revealed to its followers. One can cross the divide between Light and Void. One can pull strands from each side and weave a tapestry of day and night.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Natalie Seline had learned how to wield shadow magic from Xal'atath. She had taught her dangerous arts to other worshipers of the Light and rallied them against the Horde. Seline and her followers waged their war in secret, hunting down orcs across the human kingdoms. Xal'atath continued whispering in Seline's mind, slowly unraveling her sanity. Despite her noble intentions, she became more and more obsessed with the blade and the mysteries of the Void.\nAnd so did Seline's companions. They were overzealous in their campaign against the orcs, putting innocent lives at risk. Some strayed too far into shadow, forsaking the Light completely. Though Seline urged her followers to use caution, her calls were ignored and even treated with suspicion.\nIt is unclear exactly what happened to the former bishop, but some sources state that Xal'atath incited rebellion among her allies. It convinced them that Seline was holding them back from their true potential--holding back knowledge and power that they could have if they killed her. In the dead of night, the conspirators murdered Seline and then took Xal'atath for themselves.\nLegacy.\nFor years, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; magi in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; had watched Natalie Seline, greatly troubled by her dark teachings. After her death, they set out to scour her writings from history. Magi picked through the villages and cities Seline had traveled, gathering up every scroll and tome that she had penned. The Kirin Tor hid these writings in Dalaran, hoping that would be the end of Seline's dangerous brand of magic. Yet despite their efforts, they could not bury the doctrine of balance she had preached. In the years to come, others would take up her teachings and devote themselves to the Light and the Void. The magi also knew of Xal'atath, but they never found it. Like Seline's teachings, the blade would not simply fade away.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Cult of the Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; was created through the rediscovery of her teachings by &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; priests in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; after the capture and refurbishing of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nMost believe Natalie was murdered for her beliefs, but the truth was she knew her fate and took steps to protect herself from an inevitable death. The night her attackers came Natalie sent her spirit into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, its location known only to her. She penned a spell to retrieve it in one of her many journals. Unfortunately, the tome eventually fell into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;those who wanted her dead&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. Her body was buried at &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, where members of the Cult of Forgotten Shadows stayed, forever hopeful her spirit would return.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; wanted to restore the Cult of Forgotten Shadows so it would join them at &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Urgrok\"&gt;Twilight Lord Urgrok&lt;/a&gt; was killed and the journal taken from him. After performing the ritual in &lt;a href=\"Dawning%20Wood%20Catacombs\"&gt;Dawning Wood Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; and delving into the Void themselves, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; of the Conclave retrieved Natalie's spirit and freed it from the weight of the darkness. While Natalie could not deny part of her wished to stay embraced by the shadows, she acknowledged that the Void held &lt;a href=\"Void%20lord\"&gt;many whispers&lt;/a&gt; that should have everyone worried. Agreeing to unite as priests of both &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and Shadow to face the Burning Legion together, Natalie and the cultists traveled to &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;. News of Natalie's return would quickly spread fast among those who shared her beliefs, and soon Azeroth would see the rise of the Cult of Forgotten Shadows."}

As Nathanos Blightcaller, he would stand in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, battling the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes &lt;a href=\"Order%20Must%20Be%20Restored\"&gt;sent to kill him&lt;/a&gt; and faking his death. During the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, his body was restored with the help of Sylvanas's &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to serve his liege with renewed strength. As the Dark Lady's champion, Nathanos played a major role in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s war effort throughout the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;remained loyal&lt;/a&gt; to Sylvanas after her &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;abandonment&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde.\nAfter a &lt;a href=\"Shadows%20Rising\"&gt;failed gambit&lt;/a&gt; to kill &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of death, he retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt;. In time, he was discovered by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, who informed the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing battle against their &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos was confronted and killed by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Ranger Lord.\nIn life, Nathanos Marris was a ranger in the service of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, eventually working his way up to the rank of Ranger Captain. Nathanos's accomplishments were unprecedented. He was considered a master strategist and a tactical genius, responsible for &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; victories spanning a decade of conflict. When Lordaeron suspected the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; of forming an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos was sent to confirm the trolls' allegiance to the Horde and deliver the news to King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. While spying on a group of trolls, he saved the lives of two &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, from an Amani ambush. After taking Nathanos to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; to deliver his information to the Council, Sylvanas got to know him as she escorted him throughout the city. Nathanos and Sylvanas grew closer during his extended stay in Silvermoon. When her parents were killed in an apparent Amani ambush in &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;, he went with her and the Farstriders to examine the bodies and joined them in their conclusion that the Horde was responsible. Sylvanas visited Nathanos at the Marris Stead shortly before the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. She spoke to him of a potential invasion of Quel'Thalas from the Horde and met Nathanos's young cousin, &lt;a href=\"Stephon%20Marris\"&gt;Stephon Marris&lt;/a&gt;. Before leaving, Sylvanas spent the night at the stead.\nFollowing Sylvanas's ascension to ranger-general of the Farstriders, she commanded that Nathanos be inducted into their order. Nathanos Marris was the first and only human ranger as well as the only human ranger lord, the highest rank in the Farstriders' hierarchy below the ranger-general. His inclusion in their ranks was not without its conflicts. Nathanos was on the receiving end of prejudice from his elven comrades, many of whom objected to the presence of a human in their ranks. &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renthar%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Renthar Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt; both argued against his inclusion in their ranks, and Nathanos had a particular animosity with Lor'themar Theron, now Sylvanas's second-in-command, who claimed Nathanos felt intimidated by the elven rangers; Nathanos believed he could match Theron shot-for-shot. &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the crown prince of Quel'Thalas, also opposed the appointment, but Sylvanas insisted on it anyway, impressed with Nathanos's ability and believing that the high elves must practice tolerance with the outside world. Still, Nathanos felt unwelcome in the ancient city of the elves and tired of their politics, instead choosing to reside in his native &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, at his &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;childhood home&lt;/a&gt;. As a Ranger Lord, Nathanos owed allegiance to Silvermoon, and was obligated to fight in its defense should the elves demand it. Sylvanas frequently visited him at the stead, officially to hear his reports, but rumor spread throughout the Farstriders - and the elven kingdom at large - that Sylvanas had been continuing a romantic relationship with her human pupil. Nathanos worried that these rumors would negatively impact Sylvanas, who required the goodwill of her compatriots as ranger-general.\nDeath and freedom.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; swept over the once-great nation of Lordaeron, killing all in its path and raising the fallen as cadaverous undead. Despite his great skill, Nathanos Marris fell as well at his house, murdered by the abomination &lt;a href=\"Ramstein%20the%20Gorger\"&gt;Ramstein the Gorger&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos rose as a mindless thrall of the Scourge, bound to the will of the Lich King, spreading the plague of undeath through the kingdom of his birth. Somehow though, deep in his soul, he knew that Sylvanas would come for him, and she did.\nSylvanas, who had been killed and raised as a banshee by Arthas during the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas, had later been freed from Ner'zhul's control during the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;Plaguelands civil war&lt;/a&gt;, and after establishing the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; scoured Lordaeron for signs of Nathanos, with her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s informing her of his sightings. When she found her old disciple, he had been reduced to a pitiful sight, a decaying slave feasting on corpses of his own making. Nathanos did not immediately recognize her, and attempted to attack her with the unending rage filling the void in his soul, but was fettered by dark ranger arrows while Sylvanas called him to his senses. Sylvanas tore Nathanos free from the Lich King's will and told her disheveled former pupil of the plight of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. She named Nathanos her champion, in their quest to avenge themselves upon Arthas. After he was freed by Sylvanas, Nathanos hunted Ramstein the Gorger across the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; for months until the abomination fled to the safety of Stratholme.\nIn death, Nathanos retained the deep loyalty he had felt towards Sylvanas in life. Were she to perish at the end of their quest, he knew he would happily follow her. According to Lor'themar, he was already a bully and a braggart in life and undeath magnified his worst traits.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nNathanos returned to his old home, the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, with his pet &lt;a href=\"blighthound\"&gt;blighthound&lt;/a&gt;s on the banshee queen's orders. There he recruited &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; soldiers to fight against corrupted animals (such as &lt;a href=\"plaguebat\"&gt;plaguebat&lt;/a&gt;s), the Scourge, and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;rs of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nNathanos collected relics from the battle of &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, for unknown reasons. He kept them in his home. Nathanos appeared to be secretive regarding personal details of his former life, even sending Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"%3AQuel%27Thalas%20Registry\"&gt;:Quel'Thalas Registry&lt;/a&gt; that contained his file. He made sure to inform adventurers that the registry was not to be read. Nathanos took a special pleasure in tormenting the lodge's elven residents, his former comrades, who had scorned him even while alive.\nNathanos's death did not go unnoticed, nor did the fact that a body had never been found. Master &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, head of - the Stormwind intelligence agency - received some disturbing reports of unusual Forsaken activity in the Eastern Plaguelands, and sent five agents to investigate. Only one of those agents returned, babbling incoherently about \"Nathanos\" and the word \"Blightcaller.\" He died in his sleep just days after his return, and Alliance adventurers were asked to go investigate their disappearance. The only thing SI:7 had to go on was that Nathanos Marris may have been slain by this \"Blightcaller,\" but the truth was far less pleasant. After investigating the grounds around the Marris Stead, adventurers uncovered the ugly reality - Nathanos was the Blightcaller, now a champion of the Banshee Queen.\nOnce it was determined that Nathanos was the Blightcaller, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; enlisted Alliance adventurers to gather an army and destroy him. Nathanos, however, managed to survive this through faking death.\nCataclysm.\nAfter surviving the Alliance assassination attempt on his life, Nathanos decided to reside in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Quarter\"&gt;War Quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, where he trained Forsaken &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s. There he began training a new generation of Forsaken rangers, representing both their past and their future. He would also stand with Sylvanas as her right hand in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the disastrous conclusion to the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas confided in Nathanos about her experience atop &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; following the Lich King's defeat, including the pact she had made with &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos knew that should Sylvanas ever find herself facing that damnation again, he would gladly end his own undeath to face it at her side. Part of him hoped for it.\nDark Mirror.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion began invading Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas called Nathanos to partake in a ritual meant to make him stronger. He agreed to take part, though not before attempting to provoke her. When he discovered that the ritual would involve the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; sacrificing his cousin &lt;a href=\"Stephon%20Marris\"&gt;Stephon Marris&lt;/a&gt;, he felt no regret, only the duty-bound oath he had made towards Sylvanas. The Val'kyr proceeded to place herself between the human and the undead and began chanting guttural words in an ancient tongue, flashes of blue and gold pulsing from her hands. Nathanos lost his senses for a time, his world exploding in fire and pain. When the Blightcaller's wits returned, he found that he had been transformed to become stronger than before and not be as decayed and withered as he had been. However, upon looking into a mirror, he noticed that his new face was not entirely his own. He then noticed that the second ritual table was empty save for a bit of ash and oily residue stains. Sylvanas directed &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Anya\"&gt;Dark Ranger Anya&lt;/a&gt; to escort her champion to the armory to see him outfitted in a manner befitting his station. Along the way, Anya implied to Nathanos that Sylvanas had feelings for her champion, a notion that the Blightcaller disagreed with, as he personally felt that whatever emotion his mortal heart might have held, now it had room only for rage and contempt. After picking out a green and gray mix of mail and leather, a clean and well-maintained breastplate caught his eye and caused him to reflect back to the ritual and to the empty altar next to his. For the briefest of moments, Nathanos felt regret.\nLegion.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos and the other dark rangers are seen protecting Sylvanas, the new &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde. He fought against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s when they were revealed by the newly-accepted &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\nNathanos issued summons to the Horde champion on behalf of Sylvanas and led them to the Forsaken fleet approaching &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. Predictably, Nathanos retained his dry humor and low regard for most of the figures he crosses paths with (particularly the worgen, whom he writes off as \"beasts\"), save of course for Sylvanas. He is accompanied by his pet bat, &lt;a href=\"Bloodwing\"&gt;Bloodwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Alliance led by &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt; took the chance to bombard the Forsaken fleet, Nathanos made his queen's safety his first priority, but was ordered to take the fleet on the offensive. He led the Forsaken forces in a counterattack against the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; and worgen troops. The Blightcaller and his men boarded the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; and caused havoc in the hull, planting vials of &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; to take it apart from within. Nathanos battled Greymane on the ship's deck, and was unimpressed with his opponent until he goaded Genn into assuming his worgen form. Nathanos gained the upper hand and managed to wound Greymane (Horde version), but the battle abruptly ended with the destruction of the Skyfire, which plummeted down into Stormheim. Nathanos and Greymane survived, although Nathanos's face became \"even uglier\" than it was before.\nNathanos took command of the Forsaken stragglers, and led his rangers in a ruthless hunt across the region to locate Sylvanas. He was certain the queen survived, and sought bloody revenge on the Alliance forces remaining in the area. With the help of the champion, Nathanos was able to discover that Sylvanas safely escaped, but did not wish to be pursued. Respecting the Dark Lady's wishes, Nathanos turned his attention to claiming the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, though he ultimately left the quest to Horde adventurers after reuniting with his master in &lt;a href=\"Dreadwake%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Dreadwake's Landing&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Nathanos can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, lord of the Burning Legion, was defeated, he stabbed Azeroth in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; discovered a new material at the wound called &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos sent Horde adventurers to meet with the goblins in Silithus and oversaw the fighting at the &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Shore\"&gt;Seething Shore&lt;/a&gt; from an &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Shore%20Horde%20gunship\"&gt;unnamed gunship&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon later, he arrived to the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; with the other leaders. \nBefore the Storm.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s stalwart champion and bodyguard, Nathanos relayed to Sylvanas the ongoings of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos reported that while many were proud that a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; has been crowned warchief, others resented that she had forgotten those who were loyal to her in order to attend to the needs of other Horde races. As Sylvanas paraded with a diverse contingent of Horde races on their way to the celebration feast, Nathanos elaborated that she left a power vacuum behind in the undeads' capital, and the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; was created as an interim government to attend to the Undercity's needs. Word has also reached the Undercity of Sylvanas' efforts to create more &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; and how her plans were foiled by &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. The Desolate Council has reservations about her actions and has requested an audience with her to speak of disagreements about their future. Sylvanas confided to Nathanos her plans to bolster the ranks of the Forsaken by directing the Horde's bloodlust against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on, Nathanos relayed an invitation to Sylvanas to attend the Desolate Council's ceremony which honored the Forsaken who fell in the war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. On Nathanos' return to the Undercity however, he reported that Sylvanas was not able to attend with her duties preoccupying her and has sent Nathanos as an emissary in her stead. While &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Vellcinda Benton&lt;/a&gt; and Nathanos discussed plans for the Forsaken, they were interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; who gave them each messages from King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;; one of which was addressed to Sylvanas and concerned the proposal of the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos was furious Alonsus was a Forsaken and fraternizing with the Alliance High King, but Faol claimed he was politically neutral as he was not a member of the Horde, but a simple priest of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;Gallywix Pleasure Palace&lt;/a&gt; to relay King Anduin's missive to Sylvanas. Nathanos advised Sylvanas to use the Gathering to her advantage by publicly supporting it and either using the reconnection with their loved ones to motivate the Forsaken to continue existing as undead and prolong their will to propagate or use the hurt feelings from the reunion's failure to sway the Forsaken masses to be amenable to bloodlust and vengeance on the living. After hearing Nathanos' opinion of the Desolate Council not being a threat and considering the benefits, Sylvanas consented to the Gathering, but only with the Desolate Council members' sole participation and a small group of humans. Sylvanas and Nathanos returned to the Undercity, where she clarified her concerns and stipulated the conditions for the Gathering.\nNathanos attended the Gathering with Sylvanas and observed the event from &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. He continued to advise Sylvanas on how she could use the Gathering to politically benefit her. However, when she ordered all the Forsaken participants to be executed despite some of them not defecting, even he was shocked by her ruthlessness.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nNathanos Blightcaller helped hunt down &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and was ensuring that the meetings of his warchief remained private. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; let Nathanos in on his and Sylvanas' secret plan and recruited Nathanos to act out an adversarial relationship with him in order to trick the Alliance into thinking Saurfang was chafing against &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;'s rule and was bullying her into endorsing a major &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; campaign in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance took the bait; fearing the Horde was proliferating &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons, they sent a sizable night elf fleet to Silithus as deterrence. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to help the Alliance leadership plan the war, leaving only &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his skeleton crew of night elf defenders for the Horde to contend with. This primed the Horde's campaign for their true objective: the conquering of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Horde army marched to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos rode with Saurfang. Nathanos contemplated how Saurfang was trusted by the Horde due to his history of warfare and sacrifices but was resentful that the Horde hadn't given Sylvanas the same trust even though she had accomplished just as much if not more than Saurfang. Nathanos viewed the Horde as weak-willed and short-sighted, and only Sylvanas knew what laid beyond life and had the will to act. Although some may consider her actions cruel, Nathanos supported her regardless because life was cruel and fleeting and it delighted him that her plans soared over the horizon of mortality and frightened many. Nathanos was also elated to carry out Sylvanas' will \u2014 to kill kaldorei on their own soil and take their home for her.\nDespite fierce resistance from the night elves, the Horde had managed to secure &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Nathanos complained how steadfast the night elves were to resisting him, even to the bitter end. After rescuing Saurfang from an ambush in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos accompanied the Horde army into &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning about the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt; wall on the border of Ashenvale and &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, he was confident his dark rangers and demolishers could take it out, though &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; warned him not to underestimate it. When Sylvanas ordered Varok Saurfang to find a way to Darkshore through &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;'s mountains, Varok asked Nathanos if he knew any smugglers there. He responded that they could find one and persuade him to help the Horde. Nathanos introduced a &lt;a href=\"darkspear%20troll\"&gt;darkspear troll&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Rejiji\"&gt;Rejiji&lt;/a&gt; to Saurfang, and Reijiji led Saurfang to a smuggler's pass they could use to scale the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. Together, Rejiji, Varok, Nathanos and a part of the Horde army went into Felwood, and eventually reached Darkshore from the north. Once there, they desecrated the forests, luring the wisps to them and dispersing Malfurion's wisp wall.\nOnce the Horde breached Darkshore, the night elves were defeated. However, Nathanos along with Sylvanas were enraged to learn that Saurfang had let Malfurion escape alive. Nathanos yelled that Malfurion will return to take many Horde lives in vengeance, but Saurfang was content with his decision and would face the night elf when that day came. When Nathanos threatened Saurfang with violence, Sylvanas broke up their bickering and told them to focus on finishing the battle. Saurfang set out to make arrangements for the boarding of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and Nathanos contemptuously answered his questions about the logistics of the next step.\nAfter securing Darkshore, Sylvanas gave Nathanos and Varok orders to secure the beach and prepare to invade &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. As Sylvanas went off to speak to a gravely injured &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos inspected the carnage of the battle. His examination was interrupted by Sylvanas who suddenly ordered him to burn down Teldrassil. Nathanos hesitated for a moment only for Sylvanas to repeat her order more sharply, causing Nathanos to set off on executing her command. Wide-eyed, Nathanos watched &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; burn.\nBattle for Lordareon.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos led an assault against the Alliance alongside &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; in the back side of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to stop them, but was defeated when void elven reinforcements led by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; came to aid King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and his force. Alliance forces win the battle and the Horde is forced to retreat into the throne room, where he received orders from &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; to saturate the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, he and the other Horde leaders were seen on a zeppelin flying away from the plagued Lordaeron.\nStormwind prison.\nLater, Nathanos then gathered Thalyssra, Rokhan, and the Horde champions on Sylvanas' orders for a mission in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. While en-route to Stormwind Harbor, Nathanos instructed the Horde members about mission and later helped them escape from the city.\nUpon reaching &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji's&lt;/a&gt; ship, Nathanos tried to make Talanji sail them to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; under Sylvanas' orders, but Talanji refused, sailing them instead to &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde War Campaign.\nNathanos can be found aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;The Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt;\" docked at &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, where on orders from Sylvanas he directs the &lt;a href=\"Honorbound\"&gt;Honorbound&lt;/a&gt;'s operations to secure their position on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. He questioned &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; about her loyalty to the Horde and revealed that he knew that her killing of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; wasn't her choice. In turn she pointed out that the zeal at which he struck out against the Alliance seemed to be motivated beyond his loyalty to Sylvanas, causing Nathanos to admit that after the Alliance rejected the fallen of Lordaeron and started hunting them, he vowed to hunt the Alliance in turn.\n&lt;a href=\"Krazzlefrazz%20Outpost\"&gt;With&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;outposts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Harbor\"&gt;established&lt;/a&gt; on Kul Tiras and convinced that the Horde partnership with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; would be secured, Nathanos directed Horde the into establishing a more a suitable base for operations against the Alliance. To this end, he directed them to conquer &lt;a href=\"Timberfell%20Outpost\"&gt;Timberfell Outpost&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; and then reinforce the newly controlled outpost. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Amalia%20Stone\"&gt;Captain Amalia Stone&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos ordered for her body to be placed within a wagon.\nSeeking to learn about the Kul Tiran fleet, Nathanos sought the body of a Kul Tiran war hero and directed the Horde to the &lt;a href=\"Barrowknoll%20Cemetery\"&gt;Barrowknoll Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;. After the Horde examined the graveyard of its inhabitants, Blightcaller decided to focus their attention on &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20M.%20Valentine\"&gt;Marshal M. Valentine&lt;/a&gt;. After breaking into Valentine's crypt, Nathanos discovered that the crypt didn't actually contain the corpse of Valentine. He was then subsequently informed by the resurrected Captain Stone that the Marshal's body was lost at sea. He later sent the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to aid &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; in discovering the location of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; capable of discovering Valentine's body. When the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kyra\"&gt;Kyra&lt;/a&gt; left the \"Banshee's Wail\", Nathanos was surprised but approved of the choice to resurrect Thomas Zelling as a Forsaken.\nWhile the Speaker searched for Valentine's body, Nathanos and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Honorbound\"&gt;Honorbound&lt;/a&gt; abroad the \"Banshee's Wail\" came under attack by the Alliance. While looking for Valentine's corpse, the Speaker unexpectedly discovered the body &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore, Crown Prince of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. With the Alliance driven off the Speaker brought both corpses onto the \"Banshee's Wail\". Valentine was soon after resurrected as a Forsaken and sent to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; to inform &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde was in possession of her son's corpse, which was located at &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Harbor\"&gt;Plunder Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. While the Kul Tirans besieged the harbor, the defenses of Boralus were weakened, just as Nathanos planned. While the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Fogsail%20Freebooters\"&gt;Fogsail Freebooters&lt;/a&gt; fought to defend the harbor, Nathanos ordered the Speaker of the Horde and Zelling with breaching Boralus and acquiring the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;. After the Abyssal Scepter was acquired, the pair returned to inform Nathanos of the mission's success when they were interrupted by &lt;a href=\"General%20Cadarin\"&gt;General Cadarin&lt;/a&gt; who offered the life of Valentine in exchange for the body of Derek Proudmoore. Not to be deterred, Nathanos refused, an act which cost Valentine his life. Following the death of General Cadarin, Nathanos gave the order for the Abyssal Scepter to be used to destroy the Kul Tiran fleet and ordered for Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner to informed of the mission's success.\nTaking advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;Siege of Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos led a Horde strike team to claim &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; within the city. He also directed Horde agents with breaking into &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt; in order to reclaim a captured Horde asset.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAfter discovering a black moon now hangs over &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; Nathanos sent scouts in order to discover what caused the transformation. However, none of them returned and Nathanos became convinced that the night elves were up to something. In order to discover what the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Black%20Moon\"&gt;Army of the Black Moon&lt;/a&gt; was up to, Nathanos ordered for the lieutenants to be hunted down and interrogated. He also ordered for the slain night elves to be risen into their service, in order to replenish Horde forces in the area. After witnessing &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;'s transformation into the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Wisp\"&gt;Lost Wisp&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos revealed that he was unsettled and remarked that they needed to accelerate their plans. \nUnder orders from Sylvanas, Nathanos called for &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; to be raised into undeath. However, when Horde adventurers attempted to raise her, they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;. After Sira was defeated, Nathanos ordered for her death. Though adventurers can carry out this task out if they refuse Nathanos himself will deal the killing blow on the warden, dryly noting that he knew the adventurers \"didn't have it in them\" to kill her. At Nathanos's command the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brynja\"&gt;Brynja&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Signe\"&gt;Signe&lt;/a&gt; began raising Delaryn Summermoon and Sira Moonwarden, however during the ritual Nathanos was attacked by the Army of the Black Moon led by Tyrande Whisperwind. During the battle, Nathanos was empowered by the Val'kyr which allowed him to survive Tyrande's onslaught until Signe restrained her, though Tyrande broke the Val'kyr's bonds, and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; joined the fray. In response, Brynja personally entered the battle to aid Nathanos which gave Signe enough time to finish the ritual. Following their resurrections, Delaryn Summermoon and Sira Moonwarden declared for the Forsaken causing Tyrande to lash out and kill Brynja. The death of the Val'kyr caused Nathanos to order the Horde forces to retreat. After he declared that \"They will all pay\", Nathanos called for the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;prepare for battle&lt;/a&gt;. During the warfront battle itself, he coordinates the attacks against the kaldorei.\nAs part of the renewed war effort, Nathanos ordered the Speaker, Rexxar, and Zelling to launch an assault against the Azerite supply that was in the possession of Kul Tiras and the Alliance. With the Azerite now in Horde's hands Nathanos revealed that it was already being prepared for the Horde's next attack. After &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; engineered a plan with the claimed Azerite to deal with the Alliance, Nathanos sent the Speaker of the Horde to aid Gallywix, at the Trade Prince's own request. Blightcaller personally instructed them to ensure that he stays alive as the Alliance previously made an attempt on Gallywix's life. Under orders from Nathanos, Rexxar, &lt;a href=\"Valtrois\"&gt;Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, and the Speaker worked to break &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Lady Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; out of her prison and deliver her to Sylvanas.\nAfter receiving word that the Alliance had mounted an attack through &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; Nathanos sent the Speaker to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;Great Seal&lt;/a&gt; in order to confer with &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt;. He later participated in the battle against the Alliance within Nazmir itself. Following the death of the &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the Abyssal Scepter, Nathanos, along with his allies, discovered that Telaamon and his forces were a bait to lure them away from &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; in order to weaken the city's defenses. Realizing that the city was in danger, the combined Zandalari and Horde army rushed back to defend the city, with Nathanos among them. Amidst the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;fighting&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos heard Talanji's wail due to discovering her dying father, and the Blightcaller locked eyes with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. As Proudmoore departed, he gave the order to get to the king.\nNathanos attended the funeral of King Rastakhan, where he encouraged Talanji to let her grief be stated by vengeance against the Alliance. He was later present at Talanji's coronation.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in a secret task, Sylvanas's loyalist sought to bring it to Nathanos's attention. In response to Baine wishing to act in the shadow, Nathanos gave them his protection and ordered them to aid Baine in his task to discover what he was planning. Nathanos was later informed that Baine, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;, liberated &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and delivered him to Jaina Proudmoore. In preparation for the leaders of the Horde gathering at &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos sent Horde heroes to help secure the area. During the meeting of the Horde leaders, Nathanos held Zelling at bow point when Sylvanas revealed that she knew Zelling had aided in returning Derek to the Alliance. After Baine admitted his own role in the event, Nathanos killed Zelling which outraged Baine. Following Baine's arrest, the Dark Lady and her champion left the stronghold.\nRise of Azshara.\nUnder the orders of Sylvanas, Nathanos called for the Speaker of the Horde to join the Horde forces to embark upon the warships. Convinced that the key to victory over the Alliance was within the Horde's grasp, Nathanos declared that what they had to do next was done for the Horde. Revealing that he had been entrusted with a mission of the highest priority from Sylvanas, Nathanos directed the Speaker to speak with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rez%27okun\"&gt;Captain Rez'okun&lt;/a&gt; when they were ready to set sail. The undead would then use the &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;black blade&lt;/a&gt; to guide the Horde fleet and the pursuing Alliance fleet towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where both fleets would be attacked by the naga under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s command after the seas were opened.\nFollowing the naga attack, Nathanos expressed satisfaction when the Speaker got back on their feet and revealed that their survival was key to the Dark Lady's plan. Though the Horde fleet was destroyed, Nathanos was pleased to see the vaunted Alliance fleet in ruins. He then remarked that he had a mission to complete and then departed from the rest of the Horde forces. In his absence, the Horde rallied under &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and aligned with the former &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s of the naga, the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt;. When Lor'themar sent adventures to rescue &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; from execution at Sylvanas's command, loyalists were able to rendezvous with Nathanos and inform him of Lor'hemar's actions. In response, Nathanos remarked that Lor'themar showed his true colors at last and regarded him siding with Baine as a pity. He then ordered them to play along and remarked that the traitors were in for a surprise once they reached Bloodhoof. After Nathanos was informed that Baine was saved from execution, Blightcaller mentioned that while it was vexing to allow their quarry to believe that they had escaped from them, they must trust in the Warchief's plan. He warned that their loyalty would soon face an even greater test. After revealing that he has been recalled to Orgrimmar, Nathanos instructed the loyalist to remain in Nazjatar and play along with the traitorous vipers until they are summoned.\nRevolution.\nNathanos called for &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Sylvanas Windrunner in Orgrimmar and expressed his belief that their forces shall exterminate Saurfang's revolutionaries. He then journeyed to Orgrimmar himself, where Sylvanas ordered for loyalists to deliver &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; to him. After Eitrigg was brought before him, Nathanos declared that the orc lacked the necessary resolve that the loyalists had. He ordered for loyalists to sabotage the enemies siege weapons, burn the propaganda that dissidents within the city have been spreading, and to rally the citizens of Orgrimmar to their army. With their house in order, Nathanos declared that it was time to deal with revolutionaries and Alliance outside the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Nathanos and Sylvanas stood atop the gates of Orgrimmar and watched the approach of Saurfang and his allies, he and Sylvanas discussed the next phase of their plan with the Jailer: that after dealing with the revolution, Sylvanas would depart for the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and leave Nathanos to tend to affairs on Azeroth. As Saurfang arrived, Nathanos suddenly suggested that they could simply leave; let the Alliance and Horde fight each other, fulfill the final task the Jailer had given Sylvanas, and find some place to just be together forever. Sylvanas was conflicted, not wanting to abandon the Jailer's plan after working towards it for so long, but she never got the chance to make the choice. Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde, Nathanos left Orgrimmar and the Horde to rendezvous with her at &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. The two conversed before wishing one another a safe journey as they departed, with him calling her \"my love\". Unbeknownst to Nathanos and Sylvanas, Lor'themar called for the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; to track them down while agents started scouring the Eastern Kingdoms for them.\nHeritage of Gilneas.\nAn Emerald Dream version of Nathanos appears in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City%20%28Emerald%20Dream%29\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Let%20Sleeping%20Wolves%20Lie\"&gt;A Gilnean's Dream&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Heritage of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. He is killed by &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Gilnean champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadows Rising.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos was tasked by Sylvanas with killing the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; himself, &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, they allied with the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; rebels led by a witch known as &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast with Sira's concerns, Nathanos was confident that while they focused on their mission Sylvanas would triumph over any &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; agents that came upon her. He also took delight in the rumors and propaganda that the Widow's Bite was spreading against Talanji as he wanted the young queen to regret ever turning her back against the Banshee Queen. After meeting Apari in Nazmir, he and his squad were found by a Zandalari patrol. Flying on pterrordax provided by Apari, they lured the patrol on a beach and had the \"Banshee's Wail\"'s dark rangers kill shoot the trolls.\nIn order to weaken the protections around Bwonsamdi's shrines, Nathanos was forced to hand over something precious and irreplaceable to the witch. Thus, after a moment, he handed his officer's badge given to him by Sylvanas when they were among the Farstriders many years ago and warned Apari that if she failed to destroy the loa's shrines as promised, then the consequences would be severe. After the witch departed to begin her work, Nathanos instructed Sira to remind him to drown her in the bogs of Nazmir after their mission was complete.\nAs the Widow's Bite and the Banshee loyalists fought side by side, they finally clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, where they were discovered attempting to sacrifice children in order to weaken one of Bwonsamdi's shrines. During this conflict, Nathanos commanded the combined armies and was noted by &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; to be smiling while firing arrows at his enemies. In the end, this skirmish ended with the children saved, and Nathanos commanded his forces falling back. In the aftermath, Nathanos asked Sira if the theatrics with the children sated her bloodlust, causing her to wonder if he had a weak stomach. Nathanos was unmoved and reminded Sira that if the Zandalari were galvanized enough, they could pose a threat to their plans, especially if they acquired a few orc battalions.\nAfter dealing with another holdout of Bwonsamdi's worshipers, Nathanos found himself faced with the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Stephon%20Marris\"&gt;Stephon Marris&lt;/a&gt;, which Nathanos saw as his one true regret. Despite declaring the ghost not real, when the spirit demanded to know how he could allow Sylvanas to sacrifice himself, Nathanos found himself justifying the action, showing that he believed the spirit to be his younger cousin. However, once Stephon declared his queen had made some nasty &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; on the other side and how the lords of death would never let her win, and as she is chained to undeath she will be chained to the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos quickly realized that he was actually speaking to Bwonsamdi, who had either sent a vision of or appeared as Stephon to mock him. In outrage, Nathanos declared that Bwonsamdi knew nothing of it, that he didn't know her as he did, and in response the loa simply jeered at him remarking that it was his game and they were playing it by his rules.\nAfter arriving at loa's &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos prepared traps, anticipating that Bwonsamdi could receive reinforcements. Unbeknownst to Nathanos, &lt;a href=\"Tayo\"&gt;Tayo&lt;/a&gt;, the lieutenant of the Widow's Bite, had grown increasingly disgusted with Apari's tactics, especially those against children. When Apari sought to harm another child in order to summon Bwonsamdi, Nathanos witnessed Tayo stopping Apari. After Tayo left, Apari let her go as she believed that Tayo would simply return. When &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;Visrynn&lt;/a&gt; went to follow her, Nathanos called her off and told the dark ranger that they no longer needed her. When Bwonsamdi appeared Nathanos gave the order to attack.\nUnknown to Nathanos, his decision to ignore Tayo would prove costly as she defected to the Horde, with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; later noting that her aid proved instrumental in saving them from Blightcaller's traps. Though caught off guard by the Horde and Zandalari reinforcements, Nathanos remained focused on the mission to the point of ignoring Apari's death, the resulting collapse of the Widow's Bite, and even Sira's calls for aid. Ultimately in the face of his numerous enemies, Nathanos was forced to flee the battlefield, using the same magic that Sylvanas used to kill &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe reported directly to Sylvanas, who had just defeated the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and shattered the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, how Bwonsamdi still lived, Sira Moonwarden had been captured, how the Horde came in full force, and her champion believed that Bwonsamdi will now only grow more defiant. Though acknowledging that it was a blow to her plans, Sylvanas was confident that it was a blow that they could overcome. In response, Nathanos decided to return to the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt; to await further orders. Sylvanas ordered him to not remain idle, expecting him to return to her with a means to prevent Bwonsamdi's meddling.\nShadowlands.\nNathanos &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt;. On one of their patrols, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; saw Nathanos sitting on his front porch, not even trying to hide, and they alerted the Alliance and Horde. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; sent champions to deal with him. In the midst of their battle, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; ambushed him. The power of the Night Warrior had grown in her, and she easily defeated the undead bowman. She attempted to interrogate him about Sylvanas' location, but Nathanos instead offered cryptic answers and gloated that killing him would merely send him straight to her. When he attempted to taunt her further, she killed him mid-sentence.\nThe Alliance and Horde champions reported these events to Greymane and Theron respectively, who both expressed satisfaction with the outcome, disappointment at not being able to partake in the battle themselves, and concern over Tyrande's state of mind. \nDespite his belief that he would be reunited with Sylvanas in death, he was instead sent to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; like every other soul; &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; kept Sylvanas in the dark about his demise until Tyrande revealed it to her during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;Battle of Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter turning against the Jailer and being reunited with the lost part of her soul, Sylvanas was determined to find Nathanos again, no matter how long it took. Following the Jailer's defeat, Tyrande sentenced Sylvanas to free all of the souls trapped in the Maw and sending them to &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;the Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; for judgment. Despite the seeming infinity of the Maw, Sylvanas knew that Nathanos was somewhere among its condemned souls and that she would eventually find him again, just as she always had.\nDragonflight.\nA time-displaced Nathanos Marris appeared in &lt;a href=\"Everywhen%20Inn\"&gt;Everywhen Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, asking adventurers to kill &lt;a href=\"Fowl%20Beast\"&gt;dangerous beasts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterpelt%20Hollow\"&gt;Winterpelt Hollow&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;. He was aware of being time-displaced. After confirming that they were only fowls, Nathanos insisted that they were eldritch creatures, after which he entered a time portal to return back to his ranger-general.\nApperance.\nIn life, Nathanos was a human with white skin, dark brown hair, brown eyes and a prominent beard. Sylvanas considered him to be quite \"ugly\" as a human being, he had a muscular build and wore a brown and green hunter's uniform.\nIn undeath Nathanos was now a semi-rotten corpse, with his arms, legs and a large part of his jaw rotted and with his bones exposed and his eyes shining with a yellow light. He was still wearing his hunter's uniform when he died now broken and dirty.\nAfter sacrificing his cousin Stephon Marris, Nathanos' appearance changed radically. Now his body was more built, he had a muscular build and his body was in perfect condition, he still retained his bright yellow eyes.\nQuests.\nClassic.\nAlliance.\nHis death was the objective of the quest &lt;a href=\"Order%20Must%20Be%20Restored\"&gt;Order Must Be Restored&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne strategy was to take Nathanos down as fast as possible, whilst reducing the aggro on weaker party members. This enabled the group to at least complete the quest, or gain honor under the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20system\"&gt;Honor system&lt;/a&gt; for the kill, while all the party were (still) alive.\nYou needed at least 8 people in a raid group at lower levels, with a main and off-tank.\nFocus on Nathanos himself and take him down as fast as possible. He can be taken down in a minute or so, at which point no more skeletons will be added. The Blighthounds will not do any serious damage until he is down. Deal with them second, and the skeletons third.\nAvoid healing as 2-4 skeletons are attracted to the healer. This includes &lt;a href=\"Direct%20Heal\"&gt;direct heals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; spells, Warlock's drain spells, &lt;a href=\"bandage\"&gt;bandage&lt;/a&gt;s, potions, pet heals, and life-stealing enchants. Rather than heal, run; stop fighting to reduce threat (trinkets etc. with Spirit bonuses are useful here) and heal normally; or let your tanks do the healing to attract aggro back.\nIt was easy to solo him at level 80, especially if you are a tank.\nQuotes.\nClassic.\nGossip.\nNo doubt you are another inept simpleton sent from the Dark Lady to train under her champion.\n&lt;Nathanos sighs.&gt;\nI've sent every one of you back to her in pieces, I don't see why it will be any different this time.\nMine, however, is not to question why, but instead to do as the Dark Lady bids.\nCataclysm.\nBe gone, &lt;class&gt;.

Looking to the sky, the sun is suddenly eclipsed. A familiar white owl is circling overhead. Nathanos lowers his gaze as a thick fog falls upon the Marris Stead.

With no apparent effort, Tyrande vaporizes them both with a blast of Moonfire. As she gets close, Nathanos narrows his eyes, reaches down and picks up his twin handaxes. After a moment of locked gazes, Nathanos charges. Despite his skill, Tyrande blocks his attacks easily, and quickly overwhelms him before delivering a vicious slice across his midsection. Nathanos falls to his knees, but Tyrande holds her blade against his throat. &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt; flies over and lands on a nearby fencepost.

Nathanos gives a single gasp before going limp and slumping to the ground. Dori'thur gazes at the display for a few moments before taking flight. Tyrande gives the corpse of Nathanos Blightcaller one last, bitter look before walking into the fog.\"\nTyrande Whisperwind: "}

It served as a repository for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s arcana and forbidden knowledge and housed a great archive recording every campaign ever carried out by the Legion. Just before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the world with his &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; and raided the dreadlords' archives for the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Seal of Argus&lt;/a&gt; before returning to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and using a spell in an attempt to obliterate the world. Although Nathreza blew apart, part of it survived in some form.\nThe nathrezim rarely use their &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim%20%28language%29\"&gt;written language&lt;/a&gt; outside of their homeworld. Most outsiders know little of Nathreza, and the little that is known is only rumor.\nDescription.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; saw it, Nathreza was a collection of rocks floating in the emptiness of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. It was orbited every few minutes by a tiny green &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; and dozens of small glowing &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s. Rocks drifted across the sky and obsidian obelisks floated above cratered plains. Potent &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies saturated the very fabric of the world and everything on it; in fact, the planetoid itself was carved from pure magical energy congealed into pulsing, chromatic stone. Due to its location in the Twisting Nether, any demon who is killed on Nathreza dies permanently.\nNathreza was inhabited by hundreds of nathrezim and thousands of their servants and had several cities. One city consisted of black streets, basalt and obsidian towers lit by fel energy, and palaces where nathrezim planned the destruction and enslavement of worlds. Basalt disks rose up the sides of buildings. In the center stood a gigantic windowless tower amid a grid of energy flows: Nathreza's main archive, which contained records of every campaign the Legion had ever conducted, every portal it had ever passed through, and the name and location of every planet it had ever destroyed. It was the heart of the nathrezim's world and the living memory of their race, and dreadlords schemed to have their names imprinted there. The interior of the archive was made up of towering stacks of obsidian disks, each disk a record. It was protected by complex defensive spells and organized almost chronologically, with the oldest disks located on the bottom of each stack and the stacks closest to the center being the oldest of these.\nFollowing Illidan's shattering of it, &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Keeper%20Hasabel\"&gt;Portal Keeper Hasabel&lt;/a&gt; described Nathreza as \"once a world of magic and knowledge, now a twisted landscape from which none escape\". Latent shadows and deception is core to Nathreza.\nHistory.\nColonization.\nThe nathrezim were originally &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; beings who were created by &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the realms of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. In order to end a conflict between them and &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt; countless ages ago, Denathrius exiled the nathrezim to \"a world beyond the Shadowlands\", presumably meaning Nathreza.\nIllidan's raid.\nThe &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; saw visions of Nathreza at some point in his life. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; inherited these memories when he absorbed the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s power. Illidan's end goal was to destroy the Burning Legion's stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, and the only place he knew of that contained clues to Argus' location was Nathreza. For years, he planned an assault on the dreadlord homeworld and compiled information about it by plundering libraries in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and interrogating dozens of demons. Finally, one month before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, he used a ritual to send his soul into the Twisting Nether and passed by countless worlds destroyed by the Legion before he found Nathreza and could deduce its location.\nShortly after, he lured &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; into a trap at the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and used the souls of the slain to create an enormously powerful portal to Nathreza\u2014the greatest feat of sorcery performed in Outland since &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction. Illidan and his &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s rushed through the portal and destroyed an army of demonic defenders commanded by hundreds of dreadlords that marched to meet them. They then pressed on to the nathrezim city and stormed the great archive. While the Illidari held the entrance, Illidan descended into the archive and claimed his objective, the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Seal of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, before defacing many of the records and thereby ruining the nathrezim's prized monument. The Illidari then battled their way back to the portal and passed through it back to Outland. Illidan then collapsed the gateway, causing it to unravel in a surge of explosive energy powerful enough to tear apart a continent. He calculated that this would shatter Nathreza in the same way that &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; had shattered Draenor. Indeed, the spell caused a tidal wave of magic to surge over the planet, obliterating the dreadlords' cities. Shortly after the portal closed, Nathreza blew apart. Every demon on its surface perished. This was the greatest defeat the Burning Legion had suffered in millennia.\nLater history.\n&lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; left behind &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20from%20the%20Nathrezim%20Homeworld\"&gt;a strange artifact&lt;/a&gt; from Nathreza during the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; sent agents to &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;travel back in time&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve the artifact in the hopes of learning more about the dreadlords.\nAfter Mal'Ganis was unmasked as &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt; during the war against the Lich King, he fled through a portal to \"the homeworld\".\nDuring the assault on &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Keeper%20Hasabel\"&gt;Portal Keeper Hasabel&lt;/a&gt; opened a shadowy portal to Nathreza, guarded by the nathrezim &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Eilgar\"&gt;Lord Eilgar&lt;/a&gt;, to confuse the minds of her enemies."}

In &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim%20%28language%29\"&gt;their native language&lt;/a&gt;, they refer to themselves as thal'kituun, meaning unseen guests; for this reason, they are also called the unseen ones or the Unseen. These incredibly powerful &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt; beings are masters of dark sorcery and are deadly foes on the battlefield, but they generally prefer to manipulate and undermine their enemies from the shadows.\nSire Denathrius, the ruler of the realm of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, originally created the nathrezim for the purpose of spreading the influence of Death throughout the cosmos by infiltrating the other &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;cosmic forces&lt;/a&gt;. As such, they are closely related to the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt;. Denathrius later pretended to exile the dreadlords from the Shadowlands, but they secretly remained in service to him and his ally, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. Many nathrezim became &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and settled on the world of &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, later becoming prominent members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in which they served as the trusted lieutenants of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;, all while secretly working to further Denathrius' plans.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the dreadlords served Kil'jaeden and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; as the jailors of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and commanders of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They played prominent roles in many of the Legion's subsequent campaigns (even after Nathreza was largely destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;) particularly during the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth. Finally, the unseen guests returned in force to the Shadowlands after eons of supposed exile, openly revealing their allegiance to Denathrius and the Jailer and aiding them in their efforts to remake reality.\nDescription.\nNathrezim are enormous, imposing beings, taller than both &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;. Curled horns thrust from their skulls, which also possess glowing eyes and sharp canines jutting out of their mouths. They are equipped with large bat wings, powerful goatlike legs that bend backwards and end in cloven hooves, and fingers adorned with long, bladelike claws. Some have dead, gray skin like that of a corpse, while some others have blue-gray skin resembling animated stone. Some dreadlords have no hair on their heads at all, while others possess sideburns as well as shaggy fur on their legs and forearms. Their blood is dark in color.\nNathrezim are \"psychic &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s\" who feed on the energies of mortal creatures and often use their victims as slaves. They also enjoy eating mortal hearts. Dreadlords have a near-unparalleled capacity for working magic and are even more skilled at it than the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;. In combat, they wield the powers of dark magic and mental domination, allowing them to summon frightening illusions and take control of mortal minds. They can summon swarms of bats and carrion insects to attack their foes, use hypnosis to put enemies into a sudden, trance-like sleep, and summon &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s to crash down from the sky and do their bidding.\nHowever, while dreadlords are powerful foes on the battlefield and have been known to revel in combat, they generally prefer to turn nations against each other through manipulation from the shadows. As they are beings of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, they can\u2014with enough effort and patience\u2014alter their own natures. They are masters of infiltration and illusion who are capable of shapeshifting and disguising themselves as a variety of beings, and their cunning rivals even the best veterans of the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;. They seem to be wholly adaptable to their surroundings and specialize in gaining the trust of the very forces they are sent to undermine. They utilize terror and subterfuge, often turning brother against brother as whole worlds fall before their dark influence. Disguised dreadlords like to communicate with each other through magical written messages concealed by a simple cantrip spell, invisible to the average observer. It is possible to see through and dispel their disguises using tools like an &lt;a href=\"%3AOrb%20of%20Revelation\"&gt;:Orb of Revelation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"%3ATonal%20Jammer\"&gt;:Tonal Jammer&lt;/a&gt;. Nathrezim, in turn, are sharp-eyed enough to see through at least some invisibility spells.\nIn addition to magically changing their own appearance, dreadlords can physically possess the bodies of mortals, as exemplified by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; possessing the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; possessing &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;. In both cases, the dreadlords expressed distaste over having to hide inside the weak \"shell\" of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, but they could change back into their true form at will.\nThe dreadlords who serve the Burning Legion typically act as intelligence agents, interrogators, and secret police, as well as the elite guard and personal agents of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;. They are also skilled weaponsmiths, with their most notable creation being the &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%3AApocalypse\"&gt;:Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the Legion's most powerful weapons were created at the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Forge%20of%20the%20Nathrezim\"&gt;Cursed Forge of the Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. They are a step below &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lords&lt;/a&gt; in the Legion's hierarchy. Powerful nathrezim on &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt; were served by retinues of hundreds of lesser demons, and their status was marked by glowing runes on their armor. The dreadlords' capital on Nathreza consisted of a city of basalt towers, palaces where they planned the destruction and enslavement of worlds, and a huge windowless tower containing their great archive, where they stored records of all of the Legion's campaigns. This archive was their monument and the living memory of their race, and nathrezim schemed to have their names imprinted there.\nAs with other demons, killing a demonic nathrezim outside the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; will simply send them back to the Nether to regenerate in a new body. It is forbidden for one of the nathrezim to kill another. This law has been broken at least twice: once by &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; when he was ordered to kill his brother Balnazzar by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and another time when Balnazzar attempted to kill &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe nathrezim originate from &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the infinite realms of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, the afterlife. They were created countless ages ago by Revendreth's ruler &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; and were unveiled by him just after he sired the first &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;. The nathrezim inhabited the southwestern ward of Revendreth, which was ruled by Denathrius' firstborn son &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;, and the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Spire%20of%20the%20Unseen%20Guests\"&gt;Spire of the Unseen Guests&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; is still named after them. Since they were both created directly by the Sire, the original venthyr are in many ways more closely related to the nathrezim than they are to the venthyr that were later created from mortal souls, and the nathrezim still view Renathal as their brother.\nHaving forged them to be the ultimate infiltrators, Denathrius tasked the nathrezim with infiltrating the realms of the other &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;cosmic forces&lt;/a&gt; as well as mortal worlds in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;physical universe&lt;/a&gt; in order to spread the influence of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"%3AEnemy%20Infiltration%20-%20Preface\"&gt;:Enemy Infiltration - Preface&lt;/a&gt;\", a dreadlord report addressed to Denathrius, describes how the author's kind planned to manipulate the other forces, including:\nThe nathrezim's incursions went mostly unnoticed, but the ones who infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; were discovered. The &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and their forces retaliated by unleashing the Light's full wrath on Revendreth, setting the nathrezim's ward ablaze and turning it into a scorched wasteland known thereafter as the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; didn't rise up to defend Revendreth, so &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;, Harvester of Wrath, created the &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Legion\"&gt;Stone Legion&lt;/a&gt; to strike back against the invaders. The nathrezim found the injured naaru &lt;a href=\"Z%27rali\"&gt;Z'rali&lt;/a&gt; on the battlefield and preserved her to \"serve as a vessel for their Sire's rage\", leading to her being imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Depths\"&gt;Sanguine Depths&lt;/a&gt;. After the Light's forces were routed, the Stonewright turned her anger on the nathrezim and blamed them for the losses suffered by the Stone Legion, since the Light's attack was ultimately their fault. Denathrius ended the conflict between nathrezim and venthyr by agreeing to exile the nathrezim to a world beyond the Shadowlands: &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;. However, according to &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, even this \"exile\" was part of Denathrius' plan, for the nathrezim's mission remained unchanged and all of the schemes they carried out in the following eons were only pawns in the long game being played by Denathrius and his ally, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. The nathrezim believed that if the Jailer succeeded in his ultimate goal of reaching the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and remaking reality, those who had served him faithfully would be rewarded in kind.\nDenathrius never told Renathal what became of the nathrezim, but the prince hoped that they would learn from their exile and one day return to Revendreth as family. The Stonewright, on the other hand, continued to foster her hatred against the dreadlords. The existence of the unseen guests seems to have been either unknown to the Shadowlands at large or forgotten over time after their exile, except for persistent rumors and speculation that Denathrius had once created a third race beside the venthyr and stoneborn to infiltrate his enemies.\nAccording to one &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;, the nathrezim were once an enlightened and powerful race with a skill in summoning and portal magics that was unmatched by any in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. It is not clear how this fits into the rest of their background as described above.\nThe Burning Legion.\nEarly in the universe's history, the nathrezim who had become demons were among the demonic races who began invading the physical universe from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to attack mortal civilizations. They dedicated their existence to mastering &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt; and relished in infiltrating mortal civilizations and sowing unrest. As these societies crumbled from within, the dreadlords transformed their populations into new breeds of demon. Over millennia, the titans &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; fought these dreadlords and other demons and imprisoned them in &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne conclave of nathrezim settled on a world where several &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, servants of the void lords, were in the process of corrupting a titan &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;. They came to dwell among the Old Gods, basking in their dark power. When Sargeras discovered the planet, he captured and interrogated the nathrezim, and they revealed what they knew about the void lords: that they had sent the Old Gods into the cosmos in order to find and corrupt a world-soul and transform it into an unspeakably dark creature that not even the Pantheon could stand against. Enraged by this discovery, Sargeras killed the nathrezim and shattered the corrupted world, killing the nascent titan within. It was this event that led Sargeras to conclude that the only way to stop the void lords was by &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;purging the universe of life&lt;/a&gt;, a decision that led him to part ways with the Pantheon and later form the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; by shattering Mardum and freeing and recruiting the demons he'd previously fought.\nSargeras later recruited the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the foremost of which were &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, to command the Legion. Kil'jaeden enslaved the nathrezim to serve as his personal agents throughout the universe, and they took pleasure in locating primitive races for their master to corrupt and recruit. First among the dreadlords was &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius the Darkener&lt;/a&gt;, who served Kil'jaeden as the perfect soldier.\nThe nathrezim stoked Sargeras' fear of the Void to blind him to their true purpose and the fact that they were secretly loyal not to him, but to Denathrius and the Jailer. When Sargeras raged at the time it took for slain demons to regenerate in the Nether, the nathrezim suggested that they could infuse Argus' &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;titan world-soul&lt;/a&gt; with Death magic in order to turn him into a resurrection engine that would allow the Legion's armies to resurrect instantaneously. In truth, this scheme was a \"gambit\" by the Jailer: by infusing Argus with Death, the nathrezim ensured that, if he was killed, the titan's soul would fire into the Shadowlands and incapacitate the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, the being responsible for judging mortal souls.\nIn order to hasten the fall of mortal worlds, the nathrezim created the &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%3AApocalypse\"&gt;:Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, which could spread plagues and paranoia and thereby weaken mortal civilizations and leave them vulnerable to conquest by the Legion. Apocalypse wasn't crafted by a single dreadlord; instead, over the course of centuries, the weapon passed from one nathrezim to another, with each new owner refining it and using the lessons learned from their conquests to endow it with new plagues and maledictions. In this way, it became a fusion of all of the dark arts the nathrezim had at their disposal. The last dreadlord to use Apocalypse was &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to turn the armies of the planet &lt;a href=\"Navane\"&gt;Navane&lt;/a&gt; against themselves.\nMany dreadlords participated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. A few of them experimented with raising undead &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the first inkling of what would lead to the Legion's creation of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; ten thousand years later. &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; at one point battled &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Eldarath\"&gt;Eldarath&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. More than 2,600 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Kathra'natir returned to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. He spread &lt;a href=\"plague\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;s and disease, and used Apocalypse to warp the minds of the non-mage civilians, turning them against the magi. He stole the Amulet of Waters from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt;, and through it he was able to control and corrupt &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;. He was later banished by &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; and the Council of Tirisfal. When he was banished, his sword Apocalypse was left behind.\nThird War.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden captured the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, intending to use him in a new attempt to conquer Azeroth. A group of dreadlords consisting of Tichondrius, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; took turns subjecting Ner'zhul's body to horrific torture until he agreed to serve the Legion. Kil'jaeden passed the orc's soul through death and transformed him into the spectral &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the same time, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; intended to use the Lich King to herald his own reign on Azeroth, and wanted to use the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; in order to spread Death's influence on the mortal plane. The nathrezim bore these vessels of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic across the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; and bound Ner'zhul's spirit to them, after which the orc's spirit was imprisoned in a block of ice. Tichondrius later falsely claimed that it was the dreadlords themselves who had forged Frostmourne. The &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt; has concluded that, in this way, the nathrezim deceived the Legion into helping to spread the Jailer's influence, making the demons believe that the Lich King was an instrument of &lt;a href=\"Disorder\"&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt; instead of an instrument of Death.\nSince Kil'jaeden remained skeptical of Ner'zhul's loyalties, he called on the dreadlords who had tortured the orc to accompany the Lich King to Azeroth, act as his jailors and executors, and ensure that he succeeded in his task: to spread a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and create an undead army (later named the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;) to weaken Azeroth's defenses in preparation for the Legion's invasion. Ner'zhul's icy prison was hurled from the Twisting Nether to Azeroth and landed on the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, where it became the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadlords soon joined him and constructed the impenetrable &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; around the throne while the Lich King began enslaving Northrend's inhabitants. In secret, the Lich King plotted to betray the Legion and carefully watched the nathrezim to learn their strengths and weaknesses. When the Lich King's dominion was threatened by the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;, the dreadlords and the Lich King's undead warriors invaded &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; and crushed the spider lords.\nIn time, Ner'zhul recruited &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who subsequently created the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; to spread the Plague of Undeath throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Lich King decided he needed to use Frostmourne to create an additional servant to act as his direct surrogate beyond the Frozen Throne. He knew the dreadlords would never allow him to create a servant of his own, but he had discovered that their greatest fear was to be punished by Kil'jaeden and used this to his advantage. He played on the dreadlords' fears and subtly convinced them that finding other mortal champions was the key to victory, all while making the dreadlords believe that it had been their idea. With the nathrezim's approval, the Lich King thrust Frostmourne from the Frozen Throne to await a wielder.\nWhen Ner'zhul saw potential in turning &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the dreadlords agreed, to the point of having Kel'Thuzad reveal to Arthas and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who were investigating rumors of plague, that it was Mal'Ganis was the leader of the Scourge. As the Scourge destroyed town after town, the nathrezim hit at Arthas' weakness, his pride. Arthas began to take his inability to protect his people from the Scourge personally, and soon became obsessed with killing the dreadlord, especially after Mal'Ganis led Arthas to &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; infected &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and the young prince put the town to sword, over letting Mal'Ganis convert all of its inhabitants into undeath.\nDetermined to end Mal'Ganis Arthas journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where the nathrezim were prepared to turn him into the Lich King's greatest servant. Knowing that Arthas would become suspicious if Mal'Ganis led him to Frostmourne, the dreadlords manipulated &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Expedition\"&gt;Dwarven Expedition&lt;/a&gt; into seeking out the runeblade as part of their quest to locate ancient artifacts. With the dwarves seeking the runeblade, the Lich King used the Scourge to herd Muradin and Arthas into joining forces. In time, Arthas' obsession with the hated dreadlord led him further down the path of evil, first lying to his men, betraying his mercenaries, and finally forsaking his own soul to take up the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, grievously wounding &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nAt the Lich King's command, Arthas killed Mal'Ganis, an act that infuriated the other dreadlords. However they did not punish the Lich King, as the entity convinced them that the death was an unfortunate accident, and had promised that with Arthas now under his complete control, the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; would never again raise a hand against them. Following the corruption of Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, Tichondrius introduced himself to the death knight, providing him with orders from Ner'zhul, especially concerning the resurrection of Kel'Thuzad. Because he didn't entirely trust Arthas, Tichondrius pretended to be another one of the Lich King's followers. The ghost of Kel'Thuzad, however, informed Arthas that Tichondrius and the other dreadlords were actually the Lich King's jailers.\nTichondrius regularly &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadlords%20Convene\"&gt;discussed the Scourge's progress&lt;/a&gt; with his colleagues, &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;, who remained on a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; planet in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The Darkener expressed (justified) concern that Ner'zhul had alternative plans for his new \"champion\", but Mephistroth pointed out that he \"wouldn't dare undermine our efforts now.\"\nThe dreadlord continued his work, eventually overseeing the death of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;the invasion and destruction of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and the siege of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Once &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was summoned, he decreed that the Lich King was no longer needed, and gave the dreadlords control of the Scourge.\nInvasion of Kalimdor.\nWhile the nathrezim aided the Legion in the destruction of Lordaeron, Tichondrius and the &lt;a href=\"pitlord\"&gt;pitlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; successfully engineered the death of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; by taking advantage of the demi-god's quarrel with &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Clan\"&gt;Warsong Clan&lt;/a&gt; by corrupted the orcs into the service of the Burning Legion. However soon after this the Warsong were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, who then purged Grom of the corruption, who at the cost of his own life killed Mannoroth.\nDespite Mannoroth's death, the Burning Legion and thus the nathrezim commenced with the invasion of Kalimdor, the Scourge, more dangerous than ever thanks to the demonic support of &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s, was more than successful in penetrating &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; without Cenarius's intervention. Though unbeknownst to the dreadlords, the Lich secretly hampered their command over the Scourge during this time. The combined forces of the orcs and the humans, coupled with the resistance of the night elves, eventually managed to halt their progress.\nAs the invasion of Kalimdor progressed, Tichondrius began corrupting the forests of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; using a powerful warlock artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. However, the skull was consumed by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who had been tipped off by none other than &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. Transformed by the skull into a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;-hybrid, Illidan used his newfound power to defeat Tichondrius.\nMeanwhile, Anetheron had gone with &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, and served as a personal guardsman. Anetheron showed his tenacity when he led the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the final, climactic &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. He invaded the Great Alliance's base several times during the battle, calling &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s to serve him, with the objective of defeating the resistance so that &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; could ascend to crush the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. However, Anetheron was killed during the battle.\nPlaguelands civil war.\nFollowing the Legion's defeat at Hyjal, the Lich King openly rebelled against Kil'jaeden. In response, the demon lord recruited &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Frozen Throne. Illidan's attempt failed, but did damage the Frozen Throne to the point where the Lich King's powers began weakening, in turn causing some of the Scourge to regain their free will.\nUnaware of the Legion's defeat at Hyjal, the nathrezim brothers &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; continued governing the Scourge in Lordaeron and leading them against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; in the area. The &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sometimes overheard them mention \"&lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;sire&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;\" in their private conversations. Arthas eventually returned from Kalimdor to inform the dreadlords of the Legion's defeat and chased them off to take control of the Scourge. The three &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt; refused to be defeated and plotted to take advantage of Ner'zhul and Arthas' weakening powers to regain control of the undead, with the end goal of launching an invasion of Northrend to destroy the Lich King themselves. They reached out to the now free-willed Sylvanas to ask for her help in the coup; Balnazzar told her that the Lich King strayed from \"the path of his master\" and that Arthas was too prideful to be \"the instrument that is necessary\". It's not clear if by \"master\" he was referring to the Jailer or Kil'jaeden.\nThe nathrezim took control over the majority of the undead and set a trap for Arthas in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, but the death knight managed to escape to his master's side in Northrend. Afterward, the Dreadlord Insurgents' forces found themselves trapped between the undead still loyal to the Lich King, those loyal to Sylvanas (later called the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;), and the Alliance. The dreadlords declared themselves the future of Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and invited Sylvanas to join their \"new order\", but she refused and instead made war on them, defeating each brother in turn. She forced Varimathras to swear loyalty to her, killed Detheroc, and conquered the Ruins of Lordaeron from Balnazzar. She forced Varimathras to kill Balnazzar, but the latter secretly survived and hid in the Plaguelands.\nAfter the civil war.\nDespite the Legion's defeat a number of dreadlords still remained on Azeroth, particularly in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, with the most notable of them being &lt;a href=\"Razelikh%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Razelikh the Defiler&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to secure the land for the Legion. Razelikh was ultimately thwarted in this endeavor by &lt;a href=\"Loramus%20Thalipedes\"&gt;Loramus Thalipedes&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time in the northern &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, Balnazzar having faked his death, took on the guise of &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;. As Saidan Dathrohan, he gained control of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, who believed that they alone were not infected by the plague and attacked and killed all non-Crusaders on sight.\nWithin the forests of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, the dreadlords &lt;a href=\"Gorgannon\"&gt;Gorgannon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diathorus%20the%20Seeker\"&gt;Diathorus the Seeker&lt;/a&gt;, plotted an attack against the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Song\"&gt;Forest Song&lt;/a&gt; and desired to enslave the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;. After becoming aware of their intentions &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Vedaar\"&gt;Vindicator Vedaar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valusha\"&gt;Valusha&lt;/a&gt; respectively sent Alliance and Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; with ending the nathrezim.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and the ascension of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; as Lord of Outland, a number of nathrezim defected to the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among them &lt;a href=\"Lothros\"&gt;Lothros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vagath\"&gt;Vagath&lt;/a&gt;, who would ultimately be slain during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan led his demon hunters on a daring raid to &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;, the nathrezim home world, in order to claim the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Seal of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, a disc which held the record of the Legion's actions on the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, containing its location. When claiming the Seal of Argus, Illidan made a point of damaging the majority of the discs within Nathreza's vast archives.\nAfter claiming his prize, Illidan and his force retreated to the portal back to Outland and retreated through it, fighting off more demons. Once all were through, Illidan collapsed the portal; by his calculations, this should have caused such damage to Nathreza as to shatter the planet in the same fashion as &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, shortly after the portal closed, Nathreza blew apart. Every demon on its surface perished. Following Illidan's shattering of it, &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Keeper%20Hasabel\"&gt;Portal Keeper Hasabel&lt;/a&gt; described Nathreza as \"once a world of magic and knowledge, now a twisted landscape from which none escape\".\nDuring the Alliance and Horde's &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion stationed dreadlords in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to rain down storms of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sathrovarr%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Sathrovarr the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; possessed &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; and the dreadlord is &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;fought&lt;/a&gt; inside the spectral realm.\nMeanwhile, Mal'Ganis, who had reformed in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, returned to Azeroth during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;. Taking a page out of Balnazzar's book, Mal'ganis had taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, he led them to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to get revenge on the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. He stood in seclusion in the &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Harbor\"&gt;Onslaught Harbor&lt;/a&gt; until agents from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; confronted him, and forced him to flee.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; led demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; renegades in a coup against &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Varimathras and his conspirators were defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, but his betrayal elicited war between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Cataclysm rocked the world, Balnazzar slaughtered the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;rs in Stratholme and transformed them into the undead creatures they once hated as the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;, using his necromantic powers to resurrect them. &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; tasked adventurers to slay him.\nA number of dreadlords appeared in the on the alternate . Following the Burning Legion take over of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Anetheron arrived to Draenor at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Anetheron and his master Archimonde were soon after defeated by the champions of Azeroth.\nThird invasion of the Burning Legion.\nAfter Archimonde's death, the Legion launched its &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and a large number of nathrezim participated in its events. One of them disguised himself as the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and tempted &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to accept power in order to become Legion's pawn. Another one infiltrated Stormwind Keep taking a guise of a Stormwindian soldier who tried to assassinate the new &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The king bested him and the dreadlord offered him to join the Legion, but Anduin ultimately destroyed him.\nAs the dreadlords are major commanders of the Burning Legion, many of the newly united orders saw themselves put in heavy time and resources to take these demons down. Chief amongst them was &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, who was sent to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to watch over in the name of the Burning Legion and to keep an eye on the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;, who orchestrated the Legion forces during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, who were respectfully slain within the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the war against the Legion progressed, the Highlord of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; encountered and liberated a nathrezim, infused with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, who informed them at the Legion planned on attacking the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, before departing to gather reinforcements. Thus when &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; led the Legion against the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, they were reinforced by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and detachment of troops from &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, led by the Highlord and Lothraxion. The united forces were ultimately able to defeat the Legion and kill Balnazzar. As the Netherlight Temple resides within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, Balnazzar became one of the few notable dreadlords to receive his permanent death during the Legion's third invasion. Following the battle's aftermath, Lothraxion united with the Silver Hand to stand against the Legion.\nMeanwhile &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, posing as &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, sought to convince King Anduin to attack the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but was thwarted by the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;, who liberated Shaw and killed Detheroc and the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; were able to imprison &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. Though powerless inside the soulstone, Kathra'natir's power was later siphoned from it to power a weapon defense system located in the tallest spire atop Dalaran's &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt; in response to the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, a number of dreadlords participated in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Stormheim\"&gt;Assault on Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn time, the forces of Azeroth united with the Army of the Light and invaded &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; where it was discovered that after Illidan's defeat on Outland, nathrezim such as &lt;a href=\"Vagath\"&gt;Vagath&lt;/a&gt; returned to the Legion. As the heroes of Azeroth stormed &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, reinforcements from Nathreza arrived to push the invaders out but failed. During the fighting &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, who in payment for his &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;blunders&lt;/a&gt; at the Undercity, had been tortured by the &lt;a href=\"Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt;, was discovered by the Horde and Alliance forces. Upon meeting them, he spoke in cryptic prophecies about the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but then dismissed them in favor of a \"darkness\" they were blind to. He was then killed by the adventurers. At the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurers killed the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;soul of Argus&lt;/a&gt;. As the nathrezim had planned, this caused Argus' soul to enter the Shadowlands and slam into the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, rendering her dormant and causing all new souls entering the Shadowlands to flow into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; instead of being sorted to their rightful afterlives. This in turn caused the &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s to descend into an &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought while the Maw and its master, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, grew in power.\nShadowlands.\nThe nathrezim returned en masse to the Shadowlands during the anima drought to serve their true masters, &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; and the Jailer. It's unknown exactly when they returned, and the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; wonders if they ever truly left at all. Several nathrezim infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient city that the Jailer chained to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kin%27tessa\"&gt;Kin'tessa&lt;/a&gt; tricked &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s into helping her capture &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Kalo\"&gt;Fatescribe Roh-Kalo&lt;/a&gt; and deliver him to the Jailer in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;, and several other dreadlords infiltrated the covenant forces to sabotage their foothold in &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;. Others infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; in their old home of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of freeing Denathrius, who had been defeated and imprisoned in his sword &lt;a href=\"Remornia\"&gt;Remornia&lt;/a&gt;. The infiltrators were under orders to keep their \"brother\" &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; unharmed, since they \"needed\" him and his death would upset their Sire. Yet other nathrezim disguised themselves among the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; soldiers in Torghast.\nIn response to the dreadlord threat, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; sent Maw Walkers along with &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Vashj\"&gt;Baroness Vashj&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who had experience with hunting nathrezim in life\u2014to Revendreth to recruit the help of the dreadlords' old nemesis, &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;:Medallion of Wrath&lt;/a&gt; was needed if the venthyr were to recreate their lost &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;covenant sigil&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, the nathrezim sprung a trap to steal the medallion from the Stonewright. The Maw Walkers, Vashj, and the soul of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; used an &lt;a href=\"%3AOrb%20of%20Revelation\"&gt;:Orb of Revelation&lt;/a&gt; to unmask many of the unseen guests hiding in &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Keep\"&gt;Dominance Keep&lt;/a&gt; and Sinfall, after which Renathal and his fellow &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; used a ritual to locate Mal'Ganis and the medallion. The Maw Walkers and their allies defeated him and took back the artifact, but he revealed that the medallion heist had only been a distraction to keep the venthyr occupied while the dreadlords seized their true prize\u2014Remornia with Denathrius' essence in it\u2014from where it was held in &lt;a href=\"Dawnkeep\"&gt;Dawnkeep&lt;/a&gt;. He added that Denathrius' long game was nearing its end and that neither the medallion, Revendreth, nor Renathal's cause mattered in the face of the Sire's ambition. The Stonewright subsequently sent her &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Legion\"&gt;Stone Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces to the Maw to kill every dreadlord they could find and provide the covenants with Orbs of Revelation to defend against further incursions.\nWhen the Jailer entered the realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, many nathrezim accompanied him and commanded the Mawsworn forces in the field. The Jailer's end goal was to use the secrets in the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; to rewrite reality, but to enter it he needed to use the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;. Kin'tessa led efforts to use &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic to corrupt Zereth Mortis' &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; and destroy the obelisks protecting the Forge, while Mal'Ganis led dreadlord saboteurs in infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the covenant forces to divert their efforts and stall the Maw Walkers long enough for the Jailer to reach the Forge. The plan worked, and the Jailer used the Forge to enter the Sepulcher.\nA Maw Walker and their allies later worked with the automa &lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;Saezurah&lt;/a&gt; to breach the Mawsworn-infested &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, where they could create a new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to restore order to the Shadowlands. However, a &lt;a href=\"Darkseer%20Corruptor\"&gt;dreadlord infiltrator&lt;/a&gt; sabotaged the ritual by summoning the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Echo of Argus&lt;/a&gt; so that he could take the &lt;a href=\"vessel\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt; intended to serve as the Arbiter's body and thereby become \"&lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt;\". The Maw Walker and their allies managed to defeat the echo, but the nathrezim's interference succeeded in disrupting the creation of a new Arbiter until &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; volunteered his own soul for the role. When Maw Walkers entered the Sepulcher to stop the Jailer, Mal'Ganis and Kin'tessa\u2014together called the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Dread\"&gt;Lords of Dread&lt;/a&gt;\u2014tried to stop them to ensure that none were left to \"resist the new order of the cosmos\". However, the heroes defeated both them and the Jailer before he could complete his plan of remaking the cosmos.\nWith the Jailer's defeat, the nathrezim now presumably answer only to Denathrius. The current whereabouts of Remornia and the rest of the dreadlords are unknown.\nIn the RPG.\nMasters of trickery, deceit, and guile, the nathrezim take pride in the fiendish destruction they have wrought on Azeroth. Affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the nathrezim \u2014 also termed dreadlords \u2014 acted as commanders of the undead Scourge during the Burning Legion's second invasion, slaughtering thousands with their unnatural hordes. The dreadlords lost much power when several of their most influential members fell to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; armies under &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s banner. For a while, the dreadlords seemed almost a myth, a story told to frighten children. People felt safer when they thought the dreadlords were a remote tale; some instead comforted themselves with the lie that the great &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; was the only surviving dreadlord. More practical sorts knew that evil never truly dies and that just because they couldn't see something did not mean it was not there.\nDreadlords invariably stay behind the scenes and affect change through proxies. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s might go their whole lives and never realize a dreadlord has acted against them in countless, seemingly unrelated ways. Only after much exertion and investigation do the heroes uncover the dreadlord behind a plot. Even then, the task of tracking and slaying a dreadlord can overwhelm the most competent hunter of evil. Dreadlords live in heavily fortified lairs or march at the center of an army.\nIn the nathrezim's eyes, malice is the ultimate gift. To torment another creature with physical and moral agony offers something superior to happiness or contentment. Dreadlords prefer to turn their talents to psychic assault and manipulation, seeking to dissolve the bonds that unify individuals, groups, and nations and leave their mortal victims floundering amidst chaos and decay. A nathrezim-occupied world eventually abandons higher morality as irrelevant to the context in which its inhabitants find themselves, joining the dreadlords in their callous worship of the malign. Although fierce warriors, nathrezim prefer a leadership role, standing behind a wall of ghouls or other allies and retreating when their enemies press too close. This is particularly true of the weaker nathrezim, whose magical abilities cannot always prevent their swift, bloody execution by a determined fighter, &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;, or rogue. A dreadlord engages in melee combat only when convinced he holds the upper hand. A dreadlord studies his opponent first and learns their weaknesses. Then he remains at range, unleashing his most powerful spells on his enemy.\nNearly all dreadlords choose to study both the arts of war and the arts of magic. Some of them, such as &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, are proficient at necromancy. It is important to note that the nathrezim are not as talented in magic as the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 whereas the eredar have become adept at almost all forms of magic, the nathrezim show talent for only a handful of types. They most often are arcanists, but some dreadlords favor the physical arts of the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;. The nathrezim are called nathrezite two times in the non-&lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;ical ', but it is unknown if this is a misspelling or an alternate name.\n&lt;a href=\"Tothrezim\"&gt;Tothrezim&lt;/a&gt; are distant cousins of the dread nathrezim.\nLanguages.\nDreadlords can apparently understand any tongue psychically. Dreadlords can speak with any creature that has a language. \"However, since they are members of the Burning Legion, it can be assumed they would speak Eredun most of the time.\""}
