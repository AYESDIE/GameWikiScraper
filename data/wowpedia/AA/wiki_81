The treasure chests themselves are mostly dark green with golden trimming. They are found all over the zone, from being hidden in bushes and inside caverns to places that can't be reached without flying.\nThe best time to look for the wyrmtongue caches is when the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Tower%20%28Broken%20Shore%29\"&gt;Mage Tower&lt;/a&gt; building is active, as it grants players the ability to see more of them."}

Races sometimes personify their faiths in the form of a god, but members of the race understand that their \u201cgod\u201d is really just a symbol of their philosophical beliefs, not an actual being. Some, however, see actual beings as gods or demigods that do exist (either as a God, gods, or &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s is debatable among the races themselves), such as those who view &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; as a demigod. Others, such as the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, are seen as beings that actually exist, not symbolism for philosophic beliefs. Others, such as Firelord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, are seen by some to have achieved a god-like status. Most racial faiths include the concept of an afterlife, along with cultural mores and taboos to indicate the correct path to the afterlife. Spiritual leaders who guide their race along the proper philosophical path tend to be shaman or druids. Few races revere an actual deity to whom they can dedicate their lives as priests. In the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Formation%20of%20Felbane\"&gt;The Formation of Felbane&lt;/a&gt;, the quest giver, &lt;a href=\"Loramus%20Thalipedes\"&gt;Loramus Thalipedes&lt;/a&gt;, mentions the concept of a singular god as a blessing; \"May your determination and faith, carry you through this ordeal. Should you fail, know that your God smiles down upon you, mortal.\" Strangely enough, in the first two Warcraft games (including expansions), humans referred to a singular &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; behind the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaiths.\nThe following are the currently known religions in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt;:\nArcane.\nReligions or ideologies that study arcane magic and its corrupted version the Fel magic\nNature worship.\nReligions that worship nature and feel the need to take care of it.\nMajor deities and religions.\nThe Major deities and religions worshiped by the races.\n&lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Worship of the Moon &lt;a href=\"White%20Lady\"&gt;White Lady&lt;/a&gt; as a divine entity, by the tauren and the nigh elves. \n&lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe worship of Nature as a singular deity.\n&lt;a href=\"Sky%20Father\"&gt;Sky Father&lt;/a&gt;.\nA mysterious deity of the tauren.\n&lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe worship of the Sun as a deity.\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe worship of the Old Gods, mysterious, godlike, and great malefic horrors\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon worship&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe worship of dragons, reptilian creatures, usually winged, with magical or unusual abilities\n&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;Mystery of the Makers&lt;/a&gt; (The &lt;a href=\"titans\"&gt;titans&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Study of the Titans, metallic giants that travel across the cosmos bringing order to worlds.\n&lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nA necromantic cult that studies necromancy and worships the Lich King as the God of death/undeath.\n&lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt;.\nA sea deity worshiped by the people of Kul Tiras.\nMinor deities.\n&lt;a href=\"Arkkoroc\"&gt;Arkkoroc&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorship of the Arkkoroc a &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt; god.\n&lt;a href=\"Borrok%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Borrok the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn immense &lt;a href=\"lava%20worm\"&gt;lava worm&lt;/a&gt; found in a pit in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, worshipped by the nearby &lt;a href=\"Grimfrost%20clan\"&gt;Grimfrost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Grimfrost%20Hill\"&gt;Grimfrost Hill&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Tuskarr\"&gt;Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; deities.\nAssortment of deities that might be Loa and/or Ancient Guardians\nA mysterious spirit that guided the ancestors of the tuskarr to Kaskala.\nIs a spirit to watch over the dead, according to what tuskarr claim he might be the Lich King.\nA spirit of war depicted as a silver eagle.\nA sea goddess that the tuskarr contact to know their destiny\nArakkoan deities.\nTerokk was the greatest hero of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, closely associated with their god Rukhmar.

In wandering tauren tribes, the religious community may be but a single &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"spiritwalker\"&gt;spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt;. In the time of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the religious community of Suramar was a complicated structure intimately intertwined with the arcane community and involving nearly everyone in the city. Each culture on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; has its own religious practices, and whether in the smallest town or the largest metropolis, those practices are supported by the religious community.\nEach religious community has some sort of designated area where it practices its rituals, usually considered sacred \u2014 or profane, as with the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es built by undead cults as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; spread its influence. This could be as simple as a special cave or grotto, or a constructed temple that required years and the labor of hundreds to construct, such as &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the shrine to the Ancients Ursoc and Ursol erected by the furbolg.\nThe members of a religious community may not all share the same outlook. Before the fall of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, many cities in the human kingdom had not only overt religious communities, but had also been infiltrated by the Cult of the Damned. Several shrines to different faiths may exist, in peaceful coexistence or in competition for faithful believers. Missionary groups from outside cultures may also form part of a population's religious community.\nHealing and spiritual guidance are among the most important roles that a religious group plays within the population. Its members typically have knowledge not only in the spiritual healing of the people but also physical healing, gathering collections of exotic herbs and medicines in order to teach the people how to use them properly. The religious community is also usually in charge of the proper methods of dealing with the dead, whether it be burying their bodies and putting their spirits to rest, or bringing the dead back to serve the community as among the Scourge.

Gathering like-minded blood elves, he formed the Reliquary, a primarily blood elven (but nonetheless multiracial) organization to acquire powerful magical artifacts for the sin'dorei and their &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; allies. Tae'thelan maintains that such power not only should not be feared, but can be safely utilized with proper teaching, a creed he aims to instill in allies of the Reliquary.\nThrough these moderate and controlled methods, Tae'thelan ultimately aims to free his people from their magical addiction, and unite them as the proud, mighty race they once were.\nAccounts also make mention of an unknown council based in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; ordering the Reliquary's formal creation.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Reliquary made his debut. Under the leadership of High Examiner &lt;a href=\"Tae%27thelan%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher&lt;/a&gt;, the Reliquary seeks to support its &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; allies, honor its past, and continue the task for which it was created - the acquisition of powerful magical artifacts. Though still a mostly blood elf organization, the Reliquary also welcomes other members of the Horde.\nThey are dedicated to uncovering magical and arcane artifacts, operating around several new and revamped areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, opposing their &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; counterparts to the point where overt hostilities erupt.\nInterested in the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic artifacts once hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Sunveil%20Excursion\"&gt;Sunveil Excursion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rohan%20Sunveil\"&gt;Rohan Sunveil&lt;/a&gt;, led his subordinates of the Reliquary to practice an archaeological study in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Forest\"&gt;Tainted Forest&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, where they focused their work in the acquisition, cataloging, and preservation of any and all magical artifacts. However, the unnatural forest threatened the Reliquary excursion's progress, as its trees' roots broke their picks, its moss grew over their excavation sites, and its animals attacked their men. In order to halt the corruption and continue their archaeological study, they sent Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s kill &lt;a href=\"The%20Demons%20and%20the%20Druid\"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marl%20Wormthorn\"&gt;responsible&lt;/a&gt; for the corruption of the great tree &lt;a href=\"Maldraz\"&gt;Maldraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe regent lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, brings the Reliquary with him to the myth-shrouded land of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; when he is summoned to the continent. The Reliquary disperses into multiple areas of interest: an excavation ventures to &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; to discover more of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, while other groups remain in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; to survey the area and make the most of the neighboring Explorer's League's missteps, overseen by &lt;a href=\"Belloc%20Brightblade\"&gt;Belloc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kaelis%20Sunsoar\"&gt;Kaelis Sunsoar&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Reliquary also uncover the earliest information regarding the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful mogu artifact the &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; takes a deep interest in.\nThe Reliquary appears to have branched out its membership for the trip to Pandaria, with the likes of &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s and even some &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; wearing the Reliquary tabard and helping to secure the area, rather than only the diggers seen before.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nA few members of the Reliquary eventually make their way to the alternate . &lt;a href=\"Examiner%20Remy%20Starminder\"&gt;Examiner Remy Starminder&lt;/a&gt; and his excavators were tasked with using this once-in-a-lifetime chance to acquire the lost artifacts of power on the continent, though this brings them into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, who seek to monetize them instead.\nLegion.\nThe Reliquary has set up camps all across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, with Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher going to a new camp every two weeks for &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Reliquary arrived on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; after the Horde was granted sanctuary by &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;. The expedition, led by the high examiner's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Tae%27shara%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;Tae'shara Bloodwatcher&lt;/a&gt;, is a joint blood elf-&lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; effort to excavate the bones of &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt;, first of the &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt;s and mother to the great &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; did not object to the elves' activities, having ceded the area to local wildlife long ago. The Reliquary's blood elves have been teaching their nightborne allies the &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;art of the dig&lt;/a&gt;, but some of the shal'dorei \u2013 particularly their cloistered leader, &lt;a href=\"Astrandis\"&gt;Astrandis&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 are rather out of their element. Astrandis came into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; over the relics in the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerin%20Solvis\"&gt;Nerin Solvis&lt;/a&gt;, a Reliquary financier, is funding and overseeing the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;'s activities in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;. He makes it clear to his goblin associate &lt;a href=\"Merd%20Archfeld\"&gt;Merd Archfeld&lt;/a&gt; that neither he nor the Reliquary is interested in Gallywix's political standing with Sylvanas.\nThe Reliquary's agents were targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; during their campaign against the Horde on Zandalar. High Examiner &lt;a href=\"Arlethal%20Sunwatcher\"&gt;Arlethal Sunwatcher&lt;/a&gt; was killed by the Alliance on &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt;'s orders.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Reliquary is still present and active in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, more precisely in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, where they continue to unearth the ruins in search of ancient treasures.\nDragonflight.\nWith the re-emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, at the behest of the Horde, the Reliquary worked alongside the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their joint-mission, rivalries between the Explorer's League and Reliquary endured. However, members of both factions worked together on uncovering various secrets and artifacts across the island.\nTabard.\nThe Reliquary tabard (featured in the box to the right) is reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Tabard\"&gt;Silvermoon City Tabard&lt;/a&gt;, albeit lacking the phoenix. In its place is a blue-and-gold design (presumably representing an artifact of sorts) and two cupped hands on either side of it. Though currently unavailable to players, the Reliquary tabard is seen on numerous NPCs in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\"; even individuals belonging to other groups (such as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;) have been seen to sport the Reliquary's colors during their tenure in its service.\nMembership.\nAs the name suggests, the Reliquary represents a very different side of the elves, one perhaps more in tune with (but still strikingly different to) the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;. In place of &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;wondrous displays of arcane mastery&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;dedicated knights in plate and mail&lt;/a&gt;, the Reliquary is, at a glance, a somewhat more mundane line of work: the art of the dig is certainly not a glamorous endeavor, yet still attracts a diverse variety of members. Nonetheless, when particularly formidable danger is involved, the Reliquary has members of both the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; on hand to ensure their work proceeds smoothly -- the former to ensure the deciphering and probing of ancient texts (as seen in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ogudei\"&gt;Ruins of Ogudei&lt;/a&gt;; and later, the &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;grand magister himself&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; were called in to this end) comes along quickly and efficiently, while the latter occasionally serve as guards.\nIn addition, the Reliquary employs scouts, outrunners and -- inevitably -- &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Making use of the wider &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the more physically powerful of the blood elves' allies have also been put to good use by the Reliquary.\nThe Horde's &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; trainers are also members of the Reliquary.\nGoals.\nTae'thelan's stated goals for the Reliquary culminate in a desire to free his people of their magical addiction for good, by using powerful magical artifacts through controlled methods. Though the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; is restored, in essence, it is not a \"cure\" for magical addiction -- but a constant source of power to keep it in check, as it was since the founding of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. To truly conquer the elves' addiction to magic (as both Tae'thelan and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; have gone on record as stating), the elves must conquer the addiction itself as their Sunwell sustains them on this quest.\nThe Reliquary's more immediate goals are to amass a vast amount of magical artifacts, wealth and lore, so as to ensure it cannot be used against them.\nThe Reliquary also owns a physical vault (named the Grand Vault), though its location is a closely-guarded secret which only the highest-ranking members of the organization are privy to.

This boss is a figure with three faces, representing the Essences of Anger, Desire, and Suffering respectively. The three have to be defeated one after the other. They all are &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt;s, each with a different twist. It appears that it is some kind of soul vacuum.\nOverview.\nThe Reliquary of Souls manifests three different Essences over the course of the encounter, each of which applies unique effects that must be handled differently. First, the Essence of Suffering always strikes the nearest player and afflicts the raid with Essence of Suffering. Second, the Essence of Desire afflicts the raid with Essence of Desire. Finally, players must defeat the Essence of Anger which afflicts the raid with Essence of Anger.\nPreparation.\nRaid composition:\nRunning the Gauntlet.\nIn the corridor leading to the boss, mobs are on a 15 sec &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; timer, so the raid has to run through it fast. There is no safe place between the trash mobs and the boss. The raid must stay close together at all times. No totems must be dropped (else they aggro respawns). The raid should stop and &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; after one third of the distance, a second time after two thirds, and the last time on top of the ramp leading down to the boss. When nuking, AoE capable classes should do AoE, and point damage dealers should concentrate on the red ghosts first, these are the most dangerous type. It's best to continue moving after all red ghosts are dead, and just keep the larger blue and purple ones tanked - these two types don't deal substantial amounts of damage.\nUpon reaching the top of the ramp, it's safest to wait for one repop of the last group, kill them, and then engage RoS fully rezzed, buffed and coordinated. The boss becomes active 15 seconds after the first person steps on the ramp.\nPhase 1: Essence of Suffering.\nThis phase is characterized by two things - healing is impossible, and aggro can be easily controlled. Beyond that, Soul Drain must be dispelled immediately.\nTank switching.\nSince no healing is possible, tanks must be rotated. To facilitate this EoS should move as little as possible. The red circle on the ground marks EoS' melee range. The current tank should stand in the center of EoS, only if a change is due the new tank moves into the current tank, and the current tank takes one step back. Tanks can usually stay for several fixates and should switch only after their health is low (~15%), or if an enrage is due.\nHigh block value is desirable for all players planning to tank in this phase.\nEnrage.\nBest suited for enrage tanking are rogues with &lt;a href=\"Evasion\"&gt;Evasion&lt;/a&gt; available (incidentally evasion and the enrage have exactly the same duration). With normal DPS, three enrages can be expected, thus three rogues should be pre-designated. They must step in and take a fixate as in the normal tank rotation, and hit evasion as soon as EoS enrages.\nThe rogue must not use &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; after the enrage is over, but rather hand over aggro as described above. If the current tank dies or somehow removes himself from the combat (e.g. with a paladin bubble), EoS switches to normal aggro mechanics (which is very bad).\nWith good dodge/parry gear, one rogue can tank a whole cycle (all non-enraged fixates plus one enrage).\nHealing.\nNormal healing cannot take place during this phase. The only abilities which help are &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Blessing of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pain%20Suppression\"&gt;Pain Suppression&lt;/a&gt;. Priests should spam PW:S freely, it's also a good idea to cast it on the enrage tank 15 sec before the enrage, so that the weakened soul debuff has worn off and a second shield can be cast during enrage. The safest method to deal with Soul Drain is to have two priests hit &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; every time it happens.\nAlternate tanking rotation.\nThe whole raid (except the three rogues) stand on the boss. When a player gets fixated, he moves outside the group (but not far, so that the boss doesn't move), thus another player gets fixated next. When an enrage is near, everyone moves out from under the boss except the current fixated person and a rogue moves in. The raid moves back in when less than five seconds of enrage remain, so that the next fixate after the enrage is taken by somebody else again.\nGhost interphase.\nAfter EoS is defeated, it goes back into the Reliquary. At that point, several ghosts spawn and head towards the raid. To maximize the health and mana gain, the raid should all stand on one spot. It's a good idea to use mana intensive abilities (such as making mana gems or summoning new demons) at the beginning of the ghost phase so that the players can start the next phase with full mana.\nPhase 2: Essence of Desire.\nThis phase is all about spell steal/interrupt/reflect, beyond healing through the massive damage the raid deals to itself (from the aura). Since EoD deals only low amounts of melee damage, rage generation can be a problem. Therefore the tank should not use abilities like Demo Shout or Thunderclap. Warlocks should keep &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Tongues\"&gt;Curse of Tongues&lt;/a&gt; up, and a rogue should use &lt;a href=\"Numbing%20Poison\"&gt;Numbing Poison&lt;/a&gt;. Paladins in caster groups should use &lt;a href=\"Concentration%20Aura\"&gt;Concentration Aura&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, put &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shield\"&gt;Earth Shield&lt;/a&gt; on casters to reduce spell interruption by damage.\nHealing.\nThis phase is very healing intensive. Since all damage dealers take 50% of their damage done, raid healers are very busy. Particularly after a spell reflected Deaden is up, damage dealers must be careful not to kill themselves.\nGhost interphase.\nOnce Essence of Desire returns to the Reliquary, the ghosts appear once more and refill the raid's mana and health.\nPhase 3: Essence of Anger.\nThe initial Seethe buff on the boss can be removed with &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Slam\"&gt;Shield Slam&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid further Seethes, the tank must never lose aggro. Nonetheless, all raid members initially have the Seethe debuff and must therefore be very careful not to draw aggro.\nTanking.\nSince the tank is regularly affected by Soul Scream, and the damage by rage burn is higher than that from mana burn, a paladin tank is a good alternative to a warrior tank in this phase.\nEoA should be tanked facing away from the raid. Threat generation is crucial. The tanks must spam all his abilities to keep rage (or mana) low. If a Soul Scream is near and a warrior tank has excess rage, he must stance dance to reduce the rage, even though this hurts aggro buildup.\nDPS.\nDamage dealers must be very careful while they have the Seethe debuff. After the second scream (at about 20 seconds), everybody should use all DPS cooldowns (and &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;), Hunters should use &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt;, and everybody should go all-out (still trying not to draw aggro).\nHealing.\nAbout two healers should be on the tank, and four (preferably shamans and/or priests) on the raid. While the Aura damage is low, healers may even DPS a little if they have excess mana. Players afflicted by Spite must be topped up before they take the nature damage, and then immediately topped up again before the Aura kills them.\nAlternate Strategy.\nThe seethe (de)buff increases aggro generation by 200% for 10 seconds. If an off-tank initially pulls EoA and the main tank &lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt;s after 1\u20132 seconds, the MTs aggro generation is increased substantially. As in the normal scenario, the raid must be very careful at start, but can start all-out DPS a little earlier (at about 12\u201315 seconds).\nSoloing.\nThe most dangerous phase by far is the Essence of Desire (phase 2) as going all-out on DPS can and will lead to the player killing himself. Any pets available should be allowed to do as much damage as possible, while the player eases back some on DPS and uses any damage-mitigating or healing abilities to prevent a self-kill. It is a somewhat-tricky balance between doing enough damage to win the DPS race but not so much as to kill oneself.\nSpeculation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; and used a device to siphon the souls of dead &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; there in order to power a massive portal to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. While the Reliquary of Souls is never mentioned to play a role in Illidan's plan, it may have had something to do with it given the shared nature of souls.\nSee also.\nTCG cards:"}

He alongside other agents of the SI:7 were tasked to travel south and find the White Pawn. Flying on the board of the Skyfire, the army was attacked by Horde ships.\nAs Alliance champions make a foothold on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance adventurers first see a glimpse of the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Right%20Tool%20For%20The%20Job\"&gt;The Right Tool For The Job&lt;/a&gt;, during which Rell is temporarily affected by it. &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; cleansed him of the sha before it overtook him and explained a little of what the sha is. Taran Zhu warned Rell to be careful of what emotions he's emits in Pandaria. Rell then directs the player to &lt;a href=\"Paw%27don%20Village\"&gt;Paw'don Village&lt;/a&gt; where he hopes to establish diplomatic ties with the natives and establish a secure location to tend to their wounded.\nFurther into the Jade Forest, he found &lt;a href=\"Ga%27trul\"&gt;Ga'trul&lt;/a&gt; and orders Alliance adventurers to take him out. During the fight, they bore witness to how the orc succumbed to the sha. Taran Zhu and Rell arrive shortly after the battle and explained in thorough detail about the sha and how they thrive on negative emotions. Rell stated that the Horde would seek to conquer Pandaria and urged the pandaren to join them in their quest to repel them. Taran Zhu declines, wishing to remain out of their war. Taran Zhu states that the war will have drastic ramifications in Pandaria and warns them to not bring their war to these shores.\nAccompanied by Mishka and Sully, the trio followed Admiral Taylor to &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Village\"&gt;Pearlfin Village&lt;/a&gt;. He began working to befriend &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Jinyu\"&gt;Pearlfin Jinyu&lt;/a&gt; and when Taylor was recovered, he was sent out into the wilderness with Sully and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Lu\"&gt;Little Lu&lt;/a&gt; to find Anduin.\nHe found a plane and Agent &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; in it. His team defended her from the attacking &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hozen\"&gt;Forest Hozen&lt;/a&gt;. After this, his team set up a camp near Serpent's Spine and everyone went to scout or prepare a camp. He was critically injured in a one-sided battle against superior numbers of Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; in . He survived though and the team continued to the north - to the Lair of the Jade Witch and near the Grookin Hill. Subsequently they returned to Pearlfin Village. It is unknown if immediate &lt;a href=\"first%20aid\"&gt;first aid&lt;/a&gt; could have helped him, but by the time his team brought him back to &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Village\"&gt;Pearlfin Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mishka\"&gt;Mishka&lt;/a&gt; explained that he was dying; he did not have much time left and all she could do was to make him more comfortable, while &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; expressed frustration with their helplessness.\nApparently recovered, he is seen in &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Tournament\"&gt;Celestial Tournament&lt;/a&gt; along with his comrades.\nFate.\nHe was not seen since &lt;a href=\"Get%20Back%20Here%21%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Get Back Here!

In &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor\"&gt;Admiral Taylor&lt;/a&gt; tells adventurers that \"we lost some good people\" without mentioning any specific names. Though he was presumed deceased, it was later revealed by &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; that Rell actually survived the war.

The goal is usually to kill an enemy faction leader. On even servers, city raids can be hard to perform, as the defenders of the capital usually outnumber the raid group.\nRaiding the Alliance.\nThe Alliance has four capital cities: &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Exodar\"&gt;The Exodar&lt;/a&gt;. The most populated ones are Stormwind and Ironforge, while Darnassus and the Exodar contain few to no players at all.\nRaiding Stormwind City.\nStormwind is the capital of the Humans. Stormwind is one of the harder cities to raid. To get to King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; you have to go through the Valley of Heroes which contains a lot of guards, and the Trade District where the majority of players is located. You will most likely face tough resistance from the Alliance here. There is an alternative way into Stormwind, the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;. The Deeprun Tram is almost always used after raiding Stormwind or Ironforge. Stormwind Keep is very close from the Tram, so this is a good way to get in. There are areas of Stormwind that contain no guards, for example the catacombs under the Cathedral of Light. A raid can easily be summoned there to attack the city from behind.\nRaiding Ironforge.\nIronforge is the capital of the Dwarves and Gnomes. Ironforge is usually considered the main capital of the Alliance, which means that a lot of players is there. The only way into the mountain is on a long ledge full of guards which leads to the gates. Just inside you will find the square where everyone is. You will probably be attacked here. From here there are two ways to King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, left and right. Get through, and the king's fortress is on the south side of the Great Forge. You can come through the Deeprun Tram, but it is a lot closer to the main square than it is in Stormwind. There are small unpopulated houses spread out in Ironforge where raids can be summoned.\nRaiding Darnassus.\nDarnassus is the capital of the Night Elves. Darnassus is a rather easy city to raid. The only way into Darnassus is through a portal in Rut'theran Village on the coast of Teldrassil. The only way there is with a boat from Auberdine, Darkshore. You will be teleported to almost the center of the city. From there, get to the Temple of the Moon in the south. After a couple of stairs you will find &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Darnassus is a very unpopulated city because it's very far away from the main cities Ironforge and Stormwind. You will face little to no opposition.\nRaiding the Exodar.\nThe Exodar is the capital of the Draenei. The Exodar is also a very easy city to raid. To get there, you must get on a boat in Auberdine, Darkshore. It will take you almost directly outside one of the two entrances. Get down and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; is just in the other side of the room. There is an another entrance, the main entrance. This one is almost never used because there are more guards there, and it's a longer way to Velen. The Exodar is most likely the most underpopulated city of the Alliance. An Exodar raid goes very smooth.\nRaiding the Horde.\nThe Horde has four capital cities: &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. Orgrimmar is the main capital and is heavily populated. There are usually a lot of people in Thunder Bluff and Undercity as well, while Silvermoon is very underpopulated.\nRaiding Orgrimmar.\nOrgrimmar is the capital of the Orcs and Trolls. Orgrimmar is the main capital of the Horde, and is very hard to raid. There are two ways in. The first is the main gates. There are usually a lot of players outside, dueling each other, and the people waiting for the zeppelins in the two towers. If you enter this way, you will find yourself in the Valley of Strength. There are always a lot of people here doing their buisness. From there you will have to go through the Drag until you finally come to Grommash Hold where &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; are located. The other entrance is the western entrance, the &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Gate\"&gt;Talon Gate&lt;/a&gt;. This entrance is almost unknown by many, and not many players hang around there. All Horde players who use portals will end up in the Valley of Spirits however. Be aware of them. From the Valley of Spirits, run on the ledge past the Cleft of Shadows. You will them reach Grommash Hold. Not many places empty of guards are known.\nRaiding Thunder Bluff.\nThunder Bluff is the capital of the Tauren. Thunder Bluff is the second most populated Horde capital. Thunder Bluff is somewhat unique, as the entire city is located on four high mesas. Don't fall down, you will fall to a nasty death. There are two ways inside, two pairs of elevators. The first pair is located on the end of the road to Thunder Bluff. When you come up you will be directly on the main Square where the Horde players here will do their business. Run straight across the square and into the large totem pole tower in the center of the mesa. Run up the tower and into the first exit. On the other side of this square is the tent of &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. The other way in is the other pair of elevators, located on the other side of the center mesa. Go up the elevator and into the tower again. Go out on the square where Cairne has his tent. Beware of druids when in Thunder Bluff. If they have Typhoon then can knock you off, sending you to a long fall.\nRaiding Undercity.\nUndercity is the capital of the Forsaken. Undercity is a bit underpopulated, but not by much. It is located under the Ruins of Lordaeron. The Ruins themselves contain no guards, but players will most likely run past. There are two ways down. One is the main entrance, which is a couple of elevators beneath the Throne Room. These will take you to the Trade Quarter. A lot of guards and NPCs are located here. Run down to the lowest level of the Quarter and get to the Apothecarium. In the middle is the way to the Royal Quarter. The way down is long and there are two elite guards next to every opening. When you finally get down, you will see &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and (possibly) &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. The other way in is the sewers. The entrance is on the western mountainside in the Tirisfal Glades. Hordes will most likely fly over your heads, as the people flying to and from Undercity will go through the Sewers. A bit down you will find a couple of guards and a hole that leads straight into the Undercity. Jump down and you will find yourself in the War Quarter. Go south to the Apothecarium and down to Sylvanas.\nRaiding Silvermoon City.\nSilvermoon is the capital of the Blood Elves. Silvermoon is a very easy raid, but also the largest Horde city. The city is somewhat remote and not many Hordes go there. There is only one way in, the main gates. You will find yourself in the Walk of Elders. Run up the western way to the Murder Row and then northwest to the Court of the Sun and the Sunfury Spire which contains &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;. Horde players who use the Orb of Translocation in Undercity will appear behind the Blood Elf leaders. Have an eye fixed on the Orb."}

They usually contain &lt;a href=\"clam%20Meat\"&gt;clam meat&lt;/a&gt; which can be used for &lt;a href=\"Cooking\"&gt;Cooking&lt;/a&gt; and rarely a &lt;a href=\"Pearl\"&gt;Pearl&lt;/a&gt; which can be used in several &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Clam\"&gt;Giant clams&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the sea floor and opened for their items.\nContainer Clams.\nThese clams can be collected in your inventory, and generally stack up to 20 clams per slot. Unlike other objects that can be opened, opening a clam counts as an action and might interrupt certain channeling abilities. Clams that contain pearls will also provide clam meat. If there is insufficient inventory space for the contents of the clam (both the meat and the pearl, if there is one), the clam will simply remain in your inventory and the opening will \"fail.\" Note that the contents of the clam are determined when \"successfully\" opening it. This unusual system is a result of a patch changing clams from regular containers, which could be opened and looted as normal, but could not stack with each-other, generally making looting a clam an annoying hassle.\nExample: You have 0 empty inventory spaces. One stack in your bag contains clams, another stack has less than 20 of the type of clam meat typically found in those clams. If you continue to open clams you are likely to encounter a clam that fails to open despite the stack of clam meat being less than 20; this indicates the clam would have produced a pearl. Attempting to open the same clam again, even with cleared out inventory space is likely to simply produce clam meat and not the pearl it otherwise would have. Thus it is important to have free inventory slots when opening clams if you plan to sell any pearls that happen to drop.\nYou cannot \"guarantee\" pearls by filling your inventory slots and leaving stacks of pearls of less than 20 in your bag without stacks of clam meat of less than 20. Doing so will produce a failed opening attempt every time because even when a pearl would drop, there would be insufficient room for the clam meat."}

{"id": "15299", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15299", "title": "Clan", "text": "The old orcish Horde, dwarves, and other races are separated into many clans. What defines a clan, and how one is started, is largely up to interpretation. The term clan is sometimes used interchangeably with the term &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;. The RPG describes the organization of murloc clans as being larger than murloc tribes.\nCentaur tribes/clans.\nClan and tribe appear to be interchangeable terms when referring to centaurs groups. Centaur clans are led by khans.\nDwarven clan system.\nDwarves count their blood connections in many ways. The most prominent of ties is the clan. The main dwarven clans are the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;. Each of them have smaller clans, like &lt;a href=\"Rom\"&gt;Rom&lt;/a&gt;'s clan, the clans of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20clan\"&gt;Shadowforge clan&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nEach main clan is ruled by a thane.\nDwarven culture is made up by a clan-like caste system. The original clan that evolved from the earthen was known as the Ironforge clan. It later split into the three main Clans known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; (Ruled by line of &lt;a href=\"Thaurissan%20family\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;), Ironforge clan (ruled by members of the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; (ruled by line of Wildhammers), but many lesser clans exist as well.\nFamily names often indicate clan names as well and are the lesser clans within one of the three main dwarven cultures. Some family names are names of honor earned through some feat, which replace the family's true name. For example, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Dragonreaver\"&gt;Falstad Dragonreaver&lt;/a&gt;'s real name is Falstad Wildhammer. In which case the new name may be passed on to their descendants or not, depending on the choice of the individual. Another example are some of the members of the \"Thunderaxe\" family who joined the Dark Iron clan during the War of the Three Hammers, taking on the name \"Pikesplitter\".\nMogu clans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", also have a clan-based system.\nMurloc clan.\n&lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s congregate in &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s and villages, but the &lt;a href=\"Squigglefin%20tribe\"&gt;Squigglefin tribe&lt;/a&gt; is also referred to as a clan.\nA murloc clan is organized from multiple &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s in an area. Each tribe to its own village of usually six to twelve individuals. Every so often a clan meets to discuss issues of importance. However, keeping a large group of murlocs coordinated and in agreement for any significant length of time is difficult.\nOrcish clan system.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s originally lived an hidden, underground life on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in fear of the ruling &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s rebelled against them and overthrew their order, the hierarchy of survival on Draenor was dramatically altered and the two greatest threats to &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;'s orcs were eliminated. By the time of 800 years before the Dark Portal, the orcs, no longer confined to their underground caverns, began forging permanent settlements on Draenor's surface for the first time in generations. The orc population exploded, and overpopulation and lack of prey to hunt became a serious issue. Tensions between families simmered, but before war erupted many orcs migrated out of Gorgrond in search of new land to settle. Those who remained in Gorgrond formed the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%27s%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Lightning's Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; clans. Those who migrated east found themselves drawn to &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, where they adopted a savage, superstitious mindset. Those who kept their sanity became the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, while those who lost themselves to dark impulses were exiled and over time formed another, smaller clan known as the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewers&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs who journeyed west of Gorgrond settled in the icy &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaws&lt;/a&gt; learned to adapt to the environment, while the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; instead sought to dominate the land. In the south, three clans settled in the mountains and plains of fertile &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redwalker%20clan\"&gt;Redwalkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20clan\"&gt;Bladewinds&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; migrated farther southwest and roamed the plains of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, while to the southeast the peaceful &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; formed in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese new orcish clans gradually isolated themselves from each other, only meeting up on special occasions like the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festivals. This is what kept peace between them, but also at a cost: individual friendship between orcs of different clans became gradually seen as an anomaly, something almost impossible, like friendship between a &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt;. The clans were content ruling their own huge swaths of lands, including much of Draenor, somewhat similar to a human nation.\nMany of these ancestral clans united in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; and invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of their new &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic masters. New clans arose after the throes of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;. After the orcs' defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; took most of them to prison, with the Horde's unity shattered.\nWhen Thrall brought about the new Horde, the clan system was largely abolished. Although many orcs still proudly carry the name of their clan, the clans themselves are all united under the banner of one Horde. The orc &lt;a href=\"Urtrun%20Clanbringer\"&gt;Urtrun Clanbringer&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"guild%20master\"&gt;guild master&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and describes many clans fighting beneath the banner of the warchief. When a new &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; is created, the guild master there refers to it as adding a new clan to the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; itself is said to be home to many of the orc clans of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;; and orc &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s are said to belong to a clan. The Warsong, Frostwolf, Blackrock, Shattered Hand, Twilight's Hammer and Dragonmaw clans all retain some individualism, with some of them even evolving greatly over time and now accepting members of other races. The Shattered Hand clan is now more of a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s guild, while the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and Burning Blade clans are now global doomsday cults. The recent &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival let many clanless orcs join back the traditions of their ancestors.\nOrc clan leaders are referred to as chieftains, while the leader of all clans is called a warchief. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; used to be the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The chieftain is usually the strongest member of the clan and, according to the old orcish hierarchy, to become one you must first fight the old chieftain to the death. Alternatively, you can inherit the status of chieftain.\nThere has been mentions of orcs being able to change from one clan to another. In ', &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; was said to have risen to power through the Thunderlord clan before joining with the Blackrocks, even thought that isn't canon anymore. &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; was a Frostwolf before ending up as chieftain of the Thunderlords. &lt;a href=\"Mankrik\"&gt;Mankrik&lt;/a&gt; might have been a Frostwolf child before &lt;a href=\"Mankrik%23Clan\"&gt;ending up&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; of the Burning Blade. &lt;a href=\"Jubei%27Thos\"&gt;Jubei'Thos&lt;/a&gt; was seemingly a Burning Blade before joining the Blackrocks.\nOrc clans.\nMain clans:\nOther clans:\nUnnamed clans:\nClans of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;:\nOther clans:\nOgre tribes/clans.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; society is based on a clan structure, each clan acting independently of the others. Some ogre groups however, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ango%27rosh%20tribe\"&gt;Ango'rosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; are also called tribes.\nVrykul Clans.\nThe vrykul are also organized into clans:\nPandaren clans.\nThe initial development of Pandaria's pandaren had them divided into their own clans, also known as &lt;a href=\"Shao%27din\"&gt;Shao'din&lt;/a&gt;. The concept didn't make it into the game."}

They are the newest clan to rise to power and maintains the largest standing military force. Led by &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt;, the Nokhud have allied with the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; and turned against the rest of the Maruuk. Their seat of power is &lt;a href=\"Nokhudon%20Hold\"&gt;Nokhudon Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Nokhud came to power one generation before the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Jhakan%20Khan\"&gt;Jhakan Khan&lt;/a&gt; raised a mighty army and defeated &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Toghus\"&gt;Clan Toghus&lt;/a&gt;, taking over their territory and their position as one of the four strongest Maruuk clans. Jhakan was well-respected by the other clans, but was eventually killed by his son &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar&lt;/a&gt;, who took control of the Nokhud and led them to become more insular.\nShortly after the reawakening of the Isles, a &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; army led by &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to reach the dragons' portal to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons repelled them, and the Primalists knew they needed the aid of the centaur to defeat the dragons. Koroleth easily recruited Balakar Khan and convinced him and the Nokhud to start using forbidden storm magic. Balakar believed that his clan deserved the storm's power, with which they would \"show the Maruuk how far they have fallen\". During the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt;, Balakar's &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; advisor, &lt;a href=\"Windsage%20Garuman\"&gt;Windsage Garuman&lt;/a&gt;, tried to protest against this. Balakar responded by killing him. The green dragons sent an emissary, &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt;, to the Khural to ask &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; to uphold her ancestors' pact with the dragons and aid them against the Primalists. Sarest agreed to do so, but the meeting was disrupted by Balakar, who accused Sarest of dishonoring &lt;a href=\"Maruuk\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt;'s memory by surrendering the centaur's lands to outsiders and sending centaur to die for the dragons' sake. He then killed Gemisath with storm magic, and the Nokhud attacked the other clans in an attempt to take control of Maruukai. Balakar himself escaped from the city and left &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Bahir\"&gt;Guard Bahir&lt;/a&gt; in charge. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who had come to the plains to make contact with the dragons helped the Ohn'ir, &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Shikaar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"khansguard\"&gt;khansguard&lt;/a&gt; defeat the traitors. While Balakar marshalled his army to conquer the entirety of the plains, Sarest and her allies prepared their own forces and set about finding &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; so that Sarest could blow the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; and ally with the green dragons.\nThe Nokhud and their Primalist allies had planned for this. In order to cripple Clan Ohn'ir, they lured the mystics into an ambush at &lt;a href=\"Ridgewater%20Retreat\"&gt;Ridgewater Retreat&lt;/a&gt; with a false summons from &lt;a href=\"Tigari%20Khan\"&gt;Tigari Khan&lt;/a&gt;. Once the mystics arrived, the Nokhud attacked them alongside the Primalist &lt;a href=\"Shela%20the%20Windbinder\"&gt;Shela the Windbinder&lt;/a&gt;. Only a few Ohn'ir survived and managed to escape. The Nokhud and Shela collected the mystics' totems (which were infused with Ohn'ahra's wind magic), and captured the Children of Ohn'ahra (sacred &lt;a href=\"ohuna\"&gt;ohuna&lt;/a&gt;) who appeared to collect the souls of the dead mystics. Other Nokhud and the rest of the Primalists took control of &lt;a href=\"Windsong%20Rise\"&gt;Windsong Rise&lt;/a&gt; and shrouded it in an unnatural storm, with the Primalists teaching the Nokhud to create storm elementals in the process (with varying degrees of success). The Primalists used the mystic totems the Nokhud had collected to capture more Children of Ohn'ahra. They then stole the magic from the birds, corrupted it with storm sorcery, and infused it into bolts for their new &lt;a href=\"dragonkiller%20ballista\"&gt;dragonkiller ballista&lt;/a&gt; weapons, which they loaded into wagons for transport. Ohn'ahra sensed that her children were in danger and arrived in person, allowing Koroleth to capture her with storm magic. Meanwhile, other Nokhud started ambushing &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Teerai&lt;/a&gt; scouts near &lt;a href=\"Teerakai\"&gt;Teerakai&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventurers helped Tigari Khan and the Ohn'ir to fight the Nokhud at Ridgewater Retreat before accompanying &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Boku\"&gt;Initiate Boku&lt;/a&gt; to Windsong Rise. They freed some of the Children of Ohn'ahra and destroyed the wagons with ballista bolts, but were unable to save Ohn'ahra from Koroleth.\nCulture.\nThe Nokhud prefer brute strength and power over all else. They prefer fighting over talking and practice a battle ritual called the &lt;a href=\"tabarr\"&gt;tabarr&lt;/a&gt;, which they claim hardens them and has allowed them to eliminate weakness from their clan. According to &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tomul\"&gt;Scout Tomul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt;, the Nokhud romanticize war stories of the Maruuk's ancient past, but are in reality only \"weak, playacting children\". The clan is united by a hatred against all outsiders, and they are not known for their mercy. Even before their betrayal, they tended to antagonize the other clans during each &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt;. Due to how recently they've come to power, some non-Nokhud consider them to be \"violent upstarts\"."}

It consists of mystics who feel a special connection their god, &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, and serve as spiritual advisors to the other clans. Their &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Tigari%20Khan\"&gt;Tigari Khan&lt;/a&gt; and their main seat of power is the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27iri%20Springs\"&gt;Ohn'iri Springs&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nUnlike the other Maruuk clans, Clan Ohn'ir is not made up of families, but instead of centaur from across the plains who have an innate connection to &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; of the Wind. Foals who show signs of such a connection leave their clans of birth behind to join the Ohn'ir and spend the rest of their lives honing that connection. There are three different ranks available to members of the clan: initiate, windsage, and finally Ohn, the highest rank below the &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually receive assignments to different parts of the Ohn'ahran Plains, doing everything from maintaining &lt;a href=\"singing%20stone\"&gt;singing stone&lt;/a&gt;s to advising the khans of other clans. Assignments are not permanent: with time, they return to the Ohn'ir and another takes their place. Individual wishes are taken into account for assignments: mystics who want to see the world might get assigned to other clans, while those who prefer to stay close to home may get assigned back to their clan of birth.\nOhn'ahra does not speak in language, but instead through the winds themselves. The Ohn'ir are trained to feel her presence and interpret her songs to advise the rest of their people. When they hear Ohn'ahra calling to them, the mystics use reagents to bind totems to that particular call, allowing them to perform a ritual to center the Windmother's voice and interpret her message. The Ohn'ir cultivate flowers called &lt;a href=\"sweetsuckle\"&gt;sweetsuckle&lt;/a&gt;s and use them to create a type of incense that elicits a trancelike effect and is used to deepen their connection to omens from Ohn'ahra. In addition to totems infused with Ohn'ahra's wind magic, the Ohn'ir carry talismans and carve wind chimes to allow others to hear Ohn'ahra's presence.\nWhen an Ohn'ir mystic dies, if they are considered worthy, a sacred &lt;a href=\"ohuna\"&gt;ohuna&lt;/a&gt; known as a Child of Ohn'ahra carries their spirit to &lt;a href=\"Windsong%20Rise\"&gt;Windsong Rise&lt;/a&gt;, were they may become one with the wind and sky.\nThe Ohn'ir do not look kindly on storm magic."}

They specialize in honing their skills and hunting game across the plains, and are led by &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; reawakened, the Shikaar were preparing to assemble with the other clans at the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt;. The last Shikaar caravan to travel to the city was the one from &lt;a href=\"Timberstep%20Outpost\"&gt;Timberstep Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, which included &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt; herself. The outpost was being harassed by the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Mudfin%20tribe\"&gt;Mudfin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt;s, who raided the Shikaar's supplies and dognapped their &lt;a href=\"bakar\"&gt;bakar&lt;/a&gt; companions. The &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt; approached Sansok and tried to recruit her, but the khan refused. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s came to the Ohn'ahran Plains to make contact with the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. They encountered the Shikaar &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tomul\"&gt;Scout Tomul&lt;/a&gt;, who made the outsiders prove themselves by helping a Shikaar hunting party kill a &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Proto-Dragon\"&gt;Blazing Proto-Dragon&lt;/a&gt; before bringing them to Timberstep Outpost and introducing them to Sansok. The khan agreed to let the adventurers come along on the journey to Maruukai if they lent their aid to the clan, whose members were initially wary of the outsiders.\nThe adventurers helped the two Shikaar &lt;a href=\"Farrier%20Roscha\"&gt;Farrier Roscha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khasar\"&gt;Khasar&lt;/a&gt; deal with the Mudfin gorlocs by retrieving the stolen supplies, rescuing the missing bakar, and killing the gorlocs' leader, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Grrlgllmesh\"&gt;Chief Grrlgllmesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe outsiders accompanied the caravan from Timberstep Outpost to Maruukai, sharing stories and helping them hunt meat for the Khural on the way. On arrival in Maruukai, Sansok sent the outsiders to acquaint themselves with the other major clans before the green dragonflight's emissary &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the Khural. &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; promised to aid the green flight against the Primalists, but the gathering was disrupted when &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; revealed that they had allied with the Primalists and attacked the other clans. The Shikaar's hunters fought alongside the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; mystics and the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Teerai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"khansguard\"&gt;khansguard&lt;/a&gt; to defend the city from the Nokhud, after which the Khanam Matra told Sansok and &lt;a href=\"Tigari%20Khan\"&gt;Tigari Khan&lt;/a&gt; to prepare their clans to go to war against the traitors.\nCulture.\nThe Shikaar are the strongest &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s of the Maruuk. Their camps are spread throughout the Ohn'ahran Plains, following the patterns of wildlife and game. They are less concerned with tradition than &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Clan Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; and instead pride themselves on mastery in their own crafts. They enjoy telling stories of their kills. After completing their first hint, young Shikaar hunters are gifted with a ceremonial spear. The Shikaar's hunters traditionally provide meat for all of the shared meals at the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; by hunting game on their way to Maruukai. The Shikaar wear medallions which are adorned with the clan's symbol and can be crafted from leather obtained during their first hunt. When they join &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; in the sky (i.e. when they die), they leave the medallions behind.\nThe Shikaar keep herds of domesticated &lt;a href=\"argali\"&gt;argali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"musken\"&gt;musken&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=\"bakar\"&gt;bakar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ohuna\"&gt;ohuna&lt;/a&gt; as hunting companions and herding animals. The bakar serve as the Shikaar's fellow hunters, guards, and best friends, and each one holds a special place in the clan. The Shikaar give their bakar collars, which can be adorned with the dogs' puppy teeth and bone ornaments from their first hunt. On the other hand, the ohuna's relationship to the clan is transient since the birds do not answer to the centaur, but to the sky. Each spring, an ohuna chooses a new hunter to accompany, and each winter they return to their kin. The Shikaar consider it an honor to hunt alongside them.\nIf an outsider wants to impress the Shikaar, they must prove their worth by showing their hunting skills. Doing so earns them a place at the clan's campfire.\nMost Shikaar know sign language and can therefore talk directly to their deaf leader &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt;, but there are still many who cannot and require the help of Sansok's interpreter &lt;a href=\"Okir\"&gt;Okir&lt;/a&gt;.\nShikaar hunters can also be found in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hunt\"&gt;Grand Hunt&lt;/a&gt;s."}

It was formerly one of the four major centaur clans, before they were usurped by Clan Nokhud.\nHolding major power in the plains, they were an extremely resourceful people, consisting of skilled gatherers, trackers, and animal trainers. The raw materials they gathered were highly desired by crafters from the other clans, and their animals helped them in many endeavors. They were also known for their food. They were based out of &lt;a href=\"Toghusuq%20Village\"&gt;Toghusuq Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne generation before the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jhakan%20Khan\"&gt;Jhakan Khan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; raised a mighty army and defeated the Toghus, taking over their territory and their position as one of the four strongest Maruuk clans. The Toghus were not fighters, and their last &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faraqseng%20Khan\"&gt;Faraqseng&lt;/a&gt;, incorrectly assumed that their prestige would be enough to protect them from Jhakan's ambitions. He hoped that the remaining Toghus would settle into new lives.\nSome of the Toghus survived and went on to form the village of &lt;a href=\"Daruukhan\"&gt;Daruukhan&lt;/a&gt;, a village of craftsmen; though this village too was destroyed when the Nokhud allied with the Primalists. The surviving members of the clan were aided by an adventurer and the kind bakar &lt;a href=\"Taivan\"&gt;Taivan&lt;/a&gt;; retreating back to Maruukai."}

A character's class determines the &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"power\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s they will gain throughout their adventures, and consequently the styles of play available to the character. It determines the types of &lt;a href=\"Equipment\"&gt;weapons and armor&lt;/a&gt; they can use, which &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; they will value (and how those attributes function), as well as what combat &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;s the character is suitable for. Class also reflects the background themes of a character: whether they have chosen to pursue the dark arts of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;; the bloody honor of the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; or the arcane knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nBe aware that the choice of which class to play is constrained by the choice of &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;: each race has a different group of available classes to choose from.\nEach class has three &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s, aside from druids and demon hunters (which have four and two specs, respectively). Each specialization represents a very different approach to playing the class, offering numerous new abilities and often changing the combat role the character is most suitable for. Each class can then be considered to have three (or four) major variants, each with its own skill-set, strengths and playing-style. \nCollecting &lt;a href=\"class%20set\"&gt;class set&lt;/a&gt;s is one way players can improve a character when they have reached the level cap. Most dungeon, raid and PvP sets are made up of armor items designed specifically for the class; however, faction rewards sets also include trinkets and neck pieces. When players collect more pieces of the set, they can receive set bonuses.\nSee also:\nSummary of each class.\nThere are currently twelve playable classes in-game, with a thirteenth class, the &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;, being added in .\n &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;Demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;\nClass races.\nChoice of class is limited by choice of &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, with certain classes only available to certain races. There are 213 combinations currently available on the &lt;a href=\"live\"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; realms. Dracthyr Evoker is now playable.

Set in special locations with a strong connection to the order, order halls only allow access to players of the corresponding class.\nFunctionality.\nOrder halls are in many ways \"Legion\"'s counterpart to \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\"'s &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;s. They serve as a secondary hub for players outside of the main capital of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and allow players to command a team of champions to undertake special missions. A key difference to garrisons is that the order halls are realm-wide and open to all characters of that class, including characters of both factions. Players come here to upgrade their &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s, and to access special quests and missions.\nChampions.\nThe evolution of \"Warlords of Draenor\"'s &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; system, order halls feature class champions, who can be sent on missions. While on &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; the player was recruiting any who would join their cause, the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; also requires &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s of great power and especially capable champions. Players command a small force of these exceptional champions, including some fairly major lore characters such as &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Keeper Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. The system allows players to learn more about their champions' backstories as they fight together.\nAs with followers, players send their champions on missions, but these missions are more integrated into the rest of the game experience, unlocking content and enabling the player in related zones. For example, missions may open new areas for questing, or grant special buffs to the player while in certain zones. Players are intended to work alongside and with their champions, rather than competing with them for rewards.\nOrder Advancements.\nEach class hall has a system of advancements.\nArmor stands.\nOrder halls feature armor stands where the first ten tier sets are displayed once the player has collected all parts of the set's appearance. However, the set will only appear on the rack if all parts of the set are from lowest raid level, and are of the same specialization.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

This land is stirring with the reawakening of &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental energies&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago, the elements were present in their most primal, unfettered form; however, the resurgence of magic in the Dragon Isles has caused that energy to reawaken.\nGeography.\nGeysers and hot springs are commonplace, and powerful streams and rivers carve grottoes into the colorful rocks and sediment. Waterways feed into the land's heart and the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Life%20Pools\"&gt;Life Pools of the red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. While millennia ago this area was populated with dragon architecture like the rest of the Broodlands, most of those structures have long since fallen into decay and become overgrown.\nVolcanic areas are alive with molten earth and fire. As the elevation rises, the land becomes harsher. In these imposing mountains, Neltharus, the Obsidian Citadel was built by the black dragonflight so that the Earth-Warder could defend the Broodlands. Abandoned long ago, the imposing fortress has now been claimed by the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;."}

Players who enjoy exploration often utilize wall-walking to reach areas that are either unfinished or were developed as eye-candy. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; removed a popular form of wall-walking in patch 1.1, although variations of the technique are still usable.\nWall-walking was used to reach closed areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airfield\"&gt;Ironforge Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt;, and non-instanced versions of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.

They can be built in the vicinity of your buildings. \nWhile they are not very tough, Walls can delay enemy units for a few seconds, giving your ranged units more time to vanquish them. They are particularly good when combined with &lt;a href=\"Catapult%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Catapults&lt;/a&gt;, which can often score direct hits on the enemies while they're busy knocking down a Wall. They are also useful for stopping &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20%28Warcraft%20I%29%23Spells\"&gt;Invisible&lt;/a&gt; units sneaking into your town.\nDetails.\nWall HP is controlled by the map data. Each tile is 2 bytes (which is needed, anyway, since the forest, swamp and cave tilesets exceed 256) and the second value controls it's HP. Every unit in the game is given a \"Wall damage\" value to avoid accidentally bringing the wall down to 1 HP (thus replacing the tile with something else). The walls are given 2 sets of 160 HP: For their undamaged and damaged states. Reducing a wall's HP to 0 while undamaged will change the wall to a damaged state and give it another 160 HP. Reducing the 2nd stage to 0 HP results in the wall being replaced with a tile a unit can walk over, effectively destroying it.\nThe same damage set also applies to doors in the various caves and dungeons; the door tiles happen to use the same ID#s the cave and forest tilesets use. The key difference is doors have 0 HP, meaning a hit from any attack will (first) damage, then destroy a door tile."}

It was the winning candidate of the &lt;a href=\"Choose%20the%20Next%20Shadowlands%20Mount\"&gt;Choose the Next Shadowlands Mount&lt;/a&gt; community poll and was made available for free to all \"\" owners with the release of &lt;a href=\"Patch%209.0.5%23Items%20and%20Rewards\"&gt;patch 9.0.5&lt;/a&gt;.\nSource.\nStarting with the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.5\"&gt;patch 9.0.5&lt;/a&gt;, the Wandering Ancient is automatically added to the mount collection of all accounts with the \"\" expansion activated, including those who purchased \"Shadowlands\" at a later date.\nMount Journal.\n\"A staunch defender of the forests of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s are also known for their glorious canopies of leaves, which change color with the seasons.\"\nWebsite.\n\"Not all ancients are interested in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20Lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;, some just want to travel the world! This arboreal nomad has traveled to many places and with each passing season embraces change, both in scenery and in the foliage atop its branches.\"\nDevelopment.\nWhen it became clear that the Wandering Ancient had won the &lt;a href=\"Choose%20the%20Next%20Shadowlands%20Mount\"&gt;Choose the Next Shadowlands Mount&lt;/a&gt; poll, artist &lt;a href=\"Jon%20McConnell\"&gt;Jon McConnell&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with bringing the mount to life. The first step was to collect a reference board with concept art, images of past iterations of ancients, and fan art by the community. McConnell figured that if the team were to introduce a new type of rideable ancient, it should line up with the pantheon of past ancients, all of whom have looks that aesthetically fit their purpose. McConnell wanted the Wandering Ancient to feel like a natural growth or root system that a player might have come across and sat down on, only to then suddenly find themselves atop an uprooted creature.\nOnce the concept was finished and McConnell began modelling the mount, he ended up keeping a lot of the foliage from \"World of Warcraft\"'s original &lt;a href=\"ancient%20protector\"&gt;ancient protector&lt;/a&gt; model. Some other major parts of the mount had to be created from scratch, namely the main torso and head. The mount's animation rig was built by &lt;a href=\"Waleed%20Boghosian\"&gt;Waleed Boghosian&lt;/a&gt;, after which it was passed over to the animators, who used the animations of the the original ancient models as a foundation to build upon. A lot of animation work is based on the movement of animals in the real world, but in the case of fictional creatures that only exist in WoW, the animators like to film themselves for reference, which helps them get a feel for the mindset and personality of the creature. In the case of the Wandering Ancient's animations, animator &lt;a href=\"Corin%20McCrate\"&gt;Corin McCrate&lt;/a&gt; acted as the stand-in.\nThe mount's vocalizations were provided by longtime \"Warcraft\" composer &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Stafford\"&gt;Glenn Stafford&lt;/a&gt;, who has previously contributed his voice to previous iterations of ancients. The Wandering Ancient's voice was intended to match the fact that it's a little smaller, friendlier, and more inquisitive than others of its kind.\nThe mount features an easter egg in the form of a small caterpillar sticking out of the tree on the ancient's back, as a nod to the Curious Caterpillar, one of the mount concepts that did not win the poll. This idea was suggested by &lt;a href=\"Kelvin%20Tan\"&gt;Kelvin Tan&lt;/a&gt; and added by Jon McConnell."}

The various inhabitants of the Isle felt the change, and populations who usually kept to themselves such as the local Amberleaf &lt;a href=\"sprite\"&gt;sprite&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fe-Feng%20tribe\"&gt;Fe-Feng tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; understood something bad was coming, so they started giving trouble to the local &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, notably by stealing their supplies.\nSensing that something was abnormal, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Shang%20Xi\"&gt;Master Shang Xi&lt;/a&gt; gave his disciples the task to find and unite the four ancient &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirits&lt;/a&gt;, which would help the pandaren talk to Shen-zin Su, a feat not done in centuries.\nRealizing that the source of Shen-zin Su's pain was the \"Skyseeker\" Master Shang Xi's disciples headed into the forbidden &lt;a href=\"Pei-Wu%20Forest\"&gt;Pei-Wu Forest&lt;/a&gt;. There, the party helped triage members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as fend off the horrors from the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Deepscale%20tribe\"&gt;Deepscale saurok&lt;/a&gt;. With the immediate threat taken care of, &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; decided to blow up what was was left of the \"Skyseeker\". Shockingly, this plan actually worked, to a point.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Keletress\"&gt;Lady Keletress&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Peak%20of%20Serenity\"&gt;Peak of Serenity&lt;/a&gt;, the Wandering Isle happened to be traveling nearby. The monk &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; settled at the Wandering Isle, particularly around the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Five%20Dawns\"&gt;Temple of Five Dawns&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Keletress launched her last assault against the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, with her demonic army invading the back of the great turtle. However, with the power of the Storm Brew, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Grandmaster of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; managed to slay her and the demons were driven away by the monks.\nGeography.\nRegions adjacent to the Wandering Isle.\nOnce characters leave the Wandering Isle, they are ineligible for a return journey. Non-Pandaren are prevented from ever entering the Island, much like the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; were only part of the leveling experience of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s of all races later establish the Wandering Isle as their &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;Class Hall&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt;. This version of the Isle exists in a separate phase, not interfering with the pandaren starting experience. Notably, the &lt;a href=\"Wreck%20of%20the%20Skyseeker\"&gt;Wreck of the Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt; is absent from the new version of the map.\nQuests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle%20storyline\"&gt;Wandering Isle storyline&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; level 1-10 starting experience. Freshly-created pandaren start out \"neutral\", in their own instance. Once players reach the end of the chain, they will be forced to make a one-time-only decision as to which faction they wish to ally with, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

In challenge modes, players are tasked with trying to complete an existing 5-player dungeon as quickly and skillfully as possible. \nDepending on how well the group does, players will receive recognizable prestige rewards such as &lt;a href=\"mounts\"&gt;mounts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"titles\"&gt;titles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;, or special armor artwork that can be used with &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; to customize a character's appearance.

This title will persist for as long as a player retains the top time on the realm. Holding a realm-best time at any point will also confer a permanent &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt; to record the accomplishment.\nChallenge Modes exist in expansion-long seasons, reflecting challenges in completing current content with the abilities currently available to players. At the end of each season, the current Challenge Modes are removed, and associated &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s are converted into &lt;a href=\"Feats%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feats of Strength&lt;/a&gt;. Realm Best titles are removed, and replaced with another title appropriate to the expansion, such as \u00aba href=\"%3AMistwalker\"&gt;:Mistwalker&lt;/a\u00bb. Other rewards such as cosmetic armor sets, mounts and teleport spells remain in the possession of those who have earned them.\nChallenge Mode medal times and current guild and realm bests can be viewed through the Challenges interface, part of the &lt;a href=\"Group%20Finder\"&gt;Group Finder&lt;/a&gt;.

It is a hall with a portal to the sanctum of each &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. These sanctums were the place the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s went to lay their eggs and care for their young.\nAccording to a legend, some believe that it was in the chamber where the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s imbued the five Dragon Aspects. However, that actually occurred at &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIt was here that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; revealed the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, his solution to ending the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and urged the other Aspects as well as their respective flights to give up a portion of their essences to power it. Unknowing of his plan, they did so \u2014 and enslaved themselves to Neltharion's will.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\", the Chamber of Aspects was described as \"...a vast, monumental cavern, so expansive that even Alexstrasza appeared as little more than a gnat in comparison.\" The Chamber's walls were featureless and frictionless, smooth yet curved, the floor was an immense flat circle that was geometrically flawless, and it was lit by a golden illumination with no source. It was so big that Azeroth might have been constructed in it.\nPresumably, the Chamber of the Aspects was located somewhere in ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;; its exact location before and after the Sundering was unknown (Until \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\").\nLater information suggested that the chamber was accessible anywhere the Aspects chose, but was mostly done in the most remote of places, away from prying eyes. However, one trying to enter had to be flying, as &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; did.\nThe Chamber of Aspects underneath &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; is in fact the Chamber in which the Aspects met. The Chamber in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\" is not a completely different and more private place.\nAt least some dragons consider the location related to a dragon's afterlife.\nThe Sanctums' locations.\nSome players find it puzzling that the different sanctums are seemingly located outside, as you can see the sky, instead of below the ground under the Wyrmrest Temple.\nThe explanation for this is because each sanctum is a refuge out of time and space that are &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20dimension\"&gt;magical dimensions&lt;/a&gt; unto themselves. The sanctums' appearances are reflective of each flight.\nThis also somewhat matches how the chamber itself was \"accessible anywhere the Aspects chose\".\nWorld of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.\nIn \"\", the Chamber of Aspects is the location of two raid encounters, the first similar to &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, with the ability to add more encounters. The instances are &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; in style.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;battle with Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, a vision of Deathwing creating the Demon Soul here with the other Aspects can be seen.\nIt now appears to be a small antechamber beneath the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; (which more or less contradicts the description made in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\"). There is a meeting stone in the center of this room.\nObsidian Sanctum.\nThe Obsidian Sanctum is the black dragonflight area of the Chamber of the Aspects, available from the start of the expansion. It holds one raid boss \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Sartharion\"&gt;Sartharion&lt;/a&gt;. He is joined by three allies around the instance \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Shadron\"&gt;Shadron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenebron\"&gt;Tenebron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vesperon\"&gt;Vesperon&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 who will assist Sartharion if they are not defeated.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; used their Obsidian Sanctum as a breeding ground for &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, a terrible experiment undertaken by &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; to create a new dragonflight to rule over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. These energy vampire abominations had to be slain by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;.\nRuby Sanctum.\nThis chamber was opened in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.5\"&gt;patch 3.3.5&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the assault on the Obsidian Sanctum, the black dragonflight attacked the Ruby Sanctum and destroyed it in retaliation. A powerful war party of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, led by the fearsome Twilight dragon, &lt;a href=\"Halion\"&gt;Halion&lt;/a&gt;, launched an assault upon the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. By destroying the sanctum, the black dragonflight look to crush those that would stand in the way of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;their master&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s reemergence into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and to ultimately shatter the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the sacred bond that unites the dragonflights.\nThe battle that is to come will surely deal a crippling blow to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, however, it is up to you to stop this unprecedented offensive and defend the Ruby Sanctum. First you must face the assault of Halion's servants, &lt;a href=\"Saviana%20Ragefire\"&gt;Saviana Ragefire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baltharus%20the%20Warborn\"&gt;Baltharus the Warborn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"General%20Zarithrian\"&gt;General Zarithrian&lt;/a&gt;, before squaring off against Halion the Twilight Destroyer, a new and deadly force in this realm.\nOther Sanctums.\nThose chambers have not been opened yet.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nWyrmrest Temple was attacked after the Shattering and so was the Chamber of Aspects. The sanctums were all destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; who sacrificed himself after he found that the Twilight's Hammer had corrupted every egg into evil, malformed, and \"contagious\" chromatic whelps.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Sanctums seem to have been restored. The &lt;a href=\"Deathlord\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Ruby Sanctum to obtain information on the grave of an &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz\"&gt;ancient dragon&lt;/a&gt;."}

He found it in ruins, with immense veins of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; having breached through the vault's walls, even impaling the &lt;a href=\"Maiden%20of%20Vitality\"&gt;Maiden of Vitality&lt;/a&gt;. Magni was afraid that the facility wouldn't hold together for long, especially with the chamber's seal being close to shattering because of the Azerite bursting through. There, Azeroth bestowed the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; onto the hero, a powerful &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; than can absorb Azerite and use it to heal the world-soul's wounds. The champion used it to draw in the Azerite around the chamber, then unleashed the amulet's power to mend the crack in the center of the seal. With the chamber repaired and the world-soul secure, the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s on the surface calmed down, and Magni could hear Azeroth again, although her voice was still weak.\nThe Chamber was eventually entered by &lt;a href=\"That%20Which%20Hungers\"&gt;an unknown Void being&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of Azshara.\nThe Chamber of Heart is rebuilt and a new structure can be built called the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Forge\"&gt;Heart Forge&lt;/a&gt; which can augment the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra of the Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; are eventually invited to the Chamber.\nAfter her arrival, MOTHER connected the Chamber of Heart to all known titan facilities on Azeroth."}

When he stared into the pool, he saw odd shapes, which were at times \"silvery fish,\" and at others still, a human torso, legs, or arms.\nAside from being \"elven\", both the pool and the sanctum are of unknown origin, as is the identity of the powers in the chamber's depths.\nDuring the aftermath of the Third War, the lair was already moved to another location.\nSpeculation.\nIt is possible that this chamber is located in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; was said to meet.\nDue to the elvish nature of the structure, it is possible that &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; built it when the high elves first landed upon &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.

Aethas, despite his youthful age, quickly carved out a high rank in the Kirin Tor, eventually serving on its &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;. A heavy proponent of neutrality, Aethas worked hard to repair and uphold the millennia-old alliance between &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and Dalaran, though his eternal optimism and enthusiasm were tested when the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, now under 's rule, began attacking the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after came into power, Aethas and his people were &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;expelled&lt;/a&gt; from the Kirin Tor, though Aethas' refusal to abandon Dalaran led to his faction's incarceration within the city instead. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; saved many of them from this fate, Aethas included, and Aethas pledged the service of both himself and the Sunreavers to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; once more. Aethas eventually sought out &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, high blade of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, and with the help of his friend was able to rejoin the Kirin Tor.\nHistory.\nFlight to Northrend.\nArchmage Aethas, a member of the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, was present during the magi's flight from &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;. Along with his compatriots, Aethas assisted the magi of Dalaran in elevating their city into the skies of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where they planned to do battle with the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and his minions. However, what they were met with was quite another beast: the crazed aspect of magic himself, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. No sooner than the Kirin Tor had begun to stabilize their place looming skyward had the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; come upon them, eager to put an end to the mortals' reckless use of magic. Aethas spearheaded the defense of northern Dalaran along with &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt; by creating a massive shield over the city, the great powers of the two archmages proving enough to supplement the lesser magi.\nArchmage Rhonin established a line of telepathic communication with Aethas, to which Archmage Sunreaver urged the human to remain in control of the situation while he and Modera held off the attackers\u2014for regardless of whether the magi of the world hailed from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the aspect of magic would not discriminate in robbing them all of their power.\nAs the battle for aerial supremacy raged on, Aethas and Modera held up a grand dome over the city, shielding it from even Malygos himself. Aethas, Rhonin and Modera planned to burn the blue dragons out, and then break their hold on the shield to obliterate them directly. However, treachery at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Crevan\"&gt;Crevan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a Kirin Tor mage who had sold his loyalty to Malygos \u2014 led to the denizens of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; being released, taking the city unawares from within. As the tide began to turn unfavorably, however, Aethas accompanied his fellow archmages to swiftly confront the duplicitous Crevan, and is present during the traitor's downfall. Aethas maintained that the shielding dome needed to be kept afloat for a while longer still, and sure enough it proves an adequate deterrent. The blue dragons flee the scene, though not before resolving to crush the Kirin Tor once and for all.\nIn the Shadow of the Sun.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; war, Aethas sent several letters to the Regent Lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, to arrange an audience. Lor'themar deliberately ignored them at first, though Aethas gave up formalities and simply announced his intention to visit &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was greeted by Lor'themar, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, and less enthusiastically, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar was both impressed and concerned with the rank Aethas had managed to carve out for himself at such a young age: while Aethas' ambition and inclination to peace were a good thing, he was also inexperienced as a leader and politician.\nAethas informed the three of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; the Spellweaver's intent to wipe out all mortal magic users, and that as such, the Kirin Tor had become the crazed Aspect's enemies. He asked for his people's aid in the matter, noting that the Kirin Tor are eager to mend their bridges with Quel'Thalas, though Rommath immediately challenged him, accusing his plight of being the work of other members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;, and ensuring him that the Kirin Tor would turn to the elves for help when desperate for their mastery over the arcane, but discard them soon after. Referencing the sin'dorei's slated execution in the dungeons of Dalaran years before, while the Kirin Tor did nothing to intervene, Rommath denied Aethas the aid of any of his &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar stopped their bickering, and had Aethas shown to his quarters. Turning to Lor'themar instead, Aethas offered to speak on behalf of the regency of Silvermoon, and ensured him that Quel'Thalas' interests will be protected. However, Lor'themar did not answer him immediately.\nFollowing Lor'themar's return from failed negotiations at &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, Aethas revealed that several high elven members of the Kirin Tor under &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; share a similar attitude. Aethas had hoped that as a &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar could have helped bridge the gap between them, though concluded that it would be to no avail.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt; to enlist the sin'dorei's aid against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, reasoning that as members of the Horde they are obligated to commit support. Despite Lor'themar's apprehension to commit troops so soon after the battle on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas was able to twist his arm enough to warrant co-operation, citing that their refusal to battle the Lich King would likely lead to further death in Quel'Thalas, and the loss of Horde\u2014specifically Forsaken\u2014support in their lands. With the sin'dorei's presence in Northrend confirmed either way, Lor'themar agreed to support Aethas' endeavor, though made a point that it would not be for the Kirin Tor's agenda. Lor'themar instructed Aethas to confer with Rommath, certain that the grand magister would have \"much use\" for him.\nAethas was pleased enough with the support of his country, though noted that he would rather have seen Lor'themar agree to send aid of his own volition rather than Sylvanas'. Frustrated, the regent lord merely informed him that his own free will is what rules Quel'Thalas, and Aethas concurred with what Lor'themar viewed as insincerity, irritating the regent lord further. Lor'themar later admitted that his talk of \"free will\" in this matter was truly a lie, and that Aethas knew it just as well as he.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAs a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, Aethas was able to secure his people a place in the magical (and traditionally &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;) city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Through his efforts, the blood elves' allies in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were also welcomed, and Dalaran proclaimed itself an independent city. Aethas' followers took up his name, and the Horde was granted a sanctuary within the city that also bears the name of &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;. Aethas sent blood elven members of the Kirin Tor to the various Horde cities and bases in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and Aethas himself appeared via projection to advise &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Agmar\"&gt;Overlord Agmar&lt;/a&gt; from the Horde fortress of &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAethas assisted members of the Horde in their battles against the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;; learning of the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s connected to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;' plans to destroy them - sending their power back to the Nexus in turn. Aethas &lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Introduction%20to%20Wyrmrest%20Temple%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;presents himself&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza the Lifebinder&lt;/a&gt;, revealing his position on the Council of Six in the process.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; procured a foothold in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary elven blade &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; was unearthed in the frozen ice in its northern region. Though shattered by its twisted former wielder, &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;, the blade is ultimately restored. In the outcome of the Horde version of events, Horde heroes are tasked by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to hand the blade to his uneasy ally in Dalaran, Aethas. For a non-blood elf, Aethas expresses curiosity that the blade would bind itself to someone not of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, though praises the player nonetheless and informs them that Quel'Delar is adapting itself to their own unique abilities.\nFor a blood elf, Aethas is elated, giving the sin'dorei hero similar words of support as Rommath did before him.\nUltimately, Aethas's plight to see his people readmitted into the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; was a resounding success.\nTides of War.\nAethas was present when &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to beseech the Kirin Tor's aid in the looming battle against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Though ostensibly neutral, the Six agreed to discuss the possibility of lending aid as a \"deterrence\" to conflict of this scale, though Aethas made it clear to Jaina that once the Horde had seen its prize, this would likely not be enough to deter them from their attack. Still, Aethas cast the deciding vote, in favor of sending a token force to Theramore, reasoning that not doing so would be tacitly aiding the Horde. Both Aethas and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; recommended a mage named &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; for the task.\nDuring the battle, however, Thalen turned on his Kirin Tor comrades, revealing himself as a spy for &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, abandoning his post and assisting the Horde army in breaking through. Theramore was promptly annihilated via &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, in a particularly brutal and lingering fashion.\nEnraged, Jaina went on the warpath, and traveled to Dalaran once more to demand their aid. However, this time they were unwilling to give it, having lost their leader as a direct result of getting involved in the war. Aethas maintained that he had no part in Thalen's treachery, stating that he will make any amends he can for the treachery of Songweaver, and pointed out the presence of traitors in any given race. He furthermore told Jaina that the Kirin Tor breaking their neutrality for vengeance is not the answer, a sentiment the Council of Six agree with. Though agitated by this turn of events, Aethas and the Six still agreed to consider all options. When denied their aid, Jaina instead stole certain tomes regarding the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, and left to bring about her own retaliation.\nLater, after &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in stopping Jaina from giving the people of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; a similar treatment to those of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, a humbled Jaina returned to Dalaran. Having lost everything she had worked for, she apologized for having stolen Kirin Tor tomes, and requested to join the organization as a novice. However, her actions in the face of despair had endeared her to the Kirin Tor's leaders, who offered to make her the new head of the Kirin Tor instead. Aethas is in support of this, and gave the closing speech to cement Jaina's leadership.\nAethas later attended Rhonin's funeral along with most of the other members of the Kirin Tor, joining in with the magical gesture of mourning and respect for their fallen leader.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLandfall.\nAethas was called upon by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to help uncover the secrets of a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; device found on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Though he and &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; made considerable progress with deducting its modus operandi, Aethas was increasing wary of Lor'themar taking orders from the regent lord's \"master,\" &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Likening Garrosh's penchant for such dubious methods as a reflection of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s own, he believed the sin'dorei would be forced to walk down the same path under Garrosh's leadership as they had under Kael's. As such, Aethas believed that the sin'dorei would do well to break their ties with Hellscream's Horde, and gave voice to such beliefs after a released &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; briefly heightened his emotions.\nLike Jaina, Aethas continued to take pride in the Kirin Tor's status as a place of learning and cooperation for Horde and Alliance magi alike. Rommath, however, did not share his enthusiasm; indeed, the grand magister suspected that under Jaina's leadership, the Kirin Tor was now firmly in the hands of the Alliance, whether Aethas realized it or not.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Fanlyr%20Silverthorn\"&gt;Fanlyr Silverthorn&lt;/a&gt; conjured a Sunreaver portal at &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, allowing members of the Horde to circumvent Jaina's wards around &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and steal an artifact named the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;. While not shown in-game it was &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Pine\"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that Aethas, after stumbling upon the portal, admonished Horde adventurers for using Kirin Tor resources for the war effort and would end up being threatened into backing down. Knowing that Garrosh would know exactly who spilled the beans (which would cost blood elven lives) and struggling with conflicting loyalties, Aethas made the decision to \"to look the other way,\" gambling on Jaina's wrath being less than Garrosh's should she find out. Soon time the after heist Jaina learned of it, and incensed at yet another betrayal on behalf of the Horde, expelled the entirety of the Sunreavers from Dalaran. Aethas attempted to deter her from this, professing his innocence and Dalaran's status as the Sunreavers' city too, though Jaina imprisoned him in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;begins a purge of those unwilling to surrender&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the midst of the chaos, Rommath, who had feared this would happen, led a strike team into Dalaran to rescue Aethas and the Sunreavers. After fighting his way through the city (now mostly under the Alliance's control), Rommath succeeded in freeing Aethas from the citadel. Aethas and Rommath escaped from the city, aided by &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s Horde heroes had freed from &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Aethas returned to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, where he informed Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; of the situation, and is present to witness Lor'themar's vow to take matters into his own hands. The regent lord ordered Rommath to add the Sunreavers' strength to his own, as the rescued elves are funneled back to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; via portal.\nIn the wake of the purge, Aethas and the Sunreavers came to hold Garrosh (whose agents in their organization, actively assisting the Horde war effort, had led to the purge in the first place) just as responsible for their banishment from Dalaran as Jaina herself. Though many Sunreavers made it out of the city, Aethas also made it clear that more still are held captive in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thunder King.\nAethas accompanied &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, bringing with him a formidable amount of &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; faces both new and old. Aethas is part of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; as a commander, advisor, and secondary leader, though he defers to Lor'themar's overall leadership. Prior to the Horde's landing on the isle, Aethas was stationed alongside Lor'themar aboard one of the regent lord's &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Treader\"&gt;The Crimson Treader&lt;/a&gt;\". He was dispensed to the isle itself after the regent lord took &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; heroes aside for a private audience.\nAethas focused on dealing with the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Like Halduron and Rommath, Aethas will routinely returning to the &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Promontory\"&gt;Dawnseeker Promontory&lt;/a&gt; as construction of the camp progresses. Aethas also devised theories regarding Lei Shen's magic, which has engulfed the isle in an anti-flying stasis. Aethas believed the unnatural storms protecting the isle originate from within the emperor's palace.\nDuring the final stages of the assault on Lei Shen's stronghold, Aethas accompanied Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Captain%20Elsia\"&gt;Scout Captain Elsia&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Crossing\"&gt;Bloodied Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. He fought against &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt;'s forces in the courtyard, and faced off against &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s group when the battle was over. Jaina demanded that Lor'themar hand Aethas over to her, though the regent lord rebuked this and ordered the release of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Aethas was uncomfortable throughout the meeting and witnessed Lor'themar and Jaina's truce after &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; intervenes.\nAfter Lor'themar acquired a powerful cadre of &lt;a href=\"blood%20golem\"&gt;blood golem&lt;/a&gt;s, he set Aethas and his top archmagi to the task of getting them operational.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAethas accompanied Lor'themar's force to seize &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; from Hellscream's forces, and took part in the &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt; encounter. He has changed his outfit for the encounter, revealing his face for the first time in-game.\nLegion.\nAethas was seen in &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; observing the dying &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince their expulsion from the Kirin Tor, Aethas has sought to regain the Sunreavers' place in the conclave. However, some of the Council of Six were still unwilling to overlook Aethas' own betrayal during the Divine Bell incident. Working secretly with his old friend &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;, Aethas revealed his friendship with &lt;a href=\"Lyandra%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Lyandra Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, a distant relative of &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; who became obsessed with recovering the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt; following Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;' death. Lyandra had disappeared some years prior, her fate unknown, and Aethas himself began an unrelated search for the blade when news of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s return came. Although he was unsuccessful, he claims to have seen visions of Lyandra in an icy land resembling &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to use this opportunity to reclaim the lost blade for use against the Legion, and with it, the Sunreavers' place in the Kirin Tor.\nIn return for this information, Aethas hoped the council would allow him back into Dalaran. Modera agreed to speak on his behalf, and Aethas left for Icecrown to support a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;fire-favoring hero&lt;/a&gt; in a quest for the blade. During the battle against Lyandra, now an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; servant of the Lich King wielding Felo'melorn, Aethas disrupted her casting and held her at bay while her minions were dealt with. Lyandra was incredulous that Aethas would fight her, but the archmage did not acknowledge the creature she'd become as the friend he once knew. After the battle, Aethas returned to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to present the hero as the new bearer of Felo'melorn and put his request before the new Council of Six.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; led the council in a vote to decide Aethas' readmission. &lt;a href=\"Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; questioned whether he would betray the Kirin Tor again, but &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt; and Modera vouched for his trustworthiness in light of his role in Felo'melorn's recovery\u2013particularly him bequeathing it to the champion rather than one of his own Sunreavers. Ansirem conceded; Vargoth also gave his approval; and finally &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; gave his support. With a unanimous vote, Aethas was welcomed back into the Kirin Tor, urged not to misuse this chance to make things right.\nLegionfall.\nAethas now has an apprentice, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Ryanna\"&gt;Arcanist Ryanna&lt;/a&gt;. They met at &lt;a href=\"Tel%27anor\"&gt;Tel'anor&lt;/a&gt;, where Aethas was stark naked, trapped in a &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt;'s bonds, with the harpy and a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; arguing over who got to play with him first. Ryanna saved him.\nAfter one of his Sunreavers turned to the Legion, Aethas traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to seek the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; in setting the matter right. Aethas aids in re-powering Dalaran's defensive weapon atop the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; by siphoning the power of &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, the dreadlord imprisoned inside the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. He then becomes a champion of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Aethas states that while he does not regret his past actions, he deeply regrets what they &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;led to&lt;/a&gt;. In time, Aethas hopes that the Kirin Tor and all of Azeroth will better understand his loyalties.\nHe was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadows of Argus.\nAethas journeys to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" and boards the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" in order to take the fight to the Legion on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. He can be found within the \"Vindicaar\"'s Matrix Core room alongside &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, where the two discussed how each feels overwhelmed by the powers at play.\nAethas can also be found at &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Ridge\"&gt;Darkfall Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt; where he fights demons seeking to reach the \"Vindicaar\".\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the resurgence of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Aethas met with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, where they learned that &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt; was in danger of falling to the Scourge, with Aethas noting that the Scourge was too focused for it be a random attack, and voiced calling upon the Horde for aid. However, Rommath countered that they couldn't wait and had to deal with the Scourge immediately. Liadrin agreed with Rommath's assessment and was able to convince Lor'themar that it would be best to call upon those still in training to hold the line and keep Quel'Thalas safe. Aethas and Rommath then immediately ported to Tranquillien. Within the town they established themselves within the main building, with Aethas placing a protective barrier to keep the Scourge at bay. While Liadrin ordered for the Scourge numbers to be thinned, Aethas requested that &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;blood elf champions&lt;/a&gt; aid him and Rommath as they set up defenses in Tranquillien. As the trio went about this task, Aethas was stunned to be confronted with the &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt; and quickly realized that Vorath was leading the Scourge against them. The trio also discovered that Vorath had found a way to cheat death and informed Liadrin of the situation.\nThe group then determined that the best way forward would be to imbue a weapon with the proper power in order to send Vorath to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; for good. After the champion was able to empower the &lt;a href=\"Forged%20Ranseur\"&gt;Forged Ranseur&lt;/a&gt; with the magics of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, they returned to the group. Aethas then joined the rest of his companions in striking back at the Scourge, where the champion with the ranseur cut a swath of destruction through the Scourge, which successfully trapped Vorath within Deatholme. Determined to put an end to the invasion once and for all, the blood elves stormed Deatholme, and killed Vorath. With Vorath's death, Liadrin noticed how the Scourge began to scatter and declared that the remnants could be taken care of in time. Aethas then joined his companions in returning to Silvermoon to celebrate their victory.\nDragonflight.\nAethas visited the &lt;a href=\"Zen%27shiri%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;Zen'shiri Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in search of a &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; music box once precious to Jaina; the trinket was unaccounted for upon her raising of the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20flagship\"&gt;Proudmoore flagship&lt;/a&gt;. Aethas hoped the box's return as a peace offering would repair their friendship. &lt;a href=\"Zen%27kala\"&gt;Zen'kala&lt;/a&gt; put his best agents to the task of its recovery and wished Aethas well in his endeavor.\nQuotes.\nLegion.\nVindicaar.\n&lt;Aethas seems to be bothered by something.&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

These afflicted souls are categorized as friendly targets, and so players can use healing and other helpful spells on them. The souls always spawn with poison, disease, and curse debuffs, and start with 0% HP. If any of these debuffs is removed, or their HP reaches 100%, the Afflicted will instantly despawn peacefully. However, the souls are also casting a debuff spell and if it can complete the 10-second cast time, the party suffers a large loss of haste for 10 seconds. The haste loss can stack if multiple or sequential casts are allowed to complete. While there are some guaranteed spawns, for most spawn checks, it is not certain whether both souls will spawn, or if any souls will spawn at all. Afflicted Beings will also despawn harmlessly if the party leaves combat.\nTips.\nThis affix is primarily handled by classes which have healing and dispel abilities. These tend to be classes with a &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; specialization, although &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s can also use &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Curse\"&gt;Remove Curse&lt;/a&gt; on the soul. This is because the fastest way to deal with the affix is talenting into and using a dispel spell, and players from these classes (even while currently in DPS specs) can instantly use those spells on the afflicted soul. While players with the Healer specialization can also use a talented dispel spell, their increased healing means they can also consider healing the soul to full HP. For example, they may need to deal with a pair of Souls and their dispel is on cooldown, or they need to save their dispel for a more important dispel from a non-affix monster already present in the dungeon. As an additional note, the afflicted souls do not have a debuff from the magic &lt;a href=\"dispel%20type\"&gt;dispel type&lt;/a&gt;, so the standard healer dispel will not work without the upgrade talent, and souls will also not be cleansed by &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt;, nor Warlocks' &lt;a href=\"Singe%20Magic\"&gt;Singe Magic&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was killed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and his remains became what is today the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen&lt;/a&gt;. Agamaggan is the progenitor of the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; race, who worship him fervently.\nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Agamaggan was one of the many &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s that &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; rallied to join with the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and assault &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. He slew thousands of &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;s with fury. He stomped the ground with his massive hooves, breathed corrosive acid upon his enemies and &lt;a href=\"Quilbeast\"&gt;cast rains of thorns&lt;/a&gt; detaching from his back, causing considerable harm to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe battle between Agamaggan and the demons was lengthy, and ranged across the continent, toward the west. Agamaggan even fought the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s lieutenant. Eventually, the great boar fell before the endless numbers of the demons, sacrificing himself to allow &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and others to reach the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThousands of years after Agamaggan's death, &lt;a href=\"Charlga%20Razorflank\"&gt;Charlga Razorflank&lt;/a&gt;, crone of the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Head%20tribe\"&gt;Death's Head&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20tribe\"&gt;Razorfen tribe&lt;/a&gt;s, sought to resurrect the demigod. However, the dark and violent rituals Charlga and her minions performed were quite at odds with the Ancient's noble and protective demeanor. In response, the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Agamaggan\"&gt;Spirit of Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;, causing the entire area to come alive. The Spirit asked &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to help defeat Charlga in the hope of steering the demigod's children back to their noble roots.\nLegion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; becomes trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and forced to &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Nightmare\"&gt;relive&lt;/a&gt; his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; during the War of the Ancients, a figment of Agamaggan is seen battling demons nearby.\nLegacy.\nLegends state that where Agamaggan fell, his blood gave rise to great masses of thorny vines. Many of his &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; descendants have taken up residence in the largest cluster of giant thorns, the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen&lt;/a&gt;, which they revere as Agamaggan's resting place. Agamaggan's body makes up the entirety of the Razorfen, the holiest of all thorn clusters, but the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; are especially protected because the entrance is made from the demigod's great maw. The quilboar believe that it will swallow whole those not loyal to him, and spit out their bodies after Agamaggan has chewed them up. According to &lt;a href=\"Mangletooth\"&gt;Mangletooth&lt;/a&gt;: \"Agamaggan has left his body behind to protect us, and he gives of his spirit so we may protect him.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"geomancer\"&gt;geomancer&lt;/a&gt;s of the quilboar tribes call upon the strength of the Great Boar to help them in battle and in their rituals. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, said to be formed from the blood of Agamaggan, are especially prized by the quilboar. Boars are revered within quilboar culture, and particularly large and tenacious ones are seen as a favor from Agamaggan.\nIn the RPG.\nSpirit.\nAgamaggan's spirit is believed to reside in the afterlife. Today he is the patron of the quilboar tribes, nearly all of whom revere the boar god and pray for his return. Further, they welcome the chance to join Agamaggan again in the afterlife. Since returning to their wilder roots, some orc clans have begun to worship Agamaggan, as have some among the night elves who respect his strength and courage and wish for a return to the wilder and less ravaged time in which he lived. This worship usually takes the form of sacrifices and the consumption of burnt offerings, though on occasion more zealous worshipers will engage in single combat.\nCombat.\nHesitation in combat is unknown to Agamaggan. He will fearlessly charge and throw his full strength against any opponent. His first assault usually concentrates on spellcasters, eliminating their unpredictability from the field of battle. In the middle of a group of opponents, he will use his special attacks to knock down a number of opponents. Believing that he can gain an enemy\u2019s strength by consuming it, he will do his best to keep fallen opponents from being recovered or revived by their allies."}

During the Age of a Hundred Kings, the mogu found &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Powerful mogu necro-lords ruled their &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s from crypts dug deep beneath the surface.\nAfter their master, &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;, fell silent and their bodies were turned into flesh and blood by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, the mogu became frustrated. After a thousand years without orders from their master, the mogu began to argue amongst themselves, soon falling apart into warrior clans. Their culture, language and identity began to change, and the mogu came dangerously close to destroying themselves from within. At the beginning of each new &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; swarm, the clans would reluctantly band together to defend their lands against the &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; threat, but once the swarm had been fended off, they would once again fall back to infighting.\nSo the cycle continued for many years. However, one king was more ambitious than the others.\nKnown as &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, this young warlord ascended to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Thundering%20Mountain\"&gt;Thundering Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and stole the power of the mogu's &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;ic master. When Lei Shen returned from the mountain, he dubbed himself the \"Thunder King\" and began uniting the mogu under a single banner. Armed with the power of storms, the Thunder King gathered together his followers and began the systematic conquest of the other mogu warlords, founding the first great &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; and putting an end to the Age of a Hundred Kings."}

She was charged with training &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in the traditional shamanic arts and, despite initial disagreements, the two quickly bonded and began a romantic relationship, eventually becoming life-mates.\nBiography.\nAggra was born of a shattered world, and learned the ways of the elements among the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; to discover why the elements of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were so afraid. When he arrived, &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; advised him to turn to the Mag'har Aggra, who told him that he had toed the line between being a leader and a shaman long enough and that he would have to give up his leadership to truly become a shaman. Aggra was Thrall's guide during a vision quest. Despite their rough beginnings, Thrall and Aggra grew closer to one another as he became truly connected with the spirits and became a proper shaman. Before returning to Azeroth Thrall and Aggra became mates.\nWhen Thrall and Aggra returned to Azeroth, they participated in the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. The next day, she noticed that Thrall no longer wore the armor of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and she was satisfied. Both left &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; and went to the goblin port town &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; welcomed them and prepared a ship to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. The ship was called \"&lt;a href=\"Draka%27s%20Fury\"&gt;Draka's Fury&lt;/a&gt;\" in honor of all orcish women. Aggra was emotional and together with Thrall and a crew boarded the ship and left Kalimdor to the Maelstrom. However, their journey would not be smooth as they had intended.\nCataclysm.\nWhile en route to the Maelstrom \"Draka's Fury\" was attacked by Alliance forces and Thrall referred to as their \"precious cargo\" was lost. While Aggra commanded the shipwrecked crew of \"Draka's Fury\" on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt; she gained unexpected allies to the fight against Alliance. The Goblins of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, who were also attacked by the Alliance, and the Horde aided one in another in combating the denizens of the Isles and the Alliance forces who had captured Thrall. After all, Thrall was freed and the Goblin's joining the Horde, Aggra and Thrall successfully made it to the Maelstrom. She later appears at the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; (affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;) and sends adventurers into &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battle with Deathwing in the nightmare caused by Iso'rath, Aggra tries to fight with Deathwing, though the Aspect ultimately kills her.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nWhen Thrall found himself unable to completely focus on healing the Maelstrom, Aggra tried to get him to touch with the Spirit of Life. When Thrall was asked by the green dragonflight for aid, Aggra encouraged him to go, even though felt that he belonged at the Maelstrom. While not physically with him, there thought of Aggra was enough to encourage Thrall to never give up during his quest. When Thrall returned to Maelstrom he told Aggra everything that had occurred and was prepared to rescue Azeroth with her as Go'el.\nRage of the Firelands.\nAt the Maelstrom, Thrall strains himself attempting to commune with the elements. Able to feel how broken the world is, and with the elements remaining silent for him, Thrall tells Aggra that he will have to work without limits to fulfill this task and she leaves him.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers thwart the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; by the Twilight's Hammer and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, a meeting was convened at the ancient World Tree of Nordrassil. Thrall and Aggra were among the gathered heroes at the meeting that ended in tragedy when an incredibly powerful agent of the Twilight Hammer interrupted the ceremony and struck down Thrall with dark magic, casting his spirit into the four domains of the Elemental Plane. While the Aspects conceded that Thrall may be lost to the elements forever, Aggra believed that her mate could be saved, and called on the aid of adventurers of both the Horde and the Alliance to venture into the Skywall, the Abyssal Maw, Deepholm, and Firelands to rescue her beloved from an eternity of torment. Before adventurers can return Thrall's spirit to the natural world, they must help him overcome his doubts, his willfulness, his desires, and his rage before he is bound to his elemental cage.\nThanks to the efforts of Aggra and adventurers, Thrall is restored. Soon afterward, she and Thrall marry with notable figures in attendance.\nFall of the Destroyer.\nWhen the Dragon Aspects were planning how to defeat the Destroyer, Thrall was spiritually tortured by Deathwing. Aggra found his body and stayed by his side until he was freed.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; by the hands of the Dragon Aspects, Thrall and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Aggra was bearing Thrall's child.\nTides of War.\nAggra learned about the fall of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and understood Thrall's pain when it was believed that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; had been killed. When Thrall received a vision of an unknown figure going to use enslaved water elements to destroy Orgrimmar, Aggra wished to accompany him. Though she was convinced that since Thrall received the vision alone, then he must go alone. While resigned to this, she understood and wished him luck.\nLandfall.\nAt some point, she and Thrall journeyed to &lt;a href=\"The%20Den\"&gt;The Den&lt;/a&gt; in Durotar and while caring for the infant &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall was approached by Horde heroes. After learning that Vol'jin was hurt and that the Darkspear may be trouble, Thrall left to help the trolls on the Echo Isles. Aggra wished him good luck as she cared for their son.\nWar Crimes.\nAggra and Durak accompanied Go'el to the trial of Garrosh Hellscream. She was said to be &lt;a href=\"Rehze\"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; again. She was wary of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;'s first witness being &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and grew outraged when she prevented Velen from speaking his heart. When the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; attacked to ensure Hellscream's freedom, a group of their pirate allies attacked her. In response, Aggra slew them effortlessly, while protecting her son. She then reunited with her mate and immediately went to heal the wounded &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Aggra initially stayed behind on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to take care of her children.\nDespite this, however, she later arrived at &lt;a href=\"Wor%27var\"&gt;Wor'var&lt;/a&gt; in together with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and . When &lt;a href=\"Telaar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt; fell she sent &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Kajassa\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Kajassa&lt;/a&gt; to check in on the situation.\nLater still, she can be found alongside during the attack on &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt; and alongside Thrall at the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Stones of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s death.\nLegion.\nWhile Thrall goes on an introspective journey after Garrosh's death, Aggra stays at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with Thrall's wolf &lt;a href=\"Snowsong\"&gt;Snowsong&lt;/a&gt; and Snowsong's pup, &lt;a href=\"Snowfang\"&gt;Snowfang&lt;/a&gt;, and serving the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAggra returned to Nagrand with Thrall and her children, living in a hut near &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;. Aggra and her children remained there when Thrall returned to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;. While teaching her children to weave, she made a red cloak, which Thrall took to Orgrimmar.\nDeath Rising.\nThough her family had a happy life in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, she understood the need to return for the sake of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. However, in time Sylvanas's forces took them by surprise and despite fighting fiercely it was not enough, and Thrall was taken. Soon after Aggra joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; in convening atop of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and learned that &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had been abducted as well and how &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; had neutralized her attackers. Knowing that Thrall would want her to remain behind and safeguard their children, she encouraged Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; with finding and bringing them home.\nShadowlands.\nShe later received word from &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who gone to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, of her husband's recovery.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nAggra and her family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAs Aggra and her family were visiting &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, they were unexpectedly joined by &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; who had arrived to recruit Drek'Thar in their mission to bring back the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. While Drek'Thar was quick to join in agreement about the festival, Aggra declared that they should offer more than just a return of the festival, that they should create a new rite of passage, one that teaches not just of the hunt, but what it means to be an orc, an &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt; - a rite of honor. The others quickly agreed and Aggra offered no objections when Eitrigg declared that the champion should be the first to complete the om'gora.\nAfter Drek'Thar declared that his old bones wouldn't make it to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, he instructed Aggra with presiding over the Kosh'harg, and promoted her to &lt;a href=\"Farseer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt;, while remarking it was a title long overdue. For her part, Aggra was deeply honored. As &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Eitrigg gathered the clans for the festival, Aggra revealed that it was to be held within &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and invited the champion to either guide her children to the town or simply meet them within, while declaring that it was her task to make sure the om'gora provided a worthy challenge for them. As the om'gora started, she declared that it was to be a rite of honor, earned by three blessings. Of the clan, of the land, and of the ancestors. She further stated that when all three had been earned, the champion would understand what it means to be an orc. She subsequently issued each rite, from aiding the &lt;a href=\"Owa%27nohe\"&gt;Owa'nohe&lt;/a&gt; (the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt;), to honoring the ancestors by crafting a worthy offering, and with joining one of the orc clans at the Kosh'harg, in order to move forward and prove their own strength and worth to the living orcs. In the last regard, Aggra and the clan chieftains decided that the blessing of the clans would take inspiration from the &lt;a href=\"om%27riggor\"&gt;om'riggor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce all three blessings had been acquired, Aggra declared that the champion had successfully completed the om'gora, and that the time had come to celebrate. As the orcs feasted in the champion's honor, Aggra encouraged them to revel in the glory they had earned and to put any of the orcs who got out of line in their place, as a reminder as to why they had completed the new rite first. As she feasted with her family, she would privately remark to the champion that Eitrigg's faith was not misplaced and that the champion had made fans out of both of her children.\nSoon after, Aggra performed the ceremony to bring the Kosh'harg to a close.\nQuotes.\nLegion.\nSo long as the Legion does not break our spirit, they cannot triumph.\nIn the past I have guided my husband Go'el along the path of the shaman. But for his next trial, he walks alone. What of you? What is your path?\nWill you be a force of nature, laying waste to our foes? A font of wisdom, discerning and fulilling the will fo the spirits? A healer, soothing the troubled and lifting up the meek? I tell you the truth, &lt;name&gt;:\nA true shaman must be all of these things.\nSpeculation.\nThe description in &lt;a href=\"Aggra%27s%20Guidance\"&gt;Aggra's Guidance&lt;/a&gt; implies that Aggra was born after &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s transformation into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. If so, this means that she is currently in her mid-twenties or younger. She would have been approximately 20 or less when she first met Thrall in \"The Shattering\"."}

When Sargeras betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, Aggramar took up his role of champion, until he was slain by his former tutor and friend. He was then resurrected by Sargeras as his enforcer and guarded the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt; until he was freed and rejoined his fellow titans at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLike all &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, Aggramar was born from a &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; maturing within a planet in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. Though it is not known when exactly he was born in relation to the other members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, what is known is that he was relatively inexperienced in battle when first sent to aid the Pantheon's champion, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, in his hunt for the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s who threatened the Pantheon's work. Aggramar proved a quick study and soon earned Sargeras' admiration, and became the warrior's trusted lieutenant. The two fought shoulder to shoulder against the endless demons of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and together they soon brought peace to the cosmos.\nAzeroth.\nEventually, Sargeras left the Pantheon over an argument about how to handle the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; corrupting nascent world-souls.\nDuring one of Aggramar's long journeys after Sargeras left, he suddenly sensed the tranquil dreams of a powerful world-soul emanating from the distant reaches of the Great Dark. When he reached the planet, however, he was horrified to find that &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; had already infested the world and shrouded its skies in a layer of &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energies. Realizing that Sargeras had been right about the plans of the Old Gods and their &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt; masters, Aggramar immediately returned to the Pantheon to inform them of his discovery. He urged the other titans to take action immediately in order to save the nascent world-soul, which would later become known as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; the Life-Binder was quick to side with Aggramar, and managed to convince the rest of the Pantheon to save this lost sibling of theirs.\nDue to the titans' colossal size, Aggramar feared that if the Pantheon were to take action directly, they would irrevocably damage, or even kill, the world-soul, and so instead he proposed the creation of the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; to do battle in their stead. As the other members of the Pantheon imbued part of their powers into the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s, the greatest of the titan-forged, Aggramar imparted his courage and strength to &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, who would become the greatest warrior of the titan-forged. The keepers were made from &lt;a href=\"titansteel\"&gt;titansteel&lt;/a&gt;, and the ingots used in their construction were forged by Aggramar himself.\nDraenor.\nAfter Sargeras stormed away from the Pantheon, Aggramar continued his quest alone. His mission eventually took him near &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, a world not yet discovered by the titans. He lingered among the vast emptiness of the world, listening for the dreams of a world-soul, but heard none. Nonetheless, the planet intrigued him, for he had never seen a place of such voracious and diverse plant life or of such untamed savagery. However, the more he observed the massive botanical hivemind of the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt;, the more he foresaw doom in Draenor's future. If left unchecked, the Evergrowth would consume everything on the world, including the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elemental spirits&lt;/a&gt;, eventually even devouring itself and leaving Draenor an empty wasteland devoid of life. Aggramar's natural affinity for order compelled him to take action, but he did not wish to completely destroy Draenor's plant life, only to temper it. Thus, he would need to neutralize the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s, the heart of the Evergrowth's power. The titan considered destroying the Sporemounds himself, but since his power was so great it risked irreparably damaging or even shattering Draenor and because he could not stand guard over the world forever, he instead decided to create a mighty servant in his own image to uproot the Sporemounds.\nAggramar swept his colossal hand over the world and wove its fire, air, earth, and water energies into a massive elemental storm. He channeled the roaring tempest into Draenor's largest mountain, sending the energies blasting through the crust and causing shockwaves of force to echo around the globe. The mountain itself groaned to life and rose up on two colossal legs. Aggramar named his creation &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, and he would serve as the titan warrior's hand on Draenor. At Aggramar's command, Grond set out to conquer the plants, and as he lumbered across the world, he carved and shaped the landscape to separate the Evergrowth. When he reached the nearest Sporemound, Grond defeated the creature with ease.\nAs Grond fought the Sporemounds, pieces of his body fell off and came to life as the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s due to the life essence that stirred within. Even though Grond was killed by &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, the final Sporemound, hope swelled within Aggramar at the sight of the colossals. They were not as mighty as Grond, but they were many and their shadows still loomed over the land. Aggramar crafted great discs inscribed with titan runes from the body of Grond and fused them to the colossals, creating armor that granted them strength and resilience. In the meantime, the Evergrowth had begun to retake lands Grond had taken from it. As Aggramar unleashed the colossals against Botaan and the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; - creatures that were pieces of the Sporemounds just as colossals were pieces of Grond - he felt a &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; dying somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and left to investigate with the promise he would return one day. He never did.\nDeath.\nEons after Sargeras left the Pantheon, while the titan-forged went about their duties, Sargeras decided that the only way to save the universe from the corruption of the void lords was to purge it in flame. Unleashing the demons he had imprisoned, and in the process of doing so transforming himself into a twisted, demonic being of hatred, Sargeras began his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to eradicate all life in the universe. Shortly after the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; eradicated its first world, Aggramar arrived to confront his former master, having sensed Sargeras killing the planet's constellar. He demanded an explanation from Sargeras, but when he realized that his words would not sway him, Aggramar challenged the fallen titan to single combat. The battle between the two raged until, in an explosion of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power, both of the combatants' blades shattered. Heavily wounded, Aggramar retreated and informed the Pantheon of Sargeras' betrayal.\nWhen the armies of the Pantheon and the Legion confronted one another near the world of &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam&lt;/a&gt;, Aggramar made one last attempt to reason with Sargeras. He approached his former tutor, unarmed, trying to persuade him by recounting tales of the glorious battles the two had fought. But Sargeras was set in his ways. With a howl of fury and sorrow, the former champion raised his blade and struck Aggramar down, nearly cleaving him in two. Outraged by this murder, the Pantheon launched an all-out assault on Sargeras, but, unable to stand against the fallen titan's fel might, soon perished as well.\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"Aggramar%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;'s soul was captured and corrupted by Sargeras, who infused it in an &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, giving him a physical body.\nAggramar's corruption was first revealed when &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the Speaker of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to Argus with the forces of Azeroth. He received a vision from &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus's world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of Aggramar. Sargeras told Aggramar that the circle neared completion and the mortals must not stop the rebirth of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, then ordered Aggramar to stop their incursion. In &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;, Aggramar arrived and assaulted the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to retreat.\nLater, Sargeras spoke to Aggramar as the latter watched the &lt;a href=\"The%20Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; torture the souls of Aman'Thul, Norgannon, Khaz'goroth, and Golganneth. Though they refused to be broken, Aggramar assured Sargeras that they would be soon. Sargeras told Aggramar that the essence of Eonar was still needed to ensure victory, and Aggramar promised that she would not escape.\nThe Avatar of Aggramar serves as the penultimate boss of &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, where he watches over the world-soul of Argus in the name of Sargeras. After his defeat he is freed from Sargeras's grasp and joins his brothers at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; to aid Azeroth's heroes against &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;. After Argus is defeated, Sargeras strikes out at Azeroth and wounds her heavily in Silithus. Immediately thereafter the Pantheon imprisons him within the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who stayed behind while his comrades left, serves as Sargeras's jailer.\nIn the RPG.\nAggramar is a male &lt;a href=\"Vanir\"&gt;Vanir&lt;/a&gt; titan. His classes are &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gladiator\"&gt;Gladiator&lt;/a&gt;. He wields a sword called &lt;a href=\"Taeshalach\"&gt;Taeshalach&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' lieutenant, Aggramar took over Sargeras' position when his superior changed sides. Aggramar is now in charge of combating the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and eliminating its demonic taint. Very bland and unemotional, Aggramar is much more cool-headed than his former master. He follows orders and implements tactics in a firm, professional manner, performing all duties as they should be done. The only emotion he feels is hate: he despises Sargeras with every ounce of his metallic blood. This rage could cloud his judgment and be his doom some day.\nAggramar's sword was once part of a larger weapon called &lt;a href=\"Gorshalach\"&gt;Gorshalach&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dark Render\"), which was the most powerful weapon in the universe. Sargeras wielded the mighty blade until his fall, when the weapon, semi-sentient, sundered itself rather than remain in evil's grasp. Aggramar knows that if he ever unites his half, &lt;a href=\"Taeshalach\"&gt;Taeshalach&lt;/a&gt; (\"Flame Rend\"), with Sargeras's half, &lt;a href=\"Gorribal\"&gt;Gorribal&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dark Seether\"), Gorshalach will be reborn. He desires this weapon greatly, but has not yet had the courage to confront Sargeras.\nAggramar's portfolio is based on eliminating the forces of destruction and dissolution, especially the Burning Legion, and protecting order from entropy through military prowess and combat might. Few on Azeroth know of Aggramar, though as a member of the Pantheon he receives the respect due to any powerful titan. Champions on numerous worlds revere him and cry his name as they charge into battle against the Burning Legion.\nInspiration.\nAggramar might be based upon the Norse god , or he could be based upon the war-god . Thor and Tyr are the greatest of the Aesir's warriors and the generals of the armies of the gods. Intentional or not, Aggramar also draws parallels to . Freyr is the nemesis of , who can be equated with Sargeras, and Freyr has the most powerful sword in Nordic mythology, which is also sentient like Taeshalach. Freyr's sword is one of a pair, meant to combat the sword of Surtr in Ragnarok, as Taeshalach is meant to combat Gorribal.\nSpeculation.\nAs he was the only known titan to have interacted with Draenor, Aggramar is very likely the one that left behind several &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Titan%20Chest\"&gt;Ancient Titan Chest&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Titan\"&gt;Vault of the Titan&lt;/a&gt; in , the treasure inside &lt;a href=\"Rukmaz%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Rukmaz's Vault&lt;/a&gt; and the artifacts responsible for the creations of the &lt;a href=\"magic%20breaker\"&gt;magic breaker&lt;/a&gt;s before leaving."}

{"id": "27829", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27829", "title": "Aggro", "text": "Aggro is a jargon word in WoW, probably originally derived from the English words \"aggravation\" or \"aggression\", and used since at least the 1960s in British slang. In MMORPGs, such as WoW, aggro denotes the aggressive interests of a monster/NPC.\nSome examples are \"We've got aggro!\" and \"Go aggro that monster\".\nFor example, you may read of a player who died while fighting one mob because she aggroed another mob \u2014 that is, another mob decided to attack her because she got too close to it, or for other reasons. See &lt;a href=\"Aggro%20radius\"&gt;Aggro radius&lt;/a&gt;. Aggro is closely associated with the concept of &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;. If a mob is under attack by more than one player (or by a player and her pet), then the mob will aggro onto (i.e., will begin to attack) the attacker with the highest threat.\nAggro is understood to be the condition of a particular &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; attacking a particular &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; is the numeric value that each attacker has towards each character on its &lt;a href=\"threat%20list\"&gt;threat list&lt;/a&gt;. The basic behavior of aggro is controlled by the rules outlined below. Some mobs will have secondary attacks which have different targeting procedures; even for a normal creature, the target who has aggro is not necessarily the player highest on its threat list. Managing aggro is one of the most important aspects of grouping because it determines how much damage the group receives and where the damage ends up. \nHolding aggro is done by (usually) one person (the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;) who uses his abilities to make the enemy attack him and no one else. For hunters and warlocks, the &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; usually operates as a tank in solo play.\nAggro control is the art and work which is done by all members of a party to force the mob to attack the tank(s).\nFor a long time it was thought that players would never be able get a sound understanding of how aggro works because it was assumed that it is based on complicated AI algorithms which can't reasonably be deduced from the little information Blizzard has made available to us. Thanks to the work of some dedicated individuals, however, it is now known that this is not the case. Today there is a quite thorough theory on aggro which explains most of the factors involved in a mob's target selection.\nOverview.\nAttackable &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s come in two varieties: neutral and hostile. &lt;a href=\"Neutral\"&gt;Neutral&lt;/a&gt; mobs, which are most mobs near starter towns but many others as well, will attack only after you begin attacking; these are surrounded by a yellow circle when you target them. However, most mobs are &lt;a href=\"Hostile\"&gt;Hostile&lt;/a&gt;, displaying a red circle and will attack as soon as you get too close. The maximum distance at which a hostile mob will attack is known as a mob's &lt;a href=\"aggro%20radius\"&gt;aggro radius&lt;/a&gt; or aggro range, which is affected by both the mob's and the character's level (some mob types, such as Wolves, may have a larger aggro radius than another mob of the same level). \nWhen playing on your own, all mobs you attack will attack you back. However, in a party, the role of the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; is very important, especially in the higher level game. &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; are the five classes that can act as a real tank in instances with the right specs and gear. The job of the tanks is holding the aggro of the mob while the rest of the party attacks or heals. This prevents the mobs from attacking the weaker, cloth- or leather-wearing, &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage-dealing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; classes.\nAggro-control in a party.\nControlling aggro is not only a tank's responsibility. Each and every member in the party is responsible for aggro, and most classes have the ability to control the amount of threat they generate. For example, a priest has the &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt; ability, which lowers the priest's &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; temporarily and helps the tank hold aggro or break an &lt;a href=\"aggro%20lock\"&gt;aggro lock&lt;/a&gt;.\nTanks can use &lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt; to pull back a mob (or up to three mobs for a paladin tank) if someone else aggroed it, but in the best groups a tank will only rarely need to taunt \u2014 though many still will just in case. (The effectiveness of taunting a mob that is already focused on you is controversial.) A tank can hold aggro without ever having to taunt if every class is aware of how aggro works.\nPulling.\nThe following conditions will cause a mob to attack a character if it isn't already attacking someone else:\nDuring the fight.\nIn general, the more damage an attack does (or the more healing a heal does), the more 'hate' or threat it generates. Some abilities have added or lessened threat generation (and that's often listed in the tool tip for that ability) and there are talents you can take to decrease or increase your overall threat. Damage- or healing-over-time spells tend to generate less threat than a big, all-at-once nuke, and debuffs like &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Shout\"&gt;Demoralizing Shout&lt;/a&gt; tend to generate threat greater than the damage they actually do.\nWho a mob attacks.\nMost mobs will go by the &lt;a href=\"threat%20list\"&gt;threat list&lt;/a&gt; or \"hate list\" or \"aggro list\" to determine who they are hitting, but some mobs have abilities that ignore or change this:\nSecuring Aggro.\nActivity commonly performed by tanks. This is where other classes hold back DPS and healing until the tank has a certain margin of threat built upon one or more mobs.\nFrequently a tank would perform this by:\nDrawing aggro.\nThe following conditions will cause a mob to attack a character if it is already attacking someone else:\nIf healers/DPS draw aggro.\nIf you do draw aggro, and you are not the tank, the first thing you should not do is run around. Stand where you are and use your threat reduction abilities: &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Do not attack the mob if you want it to be pulled off of you quickly, and stop healing if at all possible. If the tank does not seem to notice it, type a quick 'help aggro' (or even 'agg') into the chat. Remember: every point of damage that you do to it and every point of healing you do makes you more threatening, and when something unwanted is attacking you, the last thing you want to do is further entrench yourself on its hate list.\nIf the tank is not nearby, help him to regain aggro by running \"toward\" him. If he has to come to you, it makes it harder to maintain aggro on the other targets. Get close to him, let him taunt it off you, then move away and use any threat reduction abilities to help him keep it.\nA hunter's pet (especially a beastmastery hunter's pet) is REALLY good for saving squishies who have drawn aggro. Turn on growl, and hit intimidation if you have it, and it should pull the mob right off (remember to turn growl back off when you send the pet back to the main tank's target).\nFor the tanks, if someone else draws aggro from you, you should use the following taunting abilities:\nAlso, the shaman's &lt;a href=\"Stoneclaw%20Totem\"&gt;Stoneclaw Totem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Elemental%20Totem\"&gt;Earth Elemental Totem&lt;/a&gt; can taunt and hold aggro for a short time.\nNote: the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Abilities%23Growl\"&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt; of a Hunter's pet and &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; ability of a warlock's &lt;a href=\"Voidwalker%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; are not actual taunting abilities; they merely cause a substantial amount of Threat.\nWhen warrior's &lt;a href=\"Taunt\"&gt;Taunt&lt;/a&gt;, druid's &lt;a href=\"Growl\"&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt;, paladin's &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Defense\"&gt;Righteous Defense&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;, or death knight's &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Command\"&gt;Dark Command&lt;/a&gt; is used, three things happen:\nThis only applies to Taunt, Growl, Hand of Reckoning and Righteous Defense. Mocking Blow, Challenging Shout and Challenging Roar do force mobs to attack you (#1), but do not match threat or transfer aggro. Mocking Blow generates a pre-defined amount of threat; Challenging Shout and Challenging Roar do not generate any threat at all!\nAggro lock.\nAggro lock is a term used when a healer gets &lt;a href=\"mobbed\"&gt;mobbed&lt;/a&gt; and starts to heal himself, creating an aggro building loop. Lasts until the healer fails to heal in time and dies, or until finally a tank class (paladin, warrior or druid in bear form) manages to taunt mobs off and build even more aggro than the healer.\nA paladin in the group can spare the healer's life for several seconds by placing &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt; on them. Remember, this aggro loss is temporary and the tank must do their best to build threat on all of the mobs before the spell wears off.\nNote that if the healer uses an ability that reduce threat to save himself, others aside from the tank in the group might end up targeted instead.\nThreat reduction.\nThreat reduction, sometimes referred to as \"aggro dumping\", is the act in which a player uses an ability to remove some or all threat from a target or targets.\nNote: Fade, Feint, and Cower will not be useful in solo situations. Soulshatter will only work if the warlock's minion has accumulated sufficient threat.\nAll classes:"}

If the tank is holding multiple mobs it may be difficult to hold them all, so one or more may run towards a healer or overzealous dps. This occurs when the victim's threat exceeds that of the tank by a certain percentage (110% for melee and 130% for ranged.) For the tank to regain aggro, they must exceed the new target's threat by the same amount. There are a number of ways to do this. First, most tanking classes have some sort of taunt ability to force the mob back onto them, immediately increasing their threat to that of the person who currently has aggro. This will not hold the mob unless more threat is added onto it before the taunt duration ends. Secondly, the tank can simply use a few high threat abilities in a row to regain aggro. This is easiest done when the new target refrains from doing any action that continues to increase threat, such as damage or healing. Third, the new target can use a threat-reduction ability such as &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt;, or a complete aggro-wiping ability such as &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;. This will put the mob back onto the tank, provided the tank is directly below them on the threat meter. If a hunter is the target and feigns death, but the healer is directly below them, the mob will attack the healer and ignore the tank."}

It was here where the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; was founded. Today, Stratholme is the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s capital in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The mad &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;ravaged&lt;/a&gt; the port city in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; moved in soon after. Stratholme burns to this day.\nThe city included many well-known buildings, from the glorious &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Bastion of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ezra%20Grimm\"&gt;Ezra Grimm&lt;/a&gt;'s famous &lt;a href=\"Ezra%20Grimm%27s%20Premium%20Tobacco\"&gt;tobacco shop&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s reign of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, many humans expanded the nation settling in the &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;northern lands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, formerly ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s. These humans populated the &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt; some 2,700 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and founded new Arathi settlements.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, with its origins tracing back to the chaos of the Troll Wars, was founded some centuries later in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It became a predominant human religion and the church constructed temples and shrines throughout the human lands. Among the oldest and most revered of these holy sites were the temples in the Eastweald, including Stratholme. The region eventually fell under the sway of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. In the days when the city thrived, it was known for producing &lt;a href=\"holy%20water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; capable of cleansing even the darkest magics.\nSecond War.\nStratholme was the second largest city within the kingdom of Lordaeron, matched only by the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Stratholme, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, was the location where the Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; founded the holy Order of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and inducted its first five members, including &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;burning of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and their army disembarked near Stratholme and went to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Second War, renegade &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and sailors were brought here to be restrained until they could be escorted to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; for interrogation. Stratholme was also an important &lt;a href=\"Harbor\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; town and the chief source of &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; in the north. While the city was preparing to deliver massive amounts of oil to the kingdoms in western Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; sabotaged its &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;refineries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt;s to halt the shipment, and then destroyed the city. With the destruction of Stratholme, the Alliance supply lines to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; were severed.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nThe city was also where one of the original &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, was tried for treason against the Alliance for defending the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hall of Justice&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Major%20trial\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by Uther the Lightbringer himself and overseen by various leaders of the Alliance. Tirion was found guilty, &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;stripped of his powers&lt;/a&gt;, and was exiled from the Alliance lands. The following day the city came under attack by a small but well-trained band of orcs under the command of the young &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, determined to save Eitrigg. Amidst the chaos, Tirion and Eitrigg escaped into the countryside.\nThird War.\nJust before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; sweeping over Lordaeron reached Stratholme in infected shipments of grain from &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. The populace, unaware of the plague, baked and consumed the infected grain, unknowingly sealing their fates. The &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; had chosen Stratholme for some specific reasons. It was heavily populated and was the Eastweald's most important city, strategically and economically. It was also a holy site, being the Silver Hand paladin order's birthplace. If Stratholme fell to the plague and became an undead stronghold, Lordaeron would lose their control of the Eastweald.\nSoon after, as the first &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; started to rise, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and a contingent of soldiers arrived at Stratholme, but soon realized the city had already been infected. Arthas believed that the only way to prevent Stratholme from becoming a bastion of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was to purge the city. And so, the Prince ordered his comrades to kill the plagued (but not yet turned) citizens. For Arthas, this was as much of an act of mercy as it was a strategic decision. If the populace of Stratholme knew they were about to turn into undead monsters that would attack everyone they loved, what would they prefer? Arthas knew if he contracted the plague he would rather die a clean death as a free-willed human than a mindless walking corpse.\nMost of the soldiers and allies, including Jaina, and Uther, and his paladins, chose not to help Arthas, thinking his purge was madness. The Prince and some soldiers, however, went on. Fire engulfed the city while ash and ember billowed through the streets. Screams were heard, and the blood of innocents ran thick along the cobblestones. Almost the entirety of Stratholme's population was &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;massacred&lt;/a&gt; by them, along with the undead. Amid the chaos, Arthas confronted Mal'Ganis, but the dreadlord told him to seek him out in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, fleeing from the site. With that, Arthas gathered his forces, leaving the city while fire swept over Stratholme's ruins. Days later, Jaina and Uther returned. To their shock, it was even worse than what they expected as bodies littered the streets and much of the city was burned to a husk.\nAt some point, the undead Scourge swept through Stratholme, and the Knights of the Silver Hand manufactured &lt;a href=\"holy%20water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; to use against the invaders. They stored it inside small crates along with other vital supplies and distributed them throughout the city. Unfortunately, the citizens turned into Scourge reinforcements before the supplies could ever be used, and the city fell under the control of the Scourge.\nAt some point, the human &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Stratholme and pledged his soul to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, being raised as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had ended, after the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; Arthas had been called back to Northrend, the lich &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; became the leader of the undead in the city and positioned his floating fortress, the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, above the &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood\"&gt;plagued forests&lt;/a&gt; near the ruined city.\nAshbringer.\nAfter the Third War, the ever-burning city was invaded by the remains of the Knights of the Silver Hand. The group consisted of &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, with his sons &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling as if they were in a maze, they were soon ambushed by the undead. During the battle, Darion was hit by a dark magic, and Saidan was separated from the rest of the knights only to be killed by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; who subsequently possessed his body in order to pose as the Lord Commander. Soon the paladins regrouped and escaped the city.\nLater, Renault, under the guidance of Saidan, tricked Alexandros and Fairbanks into sending them to Stratholme to rescue Darion from danger. The two charged to the bridge leading to Stratholme but soon became trapped by the Scourge coming from the city as well as from the opposite side.\nAftermath.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; freed &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, the ranger lord hunted &lt;a href=\"Ramstein%20the%20Gorger\"&gt;Ramstein the Gorger&lt;/a&gt; in the Plaguelands, but it fled to Stratholme.\n&lt;a href=\"Anthion%20Harmon\"&gt;Anthion Harmon&lt;/a&gt;, in search of his wife, attempted to enter the city but was killed by the undead.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nStratholme was the largest stronghold held by the Scourge in all of Lordaeron. Leading the undead forces in the city was a former noble turned death knight by the name of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;, who coordinated the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, where he constantly battled the force of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. However, one small area in Stratholme remained under the control of the living: the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, from where the &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; himself led the Crusade against the Scourge. However, the Crusaders' fanaticism led them to believe that any who were not members were corrupted by the undead and had to be destroyed. As a result, the Argent Dawn sent adventurers to kill the Grand Crusader. To their surprise though, they discovered that the Grand Crusader had, in fact, been dead for years, having been impersonated by the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually overcame the demon, however, leaving the remnants of the Scarlet Crusade to deal with the Scourge alone.\nCataclysm.\nBalnazzar, having suffered a bitter defeat, shed his human form and killed all of the Crusaders in the &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Main%20Gate\"&gt;western portion&lt;/a&gt; of the city, raising them into undeath and calling them the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;. On the &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Service%20Entrance\"&gt;eastern portion&lt;/a&gt; of Stratholme, Baron Rivendare, having traveled to &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, was replaced by his son, the fallen paladin &lt;a href=\"Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Crusade Commander Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Craftsman%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Master Craftsman Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Packmaster%20Stonebruiser\"&gt;Packmaster Stonebruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crusade%20Commander%20Korfax\"&gt;Crusade Commander Korfax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Dosantos\"&gt;Archmage Angela Dosantos&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; offered rewards to adventurers to help them end these menaces. After killing both leaders, the Argent Crusade attacked the remaining undead and took control of the ruined city, making &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt; their bases, though only for a time as the undead still roamed its streets.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the city was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; in order to retrieve the saddle of &lt;a href=\"%3ADeathcharger%27s%20Reins\"&gt;:Deathcharger's Reins&lt;/a&gt;. The death knights fought against a &lt;a href=\"Patchwork%20Horror\"&gt;Patchwork Horror&lt;/a&gt; and a ghost named &lt;a href=\"Vivian%27s%20Lament\"&gt;Vivian's Lament&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reformed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Stratholme for the city's &lt;a href=\"holy%20water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; in order to purify Aurius Rivendare's mount &lt;a href=\"Shadowmane\"&gt;Shadowmane&lt;/a&gt;, which was then in the hands of the death knight &lt;a href=\"Raemien%20the%20Soultaker\"&gt;Raemien the Soultaker&lt;/a&gt; who wanted to spread the plague once more, in order to create the &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Reins%20of%20the%20Golden%20Charger\"&gt;Glowing Reins of the Golden Charger&lt;/a&gt;. They took control of the &lt;a href=\"Elders%27%20Square\"&gt;Elders' Square&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Eastwall%20Gate\"&gt;Eastwall Gate&lt;/a&gt; service entrance, clearing the area of \u200b\u200bany undead present, and used &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; as a base of operations in the dead city.\nThe remaining Scourge members and Raemien were killed and the Silver Hand resolved to keep a closer eye on Stratholme.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; activity increased in the ruined city and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; detected a new threat. &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Wilkers\"&gt;Sean Wilkers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; worked on clearing the Scourge out of the &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Service%20Entrance\"&gt;Stratholme Service Entrance&lt;/a&gt;. They were successful, but they also found &lt;a href=\"Shadowy%20Figure%20%28blood%20elf%29\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadowy%20Figure%20%28gnome%29\"&gt;shadowy figures&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20House\"&gt;Slaughter House&lt;/a&gt; who used necromantic magic on &lt;a href=\"Brightmare\"&gt;Brightmare&lt;/a&gt; and escaped.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; reported that for a dead city, there are still living people inside who manage to survive as they can, most probably the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; who continue to control and protect parts of the city, respectively the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Square\"&gt;Crusaders' Square&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Elders%27%20Square\"&gt;Elders' Square&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Stratholme was once the jewel of &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;northern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, but today it is remembered for its harrowing fall to ruin. It was here that &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; turned his back on the noble &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, slaughtering countless residents believed to be infected with the horrific &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since, cursed Stratholme has been marred by death, betrayal, and hopelessness.\"\nIn the RPG.\nGetting to Stratholme is exceedingly dangerous and trying to enter it is a death wish. In its glory days, Stratholme housed nearly 25,000 people. Now it is a place that swarms with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and their mortal servants. Dark magic pervades the air \u2014 it feels oily.\nThe ruined &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt; is located here.\nDescription.\nStratholme is a horrible, dark place, full of blacks and purples and the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist\"&gt;putrid orange mist&lt;/a&gt;. Undead buildings mix with human ruins. &lt;a href=\"Abomination\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20warrior\"&gt;skeletal warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wraith\"&gt;wraith&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es wander the streets and chant dark paeans in their sanctuaries. &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s patrol the skies. &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s massive &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, floats above the city like a bloated, diseased creature, and its violet lights, visible from miles away, symbolizes Kel'Thuzad's absolute dominance over the land. Stratholme is an impregnable fortress of evil.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Stratholme was a valiant member of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. It was once the most glorious &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, however, the mad &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, believing its citizens had contracted the plague, ravaged the city during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. It never recovered. The few that survived fled west to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; summoned Arthas to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the traitor placed Kel'Thuzad as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The lich took the city after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat and erected Scourge structures throughout the ruins establishing Stratholme as his base, and the surrounding lands completely under his rule. Stratholme is also the home of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;. Once a wealthy human landowner who the plague corrupted, and he pledged himself as a Scourge &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. His duty is to round up and murder any human survivors he can find.\nAfter the Third War, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; formed and mounted a series of small insurrections. The Crusade has been waging this dirty, underground war for several years now, and the fight has taken its toll. The Crusaders still attack the Scourge at every opportunity, however. &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s under &lt;a href=\"warlord%20Thresh%27jin\"&gt;warlord Thresh'jin&lt;/a&gt; also moved in after the Third War. With the fall of Lordaeron and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls see a path to reestablishing their old dominion.\nRight now, with Stratholme in Kel'Thuzad's hands, the Scourge has a method of summoning a nearly infinite supply of reinforcements. Baron Rivendare and Kel'Thuzad are two key figures in the Scourge's power structure, and if someone managed to raze the plagued city and destroy them both, that would likely be sufficient to reclaim much of the Plaguelands. Taking a small group against Stratholme would be suicide and it would require the full support of all of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s races for the type of assault needed to take down Kel'Thuzad.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}
{"id": "13962", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13962", "title": "Stratholme (Classic)", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of Stratholme (pronounced \u02c8strath\u02d0h\u0254lm or STRATH-olm) was the northernmost and second most populous city of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and is the city where the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; was founded. Today, Stratholme is the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The mad &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; ravaged Stratholme in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; moved in soon after. Stratholme burns to this day, and its districts have been split between the overzealous &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, and the Scourge forces led by the death knight &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nOn first entering Stratholme through the main entrance, the gate closes. Therefore, the only way out is to fight your way to the service entrance (the key to which is held by Magistrate Barthilas), also known as the \"back door\", or use a hearthstone or mage portal to get out. Teleporting out is also possible through the dungeon finder, if it was used to form your group. If someone is already at the service entrance, they can use the &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; to open the gate and let others in. Another way to do this is duel, then aggro nearby hostiles (or just aggro monsters from the start), and slip through the door in ghost from, and resurrect on the other side.\nStratholme is basically divided into two parts, though the boundaries are somewhat vague. Scarlet Side or \"Live Side\", which goes from the main entrance into the Scarlet Crusade-controlled citadel, and Scourge Side or \"Undead Side\", which can also be accessed from the main entrance, but more commonly through the Service Entrance (which requires a &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20City\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; or Lockpicking 300) to the Scourge slaughterhouse. However, both \"sides\" are part of the same instance and players can complete both tracks. When using the &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20finder\"&gt;dungeon finder&lt;/a&gt; the end boss, and thus the side of Stratholme your party needs to clear, is determined by the entrance you are ported to. The main gate will lead to the Live Side, while the service entrance will lead to the Undead Side. Players can complete the other side as well, but will not earn credit for completing the dungeon until they destroy the end boss of the appropriate side. The &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Stratholme (achievement)&lt;/a&gt; achievement requires completion of both sides, but this can be accomplished during separate runs.\nEngineers can blast their way through the Service Entrance using Seaforium ( or better), and blacksmiths a skeleton key (&lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Arcanite Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; or better). However, if you do, remember to take two charges with you, as there are two doors to open.\nTo get to Baron Rivendare, the 3 Ash'ari Crystals must be toppled. These Crystals are guarded by 3 of the bosses: &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Anastari\"&gt;Baroness Anastari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nerub%27enkan\"&gt;Nerub'enkan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maleki%20the%20Pallid\"&gt;Maleki the Pallid&lt;/a&gt;. Kill them, and all the trash mobs inside the ziggurats they guard, and the Crystals will be toppled, allowing you entry to the Slaughterhouse where Baron Rivendare waits.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}
