{"id": "311878", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=311878", "title": "Paragon", "text": "Paragons are &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Champion%20%28rank%29\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; from past eras who were preserved in &lt;a href=\"amber\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt; at the height of their strength and buried all over the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. Legendary heroes of the mantid, they are preserved in case of a great crisis. Some of them are war masters, others are ingenious &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s or master &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s. After being chosen, the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; are usually responsible for giving paragons their second names.\nDescription.\nParagons are encased in empowered amber shells by a skilled ambersmith of the paragon's choosing. After putting the paragon to sleep, the ambersmith is immediately killed, in order to keep the location of the paragon a secret. It requires the power of the entire Klaxxi council to locate paragons, preventing outsiders or lone Klaxxi'va from interfering with them. Once encased, paragons will be left to sleep until there is need of their help, and can awaken from many thousands of years of sleep without incident. However, the power of the amber is finite, and the preserved subject runs the risk of death if not released from stasis before the power of the amber is depleted.\nBeing put to sleep is painful, and feels like dying. Being awakened is also painful, and leaves the paragon extremely weak and in dire need of nourishment. It is speculated among the mantid that the process of reviving a paragon from his amber slumber is akin to an empress bringing her swarmborn into the world, and awakened paragons do seem to feel a special bond with the one who rouses them from their sleep. Calling them their \"Wakener\", paragons can instinctively recognize the one who awakened them. The process of putting paragons to sleep in amber and the equipment used for it was invented by the first paragon, &lt;a href=\"Korven%20the%20Prime\"&gt;Korven the Prime&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecoming a paragon brings with it the right to ask questions and expect answers. Paragons display an awareness of the nature of the cycle and the swarm far beyond that of other mantid, including a far less reverential attitude toward the current empress. Through the Klaxxi, paragons are aware of their true purpose - not merely to serve the empress, but to preserve the cycle.\nRecent history.\nWhen the player first arrives in the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, they stumble upon the paragon and awaken him. Kil'ruk then introduces the player to the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; council, who allow the player to continue waking up paragons to help build their forces. These paragons become daily quest givers, so as they're waking them up the player is also unlocking more dailies.\nWith the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the Klaxxi allied themselves with the Warchief and his &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;. The paragons were given their own chamber within the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, ready to stand against anyone who dared enter Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, where the revived heart was moved. They were eventually killed by the same adventurers with whom they had allied in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zara\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zara&lt;/a&gt; pledged her people to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, she began a new swarm to conquer Pandaria in his name. The Klaxxi apparently heard &lt;a href=\"Unearthed%20Paragon\"&gt;a paragon&lt;/a&gt; just on the other side of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Sisters\"&gt;Five Sisters&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and saw fit to awaken them. Four &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi%20Wakener\"&gt;Klaxxi Wakener&lt;/a&gt;s attempted to do so but were killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s opposing the swarm, which caused the death of the paragon as well."}

But the paragons, as do all mantid, hold a far deeper loyalty. When Garrosh unearthed the &lt;a href=\"heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the paragons followed the whispers of their ancient creator to the iron halls beneath &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"After mopping up the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; on the Timeless Isle and \u201cfreeing\u201d the Fallen &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; Protectors from their eternal torment, our intrepid heroes soon come upon the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; Paragons. Go figure. In any case, players who have achieved Exalted with the Klaxxi faction and paid close attention during the tour of their sacred underground chamber probably saw this one coming.\"\nOverview.\nThree Klaxxi Paragons join the fight at the beginning of the encounter, while the remaining six observe the action from perches above. Each time a Klaxxi Paragon is defeated, any other active Paragons heal to full and the next Klaxxi Paragon leaps down to join the fight. The encounter ends when all nine have been defeated.\nAbilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeer%20the%20Bloodseeker\"&gt;Skeer the Bloodseeker&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkeer the Bloodseeker uses two primary abilities: Hewn/Bloodletting.\n&lt;a href=\"Rik%27kal%20the%20Dissector\"&gt;Rik'kal the Dissector&lt;/a&gt;.\nRik'kal the Dissector uses three primary abilities: Genetic Alteration/Injection. In Heroic Difficulty, Rik'kal the Dissector also uses the following ability: Mutate: Amber Scorpion.\n&lt;a href=\"Hisek%20the%20Swarmkeeper\"&gt;Hisek the Swarmkeeper&lt;/a&gt;.\nHisek the Swarmkeeper uses two primary abilities: Shoot/Aim.\n&lt;a href=\"Ka%27roz%20the%20Locust\"&gt;Ka'roz the Locust&lt;/a&gt;.\nKa'roz the Locust uses two primary abilities: Flash/Hurl Amber.\n&lt;a href=\"Korven%20the%20Prime\"&gt;Korven the Prime&lt;/a&gt;.\nKorven the Prime uses two Primary abilities: Encase in Amber/Shield Bash.\n&lt;a href=\"Iyyokuk%20the%20Lucid\"&gt;Iyyokuk the Lucid&lt;/a&gt;.\nIyyokuk the Lucid uses two primary abilities: Diminish/Insane Calculation. In addition, Iyyokuk the Lucid uses Calculate when he enters the fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Kaz%27tik%20the%20Manipulator\"&gt;Kaz'tik the Manipulator&lt;/a&gt;.\nKaz'tik the Manipulator uses two primary abilities: Sonic Projection/Mesmerize. In addition, Kaz'tik will summon his Hungry Kunchongs when he joins the fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Kil%27ruk%20the%20Wind-Reaver\"&gt;Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nKil'ruk the Wind-Reaver uses three primary abilities: Exposed Veins/Gouge/Reave.\nStrategy.\nOver the course of the fight, you will have to fight nine paragons, three at a time. Each time a paragon is killed, a new one will show up to take his place. Whenever this happens, all active paragons will be healed to full health, so don't bother with cleaving, multidotting, or AoE attacks.\nActivation Order.\nThe first three paragons will be:\nAs the paragons are killed, they will be replaced in this order:\nKill Order.\nOn the pull, have one tank pick up Skeer and the other tank pick up Rik'kal. Hisek cannot be tanked and should be left in the center of the room.\nThe raid will want to either kill Skeer first and Rik'kal second, or vice versa. This depends on the Rik'kal tank's ability and confidence to let Injection fall off via active mitigation (it is not possible for the Skeer and Rik'kal tanks to taunt-switch due to debuffs applied by one that amplify the other's attacks). If the Rik'kal tank can cause Injection to fall off, kill Skeer first and Rik'kal second, otherwise kill Rik'kal first and Skeer second. While Skeer is up, DPS will need to take out the blood creatures as a top priority, and the tank on the kill target will need to kite his boss away from the bloods. Hisek will meanwhile be periodically casting Aim, which requires raid members to stand in a line between Hisek and the Aim target to split the damage.\nOnce the first of Skeer or Rik'kal is defeated, Ka'roz will join the fight. The raid will need to spread out to avoid Flash/Whirling and dodge the amber pools. Ka'roz is generally not problematic and will be kept alive for a long time.\nOnce both Skeer and Rik'kal have been taken out, Korven will join the fight. Due to his Encase in Amber ability, Korven should be taken out immediately. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; should be used to break the amber that Korven will cast on himself at 50% and to then kill Korven because he can cast it on himself again. The Korven tank needs to face him away, and may need the other tank to taunt Korven if the Shield Bash/Vicious Assault combination is problematic.\nIyyokuk will join the fight once Korven is dead. Raid members affected by Insane Corruption: Fiery Edge must run away from the raid and from each other, and the rest of the raid must avoid the fiery lines. Healers must keep the raid above 25%, otherwise Diminish will one-shot people under 25%. However, the raid will be killing Hisek at this point, as his Aim damage will now be dangerously high.\nOnce Hisek dies, Xaril will join the raid. Kill him immediately. Anyone with the Blue catalyst should find a raid member to stack on who doesn't have the Blue catalyst. The raid will need to react accordingly to the catalysts when Toxic Injection is cast: spread from red, blue will find a non-blue friend to stack on, and yellow will need to place the void zones away from the raid. Xaril should only get one Toxic Injection off before he dies. The Xaril tank will need to drop Caustic Blood if it nears 10 stacks, either through active mitigation (preferred) or via a tank swap.\nKaz'tik will land next, and should also be immediately killed. Raid members should not stand anywhere near the Kunchongs, and ranged must immediately switch to the designated Kunchong whenever Mesmerize is cast. If a Kunchong becomes Mature, have a tank pick it up, and DPS should switch to it straight away. Players must make sure that other players are not in a line between them and the boss due to Sonic Projection.\nKil'ruk will be the last to land, and the encounter will be basically won at this point if the raid is ahead of the enrage timer; Death from Above is easily avoidable if the raid is spread out, and the Gouge/Mutilate combo simply requires tank and healer preparation and co-ordination. However, the tank previously on Xaril must not pick Kil'ruk up if he still has his Xaril stacks on him, and should always leave Kil'ruk to his co-tank. The raid should first kill Iyyokuk to reduce raid damage, then Ka'roz due to him being active for nearly the entire fight (and having a large damage increase by this point), then Kil'ruk last.\nParagon Buffs.\nEach Paragon will, when defeated, grant a role-specific buff to the first person of the correct role that interacts with the Paragon's corpse. These buffs should be used, as their use will make the encounter easier. Only one player may pick up any one Paragon's buff, and a player that has already picked up a Paragon buff may not pick up another.\nThe buffs granted by each Paragon are ordered in the recommended kill order above, and are as follows:\nAchievement: Now We are the Paragon.\nThe achievement &lt;a href=\"Now%20We%20are%20the%20Paragon\"&gt;Now We are the Paragon&lt;/a&gt; is earned individually and simply requires players to pick up three separate Paragon buffs. Since a player can only pick up one Paragon buff per kill, earning this achievement will take a minimum of three raid lockouts.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, they are rather vague about where their original lands were, as apparently their names for everything in Northrend are different from the others races.\nWhile their members are some of the calmest wolvar in Northrend, their aggressive nature has put them at odds with the various &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt; tribes known collectively as the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to begin gaining reputation from this faction, you must complete a long quest chain which starts with &lt;a href=\"Playing%20Along\"&gt;Playing Along&lt;/a&gt; and ends with &lt;a href=\"A%20Hero%27s%20Burden\"&gt;A Hero's Burden&lt;/a&gt;. Which NPC you choose to kill will affect the faction you become aligned with \u2014 killing the &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt; aligns you with the Frenzyheart tribe, and killing the &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt; aligns you with &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;the Oracles&lt;/a&gt;. The choice can be reverted by doing the encounter again (the switching quest is considered a daily).\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Hill\"&gt;Frenzyheart Hill&lt;/a&gt; and the wolvar of the tribe were happy to see &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; among them, as they welcomed him like a long-lost friend, and even more remarkable, they joked with him about also being friends with their sworn enemies, the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt;. They welcomed the group to their fire and told them about their story over a delicious meal of roast &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuture.\nSome years into the future &lt;a href=\"Kekek\"&gt;Kekek&lt;/a&gt; becomes the leader of the tribe and with the Scourge no longer a threat, he leads his people from Sholazar Basin to their former home, a place without gorlocs.\nReputation.\nDuring the lead-in chain, your faction reputation will increase first with the Frenzyheart tribe and then with the Oracles. \"This has no bearing upon your ultimate choice of faction\", so do not become confused. At the end of the chain you will become with the faction you choose, and with the other. For instance, completing the Frenzyheart quest &lt;a href=\"Just%20Following%20Orders\"&gt;Just Following Orders&lt;/a&gt; you will go to with the Oracles and with the Frenzyheart tribe.\nThe only way to gain further reputation is through the daily quests offered by &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Harkek\"&gt;Elder Harkek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rejek\"&gt;Rejek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vekgar\"&gt;Vekgar&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Hill\"&gt;Frenzyheart Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Three daily quests, awarding a total of 1700 reputation, are offered each day. The daily quests on offer may vary from day to day (refer to the table below).\nRelation to the Oracles.\nMuch like &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;the Scryers&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;the Aldor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, the Oracles and the Frenzyheart tribe are opposite factions, where when you gain reputation with one you lose reputation with the other.\nAs.\nYou will be unable to complete daily quests for the Frenzyheart tribe and will be attacked on sight because you are or better with &lt;a href=\"the%20Oracles\"&gt;the Oracles&lt;/a&gt;, who are the Frenzyheart's sworn enemies.\nSwitching factions.\nTo switch factions from the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart tribe&lt;/a&gt;, you must complete the 20-step quest chain up to &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Champion\"&gt;Frenzyheart Champion&lt;/a&gt; (culminating in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Artruis%20the%20Heartless\"&gt;Artruis the Heartless&lt;/a&gt;, a level-77 elite that is soloable by some classes). During the fight with Artruis, you are attacked by both an Oracle (&lt;a href=\"Jaloot\"&gt;Jaloot&lt;/a&gt;) and a Frenzyheart (&lt;a href=\"Zepik\"&gt;Zepik&lt;/a&gt;). You must leave the Zepik the Frenzyheart alive and kill Jaloot the Oracle, then finish defeating Artrius in order for the Frenzyheart &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Champion\"&gt;Frenzyheart Champion&lt;/a&gt; quest giver to appear. Completing this quest automatically boosts your Frenzyheart rep to , but REDUCES your &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt; rep to . Taking down one of Artrius' captured Frenzyheart or Oracle minions can then, according to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//thottbot.com/f1104%23A%3A%3AA\"&gt;notes at Thottbot&lt;/a&gt;, be repeated to switch back and forth between the two factions, though any rep beyond Honored, including any points gained while Honored, will be lost, as will the bonuses for any items that require Revered or greater with your old faction.\nNote that players outside of the party, or uncooperative party members, may kill the NPC you intend to save, so be aware of which quest you are accepting. However, there is no real danger of accidentally switching faction as the change does not occur until completing the daily quest offered by the NPC who survived. If the desired quest giver is killed, simply wait for Artruis to respawn and repeat the encounter.\nFurther Note - In order to switch factions you MUST complete ALL of the lead up quests. You cannot simply look at your reputation halfway through and worry about it! You will perform quests for both the Frenzyheart and the Oracles until you receive the quest A Hero's Burden. While completing A Hero's Burden you make your decision which faction you wish to gain reputation with, as explained above!\nFrom to.\nComplete the three daily quests offered on &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Hill\"&gt;Frenzyheart Hill&lt;/a&gt;; they are chosen semi-randomly from the ones listed above. Vekgar offers one of three possible dailies that require you to kill 30-50 Sparktouched Gorloc, awarding 700 reputation. Rejek will offer one of four varied dailies for 500 reputation. Another 500 reputation is rewarded for &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20Party%21\"&gt;Chicken Party!&lt;/a&gt;, which is available every day from Harkek. Therefore, the total reputation gain per day is 1700.\nNote: If you took the dailies from Vekgar and Rejek, and could not finish them on the same day, DO NOT delete them from the questlog. With a little luck, they offer different quests the other day, and so you can finish BOTH the old and the new ones. Naturally, this does not work for the chicken hunting, since this quest is the same every day.\n to : 8 days\n to : 12 \u2013 13 days\nRewards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Disgusting%20Jar\"&gt;Disgusting Jar&lt;/a&gt; can yield &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Brew\"&gt;Frenzyheart Brew&lt;/a&gt; that transforms your character into a Wolvar for 5 minutes. If you're not a costume collector this reputation is also part of two &lt;a href=\"Achievements\"&gt;Achievements&lt;/a&gt;: one called Frenzyheart Tribe for getting exalted with the Frenzyheart, and &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20of%20Sholazar\"&gt;Mercenary of Sholazar&lt;/a&gt; for getting exalted with both the Frenzyheart Tribe and &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracles\"&gt;The Oracles&lt;/a&gt; (not at the same time, of course). It is advisable to do the Frenzyheart first for the brew, then the Oracles for the companions and the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Green%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Reins of the Green Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt;, which has a much lower drop rate.\nThe Disgusting Jar can also yield a &lt;a href=\"Resurgent%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Resurgent Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Icy Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Powerful%20Rejuvenation%20Potion\"&gt;Powerful Rejuvenation Potion&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Fermented%20Liquid\"&gt;Mysterious Fermented Liquid&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nIf you lose track of this quest chain then simply kill the lion Pitch (objective of &lt;a href=\"The%20Part-time%20Hunter\"&gt;The Part-time Hunter&lt;/a&gt;), located at , again and &lt;a href=\"Tracker%20Gekgek\"&gt;Tracker Gekgek&lt;/a&gt; will re-appear to offer you the lead in quest.\nIf you are working toward &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20of%20Sholazar\"&gt;Mercenary of Sholazar&lt;/a&gt;, you can switch over to the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt; as soon as you are exalted and have &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Brew\"&gt;Frenzyheart Brew&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Disgusting%20Jar\"&gt;Disgusting Jar&lt;/a&gt; yields nothing else of value.\nFormer home.\nIt's unknown exactly where their former home was, prior to the Scourge forcing them from it, however, there would have been only one way into the valley by ground and that's from the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. That area, however, has gorlocs and is not likely where they moved back to. It's more likely their former home was in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; where the Scourge took up residence, though &lt;a href=\"Vekgar\"&gt;Vekgar&lt;/a&gt; also mentions that the Frenzyheart keep berries from their former homeland, and Icecrown is not known for its vegetation."}

Freya left behind an &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Freya\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; to protect it as a fail-safe if she were to be unavailable to the land. She has always been associated with &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; and its protection.\nBiography.\nAncient history.\nFreya was one of the nine &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keepers\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; to lead their armies against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. She was imbued with power by &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt;. Together with &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, she battled and defeated &lt;a href=\"Therazane%20the%20Stonemother\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreya created the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; during the Ordering of Azeroth to serve as the underlying blueprint for the planet. Some believe that she wove the Emerald Dream into being from nothing, others claim that this strange place had always existed in some form, a dream born from Azeroth's slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, which Freya tapped into and molded what would become known as the Dream as a way to commune with the nascent titan.\nWithin the Emerald Dream, she planted &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;, the Mother Tree, a single massive tree set atop a high peak. From it bloomed many fruits and flowers, and new life flowed outwards in waves, sweeping across the land. Freya sculpted many pools of life in other locations within the Dream, but G'Hanir was the first, the tallest, and the most radiant. For millennia, it served as a source of healing and balance that extended beyond the Dream and into the physical world, acting as a guide for Azeroth's natural life.\nFreya then wandered the world, searching for areas where the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;'s energies had coalesced. These regions created optimal conditions for the development of new flora and fauna. She molded life of astounding diversity, seeding it around the world. The sites where Freya had done her work were located at the polar extremes of the world. They included regions that would later become known as &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The original names she gave them became lost to time.\nAs she set out to populate the world with life, she placed one of the first seeds in what would become &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, near the powerful energy of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. From it grew &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan\"&gt;Fu Zan&lt;/a&gt;, the first tree. It grew strong and tall, drinking deeply from the Vale's resonant power. More trees arose around it. Lush forests, both in the Dream and in the waking world, sprang to life across the region. All of Pandaria's forests descended from it.\nA small number of exceptional, wild animals emerged from her enclaves and grew far beyond expectations, showing remarkable power. They became known as the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s. Seeing them as her children, Freya linked them to the Emerald Dream and wandered primordial Kalimdor with them at her side. The area they spent the most time at was &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore populating the rest of Azeroth, Freya fashioned a walking stick for her travels from one of Fu Zan's branches. This staff became known as &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%2C%20the%20Wanderer%27s%20Companion\"&gt;Fu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Sholazar Basin, she created the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Freya\"&gt;Avatar of Freya&lt;/a&gt; as a failsafe to watch over the region if she couldn't.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Freya and some other Keepers channeled the powers of the titans into five &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Through Freya, &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; bestowed her powers upon &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce, while traveling Azeroth in search of exceptional animals, Freya discovered a panther cub under attack by a pack of wolves, her mother already slain. To Freya's surprise, though the wolves had wounded the tiny creature, she continued to fight, swiping viciously with her claws against the larger predators. Before long the wolves were driven away, unwilling to suffer further injuries for their meal. Freya picked up the cub only to be greeted by a flurry of scratches, but she was not angered; on the contrary, Freya was delighted by the panther's unrelenting wildness. Freya healed the panther cub's injuries and named her &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt;, after her striking black fur.\nFreya also came across two young inquisitive bears named &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. She recognized their potential and saw what they would become. Freya gifted the &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;, forged from &lt;a href=\"Titansteel%20Bar\"&gt;titansteel&lt;/a&gt;, to Ursoc. He wielded the claws in countless battles until his death during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour other Wild Gods showed a particular commitment to peace and wisdom. These Wild Gods - &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; - would one day come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; by the natives of Pandaria, and Freya knew they would aid the region well. One day, Freya came to the Celestials, concerned with &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;a great darkness in the north&lt;/a&gt;, believing a confrontation was near. She gave her staff &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%2C%20the%20Wanderer%27s%20Companion\"&gt;Fu Zan&lt;/a&gt; to the Celestials for safekeeping and told them that, \"If I do not see you again, return this staff to Azeroth, to one of its children. Give it to someone who loathes battle and loves peace.\" Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent, vowed to keep the staff safe. Freya never returned for her staff, having been defeated by Loken and enslaved by Yogg-Saron.\nUlduar.\nFreya appears in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; as an encounter in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.

Though her conservatory remains lush and verdant, she has also succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s maddening presence.\"\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The watcher Freya has served as protector of all living things, aided by three stoic elders. Though her conservatory remains lush and verdant, she too has succumbed to the Old God's maddening whispers.\"\nOverview.\nDuring Stage One, stacks of Attuned to Nature must be removed by defeating the Allies of Nature. Once the Allies of Nature are defeated, Stage Two will begin.\nAbilities.\nStage Two: Nature's Wrath.\nOnce Attuned to Nature has been removed Stage Two begins.\nHard Mode.\nWhile the Elders in The Conservatory of Life are alive they will grant Freya additional abilities.\nStrategy.\nThe fight takes place in a lush oasis-like valley inside Ulduar. There are three Elder boss-tree mobs you can choose whether or not to kill. They are similar to Sartharion's hard mode: if you choose not to kill them, the fight gets considerably harder as each elder buffs Freya and her adds.\nAs you engage Freya, she will cast a HoT on herself and a buff that increases her received healing by 4% per stack, starting with 150 stacks for a total of +600% healing which makes her basically invincible at the beginning of the encounter.\nFreya will then spawn six waves of adds in a fixed interval of 60 seconds. Defeating these waves will remove various amounts of stacks from her buff until it is completely removed by the last wave. The waves are of three different types, cycling through twice in a random order.\nThe fight hinges on controlling the adds. Having said that, add-killing is far more central to this fight's strategy, as it is essential that adds are killed not merely because they will wipe the raid if it is overwhelmed, but also because in order to beat Freya's healing versus damage dealt to her, the adds must be killed.\nThroughout the whole encounter a slim, glowing tree called Eonar's Gift with 65k (20k in 10-man) HP will spawn somewhere near to Freya about every 45 seconds. It will grow for 10 seconds after which it will heal Freya and all her summoned adds in the zone for 60% of their maximum health (30% in 10-man). This tree should be killed immediately by a few designated spotters or else killing the adds within the 60 seconds time to the next wave becomes a lot harder.\nPhase 1.\nEvery minute waves spawn in a random order:\nStorm Lasher, Ancient Water Spirit and Snaplasher. They have varying HP from 500k to 1M and yet they all need to be killed at about the same time, otherwise 12 seconds after death they resurrect (reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Thekal\"&gt;High Priest Thekal&lt;/a&gt; raid boss adds). All three adds can be stunned and interrupted. Reduces Attuned to Nature stacks by 10 each.\nUnlike many mobs, Snaplashers (on 10-man) will not melee a target next to them if the person highest on their threat list is out of melee range. In a melee-heavy raid, the DPS can work on the other adds first while the tank builds up threat and periodically lets the debuff fall off. When ready, the tank can simply walk away and the other DPS can hit the snaplasher with impunity. \nAnother option is to kite the Snaplasher with a high-threat class like a hunter, helped by any slowing ability (Slow from Arcane Mages, Hamstring, Crippling Poison, etc..). This way you can go all out on DPS on it, as it has the highest amount of the three, and completely cancels the effect of its debuff; this method also frees up a tank so in a typical 3-tanks raid allows better control of the other two adds.\nThey have 234k HP, are untankable, and randomly run from player to player. When one dies it does a short ranged AoE for 8k~ (around 15 yards) which makes AoEing them all at once on one spot a bad idea.\nReduces Attuned to Nature by 2 stacks per mob.\nShe will also spawn a bigger add at some point, an Ancient Conservator with 2.2M HP. This is wave type 3. Just off-tank him and kill him to remove 25 stacks from Freya. He periodically uses Conservator's Grip to silence and pacify all members of the raid. Staying under the Healthy Mushrooms that spawn during this time in the zone will remove and protect against this debuff. A paladin using Aura Mastery with Concentration Aura can offer temporary protection from this debuff if no mushrooms are near. He can also cast Nature's Fury on a random player who will damage all nearby players for 10 seconds, so he should quickly move away from the rest of the raid.\nReduces Attuned to Nature by 25.\nPhase 2.\nThe waves will stop spawning, Freya has the same abilities as phase one with the exception of the healing augmentation buff. It is a tank and spank phase. Freya will begin throwing out Nature Bombs in this phase and raid members must be careful to move away or they can prove lethal. If too many raid members are lost it may become impossible to DPS through Freya's Touch of Eonar.\nNormal mode.\nTo engage Freya in normal mode you must kill the three Elders within the area before engaging her. The three Elders are easy mini bosses but require a little strategy to kill smoothly. Make sure to clear out any trash mobs between the mini boss and freya as it's easy to gather a patrol while moving around on the mini bosses and have them link Freya into the fight. \nHard mode.\nThe Elders, left alive prior to engaging Freya, do not engage combat, but banish themselves and provide the following buffs, while granting Freya some of their abilities as well:\nSuggested Elders to leave up:\nRelated achievements.\nHard mode.\nThe following achievements are for the encounter's hard mode.\nQuotes.\nMortals, I am indebted to you for freeing me from the terrible corruption that besets this place.

{"id": "14530", "revid": "21257", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14530", "title": "Aggro radius", "text": "The aggro radius is the distance from a player at which a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; will stop its idle behavior and engage the player in combat (see &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;). It is primarily determined by the level difference between the monster and the player character.\nLevel-based behavior.\nThe aggro radius of a mob will vary depending on the &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; difference between it and the &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;. The higher the level of the character compared to the mob, the closer the player can get without being attacked. Very high level characters can often run through densely occupied areas without being attacked at all, although there appears to be a minimum radius that will always get the player noticed, regardless of level superiority. On the other hand, low level characters accidentally wandering into or intentionally traveling through a higher level area can often be surprised when they are attacked by mobs so far away that they were not even noticed.\nFor this reason, when a high level character (Hiram) is helping a low level one (Leeroy), Hiram must be aware of areas that would be safe for himself but not for Leeroy, and should keep an eye out to aggro or kill any monster that ignores himself and attacks Leeroy. Leeroy, similarly, should not automatically assume safety in an area just because Hiram made it through without being attacked.\nCo-aggro.\nIf a player (Paula) is in combat with a mob (Commando), and Commando ends up within the aggro radius of a second mob (Security) that is currently not in combat, then Commando may pass on his aggro to Security, and Security will be &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;ed to the fight. Security will initially have a &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; of 0 against Paula, but will still attack her unless someone else gains higher threat. Situations when this is likely to occur include Paula attempting to run from Commando, using &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; effects on Commando, rooting Commando and then repositioning poorly, or when Security respawns or patrols close by to Commando. \"Fear aggro\" is particularly common and dangerous in dungeons, since the fear direction can be unpredictable, monsters tend to be packed in clusters, and most will chase indefinitely. Any of the above are even more likely if Paula jumps up or down a ledge over which Commando cannot follow, forcing him to take an unpredictable path to pursue her.\nCo-aggro is very likely to occur when the two monsters are of the same faction or creature type. A Bloodsail pirate will always co-aggro nearby Bloodsail pirates, but will probably not co-aggro a gorilla. NPCs that are friendly (green) to the player will never be co-aggro'd, but NPCs that are neutral or unfriendly (yellow or orange) - who would normally not attack the player for entering their radius - may be co-aggro'd.\nNon-radius-based aggro.\nRelated to co-aggro is group aggro, where a predetermined group will all aggro Paula if she attacks any of them, regardless of radius. Sometimes the group aggro is not symmetric - for instance it may be impossible to pull an elite monster without aggroing his \"friends\", but possible to pull a friend away from the elite using ranged attacks without engaging the whole group at once. This is particularly common in instances, where engaging a boss typically aggro's any remaining mobs in the room, but not vice versa.\nFinally, certain monsters may have a \"shout\" ability that aggro's other monsters within a large area, regardless of the others' aggro radii. These can sometimes pull bosses prematurely and are dangerous with any nearby monsters at all, so such monsters should be &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;led and &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ed until dead.\nFormula.\nCurrent shows the following facts:"}

SS Dam. = 1 Agility = 1 Stamina = 2 Strength = .1% Crit. = 5 Defense = .33% Dodge = .2% Parry = .13% To Hit = 2 AP = 4 Any Resist = 5 Health/5 Sec. = 50 AC\nOff Hand AEP Formula: .17 Off Hand DPS = 1 Agility = 1 Stamina = 2 Strength = .1% Crit. = 5 Defense = .33% Dodge = .2% Parry = .13% To Hit = 2 AP = 4 Any Resist = 5 Health/5 Sec. = 50 AC\nHunters.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; the formula for AEP as it pertains to &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s has changed somewhat. This information is based on WOW and has only been partially validated in play.\nFormula: 1 &lt;a href=\"Agility\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt; = .552 Crit Rating = 1 &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Power\"&gt;Attack Power&lt;/a&gt;\nPaladins.\nWith Patch 4.2, Rage of the Firelands, Death knights, paladins, and warriors no longer receive any bonus to their chance to dodge from Agility. Their base chance to dodge is now a fixed 5%.\nPrior to 4.2, 1 agility = 0.04% of dodge (if you had 50 agility you would have an added 2% dodge).\nWarriors.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s tanking in a 5-man party, 1 Agility equals:\n\"(Based on simulations by Mortem, not yet documented.)\"\nWith Patch 4.2, Rage of the Firelands, Death knights, paladins, and warriors no longer receive any bonus to their chance to dodge from Agility. Their base chance to dodge is now a fixed 5%.\nTwinking notes.\nNoticing the link to shadowpanther.net, it might be worthwhile to point out that the Crit from Agility is not as powerful as it is later in progression. A top tier level 19 Twink (as of 2.3) has white dps of around 35-40 (higher if they sacrifice HP) for their Main Hand weapon. Given that, for physical damage, 1% of crit will increase DPS by no more than .3 to .5 at that range. 1 point of Agility (for a level 19 twink) may be worth closer to 1.5 AP, as opposed to a full 2. This would mean that items such as would be worth closer to 12 AEP (perhaps surpassing the with its 11 AEP)\nThis would not affect just AP, however. The AEP value of Agility itself (and also Crit Rating) scales with 2 things: diminishing returns as player level increases, and DPS. On the other hand, Strength, Stamina, and AP all add a fixed gain."}

Named for the former Paragon of Courage &lt;a href=\"Agthia\"&gt;Agthia&lt;/a&gt;, the area was once the site of an intense battle between the &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;Ascended&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, when the latter attempted to invade the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. The Paragon's sacrifice at the height of the battle thwarted the invaders and saved Bastion from falling; in her honor, the site was preserved for eternity as a place of reflection and learning for all kyrian.\nHistory.\nWhen armies of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; launched a full-scale invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to shift the balance of the cosmos, they were met on the field of battle in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;Ascended&lt;/a&gt;, although the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; were caught off guard by the assault. As the fighting continued, Bastion's defenders began to lose ground and take heavy casualties, with the Void threatening to gain control of the whole realm. It was at this time that the Paragon of Courage, &lt;a href=\"Agthia\"&gt;Agthia&lt;/a&gt;, took command of the defense in the area that would become the Repose.\nThe invaders poured forth from gateways to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, consuming all in their path and even turning many kyrian against their brethren. Under Agthia's direction, these gateways were closed and the Void's forces pushed back under great effort, while the Paragon herself engaged the leader of the invasion known as &lt;a href=\"Tezulat%20the%20Annihilator\"&gt;Tezulat the Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing that the situation was desperate, Agthia chose to channel all of the power within and around her into a single blast of pure anima to destroy her foe. This blast was so potent that it succeeded not only in destroying Tezulat, but all of the Void's forces within Bastion, ending the invasion.\nAgthia's sacrifice was revered by all kyrian following the victory over the Void, being regarded as the ideal example of courage. The battle site, renamed Agthia's Repose, was kept in the same condition following the end of the conflict, still littered with armor and debris from the fighting. Eons later, it remained a shrine for aspirants on their journey to becoming Ascended."}

The &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt; sentinels were created to maintain titan lore repositories and titan machinery surrounding the titan city of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and Ahn'Qiraj. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Ra-den\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; learned of his &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;masters'&lt;/a&gt; fates and abandoned all hope, secluding himself in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThousands of years later, after the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;s divided the insectoid kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, the aqir that traveled southwest ransacked the titan city and renamed themselves the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;.

Upon delving into the ruined city, the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; were stirred awake and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; began, raging for several long, agonizing months. The night elves were always on the defensive, always outnumbered, and always driven back. The whole of Silithus was soon engulfed by the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their qiraji hosts. Out of desperation, the night elven leader, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, sought the aid of the elusive &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.

The dragons and &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; ultimately hatched a final, desperate plan: to contain the qiraji within the city of Ahn'Qiraj, erecting a barrier that would confine them until a more hopeful stratagem could be devised. With the blessing of Elune the barrier was erected before their eyes, rock and stone and roots from beneath the sands emerging to create an impenetrable wall. Even the winged soldiers who attempted to fly over the barrier met with an invisible obstruction that they could not pass. The qiraji who remained outside the wall were quickly slain. The dragon told Fandral that should any mortal ever wish to pass the magical barrier and access the ancient city, they need only strike the scepter against the gong and the gates would open. He then entrusted the scepter to the arch-druid.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe threat posed by the qiraji has thus remained behind its wall for thousands of years. Recently, however, the unmentionable Old God &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; slowly awakened from his slumber beneath Ahn'Qiraj. Behind the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;, the merciless qiraji stirred once again. Empowered by the Old God, C'Thun, the qiraji prepared their legions for a worldwide assault to avenge their bitter defeat at the hands of the night elves a thousand years ago. It was discovered that some of the qiraji were finding ways past the wall. &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;, helped the adventurers of Azeroth open the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; to prevent more incursions. After &lt;a href=\"Shiromar\"&gt;Shiromar&lt;/a&gt; rang the gong with the Scepter the ancient gates of Ahn'Qiraj opened, revealing the horrors of a forgotten war.\nAfter the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj were shattered, the qiraji poured forth. The combined forces of the Horde and the Alliance, with &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; as their Supreme Commander, had to stop the qiraji before they could overrun Silithus and eventually Kalimdor. The qiraji &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; commanded the opposing forces, and an endless flow of silithid and corrupted anubisaths flooded Silithus. This battle stretched across all of Kalimdor, with qiraji resonating crystals summoning the insects. Nonetheless the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was victorious. The last of the qiraji forces were defeated, retreating back to the ancient city-fortress of Ahn'Qiraj. The &lt;a href=\"Qiraji%20Resonating%20Crystals\"&gt;Qiraji Resonating Crystals&lt;/a&gt; littering Kalimdor vanish as quickly as they appeared, leaving behind nothing but sundered earth. Adventurers fought the qiraji and finally reached the chamber of C'Thun. After C'Thun was defeated &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20C%27Thun\"&gt;his remnants&lt;/a&gt; were brought to &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: the Comic.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; took shelter within the chamber of C'Thun deep inside the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj. While the Alliance and Horde were focused on defeating the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Cho'gall hung the &lt;a href=\"half-breed\"&gt;half-breed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; on the corpse of the Old God C'Thun, where Med'an would be tormented by the Old God's mad whisperings. As Cho'gall went about preparing for C'Thun's resurrection, but the power of the Old God monstrously deformed Cho'gall's body. Making their way deep into the ruined temple, Valeera Sanguinar and Meryl Winterstorm confronted the increasingly hideous Cho'gall and managed to recover Med'an. It was later revealed that Cho'gall had planned to sacrifice Med'an and use Med'an's potent magical power to resurrect C'Thun. Cho'gall began performing the rites and channeled a great deal of energy, but Med'an was able to contain it within a ward around the ogre. Restoring Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian to its rightful state, Med'an focused the powers of the council through it to defeat Cho'gall, burying him beneath the rubble of Ahn'Qiraj.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that some qiraji led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt; still reside in Ahn'Qiraj and some worship &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; defeated these qiraji before they could invade &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; and the introduction of flying in Azeroth, the outdoor, uninstanced part of Ahn'Qiraj became a zone named . It consists of a facsimile of the raid instances with no mobs or quests, similar to what was once &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. It currently serves no purpose. Accompanying these changes, the Ahn'Qiraj instances were tweaked to accommodate half of the previous number of players, though the enemies located inside are still level 60.\n\"Ahn'Qiraj: The Fallen Kingdom\" comprised two &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; instances in pre-expansion \"World of Warcraft\": The &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; (20 person) and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; (40 person). The &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; could only be opened by a series of player-driven quests (part of which was the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War%20Effort\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War Effort&lt;/a&gt;). When completed, this triggered a &lt;a href=\"World%20Event\"&gt;World Event&lt;/a&gt;, and the gates opened. Once the gates were open, the spoils of the kingdom would be available for anyone on the server who could rise to the challenge.\nAlthough the instance was not activated until &lt;a href=\"1.9\"&gt;1.9&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; (the gate to Ahn'Qiraj) has been present since early on in the game's release. Prior to \"\", the area where Ahn'Qiraj is physically located beyond the portal gates was inaccessible and there was a \"dead zone\" on the world map south of Silithus.\nWith C'Thun playing a role in \"Cataclysm\" and for example &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; dropping an item called &lt;a href=\"Membrane%20of%20C%27Thun\"&gt;Membrane of C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, it remains to be seen what will happen to Ahn'Qiraj.\nPopulation.\nThe city of Ahn'Qiraj is populated by the remaining forces of the qiraji empire. These include various forms of silithus bugs.\nSpeculation.\nAhn'Qiraj's architecture bears little resemblance to any other titan facilities but looks a lot like the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s architecture did. The qiraji presumably rebuilt it in the style of the Black Empire once they took over. Even so, they do not appear to maintain their city.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The qiraji and used this time to recover their former strength, until the point that some qiraji were finding ways to bypass the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nUnable to truly defeat the qiraji once and for all, the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the dragons &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt; ended the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; by erecting the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; and trapping the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; within the city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. Anachronos then created the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;Scarab Gong&lt;/a&gt;, two powerful artifacts needed to open the gates of Ahn'Qiraj should the need ever arise, and entrusted the scepter to Fandral. Fandral, still grieving the loss of his son at the hands of the qiraji, refused, and in his grief and rage shattered the scepter. The scepter's fragments were entrusted to &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;powerful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe threat posed by the qiraji has thus remained behind its wall for thousands of years. Recently, however, the unmentionable &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; slowly awakened from his slumber beneath &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.

Empowered by C'Thun, the qiraji prepared their legions for a worldwide assault to avenge their bitter defeat at the hands of the night elves a thousand years ago.\nPreparation.\nIt was discovered that some of the qiraji were finding ways past the wall. &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;, helped the adventurers of Azeroth open the Scarab Wall to prevent more incursions.\nIn order to oppose the qiraji, the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was raised through an unprecedented agreement between &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Regent Lord Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would combine the might of their armies. Under the command of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, they were gathered at &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in the center of the silithid hives that dominated the region.\nBut before the gates could be opened there was a lot of preparation they had to deal with: gathering war supplies and reconstructing the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Any &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; could contribute war supplies to the cause and gather hundreds of thousands of items.\nTo reassemble the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, adventurers had to acquire three shards that had been distributed to the red, blue and green dragonflights. The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Scepter%20Shard\"&gt;red shard&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted to &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, who was hunting down &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;. But after, he was beaten, broken and enslaved by Nefarian who took the scepter shard from Vaelestraz. To get the shard, adventurers had to kill Nefarian. To get the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Scepter%20Shard\"&gt;blue shard&lt;/a&gt; adventurers needed to follow ' wacky ramblings, learn draconic and killing &lt;a href=\"Maws\"&gt;Maws&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Green%20Scepter%20Shard\"&gt;green shard&lt;/a&gt; was held by the corrupted dragon &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt; worked together to purge the corruption from Eranikus and regain the green shard.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Shiromar\"&gt;Shiromar&lt;/a&gt;rang the gong with the Scepter, the ancient gates of Ahn'Qiraj opened, revealing the horrors of a forgotten war.\nOpening of the Gate.\nAfter the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj were shattered, and the qiraji poured forth. The combined forces of the Horde and the Alliance, with as their Supreme Commander, had to stop the qiraji before they could overrun &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The qiraji commanded the opposing forces, and an endless flow of &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anubisath\"&gt;Anubisath&lt;/a&gt;s flooded Silithus. This battle stretched across all of Kalimdor, with qiraji &lt;a href=\"Resonating%20Crystal%20Formation\"&gt;resonating crystals&lt;/a&gt; summoning the insects. Nonetheless the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was victorious. The last of the qiraji forces were defeated, retreating back to the ancient city-fortress of Ahn'Qiraj. The qiraji resonating crystals littering Kalimdor vanish as quickly as they appeared, leaving behind nothing but sundered earth.\nAfter that, Varok organized a two-pronged attack: the Horde held the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; of the city above while the Alliance reached the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; and slew C'thun.

There are three brightly-glowing orbs of light in the arena moving about alongside the Points of Light. Running into a brightly-glowing orb will spawn an Avenging Angel to start attacking the challenger. The angel must be attacked to below 50% health so it will Charge the player. Make sure to STOP DPS on the angel - don't kill it! While the angel is winding up a charge, move so Ahoo'ru stands between the player and the angel (and stay at least 10 yards away from Ahoo'ru), and sidestep out of the way as soon as the charge cast finishes. As long as the angel gets within a few yards of Ahoo'ru, Ahoo'ru will lose one of his three shield charges.\nTry to have two angels up at the same time, and while one is winding up a charge, start working on the second. Occasionally the points of light will collapse in a circle on Ahoo'ru and then expand outward from his position. Kite the angel to Ahooru as they expand out.\nOnce Ahoo'ru is active, immediately pop all cooldowns and start burning him. Ahoo'ru will occasionally cast a Complete Heal that must be interrupted. He will also Crusader Smash while in melee range and frequently cast Divine Circle, spawning orbs around the player that, if touched, will tick for 30,000 damage a second.\nHalf of three Avenging Angels 433K health plus Ahoo'ru's 1.6M health translates to 18,800 DPS required to beat the enrage timer at an absolute minimum.\nAchievements.\nDefeating Ahoo'ru will award the achievement &lt;a href=\"I%27ve%20Got%20the%20Biggest%20Brawls%20of%20Them%20All%20%28Season%201%29\"&gt;I've Got the Biggest Brawls of Them All (Season 1)&lt;/a&gt;, sending victors to Rank 10 in the guild."}

A player queues for the special instance through the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; or by talking to a particular event NPC in a major city. Entering the instance in this way places the party in the second room of the Slave Pens, near an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Stone%23Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Ice Stone&lt;/a&gt; which can be activated to summon Ahune.\nFight.\nAhune is NOT immune to frost. Players can continually queue for Ahune, but will only receive the &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20of%20Chilled%20Goods\"&gt;Satchel of Chilled Goods&lt;/a&gt; once per day. Those who kill Ahune for the first time will receive &lt;a href=\"Shards%20of%20Ahune\"&gt;Shards of Ahune&lt;/a&gt;, which begins a quest. Make sure to click on the item to start &lt;a href=\"Shards%20of%20Ahune%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Shards of Ahune (quest)&lt;/a&gt; before leaving the area, as the quest NPC is &lt;a href=\"Luma%20Skymother\"&gt;Luma Skymother&lt;/a&gt; inside the instance.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nThe base idea is simple: Kill adds until he submerges and nuke him down. Save cooldowns until phase 2.\nAhune will start by summoning an Ahunite Hailstone, an elite frost elemental that will need to be tanked. It has a Chilling Aura, which applies a stacking DoT effect to everyone in close to it. Ideally, only melee classes will be affected by it. Ahune also continually spawns smaller water and air elemental adds that have a small amount of hp, but hit quite hard on cloth and tend to attack whoever is on top of the global threat (which will most likely be a healer). These should be killed as fast as possible. Ahune himself only takes 10% damage during this phase. While ranged can DPS Ahune freely (albeit weakly), anyone entering melee range with Ahune will suffer a large amount of frost damage and be knocked back a significant distance. Phase 2 starts approximately 90 seconds later.\nPhase 2.\nAhune will submerge and his Frozen Core will become vulnerable. Ahune will not attack or spawn adds, even when players get within melee range. Use all cooldowns now. He will remain submerged for 30 seconds; everyone including the tank should damage the core as hard as possible, taking care to avoid the ice spears and not slip on the icy patches. When Ahune emerges, he will return to phase 1 and begin the cycle again. Each time he restarts the cycle he will spawn more adds, however, so you will need to kill him before the adds overwhelm your group.\nLoot.\nLike other holiday bosses, Ahune's drops can be sold but not disenchanted.\nThese items may appear in the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Chest\"&gt;Ice Chest&lt;/a&gt; each time Ahune is defeated each day:\nThe first kill each day will also award players a &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20of%20Chilled%20Goods\"&gt;Satchel of Chilled Goods&lt;/a&gt;, which may contain\nPrevious years' loot.\nThe following items dropped from the lower-level versions of Ahune, but are now no longer available and are listed here for historical purposes only.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; by assisting the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in return for Alterac's promised safety.\nBiography.\nAiden was a quiet-cultured looking man with graying brown hair, and hazel eyes. He was one of the human leaders at the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;councils&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and was initially reluctant to contribute to it, initially asking if the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s would be open to negotiation, before deriding &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; as urging for unity but having nothing himself to bring to such assembly. Despite the later fall of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, Perenolde stubbornly resisted calls for creating an alliance. He feared that by unifying, he would lose some of his regional power. Divisions widened between the members of the councils, and the arguments grew so heated that &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; threatened to abandon the discussions entirely. Despite his reluctance, Perenolde eventually gave in and joined the fledgling Alliance. When it came to choosing its supreme leader, Aiden suggested that brute force alone was not enough but that the commander should have intelligence, wisdom, and vision, all of which he felt he possessed in abundance. Anduin Lothar was chosen over him and the other human kings for the role, however.\nLater during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; ravaged its way through the southern realms up to the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Aiden started fearing for the safety of Alterac. He directly contacted &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; through a messenger bird and secretly met with him. Impressed that Doomhammer was able to speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, Aiden started finding the orc a cultured and honorable warrior. The two leaders negotiated an agreement: in exchange for free passage through the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and other means of help from the kingdom, Doomhammer would keep his soldiers in check and not kill Alteraci citizens or raid Alteraci settlements. The Warchief even promised that after his conquest of Lordaeron, he would place Alterac under his protection, so that none may violate it, keeping the realm safe. Pleased with this agreement, Perenolde came back to his castle and announced his general staff that starting immediately, Alterac would renege its vows with the Alliance and side with the Horde instead. Aiden even murdered a young Alliance messenger minutes after revealing the whole situation to &lt;a href=\"Hath\"&gt;General Hath&lt;/a&gt;, the commander of his army.\nPerenolde later arranged for a &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt; revolt in &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; to cover Horde mining operations there, kidnapped &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and sent &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;; which would remove the driving force from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, this treachery was discovered, and after the war &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; led Alliance troops into Alterac, declaring martial law and taking Perenolde into custody. The custody soon turned to a mere house arrest, confining Perenolde to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20palace\"&gt;his palace&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of his family on close watch, and the kingdom was put under Alliance control. As a sovereign king he could not be exiled, executed, or simply imprisoned (in order to avoid worrying the other kings that the same reaction would occur if they disagreed on anything). The other kings wanted him to abdicate his position as king, so that he could be executed as a lesser noble. However, he refused, knowing it would mean his death. His kingdom had been put under martial law as a temporary solution on &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt;'s suggestion. During an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish attack on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;New Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the Horde's defeat, Perenolde had the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; stolen by his troops in an attempt to use for future leverage. He ultimately traded it to the Horde to rid his lands of the vengeful troops of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Deathwing attacked the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; holding the troops. His son Aliden was disgusted by the action of his father, knowing it would destroy everything he had done to try to clear the family name.\nAfter the debacle, Perenolde was declared a traitor. His people were exiled from their lands, and a warrant was put on his head.\nHis position and his former lands have been fought over by his eldest son &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, his nephew &lt;a href=\"Isiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Isiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, and Lord &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAiden died at some point, but the exact time and cause of death are unknown.\nIn the RPG.\nIn Alliance Player's Guide and Dark Factions.\nAiden Perenolde was perhaps the most notorious &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; noble of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. He was in charge of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the hostilities. Perenolde was cowardly and was will weak; he betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in favor of the enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and sent ships to strike at the Alliance vulnerabilities.\nAiden was a good in using his political skills to turn people against each other.\nBiography.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the situation in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; was dire as Lord Aiden Perenolde and the rest of the ruling families of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Alterac&lt;/a&gt; secretly sided with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in exchange for power. Aiden was terri\ufb01ed of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and persuaded a number of Alterac's nobles that an orcish victory was inevitable. Thus it was that the nation of Alterac aided the Horde in a number of ways, not the least of which was allowing the orcs to march west, unhindered, from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; through the Alterac Mountains. Many good men were lost to their initial deception.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; discovered Perenolde's treachery, he sent Alliance soldiers into Alterac and declared martial law. Perenolde was ultimately captured and ousted, and other collaborators were stripped of their titles and property, then imprisoned or exiled.\nLord Aiden was left rotting in prison (where he would eventually die), and his son &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden&lt;/a&gt; attempted to assume command of the exiled Alteraci. He eventually succeeded his father and is now leading a bandit group known as the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the fallen noble families of Alterac, all seeking to reclaim their lost lands.\nIn Lands of Conflict.\nAiden Perenolde is the former lord of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Altrac&lt;/a&gt;, and is a high-ranking &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; member. He is 66, dark of skin and hair with blue eyes. Rumors say he is addicted to &lt;a href=\"flushbloom\"&gt;flushbloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAiden resides in his &lt;a href=\"Dandred%27s%20Fold\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Uplands\"&gt;Uplands&lt;/a&gt;, and is the scion of the &lt;a href=\"Perenolde%20family\"&gt;Perenolde family&lt;/a&gt;. His wife &lt;a href=\"Isolde%20Perenolde\"&gt;Isolde&lt;/a&gt; died some time ago and his oldest child, &lt;a href=\"Beve%20Perenolde\"&gt;Beve&lt;/a&gt;, is an important member of the Syndicate. She is fiercely devoted to her family but disagrees with her father on many issues. Beve thinks her leadership would be much more beneficial and since she is next on the line, it would not be bad if Aiden disappeared. She believes he is blind to her machinations, but he is well aware of her desires.\nBiography.\nAiden Perenolde grew up wealthy, never knowing need. He adored his home in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but had his eyes on &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron City&lt;/a&gt;. He held none of the lineage for the throne, even if everyone in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; died inexplicably.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded the continent of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he saw his chance to ride the wave of their destruction and claim the jewel of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as his own. And thus he betrayed the Alliance in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;'s honor has been blemished ever since.\nThe ousted nobles discovered, to their dismay, that the few bands of free &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in Lordaeron wanted nothing to do with them and refused them sanctuary, so they began stealing to stay alive. Soon they banded together to become more powerful and called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;. A haughty, fractious group led loosely by Lord Aiden Perenolde. They managed to stay alive by stealing from towns and villages, and traveling frequently.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, Aiden knew if they did not work together they would die. He managed to gain a loose hold on the prickly nobles to organize raiding parties on the local towns. Now acting as the self-proclaimed leader of the Syndicate, Lord Aiden realized he had to do something drastic to reclaim his lands. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began their assault on Lordaeron, he did not make the same mistake twice by allying himself with the enemy; he simply took advantage of the Alliance's distraction to begin moving on his lands. The harried and panicked citizens, the people they used to lord over, were frightened and confused and put up little fight, more concerned with the hellish creatures that were rampaging over the land.\nWhen Aiden regained control of his lands \u2014 and his neighbors \u2014 after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he had a burning desire to punish the Alliance (never mind that it lay shattered with the fall of Lordaeron). Due to that, he managed to urge his fellow nobles into taking more and more surrounding land, and currently the Syndicate holds a good portion of the Alterac Mountains and Arathi Highlands. He knows he is a target for the nobles who chafe under his rule and protects himself accordingly.\nWhen Lord Aiden Perenolde came up with the idea to take advantage of the Alliance's crippled state and attack neighboring lands, the Syndicate once again came under his rule, grudgingly. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Falconcrest\"&gt;Lord Falconcrest&lt;/a&gt;, who had been one of the many lesser nobles under Lord Perenolde during his reign, took over command in the Arathi Highlands. Falconcrest never liked the older man, but he admitted that Perenolde had a good idea from time to time, and thought it was a fine idea to work with the Horde. After they were exiled, Falconcrest blamed Perenolde for the loss of their holdings.\nThe Syndicate accepted bandit pledges of fealty, and thus stronger warriors and rogues brought their skills to the group. One of the smarter decisions Aiden Perenolde made for the Syndicate was to break up these bandit gangs among the noble families, giving the bandits new allegiances so the gangs could not stay together to work against the nobles. This trick worked perfectly, and most bandits went along with it for the greater reward.\nFar enough away from Perenolde's control, Falconcrest is slowly grooming the rogues under him to work against Aiden and the northern Syndicate. Falconcrest is younger than Perenolde, only in his forties, and is prepared to bide his time until he is ready.\nSpeculation.\nDeath knight.\nOne of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; heroes names in \"\" was \"Baron Perenolde\". It is unknown if this Baron was meant to be a relative of Perenolde, or Aiden Perenolde himself (by the programmers). But if Aiden was alive after \"Warcraft III\", the latter is unlikely, in which case the character may not actually exist. He may also be the nephew mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" (who was named &lt;a href=\"Isiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Isiden&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\")."}

Moreover, it's difficult to estimate where it, in any case, would have been located, due to the multiple errors related to the \"Warcraft III\" Outland map (see &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula%23In%20Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; for more info). Perhaps the ruins were intended to be the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20Shadowmoon\"&gt;Fortress Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt;, although it was located in a different location than in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\"'s Shadowmoon lands (&lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;). Alternatively, Shadowmoon Ruins could be intended to be just random ruins of the previously unknown Shadowmoon clan landholdings in Hellfire Peninsula. They may also be ruins of what was once part of the southern Peninsula, now known as Shadowmoon Valley, that had somehow crashed into Hellfire Peninsula during the world's destruction. In the TBC \"Behind the Scenes\" DVD, one of the designers stated that players had only visited Hellfire Peninsula during \"Warcraft III\". However, as the Shadowmoon Ruins were not actually visited, it's still possible they are part of another zone.\nWhat the TFT designers had originally intended is unclear."}

It is the location of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; (where &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; resides), and also houses a dwarven settlement named after (and led by) &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the prison where Illidan's former jailor, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, is held captive. It is one of the darkest, bleakest, and most &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-affected regions in the \"Warcraft\" universe, second only to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. The sky is always black and ghastly yellow, lightened up by the never-ceasing rain of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nShadowmoon Valley was once a lush moor engulfed in eternal night and lit by Draenor's two moons. This gave the entire land a relaxing, bluish hue that was reflected by its plant life. Roughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s began to migrate out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them gathered in the region, naming themselves after the valley and creating the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;. For centuries the orcs peacefully charted the stars and practiced their shamanistic and runic magic.\nSix-hundred years later, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; crash-landed on Draenor aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". During the crash the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt; was injured, which caused it to enter the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; state of the naaru lifecycle. K'ara's final act was to convince the draenei to eject it from the vessel. K'ara was ejected from the \"Genedar\" and came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Star\"&gt;Dark Star&lt;/a&gt; to the orcs of the valley. Because of both the Void's power to defile the dead and that those few who accessed K'ara's shadowy power directly had their minds shattered, the ancient chieftain of the Shadowmoon clan outlawed its powers after the discovery of the Dark Star. After settling properly on Draenor, the draenei built their sacred &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; on the coast of Shadowmoon Valley, making the region the spiritual capital of draenei society.\nAll this changed, of course, when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; made contact with &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; centuries later. The orcs became more aggressive, attacking innocent draenei for no apparent reason. Under demonic influence all the orc clans were united as the bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;; backed by powerful Void and &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;Fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, this Horde assaulted and destroyed the draenei settlements all across Draenor; Shadowmoon included. Gul'dan also used his mighty warlock magic to raise a &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;fel-tainted volcano&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of the valley to sever the orcs' link to the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;. They then converged on the Temple of Karabor. To overcome its defenses, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; performed a ritual to summon the power of the dark naaru K'ara. A great column of Void energy crashed down upon the temple, warping its architecture, causing the instant deaths of hundreds of draenei, while driving others to madness as the Void lords' whispers overcame them. When the Void energy dissipated, the Horde easily dispatched most of the stragglers and the site was renamed the Black Temple, and served as the base of the Shadow Council.\nThe volcano, called the Hand of Gul'dan, and the Black Temple's chain of fel rulers has transformed the lush valley into a blackened wasteland under a perpetual haze of black and green smoke and dotted with flows of green lava and green-tinted water.\nInvasion of Draenor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Valley in order to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20Shadowmoon\"&gt;fortress of the Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; and its dark order of &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nOnce Draenor was transformed into Outland and the Legion began to see potential in these shattered remnants, Shadowmoon became perpetually bombarded by infernals summoned by the demon lords seeking to scour any remaining life from it. When Illidan defeated Magtheridon, the leader of the Legion's efforts in Outland, and returned from his failure to destroy the Frozen Throne, these demons converged on the Black Temple and began to lay siege to it on orders from Kil'jaeden who wished to see Illidan punished for his failures. Some of these demons turned on the Legion and began serving Illidan, thanks to a mysterious source of magic within the temple and Shadowmoon became the center of a demonic civil war. Ironically, the Burning Legion began making anti-demonic weaponry themselves in order to fight the Illidari.\nEven after Illidan's death and the return of the temple to the draenei under Akama, it seems Shadowmoon is unlikely to recover the twilit beauty it once possessed and remains one of the grimmest reminders of what the Burning Legion is capable of. However, the valley still retains some waning lunar energies from before Draenor's destruction.\nGeography.\nShadowmoon Valley is a barren wasteland of rock and ash, with little vegetation. The &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; volcano dominates the center, from which green lava erupts.\nThe Alliance and Horde each have a settlement here, as do the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe valley contains one raid instance (the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;) and several elite areas.\nResources.\n&lt;a href=\"Herbs\"&gt;Herbs&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Leather\"&gt;Leather&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Metal\"&gt;Metal&lt;/a&gt;s\n&lt;a href=\"Cloth\"&gt;Cloth&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dig%20site\"&gt;Dig site&lt;/a&gt;s \nOther"}

A lush valley engulfed in eternal night, the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Lady\"&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt; shines so brightly here that it even replaced the sun as the valley's primary light source during the day. Shadowmoon serves as one of the key centers of draenei civilization on the world of Draenor, its heart being the sacred temple of &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. Lately, the Iron Horde began advancing on the draenei settlements through the and naval attacks targeting Karabor itself.\nThe Alliance expedition arrives in the zone after the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;introductory mission&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, which involves the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntroduction.\nShadowmoon Valley is a very distinctive land, located in southeastern Draenor. The valley's bright daytime isn't caused by Draenor's sun, unlike other lands of the planet, but its larger moon illuminating its vast, lush landscape and starry skies - hence its name. It features blue-ish flora, vast plains and rocky mountains, as well as numerous draenei settlements - including the sacred temple of Karabor. The valley is populated with majestic beasts of the primordial world, such as &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nether%20ray\"&gt;nether ray&lt;/a&gt;s and others.\nIt also features a mushroom forest named &lt;a href=\"Umbrafen\"&gt;Umbrafen&lt;/a&gt; at the northern coastline, much like the other regions of Draenor. The southern coastline leads to the &lt;a href=\"Evanescent%20Sea\"&gt;Evanescent Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe orcish Shadowmoon clan, led by Ner'zhul also populates the region and seemingly have practiced their magic for some time, and are possibly the ones who erected the stone obelisks dotting some parts of the valley. After the Iron Horde began their march against the draenei civilization, the Shadowmoon Clan also participated as part of the greater orcish union that intended to consolidate their race's power over their homeworld, and later - the worlds beyond. The Shadowmoon clan is also notable for dabbling into the void magics.\nNot all orcs share the Shadowmoon clan's fascination with void magics, though. The &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Exiles\"&gt;Shadowmoon Exiles&lt;/a&gt; have split from the Shadowmoon clan, seeking a peaceful life for themselves and trying to co-operate with the draenei and recently arrived Alliance forces, even if it means killing their former tribesmen in order to prevent greater bloodshed.\nQuests.\nChapter 1: Establishing a Foothold.\nAfter landing on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the champion, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; rescued from the were greeted by , who was eager for allies against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Velen led the champion to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt;, a commanding position at which the Alliance might build a base. Khadgar opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; for reinforcements and supplies and through it came a small army of footmen and peasants ready to break ground. Construction was briefly interrupted by attacks by local fauna, but the champion subdued the local wildlife and the garrison was completed.\nChapter 2: Shadows Awaken.\nWith the garrison constructed, Yrel asked the champion to accompany her back to her home of &lt;a href=\"Embaari%20Village\"&gt;Embaari Village&lt;/a&gt;. When they arrived, Yrel introduced the champion to her sister &lt;a href=\"Samaara\"&gt;Samaara&lt;/a&gt;, who was overjoyed and a little surprised to see her younger sister was still alive. However, they learned that the nearby village of &lt;a href=\"Arbor%20Glen\"&gt;Arbor Glen&lt;/a&gt; was under siege by the . The champion left to stop the invasion and rescue survivors, joining with Velen and Yrel to confront at the &lt;a href=\"Teluuna%20Observatory\"&gt;Teluuna Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. Ner'zhul kidnapped Samaara and summoned the void lord &lt;a href=\"Karnoth\"&gt;Karnoth&lt;/a&gt; to distract the champion while he made his escape.\nChapter 3: A Sister's Sacrifice.\nThe champion, Velen and Yrel traveled to &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Glade\"&gt;Twilight Glade&lt;/a&gt;, a village near the Shadowmoon capital of &lt;a href=\"Shaz%27gul\"&gt;Shaz'gul&lt;/a&gt;. In spite of Yrel's doubts, Velen placed Yrel in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; of the area with orders to sabotage the Shadowmoon camp and rescue the captives. While Yrel and the Rangari performed reconnaissance on Shaz'gul, Velen prepared a prophetic elixir to peer into the future of &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; with the champion's assistance. In their shared vision, Velen and the champion saw the Dark Star, a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; allied with the Iron Horde rain destruction upon Karabor as an endless stream of Iron Horde soldiers invaded the city and slaughtered its defenders. Velen and the champion both resolved to prevent this catastrophe, and the champion left to assist Yrel with the infiltration of Shaz'gul while Velen contemplated their next move.\nYrel and the champion disguised themselves as Shadowmoon orcs and infiltrated Shaz'gul. The champion placed explosives in key locations around the city and attempted to rescue the captive draenei, but the captives had already been moved to &lt;a href=\"Anguish%20Fortress\"&gt;Anguish Fortress&lt;/a&gt; before they arrived. The failure to rescue the captives hit Yrel particularly hard, and it was only the depth of the champion's experiences on Azeroth that gave her the courage to detonate the bombs. Their cover blown, the champion and Yrel then fled the ruined city for Twilight Glade.\nWhen Yrel and the champion returned, Velen informed them that they were going to seek the help of and the other exiles of the Shadowmoon. The champion traveled to &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Exile's Rise&lt;/a&gt; on Velen's behalf. When the champion arrived, Rulkan explained that Ner'zhul seeks the power of the Dark Star because had threatened to wipe the Shadowmoon out if they didn't join the Iron Horde. The Shadowmoon were a simple and spiritual tribe of nomads that did not have anything to contribute to the Horde in martial might or weaponry, so Ner'zhul opted to offer the only thing they had: magic. He led the Shadowmoon away from their ancestor worship and into necromancy and dark magic, violating all of the Shadowmoon's ancient taboos to prove his loyalty to the Iron Horde and stay the wrath of the Warchief. Rulkan than gave the champion her keystone to open the entrance to Anguish Fortress.\nThe champion led the attack on Anguish Fortress, using the keystone to disable its magical barrier from the inside, defeating the void creatures the Shadowmoon had summoned with the souls of their ancestors and the captured Draenei and rescuing the draenei captives that had not been sacrificed yet. However, Samaara was not among the rescued captives. With the defenses disabled, Yrel and Velen joined the champion to confront Ner'zhul at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Terrace of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;. Before they could act, Ner'zhul sacrificed Samaara to summon the void lord &lt;a href=\"Arkeddon\"&gt;Arkeddon&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate to Grom Hellscream what the Dark Star was capable of. Ner'zhul and Grom left to begin their preparations for the invasion of Karabor while the champion, Yrel and Velen destroyed Arkeddon. After Arkeddon was defeated, Samaara lay dying at the ritual altar. As Samaara died in her arms, Yrel resolved to work with the champion destroy the Iron Horde.\nChapter 4: The Light Prevails.\nWith Ner'zhul beginning the ritual to control the Dark Star at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Light's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, Velen sent the champion ahead to delay the ritual long enough for him to prepare to stop it. The champion confronted and fought Ner'zhul at Light's Fall. As Ner'zhul began to weaken, Velen arrived and told Ner'zhul that he could still turn from the path of destruction and that the draenei would protect him. Ner'zhul refused, saying that he could no longer redeem himself. Ner'zhul then summoned a &lt;a href=\"Void%20Horror\"&gt;Void Horror&lt;/a&gt; in a last ditch effort to forestall the champion. The void beast bought Ner'zhul the time he needed to complete the ritual and Ner'zhul summoned the Dark Star in triumph. With the knowledge of what the Dark Star would do to Karabor if left unchecked, Velen knew must be done. He gravely looked at Yrel and passed her the prophetic sigil he bore, anointing her the leader of the draenei and sacrificed himself to restore the Light in the naaru and defeat the Dark Star.\nWhile Ner'zhul's plan was thwarted, Maraad arrived with grave news\u2014Karabor's defense crystal had fallen. Maraad urged Yrel and the champion to gather up the draenei survivors and flee. Yrel refused, resolving that Velen's sacrifice would be in vain if Karabor fell anyway. She and the champion gathered up the survivors and departed to Karabor to break the siege. On wings of &lt;a href=\"fey%20dragon\"&gt;fey dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, Yrel, Maraad and the champion broke the siege at Karabor's gates and fought through the city until they reached the docks.\nThanks to Velen's sacrifice at Light's Fall, the naaru that was the Dark Star, was on the other side of the battle from the vision at Twilight Glade. The champion and Yrel protected K'ara while he prepared a devastating counterattack. &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Vorka\"&gt;Commander Vorka&lt;/a&gt; himself attacked K'ara to stop her, but the champion and Yrel overcame his assault. With the Iron Horde's forces breaking, K'ara unleased the Light upon the Iron Fleet in the harbor, sinking their ships and vanquishing the remaining assault.\nAfter resting from their victory, Yrel mailed the champion &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%27s%20Arcanum\"&gt;The Prophet's Arcanum&lt;/a&gt;, which the champion used at Karabor to receive a message from Velen. Velen's memories told the champion that Dark Star was in fact K'ara, ejected from the &lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt; when it crashed upon Draenor. Velen had kept this a secret, worried what the knowledge might do in the wrong hands. Ner'zhul and the Shadowmoon had independently discovered this, and Velen needed to give his life\u2014his Light\u2014to redeem K'ara and stop Ner'zhul.\nDungeon: Shadowmoon Burial Grounds.\nThough they were defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Defense of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul and his closest allies retreated deeper into the Anguish Fortress to revive the souls of the dead and attack Karabor again. The champions of the Alliance and Horde invaded and defeated Ner'zhul and his lieutenants, ending the Shadowmoon threat once and for all.\nSidestory: The Pursuit of Justice.\nWith their garrison built, the Alliance champion and Vindicator Maraad quickly realized that garrison's ever-growing army was going to quickly run out of food. Maraad contacted &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Akama\"&gt;Exarch Akama&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elodor\"&gt;Elodor&lt;/a&gt; about sharing in their harvest. Akama agreed, provided that the champion supply additional labor to help with the harvest. A caravan led by &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Zipfizzle\"&gt;Foreman Zipfizzle&lt;/a&gt; set off to Elodor with labor and plans to return with food.\nThe champion and most of the caravan arrived in Elodor unscathed, but the wagon Maraad was riding in fell behind. When it didn't turn up with the rest, the champion and Akama went back across the plain to find it. When they found it, they learned the Shadowmoon had ambushed them. The farmers were panicked, but Akama encouraged them to stand their ground, as even a sickle is a powerful weapon when wielded with the force of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; behind it. The Shadowmoon repeatedly attacked as the champion, Akama, Maraad and the farmers made the rest of the way to Elodor, but there were no casualties of the champion's company.\nAfter arriving in Elodor, Akama and Maraad left to meet the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt; while the champion was introduced to Exarch Hataaru and helped him repair Elodor's defense crystal. A brief attack by the Shadowmoon followed, which the champion and the Elodor defenders quickly repelled. While the defense crystal was proven fully operational, the alien technology agitated the local fungi and an &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20Fungal%20Giant\"&gt;Enraged Fungal Giant&lt;/a&gt; attacked it shortly after the Shadowmoon retreated. After the champion and Elodor defenders subdued it, the champion was brought to the Council by Maraad. The Exarchs greeted the champion genially but cautiously. The champion resolved to win the trust of the Exarchs by assisting them with their own pressing concerns\u2014Exarch Hataaru with a malfunctioning crystal in the &lt;a href=\"Elodor%20Dig\"&gt;Elodor Dig&lt;/a&gt; and with a poisonous spore population in the &lt;a href=\"Umbrafen\"&gt;Umbrafen&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the champion returned to the council, however, they found Maladaar had gone missing. When the champion found Malaadar, he said that he was worried that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had infiltrated the city. With Maladaar's help, the champion tracked down a Legion hideout in a cave under the city and killed a demon that was hiding there. When the champion went to the Council to report what they had discovered they found Exarch Hataaru dead. Maladaar took investigating Hataaru's assassination into his own hands and with the help of &lt;a href=\"Soulbinder%20Nyami\"&gt;Soulbinder Nyami&lt;/a&gt; was able to commune with Hataaru's spirit. Maladaar asked why Hataaru was killed and Hataaru said it was under an Exarch's orders. When Maladaar asked Hataaru who had him killed, Hataaru's spirit pointed at Nyami and Nyami abruptly ended the ritual, saying that his spirit was in great agony.\nMaladaar provided the champion with a device to install upon &lt;a href=\"Exarch%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Exarch's Rise&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the traitor. When the champion used the device, it revealed that &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Othaar\"&gt;Exarch Othaar&lt;/a&gt; was the traitor. Othaar had taken a new name as a &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt;--Socrethar and fought the champion until he became weak and retreated. For the champion's efforts on their behalf, the Council resolved to support the Alliance fully and permitted the champion to hire a follower from Elodor for their garrison to serve as their ambassador.\nSidestory: Gloomshade Grove.\n&lt;a href=\"Ken%20Loggin\"&gt;Ken Loggin&lt;/a&gt; informed the champion that &lt;a href=\"Shelly%20Hamby\"&gt;Shelly Hamby&lt;/a&gt; and her crew of lumberjacks traveled to &lt;a href=\"Gloomshade%20Grove\"&gt;Gloomshade Grove&lt;/a&gt; to harvest lumber but haven't returned in several days. The champion decided to investigate. Outside the grove, the champion found a pack mule used by the crew that was suspiciously unattended. After entering the grove, the champion met a &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Phlox\"&gt;Phlox&lt;/a&gt; who helped the champion follow a trail of clues to a grotto along the beach. Here, Phlox revealed that he had captured the lumberjacks and attempted to kill the champion. Phlox was easily overcome, and the champion found &lt;a href=\"Jarrod%20Hamby\"&gt;Jarrod Hamby&lt;/a&gt; dying in the cave behind where Phlox attacked them.\nJarrod explained to the champion that the podlings ate &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Metcalf%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Ryan Metcalf&lt;/a&gt; and that he was mortally wounded himself. Jarrod died, asking the champion to kill the podling king, &lt;a href=\"King%20Deathbloom\"&gt;Deathbloom&lt;/a&gt;. The champion killed many of podlings in vengeance for their murdered peasants and assassinated Deathbloom at his lair. The champion found Shelly Hamby bound in vines nearby. After releasing her, Shelly broke down about her husband's murder and swore to serve the champion as a follower as long as she gets to kill as many podlings as possible.\nSidestory: Purifying the Gene Pool.\nThe champion was asked by &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Gehaar\"&gt;Farmer Gehaar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Teluuna%20Observatory\"&gt;Teluuna Observatory&lt;/a&gt; to visit the &lt;a href=\"Draakorium\"&gt;Draakorium&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the recent aggressive activities of the &lt;a href=\"Botani\"&gt;Botani&lt;/a&gt; in the Southern region of the valley. Upon arriving there, the champion met with &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Reenu\"&gt;Prelate Reenu&lt;/a&gt; who sent them into the bog to investigate a caravan that had been recently attacked. The champion found &lt;a href=\"Fiona\"&gt;Fiona&lt;/a&gt;'s caravan at the entrance to the bog and &lt;a href=\"Gidwin%20Goldbraids\"&gt;Gidwin Goldbraids&lt;/a&gt; poisoned by local flora. The champion collected local herbs and chemicals and helped Fiona prepare a remedy for the poison.\nWith Gidwin cured, the champion and &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20Arepheon\"&gt;Rangari Arepheon&lt;/a&gt; ventured deeper into the bog to determine why the Botani had become more aggressive lately. They found an immature &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; growing deep in the grove\u2014the Botani were collecting corpses to help it grow. The champion and Arepheon then slew the genesaur before it could mature to stop the attacks. Fiona, again impressed with the champion's capabilities and thankful for the assistance in saving Gidwin, joined the champion as a follower.\nSidestory: On the Shadow's Trail.\nAfter the events in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt; delivered the champion a request to meet &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; at his own camp at the &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Outpost\"&gt;Starfall Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar has tracked 's to the nearby village of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27var\"&gt;Gul'var&lt;/a&gt; and tasks the champion and Cordana with capturing an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; from the village that they can use to spy on the warlocks. After capturing the demon, the champion broke its will, and used it to watch a secret meeting between Gul'dan, &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; and . Teron'gor was dispatched to attack in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; while Cho'gall left to assault . Gul'dan discovered quickly the observer's duplicity and annihilated it to the champion's horror.\nWhile updates on Teron'gor's and Cho'gall's activities were interesting, Khadgar believed this might be a good opportunity to capture Gul'dan. He sent the champion back to Gul'var to kill some of the warlock's other lieutenants and a demon they had summoned to create a device to subdue him.\nWhen the champion confronted Gul'dan at &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Rise\"&gt;Shadow Rise&lt;/a&gt; nearby, Gul'dan struggled briefly but overcame the attempt to imprison him. He forced &lt;a href=\"Razuun\"&gt;Razuun&lt;/a&gt; to attack his assailant. While the champion quickly defeated Razuun, Gul'dan escaped to Talador to assist Teron'gor with his plan. The champion returned to Starfall Outpost to report the failure to Khadgar. While mulling over the results, appeared from the shadows to attack Khadgar, who used &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; just in time to protect himself.

After Ner'zhul inadvertently ripped Draenor apart, many of the remaining Shadowmoon became &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and entered the service of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nRoughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs began to migrate out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadowmoon clan formed in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, far from major &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian&lt;/a&gt; settlements, allowing them to live in relative peace. The clan named itself after the valley, and not the other way around.\nShadowmoon mystics frequently set out on pilgrimages across the world, hoping to hear the will of the divine. Many of these travelers received strange dreams and visions near the mountains of northwestern &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, which unbeknownst to the orcs was the final resting place of &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt; and a place infused with &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; energies. The first Shadowmoon visitors to the location learned about the world's primordial spirits of fire, air, earth and water. They treated these beings with utmost respect and named the site of their discovery the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs flocked to Grond's remains and learned to guide the elemental spirits with a sense of harmony, becoming the first orcish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadowmoon were the first to dedicate themselves to the elements and transformed Grond's head into a crude temple. They soon began spreading their teachings to the other clans, nearly all of which adopted the practice. The shaman became highly trusted spiritual leaders among the orcs, able to peacefully solve conflicts between clans. The Shadowmoon clan began a biannual gathering of shaman called the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival, which soon grew to include all orcs.\n400 years before the First War, &lt;a href=\"Nelgarm\"&gt;Nelgarm&lt;/a&gt; was an elder shaman of the Shadowmoon clan. He was the one to convince the orc clans into banding together against the Gorian Empire when the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s' meddling with the Throne of the Elements threw the elements out of balance and threatened to cause irreversible harm to the world.\nThe Dark Star.\n200 years before the First War, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; crash-landed on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in their vessel, the \"&lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\", and in the process ejected the darkened &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt; from the ship. Some time thereafter, a great white crystal landed in the plains below a Shadowmoon village. The orcs did not know what it was and wondered if it was a sign from their ancestors. Shortly afterward, K'ara's remains appeared in the sky as a shadow beneath the pale moon and was met with both adoration and fear by the orcs. The clan gave it many names, such as \"great father\" or \"dark mother\". The clan mystics referred to it as the \"Dark Star\" and worshipped it as a deity. The Shadowmoon soon found that their power had grown in ways they did not fully understand, and they began to hear the \"voice of shadow\" in addition to the languages of the stars and earth. A few bold shaman tried to access K'ara's shadowy power, but the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energies shattered their minds. When a clan member was found defiling the spirits of the ancestors, the chieftain declared that the Dark Star and its magic were evil and dangerous and would lead the clan down a path from which they could not return. It was decreed that the Dark Star's powers of shadow were forbidden to the Shadowmoon. Anyone who tried to wield them was sharply rebuked, and if they continued they would be immediately exiled far from Shadowmoon Valley.\nRise of the Horde.\nAround 11 years before the First War, the Shadowmoon were led by the wise chieftain &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, who was respected by every clan. He acted as an advisor to all shaman and helped foster the loose bonds between the different clans. One day, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, an orc exile who had agreed to a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, approached the Shadowmoon and claimed that his home village had been destroyed by ogres. The Shadowmoon took pity on him and accepted him into their clan. Gul'dan managed to win Ner'zhul's friendship, even convincing the chieftain to accept him as his own apprentice. This allowed Gul'dan's demonic master &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to begin manipulating Ner'zhul by appearing in the elder shaman's dreams disguised as his deceased mate, &lt;a href=\"Rulkan\"&gt;Rulkan&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Gul'dan incited a conflict between the draenei and the orcish &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20clan\"&gt;Bladewind clan&lt;/a&gt; that culminated in a massacre of the largest Bladewind village. Gul'dan killed the few orc survivors and returned to the Shadowmoon with tales of an unprovoked slaughter against the Bladewinds on behalf of the draenei. \"Rulkan\" had warned Ner'zhul that the draenei planned to destroy the orcs, and the chieftain sent a summons for a great clan meeting at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, where the orcish chieftains agreed to band together into the first &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and march to war against the draenei.\nHowever, as the months of war between orc and draenei progressed, Ner'zhul gradually began to feel doubts about the Horde's purpose and the increasing bloodlust of his people and secretly journeyed to Oshu'gun for guidance from the spirits. Kil'jaeden was aware of this and ordered Gul'dan to gather allies to take control of the Shadowmoon clan, since Ner'zhul could no longer be relied upon. Gul'dan recruited the young shaman &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; and taught him the ways of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, and slowly won other shaman to his side as well. At Oshu'gun, Ner'zhul was condemned by the real Rulkan and the other ancestors, who told him that he had been deceived by Kil'jaeden. The shaman fell into despair and was captured by Gul'dan's new followers on his way back to Shadowmoon Valley. The warlocks treated him as little more than a slave, and as Ner'zhul gradually faded from the public eye, his usurpers became the voice of the Shadowmoon clan. Gul'dan's trusted Shadowmoon warlocks would later form the initial members and inner circle of the secretive order known as the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Shadowmoon were among the clans assigned to act as scouts, raiders and auxiliary forces that could quickly move from one region of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to another.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nFollowing the Horde's defeat on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul rallied the clans still left on Draenor under his &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;new banner&lt;/a&gt;. Aided by the Shadowmoon clan, he planned to open portals to new worlds for the orcs to conquer using four artifacts: the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. The latter three objects corresponded to three Draenic &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt;s, and using them in conjunction with a celestial event would give Ner'zhul the power to open portals to other worlds. During this time, the Shadowmoon ruled over the scattered orcish clans, and Ner'zhul kept the other clans subjugated through fear and brute force. After many battles with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army known as the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul gathered some of the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s and a number of Shadowmoon orcs atop the largest tower of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; to begin the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;Spell of Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;. Ner'zhul tapped into the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s beneath the Black Temple, but he was woefully unprepared for the amount of skill needed for the ritual. His desperation and recklessness caused the energies to spiral out of command. Countless holes through the fabric of reality were blasted open, causing Draenor to begin to destabilize and break apart. Ner'zhul and a few of his closest Shadowmoon and death knight followers escaped through the nearest portal, and shortly thereafter the world ripped apart.\nOn the other side of the portal, Ner'zhul and his companions entered the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, where they were captured by Kil'jaeden. Kil'jaeden gruesomely tortured Ner'zhul for some time before remaking him into the spectral &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. His loyal death knights and Shadowmoon followers were also transformed by the demon's chaotic energies, being ripped apart and remade into skeletal &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es to ensure that even in death, they would serve Ner'zhul unquestioningly.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nMany Shadowmoon orcs survived Draenor's transformation into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and eventually transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, coming into the service of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Shadowmoon forces, mainly spellcasters in the form of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, are found in both the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The Blood Furnace specifically houses &lt;a href=\"Keli%27dan%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Keli'dan the Breaker&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Channeler\"&gt;Shadowmoon channelers&lt;/a&gt; charged with keeping the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; contained, as well as &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Technician\"&gt;technicians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Adept\"&gt;adepts&lt;/a&gt; using Magtheridon's blood to transform captured &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s into new fel orcs.\nIn Shadowmoon Valley, the fel orcs of the Shadowmoon clan occupied &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20Terrace\"&gt;Ata'mal Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, once a very holy &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; site where &lt;a href=\"ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;s were used in spiritual ceremonies. There, they guarded the ata'mal crystal known as the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Heart of Fury&lt;/a&gt;, clouding its presence with dark magic to keep it from the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;. For this reason, the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; forces at the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Sha%27tar\"&gt;Altar of Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; had reason to believe that the orcs were hiding an ata'mal crystal in the vicinity, but their scrying revealed nothing. Regardless, the fel orcs occupied draenei holy ground and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Aluumen\"&gt;Vindicator Aluumen&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to deal with their presence.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryer&lt;/a&gt;-controlled &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Sanctum of the Stars&lt;/a&gt; suffered a tremendous attack by the fel orcs, and the attack was determined to have been perpetrated by the Shadowmoon forces at Ata'mal Terrace. &lt;a href=\"Varen%20the%20Reclaimer\"&gt;Varen the Reclaimer&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers to show them that the Scryers were not to be trifled with. &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; asked adventurers to retrieve the Heart of Fury from &lt;a href=\"Shadowlord%20Deathwail\"&gt;Shadowlord Deathwail&lt;/a&gt; in order to create a &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;:Medallion of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently built &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in an area once considered ancestral grounds for the Shadowmoon orcs. The spirits of the clan lay dormant for nearly twenty years, but were recently riled up by something. &lt;a href=\"Zorus%20the%20Judicator\"&gt;Zorus the Judicator&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"Ever-Burning%20Ash\"&gt;ever-burning ash&lt;/a&gt; gathered by an adventurer to create a pair of &lt;a href=\"%3Aspectrecles\"&gt;:spectrecles&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the adventurer to see the ghosts, and asked them to destroy the spirits.\nIn the month before the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a force of Shadowmoon fel orcs led by &lt;a href=\"Grimbak%20Shadowrage\"&gt;Grimbak Shadowrage&lt;/a&gt; accompanied &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; when he ventured to &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; to gather souls for a portal to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being the one clan in Illidan's service who were the most accustomed to dark magic, Illidan noticed that the orcs seemed unnerved by the ruined tomb-city. All of the fel orcs, including Grimbak, were slain during the subsequent battle with the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s defending the area.\nA large number of Shadowmoon fel orcs can be found serving the death knight &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as Teron'gor, at &lt;a href=\"Gorefiend%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Gorefiend's Vigil&lt;/a&gt; in the Black Temple.\n&lt;a href=\"Smith%20Hauthaa\"&gt;Smith Hauthaa&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; later asked adventurers to retrieve a special ore that the Shadowmoon had dug up from the Ata'mal Terrace area and used to create corrupted weapons and armor. The adventurers were to bring the corrupted armaments to Hauthaa's blessed anvil to be broken and purified before handing the cleansed results to her.\nShadowlands.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the wound inflicted on &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; bears similarity to the dark magic of the Shadowmoon clan.\nDragonflight.\n&lt;a href=\"Relka%20Bloodfyre\"&gt;Relka Bloodfyre&lt;/a&gt;, the last &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; of the Shadowmoon clan, shows up to the first Azerothian &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. She considered the Shadowmoons a dead clan.\nCulture.\nThe Shadowmoon were known to be the most spiritual of all the orc clans, and were relatively peaceful compared to other orcs. Fascinated with the starry sky, the Shadowmoon believed they could glean the future from stellar movements. They were a deeply mystical people, and they developed traditions and rituals centered around &lt;a href=\"Astromancy\"&gt;astrology&lt;/a&gt; and ancestor worship. A key source of the Shadowmoon clan's power came from their understanding of the stars and their omens. For centuries, they recorded the patterns of the stars and their interpretations. This expertise in astronomy eventually led to &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; awaiting a celestial event that only happened every five hundred and forty-seven years to cast his &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;Spell of Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, involving three of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt;s alongside one of its &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShadowmoon mystics often inscribed secret runes into their flesh using ceremonial bone needles to more clearly speak to their ancestors and the elemental spirits. Consultation with the spirits of previous generations was considered essential to Shadowmoon shaman whenever an important decision was to be made. Talismans and other relics that were important to an ancestor during life provided a more clear spiritual conduit for shaman to speak to them in the afterlife. The clan's shaman frequently journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; to commune with the elemental spirits.\nIdols carved from &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt; ivory, inlaid with complex swirling and jagged patterns, were known to have been used during the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; worship once practiced by the clan.\nOf all the orcish clans in the service of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the Shadowmoon &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s were the ones most accustomed to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and dark sorcery. The Shadowmoons were able to cast a special malady on the mind of their victims. Even if their flesh was mended, their afflicted spirits went closer and closer to death. This curse could be removed by finding the object used to poison the spirit and shatter it. This was similar to &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; sorcery.\nThe Shadowmmon clan cooked with the local ingredients found in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, though due to its destruction many of these have been lost. One such recipe is &lt;a href=\"Grilled%20Shade%20Salmon\"&gt;Grilled Shade Salmon&lt;/a&gt;, a shadow-touched &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Salmon\"&gt;Shade Salmon&lt;/a&gt; cooked with salt, spice, cooking oil, &lt;a href=\"Moonfruit\"&gt;Moonfruit&lt;/a&gt; juice and crushed &lt;a href=\"Starflowers\"&gt;Starflowers&lt;/a&gt;, which is usually served with steamed &lt;a href=\"Umbracaps\"&gt;Umbracaps&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft II.\nLeader: &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;\nColor: Black\nThe nefarious Shadow Moon clan rules over the scattered &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Although the clans Draenor do not maintain the unity of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul keeps these houses subjugated through fear and brute force. The Shadow Moon is heavily influenced by ancient shamanistic principles and exemplifies the raw power of the dark &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt;."}

A key source of the Shadowmoon clan's power came from their understanding of the stars and their omens. For centuries, they recorded the patterns of the stars and their interpretations. They were profoundly linked to the spiritual world and had many &lt;a href=\"seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt;s, astrologers, and speakers of the dead among their ranks.\nHistory.\nThe Shadowmoon clan have always derived their magic from the stars, earth, and moon. Communing with the ancestors is extremely important and often done through &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Talisman\"&gt;Ancestral Talisman&lt;/a&gt;s of the ancestors, as well as &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20Tattoo%20Needles\"&gt;ceremonial tattoos&lt;/a&gt; for clearer communication with the ancestral and &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; spirits.\nSeveral centuries ago, when the \"\" arrived on Draenor, the Shadowmoon clan witnessed the crash in the sky. A piece of the ship crashed down in Shadowmoon Valley, and soon afterward a shadow appeared in the sky that came to be known as the Dark Star by the orcs; in reality, the Dark Star was the naaru in a &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; state, ejected from the \"Genedar\" during the crash.\nBy observing the Dark Star, the Shadowmoon clan discovered the powers of the Void. But when orcs began to use the shadow powers to defile the spirits of their sacred ancestors, the chieftain outlawed the shadows and the magic of the Dark Star.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThree centuries later, before the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Shadowmoons were still largely peaceful, but eventually became reclusive as the conflict approached, withdrawing into their fortifications. When the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; began its march across Draenor, the clan's chieftain Ner'zhul was given an ultimatum by : join or die. The Shadowmoon were not a war-like clan by tradition, but Ner'zhul joined with the Iron Horde in order to save the lives of his clansmen. Hellscream also ordered Ner'zhul to provide a worthy form of power or else he would kill the Shadowmoon anyway, as he lacked interest in their astrological and prophetic traditions. Ner'zhul, with the fate of his clan on the line, broke the ancient laws and called on the power of the Dark Star, gaining mastery over the Void. Using the Void, the Shadowmoon clan raises undead and calls in creatures of shadow to battle their foes. Their nobility has been sacrificed for necromantic power, making them little different from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; that a &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;different version of Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;once commanded&lt;/a&gt;.\nA faction of discontent orcs, led by Ner'zhul's mate , still stands by the old laws that ban Void magic and have formed the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Exiles\"&gt;Shadowmoon Exiles&lt;/a&gt; to combat Ner'zhul's followers.\n&lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; sends the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Shadowmoon Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt; to investigate Ner'zhul's early studies on how to bind souls and control the undead, referring to the void-using Shadowmoon orcs as &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Impsy\"&gt;Impsy&lt;/a&gt; also sends the adventurer into Shadowmoon Burial Ground because things happening on Draenor are causing ripples in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and requires a &lt;a href=\"Void-Gate%20Key\"&gt;Void-Gate Key&lt;/a&gt; twice to prevent the worlds from collapsing into the void (both times). It seems at some point, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had fought against these Shadowmoon clan orcs. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; prepared a ritual to return the disturbed souls back to rest.

It is available exclusively to &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Equipping Shadowmourne awards the &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmourne%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Shadowmourne (achievement)&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nBefore beginning his reign as the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; was a servant ruled by a sword he believed was the key to saving his people - the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Finding and claiming the blade among the frozen wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; was an odyssey unto itself, and the search cost the prince &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;his mentor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;his relationship with his subjects&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Lehner\"&gt;his humanity&lt;/a&gt;. It cost the living of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; far more.\nWith a tight grip on the blade that he traded his life for, Arthas ravaged the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and broke free from the control of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the former prince ascended as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Frostmourne was already glutted with the souls of the numberless dead who dared to oppose him.\nNow, Arthas has become so inseparable from his weapon that the sword's likeness has even found its way into the architecture of his fortress, &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Its hilt is never far from his hands; its ghostly whispers constantly ring in his ears. Frostmourne, as much as the Lich King, is the ruler of Northrend.\nTo challenge that rule, mighty heroes will need to follow more closely in Arthas's path than ever before.\nIn a relentless quest to arm the forces of the living against the Scourge, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; has formed the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;, a union between the most skilled craftsmen of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Though the peerless paladins of the Crusade wield the power of the Light, and their &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; clutches &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, a few of Mograine's dark warriors have begun to question their hopes for victory.\nThese death knights insist that the Ashbringer and the skills of the Argent Crusaders, though potent, aren't enough to best Frostmourne alone. They swear that Darion Mograine has long been quietly aware of another legendary blade - one that could be the key to defeating the Lich King and cleansing Northrend... But it doesn't exist yet.\nFor the moment, the weapon is a formless idea, with no more killing power than an angry thought. When it is spoken of, it is spoken of quietly, and the Highlord has a habit of silencing those who discuss it in public.\nBut the hope of an artifact to rival Frostmourne is strong within the minds of the Ebon Blade. Just its name inspires the furnaces to burn late into the night, the bellows to pump air, and the darker half of the Verdict's smiths to swing their hammers until their fingers fail. While other craftsmen crafters lean over whetstones and gather pitted blades by the hundreds, these few dream of a single weapon to end the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war for Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowmourne... A great two-handed axe fit for a giant, born of sacred and corrupt powers, host of a thousand dead souls and able to be wielded only by the most stalwart armsmasters of Azeroth. Its creation seems nearly impossible; and yet, the rumors do not cease.\nSome smiths claim that Shadowmourne must be nothing more than an ordinary axe, honed to unparalleled perfection, while others would shape it from a weapon of immense import in the world. Mograine, when he can be convinced to speak of it at all, is said to believe that only &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Vengeance\"&gt;the hammer of Arthas&lt;/a&gt; himself will provide a worthy model - but such absurd ambition is just the beginning of Shadowmourne's creation. \nOnly with these mighty components, it's said, can Shadowmourne be finished. And, yet, even if the axe could be completed, questions and fears remain. Is forging the souls of the deceased into a weapon treated with blood and the essence of the Twisting Nether truly any different from the crafting of the Scourge's &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt;s?\nWho is to say that the Lich King wouldn't simply annihilate - or control - the maker for their impudence in mimicking his most treasured possession? If Arthas, one of the most dedicated knights of his age, lost his humanity to the whispers of Frostmourne, might Shadowmourne bring the same doom and misery to the living as &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;its sister blade&lt;/a&gt;?\nWithout knowing the answers to these questions, who would be bold enough to try and wield it?\nMechanics.\nThe proc effects from Shadowmourne are unlike any weapon currently in the game and as such the way they act is completely new. \nSoul Fragment generation works off the &lt;a href=\"Procs%20per%20minute\"&gt;Procs per minute&lt;/a&gt; system, and has a very high number of occurrences per minute. Current testing has shown that auto attacks on average generate one fragment every two seconds, and special abilities generate fragments at the same rate for a combined total of approximately one Soul Fragment every second on a single target. In AoE situations the Fragments gained per second will increase, but because not all of the players GCD's will be used to do AoE it is still unclear exactly how much faster fragments will be generated (in terms of Fragments gained per second) per target added for each class."}

The epilogue plays out moments after &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20cinematic\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, before the events of the \"\" pre-patch. It is not stated how much time elapses between the main story and the epilogue. Concurrent with the epilogue, the main events of \"&lt;a href=\"We%20Ride%20Forth\"&gt;We Ride Forth&lt;/a&gt;\" take place.\nDevelopment.\nBlizzard approached &lt;a href=\"Madeleine%20Roux\"&gt;Madeleine Roux&lt;/a&gt; about writing \"Shadows Rising\" around April 2019, and she worked on the book over the following summer and fall. Writing the first draft was a relatively easy process which only took about a month, which she attributes to the detailed outline Blizzard provided and the extensive backstories that already existed for the world and characters. She strove to write at least 1-2 chapters every day. In addition to simply asking Blizzard's writing team directly, Roux researched parts of the lore she was less familiar with by consulting &lt;a href=\"Wowpedia\"&gt;Wowpedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;, and fanmade lore videos. During the writing process, she kept her WoW characters placed in different in-game locations at all times so she could get a feel for the ambience of different &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s and describe specific details of the environment. She also played \"\" \"pretty hardcore\" during this time, and so included a few references to vanilla \"World of Warcraft\" in the book. To her amusement, the fact that she was frequently logged into &lt;a href=\"retail\"&gt;retail&lt;/a&gt; for the sake of book research inadvertently annoyed one of her \"Classic\" &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; members until she explained the situation to him (she subsequently started using the \"appear offline\" option while working on the novel).\nDuring the book's development, Roux was conscious of the criticism that had been directed against previous expansion prequel novels (namely \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\") for containing information that's essential to the plot of \"World of Warcraft\" but is not communicated in-game, which could lead to fans feeling lost if they didn't read the books. For this reason, Roux insisted during meetings with the writing team that \"Shadows Rising\" couldn't be something that players would \"have\" to read, and there are some events which were excluded from the book as a result. However, Roux still strove to make the novel feel like something that lore-interested players would \"want\" to read by having it give unique insight into the various characters and their development; in short, \"something that feels really essential but isn't\".\nThe original draft of the book included the death of a significant character, but that section of the novel was rewritten after the game's writing team decided that they needed the character to come back in \"Shadowlands\"."}

It is far too massive for most mortals to even dream of wielding, even if they could somehow defeat the elemental Firelord. However, fanatical followers of Ragnaros found a way to craft hammers in its image. Each requires an eye of Sulfuras, and these lesser weapons are known as sulfuron hammers. A sulfuron hammer appears to be a smaller version of Sulfuras. It is a spiked, flaming red warhammer. The hammer is crafted entirely from elementium, with an eye of Sulfuras embedded deep in the hammer\u2019s head."}

From the infernal depths of the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, the Harbinger commands &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Flamelash\"&gt;Ambassador Flamelash&lt;/a&gt; and the other lesser flamewakers in the outside world. Sulfuron Harbinger answers only to &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Executus&lt;/a&gt; and guards the rune of Koro, one of several runes that empower the Firelord's servants. Sulfuron Harbinger keeps &lt;a href=\"Shazzrah\"&gt;Shazzrah&lt;/a&gt; in particular under close watch, believing that Shazzrah seeks to betray Ragnaros. Flanked by four of the Firelord's most fervid priests, the Harbinger prepares for the day when the elemental lord of fire claims the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for his own.\nSulfuron Harbinger is a Flamewaker boss with four &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20Priest\"&gt;Flamewaker Priest&lt;/a&gt; guards watching over the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Koro\"&gt;Rune of Koro&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Sulfuron Harbinger shares a health pool with the four Flamewaker Priests. In addition, Inspire can be cast by both Sulfuron Harbinger and his priests, and increases damage by a significantly higher amount.\nStrategy.\nThe guards can have their spells interrupted so warriors and rogues should be kicking and shield bashing. There will need to be 5 tanks, one for Sulfuron Harbinger and one for each guard. Mortal strike will also help ensure that if they get a heal off it will be reduced. \nStrategy 1.\nThe first approach is to have the four guards separated into different corners of the room, while the DPS goes from one guard to another until they are all down and then to focus on Sulfuron Harbinger. This strategy, however, requires five strong tanks and the healers to keep them up. \nStrategy 2.\nThe second approach requires that the guards are all tanked in the same place and one at a time they are led away to be destroyed by the DPS. This can be an easier strategy because the tanks can share healers if one goes down or runs out of mana.\nStrategy 3.\nThe last approach is to herd all guards in one spot and hit them with massive AoE from mages/warlocks. Whenever health of any one of the guards falls below 20%, all DPS is focused on him, hoping that he dies before other guards have a chance to heal him. This approach depends on a lot of firepower, and it will take longer time for guards to die, but it is easy to implement.\nHealing.\nThe magic debuffs from the guards are much worse than the melee damage, and will generally target the off-tanks and their healers. Dispelling these debuffs should be absolute priority for Priests for Horde, or Paladins for Alliance. Prayer of Shadow Resistance on tanks and healers helps a lot. Fire resist totems / auras also help.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

After the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; peacefully intervened under the order of &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; to stop their activities.\nHistory.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, many mages lost their home in the explosion of the mana bomb, and among them, &lt;a href=\"Turi%20Flickerflame\"&gt;Turi Flickerflame&lt;/a&gt; lost her master &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and friend &lt;a href=\"Kinndy%20Sparkshine\"&gt;Kinndy Sparkshine&lt;/a&gt;. Driven by regret, fear, and anger, Turi created the Sullied Banner to help her fellow mages to find some closure. While they never really planned to hurt anyone and knew that Rhonin never would have wanted any of this, they didn't know what else to do and began their attempts to recreate the very bomb that leveled the city-state years ago. Although they were far from successful, as they just wanted some way to keep themselves safe from their enemies, their prototypes were sufficiently advanced to present risks in the event of accidental detonations.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Surigosa\"&gt;Surigosa&lt;/a&gt; began to investigate the actions of the Sullied Banner and left a message for the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, stating her intention to travel at the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Ruins of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to uncover their traces. She was found by &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, and later by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who came to settle the situation before a bloody conflict could start. In the ruins, the rogue mages could be seen clearing the rubbles, putting down the fires, and empowering their prototype mana bombs.\nOn the orders of the Aspect of Magic, who refused to make the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;same mistakes&lt;/a&gt; as his predecessor &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer was sent to capture the rogues mages and teleport the prototypes to safety, rather than letting Surigosa kill everyone. The latter and Azuregos disapproved of their leader's decision, whom they considered too merciful with the rogue mages, but agreed not to intervene when he explained that these mortals sought to defend themselves out of fear rather than to do evil. When most of them were captured, the adventurer was sent to confront and capture alive Turi Flickerflame.\nOnce the situation was defused, and after they heard the testimonies of Turi on the reason for their actions, Surigosa ceased her hostility and began to understand why they had come to this. In order to end the cycle of violence, Kalecgos apologized on behalf of his flight for failing to protect the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; and Theramore Isle from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.

He has enough experience to deal with designs from different races, such as &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e. His personal weapon is a dwarven rifle. He is also a cook.\nBiography.\nMists of Pandaria.\nOn the orders of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Sully accompanied SI:7 agents on a mission to rescue the &lt;a href=\"White%20Pawn\"&gt;White Pawn&lt;/a&gt;. After the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" arrived at the Jade Forest in Pandaria, he began helping with eliminating the Horde presence there. After the Horde was dealt with, Sully took control of a goblin shredder and helped Skyfire marines fight against the sha. Sully then sabotaged &lt;a href=\"Twinspire%20Keep\"&gt;Twinspire Keep&lt;/a&gt; to assist the Alliance's assault on the Horde there. \nSome time later, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Mishka\"&gt;Mishka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rell%20Nightwind\"&gt;Rell Nightwind&lt;/a&gt;, the trio followed &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor\"&gt;Admiral Taylor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Village\"&gt;Pearlfin Village&lt;/a&gt; until he was fully recovered. Then he accompanied Rell into the wilderness where &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; was found and he helped with scouting near &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;. He found there a &lt;a href=\"raccoon\"&gt;raccoon&lt;/a&gt;, naming it &lt;a href=\"Gizmo%20%28raccoon%29\"&gt;Gizmo&lt;/a&gt;, but Amber immediately shot him due to misinterpreting Sully's hand signals. Another raccoon, &lt;a href=\"Socks\"&gt;Socks&lt;/a&gt;, appeared and started to follow Sully. Anduin was nowhere to be found so he returned to the meeting spot only to find Rell critically injured. Nevertheless, the team continued to the north - to the &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Jade%20Witch\"&gt;Lair of the Jade Witch&lt;/a&gt;. After inspecting its hut, &lt;a href=\"Widow%20Greenpaw\"&gt;Widow Greenpaw&lt;/a&gt; appeared and wanted to make a jade statue from Sully but Socks willingly sacrificed himself in order to allow Sully and the team to escape. Sully then sabotaged a hozen camp in Grookin Hill. After this, they returned to Pearlfin Village with the knowledge of the Horde and the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hozen\"&gt;Forest Hozen&lt;/a&gt; being allies. After finding Anduin, Sully, and Amber went after him to bring him back to Stormwind. Yet Anduin refused to leave and mind-controlled Sully in order to escape.\nLater on, the Alliance SI:7 agents and &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Jinyu\"&gt;Pearlfin Jinyu&lt;/a&gt; worked hard to prepare for a battle against the Horde and the hozen. Meantime, Sully was able to salvage a ballistae. After the events of the battle at &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, Sully was rescued by an adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Mishi\"&gt;Mishi&lt;/a&gt; and was later found recuperating at &lt;a href=\"Binan%20Village\"&gt;Binan Village&lt;/a&gt;. After being healed, he moved to the newly taken &lt;a href=\"Westwind%20Rest\"&gt;Westwind Rest&lt;/a&gt;. While there he brought ingredients and made food. He subsequently had some yaungol &lt;a href=\"Oil%20platform\"&gt;oil rigs&lt;/a&gt; destroyed.\nLandfall.\nAfter the Alliance fleet arrived in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, Sully was found aboard the \"Skyfire\" while it became a mobile base above the western Wilds, sending adventurers to battle against the Horde's machines. He was also helping &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing%20%28scenario%29\"&gt;defend&lt;/a&gt; Lion's Landing against the Horde. After Anduin was attacked by Garrosh for destroying the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, Sully was seen in the Lion's Landing keep, speaking with &lt;a href=\"Fennie%20Hornswaggle\"&gt;Fennie Hornswaggle&lt;/a&gt;.\nEscalation.\nSully and Amber discovered in Dun Morogh that Zandalari trolls threatened Ironforge.\nBefore committing regular forces to the assault on &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian has sent agents &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; and Sully McLeary outside of Orgrimmar to scout out a naval landing site, learn the enemy\u2019s weaknesses, and give Alliance landing forces any advantage they can find. After discovering a Horde civil war, an Alliance champion was sent as an envoy and established an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. With a little deft political maneuvering, the Alliance champion was able to secure a potential Alliance beach landing and ensured that trolls and orcs kill one another up and down Durotar.\nCelestial Tournament.\nSully is a random opponent in the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Tournament\"&gt;Celestial Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.

Unable to recover from the loss, Sully couldn't bring himself to replace his beloved pet, and &lt;a href=\"Tawny%20Seabraid\"&gt;Tawny Seabraid&lt;/a&gt; advised him to take some time.

Although the great &lt;a href=\"sage\"&gt;sage&lt;/a&gt; Sulthis was immensely powerful, he couldn't seal the tomb alone and sought out &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt; for their help. They agreed, and thus the Keepers were formed. Together they cast a barrier around the pyramid, sealing Mythrax's corpse within. To ensure that the tomb would remain undisturbed, each of the Keepers created a keystone imbued with their power.\nOf the Keepers, Sulthis was the most closely connected to Sethraliss. The love he bore for his loa, and for the desert, inspired him to adopt the &lt;a href=\"serpent\"&gt;cobra&lt;/a&gt; as his spirit guide. Sethrak traveled from near and far to place tokens of affection at statues of the three Keepers in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt;. These tokens embodied everything that Sulthis represented. In those days, Sulthis, Vorrik, and Korthek led all sethrak in their worship of Sethraliss.\nEventually, Korthek grew hungry for war and Sulthis heard talk of Korthek being eager to attack the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. However, Sulthis could not understand why Korthek would want to start a fight he could not win after the sethrak had lived in peace for so long. Sulthis got the feeling that something bad would happen very soon, and he decided to safeguard his key and inform Vorrik of his concerns. Eventually, Korthek decided to break the seal on Atul'Aman to use Mythrax to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, and formed an &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;army of like-minded sethrak&lt;/a&gt; that slaughtered all who opposed them. Sulthis was the first to fall, but not before safeguarding his key in Zul'Ahjin and recording a message for Vorrik informing him of Korthek's betrayal.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrives in Zul'Ahjin and places two sapphires in the eyes of a &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Statue\"&gt;crumbling statue&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the ruins, the statue triggers the message Sulthis left for Vorrik and causes the appearance of an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Reliquary\"&gt;ancient reliquary&lt;/a&gt; holding Sulthis' keystone, which the adventurer then delivers to Vorrik at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt;."}

If it is already attacking something, it will not change targets, allowing you to change targets as needed. This macro eliminates the need for a separate pet attack hotkey in most situations. However, if you need the elemental to change targets, it has to be commanded manually.

If you have him out, it will use Freeze, but if you hold shift and click, it'll use your nova regardless of whether or not he is out. If you control-click the macro, it will summon him, and if you control click it while he is already out, it will tell him to attack your new target. Note that depending on these conditions, including modifier keys, it will show the icon and the cooldown of the appropriate spell \u2014 so you can see the cooldown on summoning him, using freeze, and using nova all on the same button, whether he is out or not."}

Summoner Kanthin was one of the most senior magisters in the force Kael'thas sent to decimate Kirin'Var. It's only natural that he would claim my familiar as a kind of trophy.\nI'm certain that Kanthin, fool that he is, has tried to compel Glacius to serve him.

I'll begin working the spell right away.\nTrivia.\nThe name \"Glacius\" is likely a reference to the Rare fighting game .

Scouts managed to locate the outpost in Zul'Dare and the Alliance military sent forces to destroy it.\nIn the RPG.\nZul'Dare is a sizeable island to &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;' southeast that is also part of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and remains inviolate.

Indeed, some ships do not return at all. Rumors in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; point to a &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; force hiding somewhere in the area, and some whisper that Gilneas is in their possession.\nSpeculation.\nThe island the Horde was on when a scout reported that &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s had been \"captured on the mainland, not far from the shore\" could have been Zul'Dare.

It is located in eastern &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; have recently gone mad after they sacrificed their &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; animal gods in an attempt to fight off the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; has returned to play a role in Zul'Drak as have members of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who have come to try and save some of the Drakkari history before it is wiped out. The region itself is a giant ziggurat of the now broken civilization.\nAs noted below, players visiting the zone will find that it is in the process of being overrun by the Scourge, particularly in the vicinity of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Stand\"&gt;Argent Stand&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict between various &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; factions can be intense, and it's easy to get caught in the crossfire.\nThe region's primary inhabitants are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, crazed Drakkari who randomly attack anyone in their path, and a scattering of &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s which a faction of Drakkari summoned to help them defeat the Scourge. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; have a tangible presence in the area as well. A number of the Loa of the Drakkari still exist in weakened forms, and can be found in the northeastern part of the region, towards &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;. A Scourge-controlled &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt; portion of the region also exists south of &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Watch\"&gt;Ebon Watch&lt;/a&gt;, near Drak'Tharon Keep, at the east end of the zone. The &lt;a href=\"Hath%27ar\"&gt;Hath'ar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s also have a small presence.\nThe five main entrances to Zul'Drak are: an unnamed stair in the border with &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27kalar%20Passage\"&gt;Jintha'kalar Passage&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, and &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drak%27atal%20Passage\"&gt;Drak'atal Passage&lt;/a&gt;, and an unnamed stair in eastern &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nHistory.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nZul'Drak is in the middle of a massive upheaval. &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces under the newly-empowered &lt;a href=\"Drakuru\"&gt;Drakuru&lt;/a&gt; are preparing an undead army of troll &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;s empowered by blight crystals. To counter the Scourge threat, the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari trolls&lt;/a&gt; have begun sacrificing their own &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; animal gods in desperation. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; is caught between two armies as they clash with both the Scourge and the native Drakkari at &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Stand\"&gt;Argent Stand&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; has arrived to both intervene on behalf of the gods and chronicle the end of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Empire\"&gt;Drakkari Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the meeting of the troll tribes held after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; stated that Zul'Drak had fallen to the Scourge.\nExploring Azeroth: Northrend.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the region was visited by the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, who stated in their report that since Zul'Drak was overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; years ago, it now began to fall to ruin. With the surviving Drakkari scattered and the undead roaming, they decided this was a place to proceed through with caution and gawp at the sights from a safe distance. With no surprise, there are Drakkari artifacts aplenty to be found.\nThey also reported that the main focus of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s pouring from &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; is the complete destruction of Zul'Drak.\nGeography.\nIt is a region roughly the size of &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; that is one massive city, plazas and ziggurats, walls and aqueducts stretching as far as the eye can see.\nMassive altars dot the city from the second tier of Zul'Drak upward. These altars are where the Drakkari once worshipped the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s they call &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the whole place is filled with dark energy and death, not from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, but from the suffering of these gods which stains the land.\nNotable characters.\nZul'Drak is home to several characters of note. Battling the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; are the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Falstaav\"&gt;Commander Falstaav&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Kunz\"&gt;Commander Kunz&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"the%20Argent%20Stand\"&gt;the Argent Stand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Lord%20Lantinga\"&gt;Crusader Lord Lantinga&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Breach\"&gt;Light's Breach&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Vadu\"&gt;Stefan Vadu&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Watch\"&gt;Ebon Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Having recently traveled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; are a group of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s, led by &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Khufu\"&gt;Witch Doctor Khufu&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Zim%27Torga\"&gt;Zim'Torga&lt;/a&gt;. From there, they seek to stop the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; from betraying their &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; gods, although they might be too late. The local Scourge forces are led by the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Drakuru\"&gt;Overlord Drakuru&lt;/a&gt; at the necropolis &lt;a href=\"Voltarus\"&gt;Voltarus&lt;/a&gt;, and before heading into &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;, players must face off against the evil &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20of%20Akali\"&gt;Prophet of Akali&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the &lt;a href=\"Amphitheater%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Amphitheater of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; sees the return of famous blood sport promoter &lt;a href=\"Gurgthock\"&gt;Gurgthock&lt;/a&gt;, his assistant &lt;a href=\"Wodin%20the%20Troll-Servant\"&gt;Wodin the Troll-Servant&lt;/a&gt;, and the powerful &lt;a href=\"Korrak%20the%20Bloodrager\"&gt;Korrak the Bloodrager&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlora.\nThe trees of Zul'Drak are known as thornwood trees. Their dead roots are capable of resisting moisture; as such they are great for firewood.\nThe Drakkari cultivate water-poppies within the &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Sotra%20Fields\"&gt;Drak'Sotra Fields&lt;/a&gt; that can be used for very efficient pain-reducing salves.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Agal\"&gt;Drak'Agal&lt;/a&gt; grows a fungi known as &lt;a href=\"Muddlecap%20Fungus\"&gt;muddlecap fungus&lt;/a&gt;. It can be used to spike concoctions, resulting in the imbiber being weakened.\nWild creatures.\nRare Elite NPCs associated with the achievement.\nIn the RPG.\nZul'Drak is the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; homeland, and they swarm the place looking for intruders and prey. Climate-wise this valley is the least pleasant of the eastern regions in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. It is colder than the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, less majestic than the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, and more crowded than any of them, especially with Drakkari.\nThere are not many reasons to go there, though it does have Drakkari ruins, which are interesting. Most other races avoid this region, and for good reason. You don't even need it for passage north or south \u2014 you can stick to the Grizzly Hills, which surround Zul'Drak on both sides and reach all the way up to &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; and the Storm Peaks. The only reason for wandering through Zul'Drak is if you want to meet the Drakkari \u2014 and you would better have a large group of armed warriors with you when you do.\nZul'Drak belongs to the trolls, who roam in hunting parties searching for prey. Old troll ruins are strewn across the countryside and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; hovers just beyond the western border, waiting for a chance to strike.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s are an old race, one of the first in Northrend and perhaps one of the first in all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They were building homes in Zul'Drak before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and never departed, though it is speculated some of them may have migrated south and become the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s and the other &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; races, but it is still not clear which was the first troll race. The &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; have fought the Drakkari for many years, and they can tell you some interesting things of the ice troll culture.\nDrakkari are tribal, and early in their history each tribe established its own territory and fought off any trespassers. Then one tribe conquered another and enslaved its &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. These slaves were forced to build the victors a new and larger home, and their children became part of the dominant tribe, which continued to conquer its neighbors, each time absorbing them, until finally it was powerful enough to claim all of Zul'Drak as its kingdom. Any tribe that resisted was destroyed and those that accepted the powerful tribe's dominance were allowed to keep their own territories, provided they accepted any orders from the ruling tribe. Thus the Drakkari nation truly began. The central tribe's home became &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city.\nTo this day, the tribes still war among themselves, and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20King%20Malakk\"&gt;Frost King Malakk&lt;/a&gt; allows it because it keeps his people strong and aggressive. He coordinates border patrols and establishes protocols for calling all the tribes together should an army attack them in force. Many tribe &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;s thought these efforts foolish until they encountered the walking dead. Then the Frost King organized the other Drakkari and drove the dead from their lands.\nSince then, thus far the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; has not penetrated into Zul'Drak to any degree, though it claims &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt;, an old Drakkari stronghold in the Grizzly Hills just beyond Zul'Drak's southwest edge.\nAn explorer who hid in an old troll ziggurat in Zul'Drak sketched some of the markings he saw there. These markings though, were not &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;, the troll language, and they looked too complex for the barbaric Drakkari to have fashioned them, at least in their present state. People speculated if the ziggurat could be from some other race, or if the trolls were more intelligent and more sophisticated long ago.\nPeople and culture.\nThis is the Drakkari homeland and judging by the ruins, their culture was here long before the Great Sundering. They live here by the thousands, which at least means they are not anywhere else. It is amazing this one land can support so many trolls, especially since fresh meat is their principle food. Fortunately for them, wild beasts roam the area as well and provide plenty of prey. Fortunately, Drakkari are tribal.\nThey live in small tribes throughout Zul'Drak and wage war among themselves. Someone saw once bands of Drakkari slaughtering each other simply because they met along the border between their two tribes. Such conflict helps keep the troll population down. No one else is foolish enough to share the region with them.\nGeography.\nZul'Drak is a single large valley between the arms of the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. The trees here are smaller than the southern forests but numerous and upright, and provide excellent cover when sniping trolls. Some grass and other plants poke up through the snow, and frozen ponds and streams dot the land. Obelisks and ziggurats are everywhere, often at the center of active troll camps. Ruins show where troll tribes must have lived long ago, though most of these look like they were destroyed during battle rather than simply abandoned.\nThe valley teems with life. In addition to the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;, giant &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt; and other animals live among the trees and grass. &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s wander up from the Grizzly Hills to hunt and clash with the Drakkari. The trolls maintain patrols along their border, both to drive out intruders and to kill anyone they find.\nTroll villages are everywhere in Zul'Drak. Most of these are small, crude places, a handful of wood or stone buildings around a single larger hall. Some are built on the ruins of older structures or surround an ancient ziggurat or obelisk, carved from stone and more impressive than the more recent structures. The only large settlement is &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city.\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", the Zul'Drak was rewarded for achieving Rank 20 in Ranked Season 27, which took place during June 2016. The flavor text reads: \"Home of the Drakkari ice trolls, Zul'Drak consistently produces the best figure skaters of all the troll tribes.\""}

When the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; shattered the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;landmass&lt;/a&gt;, the area swiftly became the desert of Tanaris. The &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Farraki tribe&lt;/a&gt; of trolls were stranded here and eventually adapted to their harsh new environment, becoming &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"This sun-blasted city is home to the Sandfury trolls, known for their particular ruthlessness and dark mysticism. Troll legends tell of a powerful sword called &lt;a href=\"Sul%27thraze%20the%20Lasher\"&gt;Sul'thraze the Lasher&lt;/a&gt;, a weapon capable of instilling fear and weakness in even the most formidable of foes. Long ago, the weapon was split in half. However, rumors have circulated that the two halves may be found somewhere within Zul'Farrak's walls. Reports have also suggested that a band of &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; fleeing &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; wandered into the city and became trapped. Their fate remains unknown. But perhaps most disturbing of all are the hushed whispers of an ancient creature sleeping within a sacred pool at the city's heart - a mighty demigod who will wreak untold destruction upon any adventurer foolish enough to awaken him.\"\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, the city was entered by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to kill &lt;a href=\"Kai%27ju%20Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Kai'ju Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time of the Cataclysm, Zul'Farrak had become a wasteland. The surviving Sandfury joined the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; were summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury tribe&lt;/a&gt; in Zul'Farrak so they could sacrifice their prisoners - &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; - to them, although the loa refused their sacrifice, much to the trolls' surprise.\nTactical overview.\nZul'Farrak is a big circle, so the end boss can be done before most of the mini-bosses. Chief Ukorz Sandscalp can only be reached after defeating Nekrum at the end of the Pyramid Battle. Talking to the goblin before &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Bly\"&gt;Sergeant Bly&lt;/a&gt;, therefore, most parties classify him as the \"End Boss\". &lt;a href=\"Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt; can be done before or after the Pyramid Battle/Sergeant Bly/Chief Ukorz Sandscalp, so in some sense, he can also be the \"End Boss\". Nevertheless, it's a technical thing. Zul'Farrak is one of the first instances you may use your mount in, due to it being an outdoor instance.\nGroup and level guidance.\nA good group composition would require a tank, an adept healer and an AOE, mage being the best class, due to their large range of AOE attacks. AOE is essential for certain boss fights and non-elite trash mobs, unless you want to clear individual mobs. This instance can be extremely tough in places, depending on player level, and careful pulling is of critical importance. It is far too easy here, when attempting to pull one mob, to accidentally pull more, and for the group to then wipe because they underestimate the mobs' strength. It is also extremely important to avoid opening too many of the graves inside the instance and unleashing all of the zombies at once, since doing so will quickly lead to the group being overrun.\nThe treasure available here is of good quality, with a large array of green items and a decent drop rate of silver and cloth, as well as some leather from the basilisks which accompany the trolls in certain places.\nThe instance is almost completely outside, allowing for the use of &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThis instance is one of the last major ones that players will experience before the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; complex and the commencement of serious raiding. As such, also given the level of difficulty, it provides an excellent environment for players to develop the group co-ordination skills and depth of familiarity with their characters that they will need before moving on to such places. If you think you're good at running an instance group, ZF will provide you with an opportunity to discover whether or not that perception is accurate.\nIn the RPG.\nZul'Farrak is a place of brown adobe walls and mud-brick buildings, similar to the troll settlements found in Stranglethorn Vale. It is impressive that trolls separated for thousands of years build a new town using the same construction methods known only to their ancestors thousands of years and miles away. It is said that an ancient weapon, &lt;a href=\"%3ASul%27thraze%20the%20Lasher\"&gt;:Sul'thraze the Lasher&lt;/a&gt;, is held by the trolls within Zul'Farrak, and another legend says that a &lt;a href=\"Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;mighty demigod&lt;/a&gt; sleeps within a sacred pool inside the village. The Sandfury trolls attack anyone that approaches their city."}

Thousands of years ago it was the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; and all jungle troll tribes affiliated with them. However, now it only serves as the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is an extremely dangerous place where the influence of Hakkar still persists, the trolls there are brutal, violent and fast. Many people venture there in search of treasures and artifacts. But few come out of it, if not at all.\nHistory.\n1,500 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the powerful &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart by a massive civil war. An influential group of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; priests, known as the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, called forth the avatar of an ancient and terrible blood-god named &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Though the priests were defeated and ultimately exiled, the great troll empire collapsed upon itself. The exiled priests fled far to the north, into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, where they erected a great &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;temple to Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; in order to prepare for his arrival into the physical world.\nIn time, the Atal'ai priests discovered that Hakkar's physical form could only be summoned within the ancient capital of the Gurubashi Empire. It was in Zul'Gurub that &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do%20the%20Hexxer\"&gt;Jin'do the Hexxer&lt;/a&gt; enslaved several high priests of the Gurubashi to aid him in summoning their dread god, Hakkar the Soulflayer, into Azeroth.\nIn order to quell the blood god, the trolls of the land banded together and sent a contingent of High Priests into the ancient city. Each priest was a powerful champion of the Primal Gods - Bat, Panther, Tiger, Spider, and Snake - but despite their best efforts, they fell under the sway of Hakkar. The champions and their Primal God aspects started feeding the awesome power of the Soulflayer.\nThe Zandalari knowing that they could not free their champions and stop Hakkar from entering our world on their own, sent word to the Darkspear tribe that the Horde needed to come and help stop Hakkar before it was too late. The Horde stormed Zul'Gurub and slew &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt;, but not before Hakkar entered the physical world. The battle was costly but in the end, the Horde was victorious.\nAfter the Cataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt;'s restless spirit burned with shame at his failure, and it drifted in the spirit world, seeking a way to return and a plan.\nMost of the sections of the city have been caved in such as &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27zaar\"&gt;Shadra'zaar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Hir%27eek\"&gt;Altar of Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;.\nJin'do eventually forced his way back to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to call on allies old and new: the worshippers of Hakkar, the exile &lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Zanzil the Outcast&lt;/a&gt;, and even Hakkar's former enemies among the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they promised to rebuild Zul'Gurub - not for the glory of their defeated god, but to take his brutal power for their own, and see the troll race stand triumphant over a broken world. After repelling the Gurubashi trolls from settlements across Stranglethorn, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; ordered his &lt;a href=\"Atal-Mhuto\"&gt;Atal-Mhuto&lt;/a&gt; to Zul'Gurub, aided by adventurers. The effort was overseen by a Booty Bay representative, &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Blingbang\"&gt;Overseer Blingbang&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; reported that Zul'Gurub remains a dangerous place, proclivities to Hakkar remain strong in his followers, and agents are to avoid it unless specifically directed to investigate it.\nIn the RPG.\nThe beginning of the great &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi civilization&lt;/a&gt; lay in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;'s far eastern reaches. Few &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s live here now \u2014 only those &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; who research and wish to preserve the ruins from the encroaching jungle."}
{"id": "16774", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16774", "title": "Zul'Gurub (Classic)", "text": "Zul'Gurub was a 20-man raid instance located in northeastern &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, released in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.7\"&gt;patch 1.7&lt;/a&gt;. Like &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt;, it counted as an outdoors zone, and riding on &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s is possible. Zul'Gurub is the capital of the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes, led by the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of the terrible god, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, who personally inhabits a temple in the deepest parts of the city.\nGuide.\nThe most efficient route through Zul'Gurub was as follows:\nDungeon denizens.\nEncounters.\nThe Priest Aspects all assume an animal form at some point when fighting them. Moreover, if they are left alive they grant &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; powerful abilities that make him much harder to kill. This is in contrast to &lt;a href=\"%23Optional\"&gt;other bosses&lt;/a&gt; who do not assume animal forms and do not give Hakkar any abilities.\nOptional.\nThe bosses below are considered 'optional' because they do not give &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; any abilities. As such, you can choose to kill or skip them; it won't change your encounter with the Blood God. However, most of them are involved in gaining powerful trinkets unique to each class, so anyone seeking to gain them must fight each of these bosses at least once (except Gahz'ranka). \nLoot.\nZul'Gurub raiders receive loot through several systems. There are standard drops from the bosses (described at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20loot%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub loot&lt;/a&gt;), quest-based rewards that require Zandalar reputation and special rare drops from bosses (see &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari\"&gt;Primal Hakkari&lt;/a&gt;), and rewards that are received after collecting various difficult tasks inside the instance (see &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20Trinket\"&gt;Zul'Gurub Trinket&lt;/a&gt; and the Enchants discussion, below).\nFaction rewards.\nGetting reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Tribe\"&gt;Zandalar Tribe&lt;/a&gt; offers several benefits.\nVarious crafting recipes can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Rin%27wosho%20the%20Trader\"&gt;Rin'wosho the Trader&lt;/a&gt;, who is located on Yojamba Isle in the far northwest of Stranglethorn Vale. All recipes are BoP. All items crafted from these recipes are BoE. \n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20enchantment\"&gt;Zul'Gurub offers unique enchants&lt;/a&gt; for the head, leg and shoulder slots.

The original incarnation of the instance was released in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.7.0\"&gt;patch 1.7.0&lt;/a&gt; and was suited for 20-player parties. Zul'Gurub is the capital of the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes, led by the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of the terrible god, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Since the defeat of Hakkar and his Gurubashi minions, the city fell into disrepair and was mostly consumed by the jungle. The Gurubashi still persist, now backed by their former enemies; the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and once again they must be faced within the walls of the ruined city before they are able to fully regroup and strike back.\nBackground.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Zul'Gurub was the capital of the Gurubashi jungle trolls, a tribe that once controlled the vast jungles of the south. It was here that Jin'do the Hexxer summoned the savage loa Hakkar the Soulflayer into Azeroth. Of late, these efforts have begun anew amid an alliance between the Gurubashi and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20troll\"&gt;Zandalar troll&lt;/a&gt;s that seeks to establish a unified troll empire.\"\nDescription from website.\nThe influence of that savage civilization can be seen in Zul'Gurub's raised platforms and vine-covered arches, though, arguably, the most important part of the city's history is recent. It was in Zul'Gurub that Jin'do the Hexxer enslaved several high priests of the Gurubashi to aid him in summoning their dread god, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe presence of the Soulflayer presented a grave threat to the world, and, before Hakkar and his priests could dominate the continent, they were thwarted by the dedicated effort of heroes mobilized from the four corners of Azeroth. Jin'do was slain in the conflict, but his restless spirit burned with shame at his failure, and it drifted in the spirit world, seeking a way to return... and a plan.\nJin'do forced his way back to Azeroth to call on allies old and new: the worshippers of Hakkar, the exile &lt;a href=\"Zanzil\"&gt;Zanzil&lt;/a&gt;, and even Hakkar's former enemies among the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they will rebuild Zul'Gurub - not for the glory of their defeated god, but to take his brutal power for their own, and see the troll race stand triumphant over a broken world.\nDungeon denizens.\nEncounters.\nThere are several bosses and minibosses in Zul'Gurub. All bosses except one have been in the game since classic lorewise. Their battles are also somewhat reminiscent of their old encounters. For example, Bloodlord Mandokir still levels up when he kills a player and dead players are brought back to life as long as ghosts exist in the battlearea.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

They are not the only trinkets one can acquire within that zone, but they are unique in that each is a part of an &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; class-specific equipment &lt;a href=\"set\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;. These trinkets have diverse effects, but all of them provide short-term bonuses. They are therefore most useful for PvP combat.\nList of trinkets.\nAll of these trinkets are epic items which bind when picked up. Each one has a three minute cooldown.\nAcquisition.\nThe Zul'Gurub trinkets are acquired by combining a particular type of &lt;a href=\"punctured%20voodoo%20doll\"&gt;punctured voodoo doll&lt;/a&gt; (as appropriate for their class) with all 4 animal token drops from the &lt;a href=\"Edge%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Edge of Madness&lt;/a&gt; event. This event is complicated and can be expensive to trigger, but has the benefit of being fairly reliable.\nAs mentioned, each trinket is a piece of a class-specific set which is available only in Zul'Gurub. These trinkets are unique in that they are the only piece of these sets which have no faction requirement; indeed, the player need not even visit &lt;a href=\"Yojamba%20Isle\"&gt;Yojamba Isle&lt;/a&gt;. All the player must do is acquire the relevant components and then use the doll; the doll and components are consumed and produce the trinket.\nUsage.\nThe Zul'Gurub trinkets vary substantially from class to class, but all of them have two things in common: their effects are short-lived, and their cooldown is a mere 3 minutes. These trinkets provide their bonuses in bursts, which makes them very ineffective when fighting elite monsters, but strong in player versus player combat. However, because of the short duration of their effects, it can be challenging to use them well. Therefore, these trinkets are best employed as a part of a &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; which will also use the appropriate abilities.\nWarrior and Rogue.\nThe warrior and rogue trinkets are both the easiest and the hardest to use. The trinkets' uses are obvious, but actually performing these combinations is challenging without a macro.\nBoth trinkets provide their user with one or more \"free\" special attacks. The rogue's backstab ability costs 60 energy, and this trinket supplies 60 energy; this trinket therefore can grant a rogue an additional backstab at any time. Similarly, the warrior's high-end talent attacks - &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Slam\"&gt;Shield Slam&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bloodthirst\"&gt;Bloodthirst&lt;/a&gt; - all require 30 rage to use, exactly the amount granted by the warrior trinket. Of course, rogues and warriors can also use this free energy/rage for combinations of other abilities.\nThe warrior trinket is slightly more forgiving than the rogue one - a warrior in combat will retain any rage he gains until he leaves combat, but the benefit provided by the rogue trinket must be used within 6 seconds at most before its benefit begins to be lost. In both cases, the player would be well-advised to use their trinket by way of a macro to ensure that the trinket is not used when it would exceed the player's maximum capacity for rage or energy. Rogues might be well-served to take advantage of the fact that trinkets and spells can be used immediately after each other. A macro which uses the trinket, then uses a spell which will consume the trinket's bonus, will ensure that it is used fully every time.\nExample rogue macro.\n /script if (UnitMana(\"player\")&lt;=40) then UseInventoryItem(GetInventorySlotInfo(\"Trinket1Slot\")); end\n /cast Backstab(Rank 8)\nThis macro casts backstab. If the player's energy is low, then the macro will use the trinket just beforehand. This macro requires that the player have his Zul'Gurub trinket equipped in his second trinket slot.\nHunter.\nThe hunter trinket is especially difficult to use. It clears the cooldown of four different hunter abilities, but two of these abilities already have a 6 second cooldown (arcane and aimed shot), and a third has a ten second cooldown (multi-shot). In addition, the cooldowns on aimed and arcane shot are linked; using one applies a 6 second cooldown to both of them, so they cannot be used in tandem. Resetting cooldowns on these spells would seem to be relatively trivial. However, arcane/aimed shot and multi-shot are the primary direct-damage spells used by hunters; the ability to reset their cooldowns allows the hunter to use each one twice in quick succession. A hunter can fire arcane shot, then multi-shot, then activate his trinket and cast each spell again immediately. This entire sequence will take between 4 and 5 seconds, and can be performed while the hunter is running (though he will need to pause for each multi-shot). If a hunter has access to aimed shot, he can substitute that for arcane shot; this extends the sequence to 8 or 9 seconds, and requires the hunter to remain in one place, but delivers far more damage.\nEDIT: As of a New Patch Arcane and Aimed no longer share the same Cooldown, Thus you can get far more damage out of this!\nDruid and Priest.\nThese two trinkets are nearly identical; each one reduces the casting time of their class's largest heal spell by 40%, and reduces the mana cost of all healing spells by 5%. This effect lasts only 15 seconds, and thus the trinkets are most effective when a single player is taking intense damage, and can therefore utilize all the healing being applied. The trinkets can also allow rapid healing of an entire party, but some method of rapidly switching targets would be needed to get the most out of the time spent.\nPaladin, Mage, and Warlock.\nThese trinkets are not at all identical, but very similar; each increases the damage output of a particular category of spells.\nShaman.\nThe shaman trinket is the most unique of all the Zul'Gurub trinkets - it is the only one whose effects do not require direct action to utilize. The shaman need only get several enemies to attack him, then use his lightning shield and this trinket. The shaman may need to recast his lightning shield several times over the trinket's 20 second duration, but the effects should be thoroughly satisfying."}

Zul'jin was a fierce enemy of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he shared many years of conflict. Zul'jin and the Amani tribe were allied with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for the duration of the Second War, but Zul'jin himself was captured near its end by &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, in whose custody he lost an eye and an arm, which he never regenerated. Upon gaining his freedom, he went into hiding to rebuild his army and plan an attack on the remnants of the high elves, now known as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, only to find them allied with the reformed Horde. He was killed by &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azerothian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who raided Zul'Aman during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nZul'jin - styled as \"Warlord Zul'jin\" - used to be found as the final boss encounter of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the Amani tribe. After his death, his soul was sent to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBlood of the Highborne.\nZul'jin of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt; was known as a fearsome troll leader by the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. He was infamous for his daring raids on the outskirts and &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, known to swiftly strike at high elven settlements and then to disappear before the elves could marshal a counter-attack. The &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; in particular considered Zul'jin their most hated enemy, as his raids had frequently cost the lives of their comrades. His ruthlessness and cunning were feared by the high elves.\nZul'jin's hatred for the high elves was as fierce as his reputation. He considered them invaders and usurpers, responsible for stealing Amani land and spilling Amani blood. He claimed that like the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; years before, the high elves had failed to wipe out the Amani, and that the trolls would never truly go away.\nZul'jin had long sought a way to dismantle the high elves' magical &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;defenses&lt;/a&gt;, and believed the &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s may have held the key to their subversion. He believed the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; to be the ultimate source of the elves' power. To this end, he captured a number of elves over the years, and attempted to torture them into revealing their secrets. He once had the ranger &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; in his grasp, who \"did\" have this information, but Zul'jin conceded that the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;elf rangers&lt;/a&gt; were a tough breed and did not truly expect his prisoner to talk. Instead, he hoped that the gruesome death he would give Theron would compel the other captured elves - the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, her apprentice &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;Galell&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; - to tell him what he needed. Zul'jin offered them one chance to spare themselves this fate; silence was his answer. The warlord reflected that the elves were too proud, that perhaps they enjoyed the slaughter. He promised them that the Amani would fight to the last. Zul'jin then began his torture of Lor'themar, and painted his own face with the ranger's blood. The elves hurried to free themselves, and in the ensuing struggle, Liadrin attacked Zul'jin with a mental assault that left him reeling in pain. By the time the furious Amani warlord had recovered, Dar'Khan's power had replenished, and the mage teleported the group to safety. Zul'jin's brutal torture of Lor'themar would not be forgotten by the elves.\nZul'jin was the first forest troll since those terrible wars to reunite the tribes of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. One by one he had challenged the other tribe leaders and defeated them, whether at combat or at racing or at some other task. And all had bowed before him, pledging themselves and their tribes to his rule. The forest trolls were a single people once more. He believed that with the Horde's help they would wipe the world clean of humans and elves alike, rule the forests once more, and avenge the ancient &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the orcish Warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to approach the troll leader, Zul'jin, and asked him to join the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Zul'jin initially refused, believing the trolls capable of handling the elves themselves and not seeing any benefit to joining wars against others. Months later, he was captured by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, held in a prison camp near &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20of%20Zul%27jin\"&gt;freed&lt;/a&gt; by Orgrim himself. Impressed, he agreed to join the Horde and assisted it throughout the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nZul'jin's goal was not hindered by this alliance, and he believed that the Horde would have no use for the lands the Amani would take over. On the other hand, Zul'jin himself had no desire to extend his conquest beyond Quel'Thalas, and thus was confident in his new allies and the honorable Doomhammer.\nUltimately, Zul'jin was most eager to utterly conquer his mortal enemies, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with the Horde's help, and claiming King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s head (and forcing it to watch Quel'Thalas burn) was his primary goal during this time. He assisted the Horde in reaching Quel'Thalas, and went on ahead to claim his vengeance upon the elves for the fateful &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; so many years ago.\nZul'jin fought throughout the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and he and Doomhammer developed a mutual respect, however, Zul'jin grew furious when Doomhammer not only failed to destroy Quel'Thalas, but also abandoned his siege against the elves in favor of assaulting &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Zul'jin and his armies stayed behind, continuing to fight on, yet the high elven king seized the chance to upset the balance of power between them for good, and sent out spellcasters and priests to help the rangers and warriors crush the Amani. Zul'jin was cornered near &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;Darrowmere Lake&lt;/a&gt;, unable to reach the water due to the walls of rampant dragon fire scorching the area. He put up a fierce fight, but his entourage was cut down and Zul'jin was taken into the custody of the elf &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, who set up camp and waited for the fire to subside. Chaining Zul'jin to a stone pillar, Halduron's men brutally tortured Zul'jin for hours on end, even gouging his eye out. Halduron was a close friend and comrade of Lor'themar Theron, and still remembered his friend's ordeal at Zul'jin's hands years before. He declined counsel to simply execute Zul'jin, hoping to drag his prisoner to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; alive so that Lor'themar could decide his fate. Yet this decision to keep the chieftain alive for punishment and revenge rather than execute him on the spot - many more of the rangers had lost friends and family to Zul'jin's constant campaigns - would prove short-sighted: in a daring rescue attempt, Amani raiders wounded Brightwing and caused enough havoc for Zul'jin to escape, the chieftain cutting off his own arm with a discarded spear to do so.\nZul'jin's escape forever solidified his legendary reputation among trolls of all kinds. Denouncing the Horde, the Amani went back into their seclusion, watching and waiting for the right time to strike out against the elves once more.\nBlood of the Highborne.\nZul'jin's chance came at last following the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion of Quel'Thalas, in which roughly ninety percent of the kingdom's elven population was slain. The trolls readied an armada of &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; to attack the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, now undefended with the elves' great shield dispelled, and to secure the Sunwell as a weapon against them. While this particular endeavor ended in failure, Zul'jin nonetheless seized the chance to attack the elves' tenuously-held settlements in both &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, though again, these attacks were met with only short-term victories. The elves - now calling themselves \"blood elves\" - proved more resilient than the trolls had expected. \nZul'jin's re-emergence became apparent after a raid of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; treasure hunters attempted to plunder &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. The sole survivor of this attempt informed the blood elves of Zul'jin's return.\nThe Gods of Zul'Aman.\nZul'jin retired to the city of Zul'Aman, capital of the Amani trolls, where he called upon mysterious dark powers to rebuild his army. While the eyes of Azeroth focused on the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the expedition to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, treasure-seekers invaded Zul'Aman, rekindling Zul'jin's hatred of the outside world - particularly the high elves of Quel'Thalas. Upon hearing that these newly christened blood elves had become part of the Horde in his absence, the infuriated Zul'jin declared war on both Horde and Alliance. Reaffirming his hatred for the outside world, Zul'jin resolved to take down all of his enemies with this dark new power. After that the &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hex%20Lord%20Malacrass\"&gt;Malacrass&lt;/a&gt; suggested a way for the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; to get great power through dark ways, with which Zul'jin in his anger agreed.\nHaving survived his ordeal with the high elves, and indeed the entire &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion that had crippled much of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Zul'jin and the Amani persisted in their goal to wipe the elves out. The high elves, having renamed \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\" in honor of their fallen brethren, began to take back much of Quel'Thalas themselves and most of the soldiers become occupied within Outland during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Zul'jin, seeing this as an opportunity, coordinated a number of attacks on the reforming elves from &lt;a href=\"Tor%27Watha\"&gt;Tor'Watha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeb%27Watha\"&gt;Zeb'Watha&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani's holdings in &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;Eversong&lt;/a&gt;, and directly out of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; in the Ghostlands. Despite being able to draw upon the ghostly spirits of each of the four liberated animal gods from Zul'Aman (and being able to change his own shape to assume their powers), Zul'jin was ultimately slain by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers.\nCataclysm.\nAfter Zul'jin's death, Zul'Aman became quiet, as a new warlord named &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt; rose to power. Under Daakara's leadership, the Amani have received the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; in rebuilding, and are pledged to their progenitors in creating a vast troll empire in response to the turmoil of the Cataclysm.\nAs a result, Zul'Aman was retooled as a heroic-only five-man dungeon in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1.0\"&gt;patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, and Daakara replaced Zul'jin as its final boss.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nStatues of Zul'jin are present within &lt;a href=\"Tal%27aman\"&gt;Tal'aman&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; enclave found at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nAfter his death, Zul'jin's soul was sent to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"the%20Nine\"&gt;the Nine&lt;/a&gt; showed the realms of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, she asked to see where Zul'jin had been sent; she was angered when she learned that the troll was to receive a chance at redemption, unlike her who had been sent to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. The Nine subsequently showed Sylvanas that the soul of the elven prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; was also held captive in Revendreth. She noted the irony that the former leaders of two races who loathed each other were being tormented in the same realm, both unaware of each other's presence.\nIn-game, Zul'jin\u2014referred to as a Wrathful Soul\u2014can be found in a hidden crypt in the northwestern part of the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Atonement\"&gt;Halls of Atonement&lt;/a&gt;, carrying his &lt;a href=\"sinstone\"&gt;sinstone&lt;/a&gt; and reminiscing how elves killed him. The crypt is blocked by a carpet that can be accessed either by clicking the nearby &lt;a href=\"Flickering%20Candle\"&gt;Flickering Candle&lt;/a&gt; or by certain abilities. This room is only accessible when a \"Secret Treasure\" appears in the northwest of the Halls of Atonement, indicating the switch is able to be used.\nAs Wrathful Souls are otherwise only found in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Ward\"&gt;Military Ward&lt;/a&gt;, and he is hiding, it can be presumed he escaped.\nThough it is unknown as to how he ended up in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; rescues even the souls of all trolls, even those who try to kill him, Bwonsamdi does make mention that he has lost a soul at least once before.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \", Zul'jin appeared as a minor character. Although once \"the fiercest troll ever to flay an &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;\" and mastermind behind the alliance of the orcs and trolls, he now ran a run-down trading post in an &lt;a href=\"Ork%20Reservation\"&gt;orcish reservation&lt;/a&gt; after the Horde was defeated. He was fond of collecting the blade hands of &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; warriors who traded their most prized possessions to him for &lt;a href=\"black%20ale\"&gt;black ale&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe had items of varied origins, \"from the islands of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; to the fire-pits of the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;\". Among the curiosities in his shop were the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%27s%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Lightning's Blade clan&lt;/a&gt;, the saddle of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, the spell book of &lt;a href=\"Mugg%27roth\"&gt;Mugg'roth&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; from the deck of a &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;, a lamp made from the skull of an &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;, chalices from a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Temple of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, and a black velvet painting of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the TCG.\nZul'jin appears in the Warcraft TCG. Interestingly his class is listed as a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, which would fit the descriptions of Zul'jin using guerilla and stealthy tactics, as well as the Warcraft II's manual description of him as a Rogue Troll.\nIn the RPG.\nZul'jin's name is a title and means a great tribal &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;. Zul'jin disappeared after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and most believed he died under a hail of &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s arrows.\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion \"\", Zul'jin serves as the champion of &lt;a href=\"Halazzi\"&gt;Halazzi&lt;/a&gt;'s Lynxes, a fast and ferocious team of troll &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and appears as .

{"id": "113311", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=113311", "title": "Zul'jin (tactics)", "text": "Zul'jin is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; instance.\nAbilities.\nEvery time his health drops by 20%, he walks to the center of the platform, switches form, and does a threat wipe. Note that he's immune to Taunt, but Debuffs (and DoTs) remain on him. The use of &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; is strongly recommended for every phase change.\nPhase 3: Eagle Form.\nWhile in Eagle Form, he remains stationary, and doesn't attack. \nStrategy.\nGet your whole group up on his platform past the threshold when you start the fight, there's a wall of fire that closes his platform off. The 8 adds don't have many hitpoints and die fast to AoE. The adds are linked to the boss.\nEvery phase change he does a threat wipe, so be careful with DoTs. He's immune to Taunt, so the tank must quickly gain aggro. Use Mis-direction if possible. When he turns into an Eagle you do not need to worry about the threat list though, as explained below. He changes phases every 20% of his hitpoints.\nAlso, raid members might want to consider changing their gear out for max, or at least more, stamina. Having the mages/priests/healers above 9k health is a lot of help in this fight.\nPhase 1.\nMelees watch out for his whirlwind. Healers react quickly to \"Grievous Throw\". Players only lose this DoT when their health reaches 100%. General methods which make players immune to phsysical damage like Paladin bubbles/Ice Block can work here. The dwarven racial &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt; also removes it. It is not advised to use Healthstones or Healing Potions to remove it because he can hit the same person several times in succession and these will be much more useful in Phase 4.\nPhase 2.\nAs soon as he starts this phase you will notice everyone gets a Paralysis debuff. Dispel it off the main tank and yourself, then other healers if time (or the tank doesn't need a heal). DPS etc do not need it dispelled. After 5 seconds of having the debuff, you will take damage and become stunned, assign someone to top people off before the next. He can hit decently hard, so keep the tank topped. Uses overpower on the tank.\nTwo tactics exist to cleanse the debuff. Either have the raid stack, and use Mass Dispel to cleanse the entire raid of the debuff, or just dispel the MT and a healer or two of the debuff.\nPhase 3.\nThe tornados have a fixed algorithm of movement, they'll move to one person, hit them once, and start moving towards another person.\nThe best way to avoid this is to leave your two best melee dps hitting the boss, and the other members go to the corners of the room, two at the sides of the entrance, two on the left side on each corner, two on the right side on each corner, and two on the bottom of the stairs where Zul'jin is standing, leave a healer at one side of the entrance and one on each side of the room, so each healer will have line of sight of at least six members of the raid, this will minimize the damage taken by the tornados. \nThe tornados knock you back and deal around 1k damage. If you are a caster (yes healers included) every time you cast you will get hit for about 1250 damage. Heal over time spells really make this phase much easier. Melee need to try and burn him down as quick as they can, as they get no punishment for doing damage. Use bandages. Casters use wands and regenerate mana for the next phases. Hunters may use Arcane Shot, Steady Shot, Multi Shot, Aimed Shot, and Serpent Sting. Hunters will take damage from using Feign Death, Rapid Fire, and switching Aspects. Hunters are important for doing lots of damage during this phase. It is recommended that hunters use Rapid Fire on this phase, even though you will take damage, as a good use of Rapid Fire can really be helpful.\nRetribution Paladins can use Crusader Strike without taking damage. Spells with a base mana cost of 0 such as Desperate Prayer, Inner Focus, and Starshards will not cause damage to the caster.\nWarlocks can use Shadow Bolts timed in conjunction with Drain Life to nullify the repercussion from casting and maintain DPS. With healing assistance you can get all your DoTs off and take minimal damage.\nIt's worth mentioning that casters can follow a spell with a casting time by an instant casting spell without getting hit twice by the tornadoes. For example, a druid can cast rejuvenation right after casting regrowth (not necessarily on the same target) and just get hit once.\nPhase 4.\nLynx form he melees fairly weak on the tank. He also will use Claw Rage on a random player in the raid and melee them. Claw Rage is the deadliest ability of this fight Zul'jin will turn towards a player and pause for a second then starts to hit that player several times increasing damage and attack speed every hit doing a lot of damage in a short time. Intervene near the end of the phase (9-11 stacks) to help out cloth wearers. Healers must use fast spells or instant spells, lag can make suvival problematic here. Announce Vanish/Divine Shield/etc to the raid, so healers know that he will change back to the tank. Healers take good care of Lynx Rush victims, as everyone should be topped for the next Claw Rage. He will stop claw rage on the target if the target uses &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Blessing of Protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; and will return to his default highest threat target. The dwarf racial &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt; can also help mitigate the damage. Druids should use &lt;a href=\"Barkskin\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt; and can try to turn into Bear Form if they are fast enough although that limits them from using potions.\nEveryone needs to be on their toes to stay alive, he's very fast, and your health can drop quickly. Keep Healthstones/potions ready.\nHealers may find the following macro useful in the Lynx phase. It will quickly find Zul'jin's target and cast your fast heal on them. Hit this macro as soon as you see him turn to go after a raid member. Replace Regrowth with your appropriate fast heal spell (ie: Flash of Light, Flash Heal, Lesser Healing Wave).\nPhase 5.\nEveryone will get a buffet like debuff every so often, increasing fire damage taken. He will choose random people throughout the raid and place a beam of fire on them. They may take lots of damage due to the debuff, so move out of these beams ASAP. It's a simple phase if people are good at staying out of void zones. Spread out so only one person is hit at the same time.\nFlame Breath will hit the tank for more and more fire damage due to the debuff, so DPS him down as fast as you can. The tank needs to build threat fast, but also stay focused to move out of the beams quickly.\nMelee stay in his back to avoid getting hit by Flame Breath.\nQuotes.\nIntro:\nAggro:\nTransforms into Bear:\nTransforms into Lynx:\nTransforms into Eagle:\nTransforms into Dragonhawk:\nDragonhawk Fire Breath:\nKilling a player:\nEnrage:\nDeath:\nPatch 2.3 Trailer.\n\"Dis was our land.

The high priest and a retinue of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to the Thunder King's domain with a simple offer: that the Zandalari and the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; would ally with one another, teach each other their secrets and together conquer &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The offer intrigued Lei Shen, but in truth, both him and Zulathra plotted to betray the other, as the troll planned to steal Lei Shen's godlike powers the moment he had learned the mogu's secrets. Nevertheless, the mogu and the trolls found each other to be invaluable allies, and their pact endured for many years.\nWhen Lei Shen announced his intent to conquer &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; device known as the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, he invited Zulathra to join him. Lei Shen had artificially extended the elderly troll's life, but once the Forge was under mogu control, they would unlock the secret to eternal life. Almost all of the highest-ranking Zandalari accompanied Zulathra and Lei Shen, expecting to also be granted immortality. However, Zulathra and his honor guard died along with the Thunder King's armies when Uldum's &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; guardians activated the Forge, instantly killing all life in the region. The dead Zandalari who had followed Zulathra were buried at &lt;a href=\"Kings%27%20Rest\"&gt;Kings' Rest&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Halls of Ash&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mengazi\"&gt;Mengazi&lt;/a&gt;, who led the Zandalari forces during the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Zandalari Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, was a descendant of Zulathra.\nSpeculation.\nAs both \"one of\" the Zandalari leaders and a high priest, he may have been part of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;."}

This massive, golden &lt;a href=\"temple%20city\"&gt;temple city&lt;/a&gt; is considered the jewel of all &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; civilizations. Built atop the highest peaks of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in a series of giant ziggurats, its majestic pyramids tower above the jungle canopy and its &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;indomitable navy&lt;/a&gt; controls the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that, every six years, envoys from all the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes convey in order to share information and discuss matters that may affect the entire troll race. Recently, the kingdom has faced attacks by forces both within and without, with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;city's gates&lt;/a&gt; assailed by the rising tide of a relentless enemy, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDescription.\nNestled deep in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;'s primal jungle, Zuldazar is a remnant of the once-mighty &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalar empire&lt;/a&gt;. A vast coastline surrounds Zuldazar to the south, east, and west, offering bountiful opportunities for fishing, boating, swimming, and treasure hunting. To the north are the marshland of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, and the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh above the jungle canopies, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Throne\"&gt;Golden Throne&lt;/a&gt; serves as Zuldazar's city center, with some of the most breathtaking views in the region. It is from here that &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, king of the Zandalari, rules. A vast, ancient cityscape of interconnected terraces sprawls out below, dotted with temples devoted to the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, which are maintained by their loyal servants.\nVisitors can find anything they need for an extended stay in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the city. Facilities include an inn, portals to all major Horde cities along with Dalaran, profession trainers, a bank, training dummies, vendors, and more. It\u2019s easy to get lost this ancient, multileveled city\u2014but that only emphasizes its vastness and grandeur.\nThere are thousands of steps throughout Zuldazar. One needs to keep an eye out or risk plummeting into one of the many thunderous waterfalls surrounding the city. Worshipped as deities by the Zandalar trolls, many of the temples dedicated to them can be often found on high ground or mountain peaks, which are viewed as sacred ground by the devout. In the southern part of city at its lowest point is the expansive &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that the Zandalari berth their &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;mighty fleet&lt;/a&gt; and traders from around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; sell their wares and services.\nZandalar's rich tapestry of flora and fauna deserve research and cataloguing. The Zandalari have shown themselves to be able beast masters, having domesticated many of the creatures that roam the land. Some of these serve as helpful allies to the Zandalari; others prove obstacles to those who would seek to exploit the jungle's resources. Tamed Ravasaurs, Brutosaurs, Pterrodax, and Direhorns make up just a portion of their menagerie. There are countless other wild beasts that make their homes in surrounding jungles, from Muddy Riverbeasts to Roaming Nibblers.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Road\"&gt;Golden Road&lt;/a&gt; from the city and up into the mountains to the west will eventually lead to &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;. These ancient pyramids have served as the resting place for Zandalari kings for millennia. With each passing ruler, new rooms are constructed to house the deceased\u2019s vast wealth.\nZuldazar has mountains reaching altitudes so high that it is hard for most species to breathe.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;primordial Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, a series of peaks and plateaus located in the southern part of the continent was home to many &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s. Due to their reverence for these beings, which they called &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;\"loa\"&lt;/a&gt;, the early &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s settled on the holy mountain range and gave it the name \"Zandalar\", building small encampments upon its slopes. The most powerful group of trolls was called the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Its members claimed nearly all of Zandalar's tallest plateaus, believing them to be sacred ground. Atop the highest peaks they built a small cluster of crude shrines, which over time grew into a bustling temple city known as Zuldazar.\nZandalar has accepted the tortollan as an exception to their troll-only policy due to the useful information they provide the trolls. The Zandalari did try to get rid of them once, but the tortollans managed to change the mind of then-&lt;a href=\"Tezlekhan\"&gt;King Tezlekhan&lt;/a&gt; using their political influence and information they had gathered on the royal family.\nCataclysm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; inflicted great damage on Zuldazar, causing the great palace of &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; to list to one side, the forum to be flooded with sea water, jagged fissures tearing up the tiles, and high tides coming up to the market awnings. But while there was some damage, the city was rebuilt, after &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;'s departure.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nYears later, as conflict once again erupted between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s made greater and greater incursions into Zuldazar from &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;. Princess Talanji, frustrated from her father's inadequate response to this threat, sought outside help from the Horde, but she was intercepted by the Alliance. After the Horde saved Zul and &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockades\"&gt;Stormwind Stockades&lt;/a&gt;, Zandalar let the Horde establish an embassy within the pyramid of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later, &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; launched an insurrection against Rastakhan. With Zandalar opening its borders to non-trolls, other races such as &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Zuldazar's port to do trade.\nZuldazar was raided by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in the death of King &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and the crippling of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting there.\nThe main way to travel here is to use the portal in the Portal Room (&lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. But there is also a boat that departs from the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. \nWild creatures.\nZuldazar is also home to many carnivorous flowers.\nIn the RPG.\nZuldazar includes standard troll architecture: It features a winding, tiered structure of walls and buildings. Thousands of cannibalistic &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s inhabit these ziggurats. Zuldazar is the seat of &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and hosts a gathering of all the troll tribes every six years; the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s meet to share information and plot (most likely).\nSpeculation.\nTaking all of the notes above into consideration and combining it with the fact that Zuldazar has always been the Zandalari capital, and every region has &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; temples\u2014required to form a temple city\u2014and that all Zandalari ruins across Zandalar are connected to each other as well as the loa temples, it is possible that Zuldazar at its height covered all of modern Zandalar. In fact, Zuldazar most likely stretched far beyond the borders of modern Zandalar in the past, as most of what was once the Zandalar Mountains is today beneath the waves as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, &lt;a href=\"Nazwatha\"&gt;Nazwatha&lt;/a&gt; in Nazmir has a massive road enclosed by buildings extending far into the ocean from the pyramid, meanwhile the of Zuldazar from ' shows a part of Zuldazar that did not make it into ' (though inspiring &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;), while also showing that the city had massive structures and plateaus built up against the sides of tall mountains, those parts of the mountain range now being lost beneath the sea.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}
