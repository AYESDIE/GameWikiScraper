Forgewright was a celebrated architect from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;. He oversaw the construction of, among other things, the &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Dam\"&gt;Stonewrought Dam&lt;/a&gt; and much of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; can be found as a &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Forgewright%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Forgewright's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; in the center of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. He can only be seen while in ghost form.\nBiography.\nFranclorn was responsible for the design of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; fortress of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; in the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, under the control of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, tore out the heart of the mountain. Franclorn was the creator of the \"stonewrought\" method of architecture and oversaw the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Dam\"&gt;Stonewrought Dam&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;. He also created the twin hammers &lt;a href=\"Ironfoe\"&gt;Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironfel\"&gt;Ironfel&lt;/a&gt;. Franclorn chose to keep Ironfel for himself, but Ironfoe was gifted to the great-great-grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and would years later be wielded by Reginald himself.\nAs chief architect, Franclorn had in his possession the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Key\"&gt;Shadowforge Key&lt;/a&gt;, master key to the city. The &lt;a href=\"Monument%20of%20Franclorn%20Forgewright\"&gt;monument&lt;/a&gt; erected in his honor (which it seems he likely designed himself) holds two secrets: within the base is a tiny compartment in which he stored the master key, and the empty grip of the statue itself was designed to permanently lock Ironfel in place. Inserting Ironfel would open the key's compartment, but the hammer would essentially become one with the statue. Any attempt to remove the hammer would shatter the monument and the hammer with it.\nBelieving that he did not have a choice, Franclorn stood by and watched the corruption of Ragnaros seep through the hearts and minds of the Dark Iron nation, and when the construction of the Spire was complete, the architect's will to live among his people gave way. His &lt;a href=\"Forgewright%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; was placed at the entrance of the city he planned and built in honor of his efforts, and his great hammer, Ironfel, was then handed down to the new chief architect, &lt;a href=\"Fineous%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fineous Darkvire&lt;/a&gt;. However, Darkvire's arrogance and scheming have drawn the ire of Franclorn from beyond the grave, and the ghost of the late chief architect now seeks to reclaim Ironfel from Darkvire before it can be used for ill.\nFranclorn's spirit would meet &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s that were exploring the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; and shared his story with them, the secrets of his monument, and how they could retrieve the Shadowforge Key. In exchange, they would kill Darkvire and make sure that Ironfel would never be used to create evil to be unleashed upon the world.\nIn the RPG.\nFranclorn Forgewright was the chief architect and designer for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; and inventor of the \"Stonewrought\" method; the name \"Stonewrought\" refers to his works. Franclorn was likely not evil; rather, he chose to side with his clan (the Dark Irons) out of honor and loyalty."}

Frank talks about many types of portals you could have, like the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Frank explains that where he comes from, they have their own names for things, rather than the more complicated names. Frank realizes that they have both missed the boat, but Beans tells him not to change the subject just because he is losing the argument, which he tells him that he is not. He then tells Beans that a boat is known to him as a \"moving portal\". As the boat arrives again, Frank blinks onto the boat, leaving Beans on the docks.\nEpisode Three: The Fourth Wall.\nJacob Filla announced there is a script on \"The Fourth Wall\" which involves an invisible wall involving the audience."}

{"id": "15105", "revid": "50971362", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15105", "title": "Turalyon", "text": "High Exarch Turalyon (pronounced \"Tuhr-AHL-ee-ohn\") is one of the first five &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to the other paladins, Turalyon was previously a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; rather than a warrior. Serving the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army with distinction during and immediately after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he was second in command to Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Allied Commander. During the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar was struck down in combat against &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. It was General Turalyon that picked up Lothar's battle standard and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Royal%20Sword\"&gt;broken sword&lt;/a&gt;, and rallied the army of the Alliance to victory over the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, capturing Orgrim and driving the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s back to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. As the Lion's &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon was named Lothar's successor as Supreme Commander by the monarchs of the Alliance.\nAfter the war ended, Turalyon led the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. There they achieved a series of military victories against the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and successfully destroyed the Dark Portal's stone frame, severing the link between the two worlds. The victory, however, was short-lived. As the Sons of Lothar clashed with the remnants of the Horde's forces, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; had unleashed a powerful spell that tore open countless portals, ripping the world apart. After fleeing through a nearby rift, Turalyon and his lover, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, became separated from their companions. Their whereabouts were unknown for decades.\nFollowing their disappearance, Turalyon and Alleria encountered the prime &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Separated from physical reality and the flow of time, the pair joined the Lightforged as they waged war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; in a struggle that spanned a millennium. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;final war against the Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon and Alleria finally reunited with their comrades when the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; united with the Army of Light to assault the Legion homeworld, &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Turalyon has lived this long because &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; blessed him and, in her words, he \"has crossed the boundaries of mortality. He has been found worthy to become an eternal protector of creation.\"\nAfter the Burning Legion was defeated, Turaylon rejoined the Alliance. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he served as one of the commanders of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, that ultimately ended in Alliance victory. Following the war, he was appointed as Lord Commander of the Alliance forces and with the capture of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon, with the support of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;, became the regent and protector of the realm.\nTuralyon was one of the main protagonists in \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nTuralyon was born to the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and his father's name was &lt;a href=\"Dorus\"&gt;Dorus&lt;/a&gt;. Since he was a small child, Turalyon believed in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, but he had never felt it directly. As a boy Turalyon had been forward enough, often devising the games he and his friends played or commanding one of their mock-armies when they played at war. But once he'd joined the priesthood all that had changed. He had taken orders from the senior priests, and then after they had brought him to &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; he'd followed the archbishop's instructions. He studied in the ways of the Light and became a priest, healing the sick and the wounded.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon had spent most of the decade prior in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, which he now considered as close to a home as he had.\nThe Second War.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; Turalyon was one of the most venerated priests in Lordaeron. When the leaders at the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt; grew divided as &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; threatened to abandon the council out of fear of losing their regional power to unity, Turalyon brought the orphaned Prince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to his side and called upon the kings to cease quarreling over meaningless issues. If they did not, he announced, then every kingdom would be destroyed and every city would be burned as Stormwind had been, and their children would be orphaned like Varian if they even survived at all. Turalyon argued that if humanity failed to unite they would be remembered as a people that could've saved &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; but were too proud to put aside political ambitions, yet if humanity did form an alliance they could change history and become the guardians of Azeroth. These words saw the Council of Seven Nations erupt into applause, even from Greymane and Perenolde, and resulted in a unanimous vote to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the beginning of the war, he was chosen by Archbishop Faol as one of the four candidates from Lordaeron to start the order of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, along with his mentor &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad&lt;/a&gt;. While traveling with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s army, Turalyon and the others were trained vigorously day and night by Faol, who taught them how to use the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to comfort their allies, to smite their enemies and how to lead by example, as they would be more than weapons but beacons of hope to guide the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As their training progressed, Faol presented each of the paladins with enchanted &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s that were among the church's most ancient relics. Each libram represented a core trait of the Silver Hand that Faol challenged his students to become the living embodiment of, and Turalyon was given the Libram of Protection. After becoming a paladin of the order, Lothar chose Turalyon as his lieutenant, a decision that made an already uncertain Turalyon question his worth even more. The young Turalyon developed a rapport with Khadgar, who despite his aged appearance, was roughly the same age as the paladin. Turalyon was also introduced to &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of a cadre of &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s who had been sent to assess the situation by the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the first &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;skirmishes&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon fought at Lothar's side. After forcing the Horde from their initial beach landing, the Alliances forces followed the Horde northeast to the mountain pass leading to the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;' keep of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Unknown to the trailing Alliance forces, the Horde's goal was not the dwarven stronghold there. It was merely a feint to lure the bulk of their pursuers into a cat-and-mouse diversion in the mountains and forests of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, while the main body of the Horde marched on the elven homeland of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. From this location, the Horde could launch an assault on either &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Lothar sent Turalyon, Khadgar, and Alleria to intercept the Horde before Quel'Thalas burned. The army was ferried from below &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; to an area near &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and continued to the border of Quel'Thalas. The Horde proceeded and set fire to &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt; in southern Quel'Thalas.\nTuralyon and his troops moved quickly to catch the Horde and trap them between themselves and high elven forces under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General\"&gt;Ranger-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; took many turns, with a sizable portion of the Eversong Forest being destroyed, but ultimately the Horde abandoned Quel'Thalas. On the battlefield, despite his self-doubt, young Turalyon was able to develop a mutual respect with both Sylvanas and her second-in-command &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. The brutal assault on their home convinced the elves to throw their full support behind the Alliance, and when Turalyon left Quel'Thalas, it was at the head of an elven armada.\nAs a result of these events, Alleria sought comfort in the arms of Turalyon and both spent a single night together, but the next morning she was gone. Turalyon emerged from his tent to news that Alleria had personally lost eighteen kin of various degrees of closeness. And among the dead was her &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;younger brother&lt;/a&gt;. Turalyon tried to talk to Alleria, but she grew cold towards him and chose to dedicate herself to revenge against the orcs.\nTuralyon with high elven forces arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, after passing through the mountainous region of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, just in time to turn back &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Capital%20City\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;, and then chased the orcs back to the beaches of Southshore.\nThe Lion's lieutenant.\nTuralyon and his comrades rejoined the rest of the Alliance army after the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the Horde to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; itself. The battle proved to be devastating for both sides. In the midst of the battle, Turalyon saw Lothar fighting against the orc warchief, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, in single combat. Turalyon desperately fought his way towards them, but he was barred by orc warriors and could do nothing more but watch as Doomhammer shattered the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Royal%20Sword\"&gt;Great Royal Sword&lt;/a&gt; and brought his &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt; down on Lothar's helm with a sickening crunch. Turalyon shoved his way through the crowd and knelt by the body of his hero as the warchief laughed and proclaimed victory.\nDoomhammer's words - \"I have conquered! And so shall all our foes die, until your world belongs to us!\" - brought Turalyon to a revelation. For months he had been struggling with his faith and had been unable to wield the Light like &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; and the other paladins could. He did not understand how to reconcile the notion of the Light uniting all creatures while beings as cruel and monstrous as the orcs walked the world, but Orgrim's comment reminded him that the orcs were not of his world. Turalyon reasoned that the Light only united the creatures of Azeroth and that creatures who did not belong there - like the orcs - could be struck down with impunity. Now confident in his faith, Turalyon began to shine with a brilliant glow that forced onlookers to shield their eyes.\nTaking up Lothar's shattered sword, Turalyon disarmed Doomhammer and struck him unconscious. Other orcs cowered from him as the light around him grew blinding, and the black rock on which he stood was blanched white by its power. Turalyon and the other paladins rallied the Alliance forces, while many of the orcs began to panic. Some stood and fought, some surrendered, and others fled. After the battle, control over the Alliance army fell to Turalyon - as he was Lothar's lieutenant and sub-commander, no one questioned his right to lead. Uther expressed his happiness at seeing Turalyon's faith finally emerge, and Turalyon bestowed the title of \"the Lightbringer\" upon the older paladin.\nWith the battle lost, the Horde retreated towards the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Under Turalyon's command, the Alliance launched its &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;assault against the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Turalyon led the charge to the portal's stairs, where he dueled &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; there. Cut off from reinforcements and fractured by infighting, the Horde finally buckled in upon itself and fell before the might of the Alliance. With the ending of the Horde menace, the Alliance rounded up the scattered orc clans within guarded internment camps and began rebuilding their devastated kingdoms. Turalyon also led his men to the destroyed &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Some months later, he and Khadgar happened to be in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; watching the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Hovel\"&gt;statue of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and discussing the possibility of the return of the Horde.\nTuralyon helped &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; secure his place as Stormwind's next king by providing him with experienced ministers and advisors. He also oversaw the repatriation of the citizens of Stormwind and the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; between Stormwind City and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; keeping Turalyon informed about updates or problems. During that time, Turalyon also wrote letters to Alleria, but she never answered.\nExpedition to Draenor.\nOnly two years later, the mystical gateway between Azeroth and Draenor opened again, and orc forces began pouring out into the empty, open landscape of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter receiving Khadgar's urgent message about the new orcish invasion, Turalyon arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; with Alliance reinforcements. Alongside Khadgar and &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;'s soldiers, they kept the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; contained. Yet the humans couldn't shake the suspicion that the orcs were not throwing their full might into the invasion. To find answers, Alliance forces captured one of the &lt;a href=\"Gaz%20Soulripper\"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt;. They brought him back to the keep for interrogation. Turalyon led the questioning, calling on the Holy Light to draw out information from a &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. The captive eventually talked and confirmed that the Horde's new leader, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, had no interest in Azeroth, instead he wanted to open portals from Draenor to other worlds.\nAfter that shocking revelation a &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;luminous crystalline figure&lt;/a&gt; appeared before Turalyon in a vision. It encouraged him to proceed with his decision to put an end to the orcs' evil forever. Turalyon and Khadgar both agreed that they could not allow the Horde to invade another world. Turalyon raised his banner, declaring that he would lead the \"&lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;\" into the orcish homeworld and end the Horde forever. Nearly every one of the Second War's most revered heroes \u2013 including Alleria Windrunner, Danath Trollbane, and &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 answered the call.\nUnder Turalyon's command the Sons of Lothar smashed through the Horde's warriors, forcing them to scatter into the far corners of the Blasted Lands. With the way clear, the Alliance expedition force marched through the Dark Portal and laid eyes upon the Red World for the first time. Upon arriving, Turalyon renewed his relationship with Alleria Windrunner, much to the relief of their friends, and lay siege to the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The Sons of Lothar were victorious, but they had no time to rest or rejoice. The presence of &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragons&lt;/a&gt; at Hellfire Citadel was an ill omen. What was worse, Khadgar discovered that Ner'zhul had marched southwest with the rest of the Horde and most of his potent artifacts. Strangely, the archmage did not sense the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; moving with them, he felt its presence somewhere in the north. The Skull of Gul'dan was needed to destroy Draenor's side of the Dark Portal, so Turalyon decided to split his forces. One half would track down the Skull of Gul'dan, the other would apprehend Ner'zhul. Turalyon, Khadgar, and Alleria led the forces that sought out the Skull of Gul'dan to the north. Danath, Kurdran, and &lt;a href=\"Talthressar\"&gt;Talthressar&lt;/a&gt; pursued Ner'zhul to the south.\nWhen Turalyon, Khadgar, and Alleria arrived in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, they were deeply unsettled by what they had found. Battles between black dragons and &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; had resulted in many deaths. &lt;a href=\"Gruul\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt; and his followers had taken to impaling their slain enemies on spikes, displaying their corpses to all. The gronn nearly turned on the Sons of Lothar with violence, but Khadgar and Turalyon were quickly able to demonstrate that the Alliance was also the enemy of the black dragonflight. They struck a simple bargain with Gruul. If he gave them safe passage through Gorgrond, they would help him defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. The gronn and the Alliance prepared an ambush at the largest cache of Deathwing's eggs, nestled in one of Gorgrond's barren valleys. Turalyon hesitated at first, because these were the eggs of sentient creatures, essentially their defenseless infants. After Alleria reassured him, the Sons of Lothar destroyed as many of the unguarded eggs as they could, hoping to lure the black Dragon Aspect into the open. When Deathwing and his draconic followers appeared in the skies, they unleashed their molten fury on the intruders. During the battle Khadgar lashed Deathwing with his arcane power, ripping apart the metal plates bolted to the black Dragon Aspect's spine. The pain was so great that it forced him to drop the Skull of Gul'dan. \nHaving recovered the Skull of Gul'dan, Turalyon turned his forces south, fearing that Gruul and his followers would turn on them once they had defeated the dragons. Outside the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the two halves of the Alliance army reunited. Yet they had not reached the city in time to stop Ner'zhul. What was worse, the Horde had prepared for their arrival. The remnants of the orcish army had dug in around the Black Temple to keep the Sons of Lothar back. Ultimately the Alliance forces failed to stop Ner'zhul from blasting multiple holes through the fabric of reality. The &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; that Ner'zhul had unleashed destabilized Draenor's ley lines. The Sons of Lothar witnessed how unimaginable forces began to tear open rifts across Draenor. With each passing moment, the world groaned louder in upheaval. Fissures and volcanoes erupted in fiery fury across land and sea, as the earth began to shake beneath Turalyon's feet. The world of Draenor was dying.\nTuralyon and Khadgar knew what needed to be done. The Sons of Lothar would have to destroy the Dark Portal to protect their homeworld, and they would have to do so from Draenor. With chaos unfolding all around, there was no time to gather on Azeroth and perform the task there. It was a suicide mission, but no one hesitated.\nBack at the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the Horde were scrambling through the Dark Portal. They were none too pleased to see that someone had come to close off their only means of fleeing. The two sides crashed together outside the yawning gateway in their desperate attempt to escape oblivion. As the battle raged, Khadgar and the other magi unleashed the raw power contained within the Skull of Gul'dan. Turalyon and his forces encircled the &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s and fended off the terrified orcs who sought to flee from their world. The magi's spellwork ignited a massive explosion that destroyed the Dark Portal's stone frame and severed the bridge between Azeroth and Draenor. Yet there was little time to savor the victory.\nIn the chaos of Draenor's collapse, Turalyon led the forces of the Sons of Lothar that were with him through one of the volatile rifts, that separated Turalyon and Alleria from their friends. Turalyon's disappearance was not taken lightly by Danath, his brother in arms and successor as expedition leader. Trollbane exerted his full authority as the leader of the Sons of Lothar, and they would search from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, but found no leads. Eventually, Danath and Khadgar could do nothing more than call off the search and presume that Turalyon and Alleria were dead. Turalyon would later have a massive stone statue erected in his memory in the Valley of Heroes in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the other leaders of the Sons of Lothar.\nA Thousand Years of War.\nTuralyon and Alleria ended up elsewhere on Draenor, in an area of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; that was beginning to merge with the self-destructing world. They were found by &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; who had joined the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Lothraxion told them that they were fated to do battle against the Legion, and he had been sent to find them. However, the Legion had also dispatched an &lt;a href=\"Eradication%20%28eredar%29\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; to kill them. After Alleria made short work of the assassin, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; appeared before the two and told them that, though the Burning Legion had failed to enter Azeroth during the Second War, they would soon succeed in doing so. Alleria, wishing to see their son &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; once more, pushed Xe'ra to send them to Azeroth to rally the disparate nations to stand against the Legion. Xe'ra told them their aid would not be enough, but that they would be needed to do battle against the Legion elsewhere and were fated to discover the \"Emerald Star,\" which held the means to end the Legion forever. Turalyon and Alleria agreed with the necessity of Xe'ra's request and stepped through a portal to join the Army of Light.\nTuralyon and Alleria trained aboard the Army's &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\". After many years, Turalyon was infused with the Light by Xe'ra, granting him immortality. He also joined their &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs%20%28Army%20of%20the%20Light%29\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt;, and participated in many raids against the Burning Legion throughout the cosmos. Eventually, the Burning Legion invaded the remains of Draenor, now known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. As time flowed differently within the Twisting Nether, the 20 years had passed on Azeroth translated into more than 500 years for Turalyon. Alleria told Xe'ra of a vision she had seen of herself walking on the Legion stronghold world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, and that in this vision she had seen the Emerald Star. With Argus's defenses diminished by their invasion, Xe'ra recognized that there would be no better chance and sent Alleria and Turalyon to discover the truth of the Emerald Star. En route Alleria privately told Turalyon that her visions were sent not by the Light, but by &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;another force&lt;/a&gt; that Xe'ra would object to. Turalyon told her that while he respected Xe'ra wisdom, he trusted Alleria's instincts more and welcomed any help against the Burning Legion. As they explored Argus, Alleria was struck by a vision sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;titan world soul&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of Argus: \"it\" was the Emerald Star that was reviving slain demons of the Burning Legion. Though Turalyon did not see the vision, he spoke aloud a pledge to return and free the world soul from the Legion's imprisonment. When they returned to their transport, though, they found it surrounded by demons intent on capturing them. Though they struck down many demons with the Light, their defeat appeared certain until Alleria called instead upon the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, striking down the demons and opening a shadowy rift. Turalyon, who had become one with the Light, felt agonizing pain as she dragged him through it to a floating rock far away in the Twisting Nether. Dismayed at what she had done, he reached out to her only for their hands to burn at each others' touch. Alleria told him that she was not his enemy and to return to the \"Xenedar,\" and Turalyon watched in tears as she departed through another shadowy portal.\nUnbeknownst to Turalyon who was on Argus, his now 24-year-old son Arator went to Outland in search of his parents, motivated by dreams he had about his father. Though Arator did not find them, he found their old friend Danath Trollbane, whom he would pledge his sword to.\n500 Nether-years later, Turalyon had become the High Exarch of the Army of the Light. Though they had spent centuries opening rifts to make hit and run attacks on Argus, the Legion had finally enacted barrier generators to block their rifts. Following a failed assault to try and shut down the barriers, the assassin from Draenor--now reborn from within the Twisting Nether--snuck aboard the Xenedar and ambushed Turalyon, stabbing him and Lothraxion with a dagger that cut them off from the Light and prepared to trap Turalyon's soul within a soulstone. He gloated that Alleria was alive as the Legion's prisoner, and that she would share his fate, their souls imprisoned for all eternity. He was saved by the unexpected arrival of Alleria, who had received a vision of his torment while training to wield the Void. Alleria drove off the assassin, but could not stop the soulstone from draining Turalyon's soul. She instead used the Void to rip the assassin's poison out of Lothraxion, who saved Turalyon's soul and cleansed the poison from him in turn. Turalyon warned her to leave, as Xe'ra would not accept her use of the Void, Alleria refused to leave. When the naaru arrived, Turalyon pled for mercy for Alleria. When Alleria refused to renounce the Void, Xe'ra imprisoned her. Though Turalyon's thoughts were conflicted, he was comforted knowing that he would always trust and fight for Alleria, and she for him.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s third invasion of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the sentience core of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;, fell out of the sky and was delivered to Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. When Khadgar investigated Light's Heart, an image of Turalyon appeared from it with a message: the final plea of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Turalyon explained that Light's Heart represented the army's ultimate sacrifice and must reach &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Light's Heart reached out to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; who received another message from Turalyon, known as High Exarch, to his son, &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt;. He revealed that for him it had been \"ages\" that he and Alleria had fought the Burning Legion across the stars, and now the Legion was coming to Azeroth, with &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; being ordered to destroy everything Turalyon held dear. Turalyon told Arator that he must gather the defenders of the Light and fight, or all would be lost.\nWhen Balnazzar attacked &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand was sent to help the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, High Commander of the Grand Army of the Light, was sent as a reinforcement by Turalyon to help defeat the demons.\nArgus.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon survived the crash of the army's &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\", and was saved by the resident &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Krokul%20Hovel\"&gt;Krokul Hovel&lt;/a&gt; he met the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and heroes from Azeroth, and reunited with Lothraxion where he revealed he did not know the status of Alleria. While aiding the Krokul in their battle against the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;annihilan&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Annihilan%20Pits\"&gt;Annihilan Pits&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria arrived to help defeat &lt;a href=\"Aggonar\"&gt;Aggonar&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them traveled to the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", the dimensional ship that brought Azeroth's armies to Argus, where they reunited with their son &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward Turalyon, Alleria, and an adventurer set out to rescue Xe'ra from the wreck of the \"Xenedar\".\nWhen Xe'ra informed Illidan of the destiny she had seen for &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan rejected it, and Xe'ra consequently bound Illidan in chains of light to force the prophecy to be fulfilled by Lightforging Illidan. Illidan ultimately broke free, declared his destiny is his own, and killed Xe'ra. Horrified, Turalyon cried that Illidan had doomed them all, called him Betrayer, and attempted to slay him to avenge the Prime Naaru. Illidan grabbed Turalyon's blade with his hand, saying as fel blood leaked down his arm that his faith had blinded him and there was no chosen one--only they could save themselves, only staying his hand due to Velen's intervention.\nIn a reunion with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, the archmage informed Turalyon and Alleria that &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt; were both still alive though he did not get to see them as often as he would like. The three agreed that when the fight was behind them the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; would hold a reunion feast, and the couple reminded Khadgar that it was his turn to buy the drinks.\nRetrieving the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Sigil of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Crown of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; attracted the attention of the Burning Legion, who came to &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down the forces of Azeroth. Velen had traveled with the Army of the Light to the &lt;a href=\"Arinor%20Gardens\"&gt;Arinor Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to search for the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Crest of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden's piece of the Crown of the Triumvirate, prompting Turalyon and an adventurer to go and try to save them before it was too late. Velen was found in the ruins of his old home, before the childhood bed of his &lt;a href=\"Rakeesh\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;, who he asked to forgive him. Once they reunited, Velen revealed that his old friend &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the Legion's presence on Eredath and aimed to take the Crest of Knowledge beyond their reach. At &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Kil'jaeden's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; they learned that long ago &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; had thrown the Crest in the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; to rot alongside the naaru &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt;. After Velen recalled the day Sargeras came to the eredar, Talgath arrived to confront his old friend.\nTalgath commented on how unlike Velen it is for the Prophet to stand his ground, but that it was a welcome change of pace. Velen attempted to reach a peaceful solution and told Talgath to stand down, but Talgath refused. During the battle Talgath taunted Velen, telling him how his departure wounded Kil'jaeden and how cold Velen had been leaving his &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Nuuri\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and son behind. When Talgath was about to lose he attempted to flee, but Velen bound him with chains of light. Velen once more tried to get Talgath to help them find the Crest of Knowledge, but Talgath responded that they were too late, and not even the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; could escape the Seat of the Triumvirate where the Crest was hidden. Afterwards, Velen killed his old friend with a burst of holy magic.\nWith Talgath defeated, Velen realized from Talgath's words that the naaru L'ura had fallen to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. This concept was a foreign one to Turalyon, who thought it impossible for a naaru to fall to darkness. In response, Velen said there was much Xe'ra had not wanted Turalyon to know. Alleria and an adventurer would be the ones to break into the temple, defeat L'ura, and retrieve the Crest of Knowledge.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; is imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon talks about how part of him never expected to see the day the battle was over, after so many battles and so much loss. Returning home to a world he hasn't walked on in a thousand years worries him. His old life is long past, but it is time to build a new one and get to know the son who embodies everything he fought for.\nReturn to Azeroth.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria and Turalyon stood beneath the memorial statues that had been made for them after the destruction of Draenor, feeling unsettled. Alleria said that sometimes she felt as though she had already died twice, first at Draenor and then with &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt;. She wondered if death was the true legacy of the Windrunners. Turalyon knew she was anxious to meet Sylvanas no matter how she hid it, and while he told her she did not have to go, Alleria insisted that she did. She had to see her homeland with her own eyes and ask Sylvanas how she could ever wear the mantle of Warchief. Turalyon wanted Alleria to tell King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; about her meeting with her sisters since it took place in Horde territory and involved Sylvanas, the Horde's warchief, but Alleria argued that it was not a political meeting but a family affair taking place in their ancestral home. When Turalyon suggested he come with her, she discouraged him, insisting he would be bored.\nAs Alleria left through a shadowy portal, Turalyon promised her that he would tell Arator that she sends her love, and added that he would remind himself of the same thing.\nBefore the Storm.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll Benton&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon was asked to participate in a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt; and his advisors. Turalyon disagreed with Anduin's idea of having a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; between humans and their &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; relatives, and even went so far as to say Anduin misunderstood what the Light intended. As a tactician, Turalyon believed the Gathering was not worth the risk of an escalated altercation that can lead to political catastrophe and war. When Anduin brought him and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; to meet Turalyon's old friend and mentor Alonsus Faol, who was now a Forsaken himself, Turalyon's first reaction was cold loathing. When the furious Genn transformed into a &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; to attack Faol, Turalyon stopped him to prevent bloodshed in the cathedral. After Genn left the cathedral in rage, Turalyon told Faol that he &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemed&lt;/a&gt; what was once a good man and had stolen his form, and if there was anything left of his old friend Turalyon would kill him in mercy. But when Faol told Turalyon to look for the Light within him, Turalyon did not strike; when he did indeed find it, with tearful joy he knelt in front of the archbishop who gave him a blessing. Overjoyed Turalyon changed his mind about the Gathering and immediately admitting his views had been wrong, offered his help to Anduin.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; the evening before the Gathering, Turalyon attended a religious ceremony where Faol and a disguised &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; spoke to the humans who would soon meet their undead relatives. Though he admitted there was much he had been wrong about, he also thought that Genn was right to worry and told Anduin he had to make the best call with the information he had and his instinct. He reminded Anduin to let the Light guide them, but not control them. Reminded of what he had heard about Xe'ra, Anduin wished to later speak to Turalyon about his experiences. Turalyon in turn wanted Anduin to meet with Arator. He referred to the field where the Gathering was to take place a battlefield and had once meant it as a field of war, but later did so in a symbolic way, referring to the event itself as a battle \"for the hearts and minds of the future,\" and one well worth fighting.\nTuralyon attended the Gathering but was regulated to staying at &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; to organize the Alliance security forces. Though the Gathering started off peaceful, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; eventually ordered to recall the Forsaken participants. When some Forsaken participants refused or hesitated to retreat from the event, Anduin felt the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;'s pain in his body and realized that &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; had revealed herself to instruct any of the deserting Forsaken to find sanctuary in the Alliance's side of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas responded by sending her dark rangers to kill all the Forsaken participants. Turalyon was one of the Alliance leaders that scrambled to secure the Alliance participants.\nRejoining the Alliance.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon was present at the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, advocating for the inclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance. With the endorsement of King Anduin, Turalyon and a fellow Alliance champion headed to the &lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt; to address his troops. Since &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Fareeya\"&gt;Captain Fareeya&lt;/a&gt; was in the middle of recruiting more Lightforged, he allowed the Alliance champion to bear witness to the process of becoming Lightforged by undergoing the trials as &lt;a href=\"T%27paartos\"&gt;T'paartos&lt;/a&gt;' second. After successfully completing the trials, Turalyon officially inducted T'paartos as a member of the Lightforged and has Fareeya announced that from this day forward, the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; fights for the Alliance. He then returned to King Anduin to give the Lightforged draenei's official pledge of loyalty to the Alliance.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon, along with his old friend &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; commanders during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. His forces consisted of a mix of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; forces. Both raised &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Banner\"&gt;Blessed Banner&lt;/a&gt;s which bear the Hand's iconography. It is possible for him to fight &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, where he scoffed at the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; being led by a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, questioning what has happened on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to allow this. He also claimed that he is looking forward to enacting justice on a \"misguided paladin of the Horde\". The battle ultimately ended in the Alliance's favor, thanks to the leadership qualities of the Alliance commanders, and the tenacity of all the soldiers who fought.\nTuralyon, along with Alleria and other Alliance leaders, was present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nA version of Turalyon appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Within the vision, Alleria has fallen to the madness of the void and is orchestrating the downfall of Stormwind from the Cathedral of Light. There, Turalyon was killed by Alleria as the former attempted to reason with her, dying just as &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s entered into the vision, begging them to save his son. The adventurers are ultimately unsuccessful, as Alleria consumed Arator into a portal of the void before engaging the adventurers and being ultimately defeated.\nAfter the downfall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon was present at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt; meeting where he learned that the armistice ending the Fourth War between the Horde and Alliance was signed. Later at the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, he found Alleria reflecting about a \"&lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;simpler time&lt;/a&gt;\". They both discussed recent events, with Alleria expressing her sorrow at failing to have both sisters at her side when fighting the war and revealing that the downfall of the Old God has not brought her peace. Turalyon reassured Alleria that his faith in her had not changed, to which Alleria reciprocated.\nShadows Rising.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon attended a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Anduin\"&gt;Kings Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; in the crypts of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, in which the corpses of retrieved of members suggested that &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s were on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. This knowledge caused Turalyon to wonder if Sylvanas sought vengeance on &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; for pulling her support to the Banshee Queen, while Genn believed that Talanji was still working with Sylvanas and was providing her shelter on the island. Anduin then declared Turalyon as the Lord Commander of the Alliance forces, with the task of finding &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and to use whatever means he must. For this task, he enlisted the aid of his love, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring their hunt &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; informed his friends that a &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; had been seen among a group of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s within the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Upon securing the refugees, they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Zun\"&gt;Zun&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"child\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;. Turalyon humorously subdued him, and the pair fully agreed to spare him when &lt;a href=\"Gowzis\"&gt;Gowzis&lt;/a&gt; begged for her son's life.\nAs they looked over the refugees, they discovered that their target wasn't among them, however, with the powers of the Void, Alleria sensed that Gowzis had the information they sought. Initially, Turalyon tried softly interrogating the orc but when that failed, the pair reluctantly decided that they needed the information whatever the cost. Thus, Alleria tortured Gowzis with the Void causing an outraged &lt;a href=\"apothecary\"&gt;apothecary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cotley\"&gt;Cotley&lt;/a&gt; to command her to stop and revealed that &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;Visrynn&lt;/a&gt; had demanded a vow of silence from them and had let slip that she intended to go to the &lt;a href=\"Faldir%27s%20Cove\"&gt;Faldir's Cove&lt;/a&gt; in order to acquire a boat. In response, Alleria ceased her attack and ordered &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Celosel%20Nightgiver\"&gt;Celosel Nightgiver&lt;/a&gt; to give the refugees food, blankets, and what they could spare. She then ordered for Nightgiver to send &lt;a href=\"Cotley\"&gt;Cotley&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, under the belief that he may know more and how they couldn't afford to miss a single detail in their hunt for.\nWith their new knowledge, Alleria and Turalyon headed towards Faldir's Cove, where they discovered a man with a dagger that would be more fitting in a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; scabbard. When the smuggler refused to answer their questions, Turalyon shackled him with the Light, while Alleria invaded his mind with the Void. During this interrogation, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrived, having been sent by Anduin to check on the pair for an update. Jaina was horrified by their harsh tactics and when Turalyon justified their actions by mentioning that the man had sheltered &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;an agent&lt;/a&gt; of Sylvanas, Jaina demanded to know how he had known to which the paladin revealed the Forsaken dagger, and Alleria explained that her interrogation revealed that the &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; was heading towards &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina then left to inform Anduin of everything, which Alleria partly saw as tattling.\nSometime later Turalyon and Alleria were hosted by Jaina in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, as they had come at Anduin's request should &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; discover nothing on the Zandalari coast. They were soon interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, who reported that Shaw had been taken prisoner by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas Turalyon was prepared to sound the call for war, Jaina called out for them not to risk the treaty. Turalyon relented and asked what should they do next. Jaina then stated she would use the treaty itself before turning to the blade.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt;'s abduction by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon was appointed as regent and protector of Stormwind with the support of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. The nobles were keen on restoring Stormwind's defenses in the wake of the Fourth War, and Turalyon mused that reclaiming &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; had been a \"good first step\" and that there could be other holdings of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;old Alliance&lt;/a&gt; that could be secured. During the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge's resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces in Stormwind sent field reports to Lord Commander Turalyon and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, a freed Anduin told Genn that he couldn't return to Azeroth yet and that he trusted Turalyon to keep the Alliance safe in his absence.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Turalyon and his family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception, he talked with &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; expressed surprise at how relaxed Turalyon seemed in the heart of Horde territory.\nDragonflight.\nDuring his five years as regent of Stormwind, Turalyon became quite popular among &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;nobles&lt;/a&gt; and soldiers of the Alliance, even though he doesn't particularly enjoy \"getting into politics\". He was also able to rekindle his romance with Alleria.\nWith the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon met with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Scalecommander Azurathel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20%28Stormwind%20Keep%29\"&gt;Royal Garden&lt;/a&gt;, where Wrathion briefed him on recent events, and extended the Aspects' invitation to the isles. Recalling how the Aspects made great sacrifices to save Azeroth during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon declared that the Alliance will answer the call and stand together with &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragonkind&lt;/a&gt; once again. He gave Wrathion his word that this will be an expedition, not a \"military maneuver\", and thus instructed the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; to work in concert with the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; to honor a truce with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Azurathel then stated the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt;' intention to accompany the Alliance on their journey to the isles, while reflecting that it would take time to build trust between them. Turalyon admitted that as a fellow soldier, he perfectly understood his wariness.\nLater at the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; was preparing to depart, Turalyon discussed with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; about the return of the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Although he had faith in &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s intentions, he expressed distrust of the other dragons, citing the 's report of the damage done to the kingdom by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; years ago. In order to protect the Alliance and their past years efforts to recreate its strength and prevent a repeat situation like Onyxia's, he ordered the Spymaster to enlist the expertise of the Stormwind mages to create a foolproof method to see through the \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%23Shapeshifting\"&gt;visage&lt;/a&gt;\" that the dragons wear among mortals.\nPersonality.\nTuralyon is a kind and gentle soul who only wishes the world to be at peace. His innocence and understanding personality allow him to see through people for who they truly are. An example would be his friendship with Khadgar, as wizards were often discriminated against by holy orders. He has no special hatred for his enemies either and it pained him to see those he was fond of so revenge-ridden during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Turalyon is also capable of mercy: he refused to kill Doomhammer even when the warchief killed Lothar whom Turalyon admired very much. However, when innocent lives were threatened Turalyon's passive nature changed to that of a determined avenger willing to do what was necessary, setting aside his own well being, and putting the lives of the endangered as the top priority. It was these traits that drew Alleria Windrunner to fall in love with him. The elf and the human were from different worlds, but they had been brought together in a way that only war could do. According to Khadgar, Alleria's age and wisdom strengthened Turalyon's spirit, and his youth and innocence softened the somewhat jaded elf.\nAlthough Turalyon is a firm believer that order can be maintained only through extreme martial discipline, he is honored by his friends and foes alike. Even though he proves to be a quite capable warrior of the Light, there are moments of internal reflection that reveal Turalyon is constantly struggling with doubt since becoming a paladin. Turalyon secretly harbors a deep regret of his inability to save &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. The death of his mentor pressed down like an iron fist on his heart. The temptation to withdraw into himself after the horrors of the Second War was strong, but Turalyon could not abandon people in need. While the veterans of the Second War had begun calling themselves the Sons of Lothar, Turalyon himself was not comfortable with the term. He did not feel like a son of the great man, although he would defend Lothar's ideals to his last breath.\nAs a priest and then one of the first five human paladins, Turalyon has strong faith and devotion in the Light. Despite this, Turalyon never veered toward fanaticism. During the Second War, Khadgar noted Turalyon to be one of the more open-minded and pragmatic members of the Church of the Holy Light (though Turalyon did resolve a brief crisis of faith by figuring the Orcs were not from Azeroth and thus not part of the Light). During his time among the Army of the Light and after being Lightforged by Xe'ra herself, Turalyon opposed the Void initially, but was willing to trust Alleria even to the point of disagreeing with Xe'ra's absolute opposition to Void use. Though Turalyon still held the Prime Naaru in high regard, to the point of trying to avenge Xe'ra alone after Illidan slew her. During the Blood War, Turalyon accepted Alonsus Faol despite his undead state. Though he retained his faith, Turalyon told Anduin during this meeting to \"let the Light guide (them), but not command (them)\", stating they still had hearts and minds of their own that should be used. He also never expressed anything but dismissal for the Scarlet Crusade and their offshoots (who likely oppose him in turn due to Turalyon's ties, especially to Alleria, Arator, Alonsus, Genn and Velen in particular).\nCombat.\nAlthough he was initially a priest, Turalyon is a skilled and fearsome warrior and can fight as well as any knight. Like Lothar, he was usually seen leading contingents of knights, smashing aside foes with his warhammer and his aura, spreading encouragement to his own troops and fear into the hearts of his enemies. His determination and faith gave him enough strength to fight dozens of much larger orcs. A skilled tactician, Turalyon is known for his tactics of surprising enemy forces with fearsome charges of knights and foot soldiers while supporting them with arrow and magic.\nQuotes.\nSecond War.\n\"For Turalyon's Warcraft II quotes, see &lt;a href=\"Quotes%20of%20Warcraft%20II%23Turalyon\"&gt;Quotes of Warcraft II#Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWorld of Warcraft.\nStormwind Embassy.\nMuch about Azeroth has changed in the years I was absent.

Although Turalyon is a firm believer that order can be maintained only through extreme martial discipline, he is honored by his friends and foes alike. Turalyon was among the forces that &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lord Lothar&lt;/a&gt; led into &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and secretly harbors a deep regret of his inability to save the great Knight.\nSpells.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;spirit of mankind&lt;/a&gt; is everywhere, so the Holy Vision of the Paladin extends to all corners of the land. The area unveiled by this incantation grants the Paladin knowledge of the terrain and of all those who may dwell there. When this spell dims, the Paladin maintains knowledge of the lands he has seen, although he loses sight of the denizens in these lands.\nAiding our brethren in times of pain and illness remains the fundamental concern of any within the holy &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;. By focusing his spiritual powers, the Paladin can heal those who have been wounded in battle. While only one being at a time may be healed in this fashion, it serves to replenish the strength and courage of all who strive for victory against the unfeeling &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCalling upon the forces of &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; and purity, the Paladin is able to dispel the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;walking dead&lt;/a&gt; that plague the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Exorcism can be used to cause injury to entire groups of these &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; terrors, or to utterly eradicate a lone creature. These creatures of Hades seem to gain strength in numbers, thus the greater number of undead that are exorcised within a group, the less actual damage each undead will take. This act is extremely taxing upon the Paladin, making it necessary for him to observe a period of rest before once again invoking this great power."}

{"id": "60826", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=60826", "title": "Broggok", "text": "Broggok is the second boss in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt; wing of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen first approached, Broggok floats through the air on the far side of a gate with a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; in front of it. The encounter starts when the lever is pulled, releasing four increasingly difficult waves of elite &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Once each wave is defeated (or approximately two minutes has passed since the last wave was released) the next wave will come immediately. Once the fourth wave is defeated, the gate will open and Broggok will come immediately.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Some creatures occasionally have second thoughts about their allegiance to their new, corrupt masters. Broggok ensures that any subversive notions among the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s are permanently eradicated.\"\nAbilities.\nImprisoned Orcs.\nActivating the Cell Door Level opens the 4 Orc prison cells in succession.\nStrategy.\nWaves of Orcs.\nThe Broggok encounter is fairly difficult and heavily reliant on crowd control to survive the four waves of fel orcs that come before Broggok himself. Most players thus far have found it helpful to have &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warlocks\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt; use AoE Fear abilities or AoE snares like the hunter's Frost Trap or shaman's Earthbind Totem as each wave emerges, to give the group a little more time to prepare.\nThere are 4 waves of orcs and they come from each of the four cages on the sides of the room. The cages always open in a specific order, which follows the shape of a \"Z\". If you're standing at the lever facing the boss in the next room, the first cage that opens is directly to your left. The second is directly to your right. The third is to your left and in the back, and the last cage is to your right and in the back.\nTo start the fight have the tank stand next to the first cage, and have someone else pull the lever. When the cage opens, the tank should then use any AoE abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt; (paladin), &lt;a href=\"Swipe\"&gt;Swipe&lt;/a&gt; (bear druid), &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt; (warriors) or &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay%20%28death%20knight%20ability%29\"&gt;Death and Decay&lt;/a&gt; (death knights).\nEach successive cage opens immediately when the last orc from the prior cage dies. To ensure that the tank is the one that will be hit first by each wave, the tank always needs to be standing in front of the next cage door when the last orc in a wave dies, so that the tank is ready to face the next wave. From a tanking perspective, moving the mob to the next door prior to it dying easily makes this part of the encounter much easier. \nAssign one person in the party as a &lt;a href=\"main%20assist\"&gt;main assist&lt;/a&gt;, so that everyone is attacking the same target to make it easier for the tank to hold aggro, since it can be difficult to quickly mark mobs for a kill/CC order. Then use any CC abilities on the other orcs, as necessary, such as &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;, etc, in order to help the tank with aggro-management and to decrease damage to the tank.\nYou never leave combat between each wave of mobs so there is no time to stop and drink. The non-stop combat puts a heavy strain on mana so it is best to use potions early and have mana regenerating consumables for the encounter, and if there's time near the end of a wave use bandages to conserve the healer's mana.\nIf possible keep the last orc from each wave CC'd for awhile to give the healers time to regenerate mana and get everyone back to full health. This is especially useful on the last wave since that's when the boss enters the room.\nBroggok.\nOnce the orcs are dead, Broggok himself will enter the room. He drops rings of poison on the ground directly beneath him that will slowly expand outward: the tank and any melee dps will need to move to avoid taking damage from these rings. He also has an AoE poison bolt with a DoT component that will need to be dispelled, if possible. \nBeware: The poison rings also persist for a time after his death and can still kill party members at that point, so watch where you're standing even after the fight is over. There's usually a ring that is under is body when he dies, as well, so be careful looting him.\nHeroic.\nThe boss itself is very similar to normal mode, and the waves of mobs prior to this boss are still a test of endurance. You will need very high sustained DPS and/or multiple forms of crowd control to get through this. \nIn heroic mode each wave and the boss are on a timer to come out (~ 2 min?). The waves before the boss, all elite, are also much harder. On the 3rd and 4th waves, there are 4 mobs in each group. \nThe strategy for the waves are otherwise just like that for non-heroic, except: in all but the first group, there will be a &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Orc%20Neophyte\"&gt;Fel Orc Neophyte&lt;/a&gt; who is immune to crowd control, but can be snared or feared. He should be tanked and die first, if possible.\nJust like on non-heroic, make sure that the tank is standing next to each cage door before it opens, so that the tank gets the initial aggro from the wave. From a tanking perspective, moving the mob to the next door prior to it dying easily makes this piece of the dungeon much easier. \nThe door order (when facing Broggok) front left, front right, back left, back right.\nAfter defeating the waves of prisoners, Broggok himself is a relatively easy fight.\nBugs.\nHelpful hint \u2013 Broggok does not seem to be on a timer. He will only come out once the last wave of orcs is dead. If you have a mage, sheep one orc on the last wave and continue to resheep while the healer regains mana and everyone else bandages. However, the mobs are on a timer, and if you take too long - approximately 5 minutes - the next wave of orcs will spawn on you."}

{"id": "33626", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=33626", "title": "Broken", "text": "The Broken (also known as Broken Ones and Krokul or krokul in &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt;) are a devolved sub-race of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; who live in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, mutated after being exposed to the &lt;a href=\"red%20mist\"&gt;fel energies&lt;/a&gt; wielded by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. Many tribes have joined or become enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; reopened, several of them tried to get to it and escape Outland.\nAnother tribe of Broken, called by their draenei name Krokul to differentiate them, are found on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. These Krokul have been hiding on Argus since the draenei flight from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. They look slightly different than Outland's Broken, having upright bodies and hooves, likely because they were mutated by Argus's fel energies instead of the red mist. But it might just be an updated and more logical model for all Broken.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nYears ago, the draenei narrowly survived a horrific &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide by the orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Blinded by rage, the Horde slaughtered most of the draenei race and forced the survivors into hiding. After being exposed to the &lt;a href=\"red%20mist\"&gt;fel energies&lt;/a&gt; wielded by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, many draenei were mutated into physically deteriorated forms known as the Krokul, or the \"Broken\". Years later, the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; opened magical portals throughout &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and the resulted energies shattered the dying world.\nAlthough the Broken in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; (the shattered remnants of Draenor) were thought by many to have been completely wiped out by the orcs' genocide and the world's cataclysm, some survived and have formed various tribes. However, many still fought for survival from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, who had claimed Outland with the aid of their &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;his forces&lt;/a&gt; discovered a surviving Broken village in Outland during their flight from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The village's inhabitants, ruled by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, swore allegiance to Illidan in return for him liberating them from orcish and demonic oppression. Having been corrupted by demonic influences, they lost some of their former draenei abilities, and their already Broken forms were further altered, causing them to become the sub-species known as the Broken draenei.\nIn \"The Burning Crusade\", the term \"Broken\" is used mainly as a racial name, though sometimes it is used to refer to the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Ashtongue Deathsworn&lt;/a&gt;. This faction, led by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Elder%20Sage\"&gt;elder sage&lt;/a&gt;, contains most of the Broken draenei in Outland. They are allied with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and with his &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nBroken draenei are often rejected from draenei society due to their deformities, and inability to use the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, leading them to eke out miserable existences in Outland's wastes. It is not uncommon for Broken living in Shattrath to throw themselves off elevators, committing suicide as the draenei guards simply watch.\nIt is unknown how many Broken draenei are in Outland, though there are several groups not serving Akama. &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; is a notable Broken draenei shaman, though he is not a follower of Akama. A number of Broken draenei serve as laborers in a crystal mine beneath the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", and appear to be loyal to &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. It was speculated that this was evidence of prejudice on the part of the uncorrupted draenei, but this could be a case of physical tolerance.\nWhile they are referred to as \"Broken\", even by themselves, many, including Akama himself, still consider themselves draenei. Some are trying to find a cure to return them to their original forms.\nEven further below on the social scales are &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Draenei Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt;, who even many broken shun.\n\"In Warcraft III, Akama's tribe possessed the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; physical appearance. As Lost Ones, they were renowned for being unbeatable spies and assassins, as their warriors can &lt;a href=\"shadowmeld\"&gt;shadowmeld&lt;/a&gt; regardless of the time of day and even while moving. This was before the retcon to the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; history and the introduction of the Broken. Akama's new appearance is primarily that of a Broken draenei, although he possesses the characteristic mouth of the Lost Ones.\"\nNobundo, a Broken draenei shaman.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/classcombo.html\"&gt;Velen's Vision&lt;/a&gt;\nIn recent years, Velen, the noble leader of the draenei, was granted a vision...in it he saw the Broken; formerly healthy draenei who had devolved during the orcs' murderous crusade to wipe out the draenei race. According to Velen's vision, the Broken would rise to power once again and aid their displaced brethren.\nVelen's vision was given substance in the form of Nobundo, a one-time draenei &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt; who had devolved while the orcs decimated his race and tore the planet apart. Like his fellow Broken, Nobundo had lost contact with the Light, and so he ventured far into the deserts of Outland to meditate and pray for guidance.\nAfter decades of silence, an unfamiliar voice finally answered his prayers. It was not the Light that whispered to him, but the wind. The breeze spoke to him of lost truths, of the might of the elements \u2013 of the delicate balance of power embraced by the shaman.\nNobundo listened eagerly and learned all he could. When he judged the time was right, he departed the desert determined to use this knowledge to help the draenei race. However, most draenei refugees greeted the sight of a Broken with skepticism and outright prejudice. Only one of the healthy draenei did not shun the Broken: the wise and perceptive Velen.\nVelen had heard the philosophy of the shaman before, but Nobundo revealed new truths. The elements were timeless; they stretched across the cosmos to inhabit every world they touched. With the proper training, the draenei might learn to wield this overlooked, seemingly inexhaustible source of power.\nVelen rejoiced to realize that his vision was coming to pass. Accordingly he took Nobundo with him when he and his fellow refugees took possession of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; satellite structure &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. Thus it was that Nobundo journeyed with the draenei to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nNobundo found that unlike the desolate wastes of Outland, Azeroth possessed abundant elemental energies. He shared his knowledge of shamanism with the draenei on Azeroth, and all who adopted its path flourished.\nThe time for the draenei shaman to test themselves draws near, for the battle against the Burning Legion is once again at hand. And the fate not only of Azeroth, but of all worlds, hangs in the balance.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invaded Outland&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; sought to reconnect with and redeem their Broken kin. Some of these Broken they reached out to included the &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Feralfen%20tribe\"&gt;Feralfen&lt;/a&gt; Lost Ones in the &lt;a href=\"Boha%27mu%20Ruins\"&gt;Boha'mu Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. While the Feralfen refused to re-assimilate with draenei society, the Kurenai were more receptive to reconciliation.\nThe Alliance would later solidify diplomatic relations with the Kurenai in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; after helping them secure their home of &lt;a href=\"Telaar\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt; from various threats. However, the Kurenai and the draenei didn't always see eye to eye, particularly on the issue of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s. While the Kurenai were content to help the Lost Ones who sought them out, they didn't pursue them and those who went too far were immediately put down. Some of the draenei, on the other hand, were intent on 'redeeming' them all. The Kurenai appear to be fierce enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfen%20tribe\"&gt;Daggerfen tribe&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 whose use of poisons and deceit they found distasteful \u2014 and later on the &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20tribe\"&gt;Murkblood tribe&lt;/a&gt; for their role in harming their ecosystem and creating hostile relations with the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;. The Kurenai were also not fond of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' role in the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt; people.\nMany of the other Broken tribes appear to have been conquered or sold into slavery by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. This appears to be the case for the &lt;a href=\"Wrekt\"&gt;Wrekt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wastewalker%20tribe\"&gt;Wastewalker tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dreghood%20tribe\"&gt;Dreghood tribe&lt;/a&gt;, although some Broken were enticed to betray their Broken kin in exchange for promises of power.\nCataclysm.\nSometime after the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broken%20exiles\"&gt;Broken exiles&lt;/a&gt; crossed the portal into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and made a home for themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. They settled in the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt;, and sometime during that time, &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Avuun\"&gt;Anchorite Avuun&lt;/a&gt; came to live with them and study their transformation. Avuun worked for years to try to cure the affliction of the Broken. The foul energies that corrupted them did more than twist their bodies - it took the comfort of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; from them so they cannot feel its warmth. Avuun was also eager to help &lt;a href=\"Magtoor\"&gt;Magtoor&lt;/a&gt; who grew ill and weaker every second. Avuun desperately sought a remedy to cure Magtoor but despaired when his remedy failed. As Magtoor began to pass away, Avuun pondered why the Light forsook the innocent. A portal from the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; opened and &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; stepped through. Velen explained that the Light wishes suffering on none, but it does not reign unopposed in their realm. As Magtoor had embraced his plight bravely he was ready to return to the embrace of the Light. In his final moments, Velen performed an unction on Magtoor as he passed away.\nThe Broken of the Harborage were also harassed by the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fallow%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Fallow Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; despite being their former brethren. The rigors of the difficult journey made these former Broken exiles violent, full of hatred, and furthered their corruption. They became enemies of the Harborage when they began to kidnap their former brothers.\nLegion.\nDuring the joint attack on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes of Azeroth came across Krokul led by &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Hatuun\"&gt;Chieftain Hatuun&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Reach\"&gt;Argussian Reach&lt;/a&gt;. They had lived on Argus all this time, having sought escape but finding themselves trapped in a nightmare. They changed and endured without choice, hidden underground in hovels they moved to and from every time the Legion discovered them, and resent the draenei who fled for abandoning them. When the Army of the Light's flagship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\", fell, they brought &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to safety in their current home, the &lt;a href=\"Krokul%20Hovel\"&gt;Krokul Hovel&lt;/a&gt;. They seem inclined to &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; magic and have a &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Stone\"&gt;Sacred Stone&lt;/a&gt; within Krokul Hovel from which they hear the faint whispers of &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of their planet. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; uses the Krokul both as a labor force and tortures them for fun. Their mount of choice is the &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of two fates await Krokul prisoners taken to Nath'raxas Hold. Consume the fel, and become a willing soldier of the Infinite Army, or be mutated into a disfigured abomination, an &lt;a href=\"ur%27zul\"&gt;ur'zul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Krokul in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; have been mutated by &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energies by the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard\"&gt;Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRacial hatred?\nDespite the (in most cases) accidental regression into Broken draenei, many draenei not only distrust them but despise them. Although understandable of those Broken draenei who remain corrupted or in service to the Legion, one would think that the draenei would be willing to welcome any of their people that survived the orcs' genocide. Talking with Nobundo, however, reveals a possible reason for this distrust and hatred. Broken draenei are unable to draw upon the Light's powers, being infused with fel energies. The draenei, being deeply religious, could view this in a very negative context. For some &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic teachings of the Broken were even considered as &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;al.\nHowever, some draenei such as Velen, work to reintegrate Broken into draenei society. The fact there are so many Broken draenei working in and on the Exodar is a testament to Velen's unending compassion for his people. Yet sometimes even in societies such as Shattrath, the social rejection from other draenei can turn Broken suicidal, while uncorrupted draenei guards watch, presumably viewing an ended life as better than a Broken life.\nStill despite this rejection, Broken are in general accepted more than the Lost One draenei.\nNotes and trivia.\nFemale Broken draenei.\nThough female Broken draenei are confirmed in lore, \"World of Warcraft\" does not currently have any female Broken draenei model in-game. However, an unfinished model of a female Broken draenei (half of a female tauren without a head) has been found within the game files. It is un-textured as of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1\"&gt;patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt;. It's possible that the female draenei of the Kurenai are meant to be Broken, but use the draenei model for lack of the alternative (similar to the female taunka who use a standard tauren model).\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wing\"&gt;Shadow Wing&lt;/a&gt;\", a female Broken is visible in the crowd. She simply looks like a female draenei with Broken facial features.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, female Broken have appeared on numerous occasions.\nSpeculation.\nTheir audio dialogue in \"\" seems to suggest that the Broken (as well as some Lost Ones, who use the same voices) are slowly losing their memory, even their sanity. They speak in a slow, clumsy manner with irregular pauses. However, they appear to be struggling against this change."}

Using the &lt;a href=\"Sign%20of%20the%20Earth\"&gt;Sign of the Earth&lt;/a&gt;, you will be able to remove the runestones and unlock the Seal of the Earth.\nBe wary though, &lt;name&gt;, the black drakes &lt;a href=\"Blacklash\"&gt;Blacklash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hematus\"&gt;Hematus&lt;/a&gt; are not to be trifled with.

The Pillar of Amethyst and Pillar of Opal are at the southern end at 81,64 and 72,66 respectively.\nThe dragons spawn essentially on top of the Seal of the Earth. If they are killed within the Pillar's clickable radius, you may be unable to loot the bodies of Blacklash and Hematus after they are dead due to \"interference\" from the Pillar.

The operation was planned in secrecy, and would likely have succeeded but for a chance encounter with a Horde recon patrol.\nOn spotting the Alliance forces, the Horde patrol took cover. Once the Alliance offensive was fully engaged with the Scourge, the patrol attacked from behind. While the patrol was considerably weaker than the Alliance forces, the surprise of the attack was enough to break up the Alliance formation, inflicting grievous losses.\n&lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces arrived late to the battle after all three sides had mutually annihilated each other. They were able to retrieve a few members of both the Alliance and Horde forces back to &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Keep\"&gt;Justice Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but the majority of the gravely wounded remained where they fell. In the end, the Scourge still remained in control of the gate.\nThe actions of the Horde's forces did not go \"unrewarded\", however. When \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\"'s captain, &lt;a href=\"Sky-Reaver%20Korm%20Blackscar\"&gt;Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar&lt;/a&gt;, sent in a report to &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; in support and praising the patrols' actions, he didn't know that none other than Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; would be there to read the report and voices his disgust at the cowardly actions of the patrol's \"selfless bravery\" and \"courage\". Overlord &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; apparently agreed, and had Blackscar immediately report to the hold to reprimand him.\nIn front of Thrall, Garrosh tells Blackscar that there is no combat but honorable combat, and that he will not have cowards among his ranks. When Blackscar offers his resignation, Garrosh instead orders him to return to \"Orgrim's Hammer\" and lead his forces in a manner worthy of the Horde. If he doesn't, the only thing Garrosh will ask for is Blackscar's head on a pike."}

Littered with ancient &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;elven ruins&lt;/a&gt;, they contain notably the mighty &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; as well as the long-lost &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; commenced when the sealed portal inside the Tomb was opened again by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Gul'dan from the alternate universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the region that would become the Broken Isles was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was here that the ancient forest of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, home of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, and birthplace of &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt; and its first mortal druid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, was located, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;city of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; was born. Tyrande, Malfurion and his brother &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; also grew up there, along with &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Captain of Suramar's Guard, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, a high-ranking priestess of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, also centered in Suramar.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; night elves of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, used the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to seal a gateway the Legion prepared to open in an attempt to overwhelm the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; on two fronts, but with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; (which they used to create the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;) apparently scattered most of them throughout the other regions of the Broken Isles, just before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sundering blasted a part of Suramar underwater, though the majority of the city was saved by the future &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; thanks to a magical shield that shielded the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, came to the island of &lt;a href=\"Thal%27dranath\"&gt;Thal'dranath&lt;/a&gt; seeking a safe place to entomb the corpse of the &lt;a href=\"avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;avatar of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, knowing it still held power. She thus placed his body in a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; facility underneath the sunken &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, which would eventually become known as the Tomb of Sargeras.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and led his &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; followers to the Broken Isles, seeking the power of the Tomb for himself. Using his experience raising the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan volcano&lt;/a&gt; from the ground of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; led his men in raising Thal'dranath from the bottom of the sea.\nAs he opened the Tomb, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was torn to shreds by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Guardians\"&gt;inside&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; loyalists of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;s then finished Gul'dan's troops, though the Hammer and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; managed to survive and escape.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; chased escaped prisoner &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to the Isles, who searched for the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. She discovered the remains of the ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; city of Suramar, as well as a never-ending battle between the undead remnants of the Twilight's Hammer, Blackrock, and Stormreaver clans. Maiev pursued Illidan into the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, but Illidan found the Eye first and used it to collapse &lt;a href=\"Collapse\"&gt;a section of the tomb&lt;/a&gt; onto Maiev's forces. Maiev sent a runner to return to Kalimdor and get help from Malfurion Stormrage, who rescued her forces and pursued Illidan.\nLegion.\nThe Broken Isles are a new continent introduced in \"\" and are the main setting of the expansion. The Tomb of Sargeras has been reopened and demons have began to pour into the isles.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Broken Isles include about four large (relatively speaking) islands and about three small islands. They were underwater until a scant few decades ago, when the orc warlock Gul'dan raised them from the ocean floor. Gul'dan was searching for the tomb of the fallen Titan Sargeras, and indeed he found it: The ancient Kaldorei structure stands on the largest isle. Other Kaldorei ruins, remnants of their culture from 10,000 years ago, stand on the other islands. For having been underwater for the better part of ten millennia, they look pretty good.\nThe Broken Isles are an unpleasant and dangerous place. The &lt;a href=\"Death%20Hiss%20tribe\"&gt;Death Hiss tribe&lt;/a&gt; of naga dominates the region, led by &lt;a href=\"Harash\"&gt;Tide Priest Harash&lt;/a&gt;. Other threats are abundant as well: giant turtles, hydras, wendigo and a host of other dangers occupy the areas the naga are not. Also, a few goblin merchants have managed to carve out some spaces for themselves with the help of hired mercenaries.\nThe Maelstrom is just northwest of the Broken Isles. It's close. It's too close. The Maelstrom's magical storms lash the Broken Isles, making for near constant winds and rainfall and, occasionally, something stranger. The Maelstrom's proximity makes the Broken Isles unstable. Soon, the storm will prove too much and the islands will sink back into the sea.\nHistory.\nFive hundred years ago, Magna Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal, slew the demon Sargeras, though just his physical form as his spirit inhabited her body and later possessed her child, Medivh. Knowing that the demon-Titan's corpse still had power, she sought a safe place to entomb it. She discovered a Kaldorei ruin deep beneath the sea, near the Maelstrom, and placed the body within, believing it to be secure. Time proved her incorrect.\nCenturies later, Medivh, possessed by Sargeras, convinced the orc shaman Gul'dan to lead his people through the Dark Portal to wage war on Azeroth. Medivh\u2013Sargeras offered Gul'dan a powerful artifact called the Eye of Sargeras as incentive. Gul'dan grew impatient, though, and through magic and research divined the location of the Tomb of Sargeras. He raised the Broken Isles and entered the tomb.\nGul'dan encountered many trials within the tomb. He kept a record of his experiences \u2014 a sort of diary \u2014 by painting Orcish runes onto the tomb's walls. Orc forces loyal to Doomhammer attacked Gul'dan's Stormreavers, and the shaman desperately sought the Eye. In the end, he failed, and the tomb's demonic guardians tore him asunder.\nMany years later, some time after the Third War, Illidan Stormrage, the Betrayer, traveled to the Tomb of Sargeras. Like Gul'dan, he too sought the Eye of Sargeras, supposedly intending to use it in a ritual to destabilize and destroy the Frozen Throne. The night elf warden Maiev Shadowsong tracked Illidan to the tomb. While there, she crossed paths with Drak'thul, and the warlock convinced her to help put some of the undead orcs to rest. She did so, though after she discovered that Drak'thul was part of Gul'dan's original coven and partly responsible for raising the Broken Isles and thus bringing dangerous artifacts like the Eye of Sargeras back into the world. She regretted her decision. Also within the tomb, Maiev discovered pieces of an artifact called the Orb of Shadow, and when she collected the entirety of the object it gave her great power. Maiev and her forces confronted Illidan deep within the tomb and interrupted his ritual. Illidan used the Eye to flood the tomb and escaped. Out of all the night elves, only Maiev had the power to escape death, and the loss of her forces embittered her. Since that time, naga and murlocs have emerged to claim the Broken Isles, and undead orcs continue to fight the Second War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;'s proximity \ufb01nally proved too much for the Broken Isles, and they began to sink back into the sea. Before they did, however, several factions \u2014 including &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 wanted to save the library of &lt;a href=\"Izal-Shurah\"&gt;Izal-Shurah&lt;/a&gt;. They sent expeditions to treat with (or destroy) the library's &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt; defenders. Complicating things were the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, who were out in force, believing that the sinking of the isles was a time for celebration and a good omen for their culture. Moreover, the few &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; survivors from the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and several roving bands of mercenaries attempted to storm the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s ships in a desperate attempt to save themselves.\nPeople and culture.\nPeople aren't particularly prevalent in the Broken Isles, but cultures certainly are. The dominant force is the Death Hiss naga tribe. They have several bases throughout the region, and their forces are strong. Naga myrmidons, sirens and royal guard are out in force, posing a threat to all sensible races. The terrain favors the naga as well; if you're forced to flee the creatures, you can run only to the shore, and then they've got you. The naga live in Kaldorei ruins and have constructed some of their own buildings as well. The architecture is frighteningly similar. The Death Hiss naga have a distinctive warcry: the hiss, from which they take their name, which sounds like rain striking the ocean.\nThe Lostfin tribe of murlocs is also strong in the Broken Isles. They, a few other murloc tribes, and some &lt;a href=\"mur%27gul\"&gt;mur'gul&lt;/a&gt; tribes live in stilted huts on the shores. You can also run across sea giants and makrura. These two races aren't quite as bad as the others. Constant fighting against the naga, murlocs and other threats can do poor things to anyone's disposition, and makrura tend to attack intruders on sight.\nA few enterprising goblins manage to set themselves up on the islands as well, hiring out boats to make travel among the islands easier. They cater solely to adventurers. They brought mercenaries with them, to carve out locations for their shops and to protect them, and now the mercenaries hire themselves out to adventurers as well. The mercenaries myself seem to focus their efforts against the naga and murlocs and other native creatures.\nOne other culture exists on these islands: orcs. These aren't orcs from Thrall's Horde, either, and many of them aren't even alive. During Gul'dan's betrayal, forces from the Blackrock, Twilight's Hammer, and Stormreaver clans clashed on the newly-summoned Broken Isles. The demons that guarded Sargeras's Tomb slaughtered the survivors, and now these skeletal and ghostly orc warriors battle each other for eternity. A few orcs, however, are not dead. These are mostly leftover warlocks from Gul'dan's clan, the Stormreavers, who were canny or lucky enough to escape destruction. They are scattered across the islands and have been living as hermits, probably eating crabs ever since the Second War. It is possible that a few more warlocks used to abide here, but they were voted off the islands. The oldest and sanest of these Stormreavers is a warlock named Drak'thul.\nGeography.\nRain-lashed islands with ancient ruins and palm trees. That pretty much sums up the Broken Isles. The four large islands are arranged in a bit of a circle, with one large island at each point on the compass. All sorts of nasty beasts live here.\nSince the islands haven't been islands for very long, natural life hasn't had much a chance to get a foothold here, but palm trees, tropical fronds, and a few flowering plants push through the ruins. Coral is prevalent, and there are at least a dozen albatrosses. The coasts boast hermit crabs and colorful fish. Purple, black and orange urchins inhabit tide pools and the shores around the coral reefs.\nStormreaver Bay is natural bay between the southwestern islands which boasts a bit of history. Gul'dan anchored his ships here when he was exploring the isles. The ships are long smashed, but their remains still drift in the aptly-named Stormreaver Bay. The Broken Isles are being pulled toward the Maelstrom, and they will likely be destroyed at some point by the magical forces of the storm.\nSpeculation.\nLocation discrepancy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"northern%20islands\"&gt;northern islands&lt;/a&gt; may have been meant to represent the Broken Isles, but were seemingly too far north at the time. In \"\", the Broken Isles are located close to where the northern islands were on the Vanilla map, indicating that they may be in fact the same. However, the northern islands and the island that the RPG called the Broken Isles have been seemingly on the map at the same time since \"Warcraft III\".\nContact with Kalimdor.\nExactly how much contact the night elves of Kalimdor retained with the people of the Broken Isles since the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; remains unclear, although some of the kaldorei would have limited contact with the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, who cooperated with &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt; two or three thousand years ago. &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; also planted three &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;s in Northrend and the Eastern Kingdoms in ancient times, indicating that some night elves did go to the other continents. \"\" is also vague regarding the kaldorei's involvement in affairs beyond Kalimdor, only mentioning that Tyrande and her night elves were \"partially\" aware of events happening in the Eastern Kingdoms, but only rarely and very subtly intervening; it is possible that the Kalimdor night elves were indeed vaguely aware of the Broken Isles and its surviving groups, but nevertheless focused most of their efforts on protecting &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, their greatest and most sacred responsibility. Some night elf hunters left &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; after the Sundering and returned to &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, where they would form the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, although their numbers would gradually dwindle over the millennia, and some of these hunters, including the Path's founder &lt;a href=\"Namuria%20Gladesong\"&gt;Namuria Gladesong&lt;/a&gt;, would return to Kalimdor to fight in conflicts such as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; mentioned it was ten millennia since she last stepped foot in the land of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; since the War of the Ancients, and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; notes that he has not stepped foot in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; in \"an age\", mentioning that though the forest has aged, its spirits still remember him. Elders from &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; \"regularly\" sent their most promising disciples to &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%20Glaidalis\"&gt;Archdruid Glaidalis&lt;/a&gt;, implied to be a native to &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, for instruction, implying some older link between the &lt;a href=\"Dreamweavers\"&gt;Dreamweavers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, especially as there were very few kaldorei druids by the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Hamuul mentions &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; training druids in Val'sharah after the Sundering, and &lt;a href=\"Nyandra%20Springbloom\"&gt;Nyandra Springbloom&lt;/a&gt; confirms that the Archdruids have studied under Cenarius for thousands of years. The ethereal nature of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, combined with the fact that the druids would spend centuries or millennia wandering its vast and ever-shifting expanses, could also mean that Malfurion, Cenarius and the Cenarion Circle did not need to physically travel to Val'sharah, but rather simply met the other druids in the Dream to tutor them. Nevertheless, Malfurion has not returned to Val'sharah, the region of his birth, for a considerable period, as &lt;a href=\"Koda%20Steelclaw\"&gt;Koda Steelclaw&lt;/a&gt; has not heard his name for \"centuries\". \nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; has existed since before the Sundering, and remains in relatively well-kept condition, implying that some night elves either traveled to the Broken Isles, or never left to begin with. &lt;a href=\"Lyanis%20Moonfall\"&gt;Lyanis Moonfall&lt;/a&gt; apparently kept the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; in a vault at the eastern edge of the temple grounds, stating that her \"order\" has protected them for thousands of years. Tyrande apparently recognizes the priestesses of the Temple as belonging to her \"order\", the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; as one of Elune's ancient territories, going as far as leaving her husband Malfurion to defend the Temple, although it remains unclear whether Tyrande herself personally visited the Temple in the millennia after the War of the Ancients. Tyrande recognizes &lt;a href=\"Elothir\"&gt;Elothir&lt;/a&gt;, although this might have been before the &lt;a href=\"Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Priestess\"&gt;Temple Priestess&lt;/a&gt; has heard of the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, presumably acknowledging its ancient history in Kalimdor.\n&lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Wardens\"&gt;Wardens&lt;/a&gt; maintained a &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, built after the War of the Ancients and stated to have kept Kalimdor's greatest threats such as &lt;a href=\"Ash%27Golm\"&gt;Ash'Golm&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned within its chambers over the millennia; as Maiev became a Warden only after Illidan's imprisonment, this implies she and her Wardens returned to the Broken Isles not long after imprisoning Illidan in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20Warden%20Glaive\"&gt;Ceremonial Warden Glaive&lt;/a&gt; is a weapon of formality from \"an age when a posting to the Vault of the Wardens was considered prestigious\", and &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Towers\"&gt;Warden Towers&lt;/a&gt; exist throughout the Isles, indicating their familiarity with the other regions. Maiev seemed genuinely surprised by the Broken Isles during her hunt for Illidan, and required calling for reinforcements from Malfurion in Kalimdor, despite the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; geographically being only a short distance away from the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20the%20Watchers\"&gt;Isle of the Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. \nSome of the Kalimdor night elves, such as &lt;a href=\"Kallistia%20Starlance\"&gt;Kallistia Starlance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olothil%20Starlance\"&gt;Olothil Starlance&lt;/a&gt;, presumably from the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; or trained as their students, have reunited with some of their long-lost kin in Azsuna, and &lt;a href=\"Namha%20Moonwater\"&gt;Namha Moonwater&lt;/a&gt; appears to be astonished by the tales of the night elves in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, implying that the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt; at least has had almost no contact with their brethren until very recently.\nWhy the Kalimdor night elves did not re-establish, make contact with, or at least acknowledge the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dreamweavers\"&gt;Dreamweavers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalker Farodin&lt;/a&gt;, or even their former kin in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; (despite their shielding of the city), where many of their people lived for ages, remains unclear. For example, Tyrande and Malfurion, with their wariness of the arcane, might have been concerned or at least been curious as to the presence of a large arcane shield covering the city where they grew up in, something not easily ignored by anyone passing through the region over the past ten millennia, let alone any of the night elves. Why &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the elves in Suramar, with their tremendous arcane powers over time and space, seemed unwilling to lift their shield and reconnect with their surviving kin in Kalimdor, or at least their kin in the rest of the Broken Isles, such as the neighboring Moon Guard, even while continuing to exile &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; from the city, is also confusing; the Moon Guard apparently still thought the nightborne their friends despite their \"long separation\". Maiev and her Wardens apparently moved there after their estrangement from Tyrande and Malfurion in \"&lt;a href=\"Wolfheart\"&gt;Wolfheart&lt;/a&gt;\", and were aware of the Nightfallen who were banished from Suramar. The &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; in turn is aware of the Wardens' presence in Azsuna and their secret prison facility underneath its mountains, as well as their usage of powerful containment crystals to hold their myriad prisoners, although it is unclear whether or not the two groups have ever directly interacted.\nFollowing Suramar's liberation, Malfurion and Tyrande apparently remained in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; until after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the Archdruid at his native village in &lt;a href=\"Lorlathil\"&gt;Lorlathil&lt;/a&gt; and the High Priestess at the Temple, apparently emphasizing their renewed affinity for the region and its ties with their ancient orders. Some &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Mage\"&gt;Nar'thalas magi&lt;/a&gt; travel to Stormwind's Portal Room during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, affiliating themselves with &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, opening a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Crumbled%20Palace\"&gt;Crumbled Palace&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a continued presence of Kalimdor night elves in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Mevris%20Ghostdancer\"&gt;Mevris Ghostdancer&lt;/a&gt;, who helps his wife &lt;a href=\"Daniss%20Ghostdancer\"&gt;Daniss Ghostdancer&lt;/a&gt; create &lt;a href=\"Drum%20of%20Primal%20Might\"&gt;Drums of Primal Might&lt;/a&gt; against the Horde, in addition to the presence of Gilnean villagers at &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Bradensbrook&lt;/a&gt; (who were openly aided by &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, Maiev Shadowsong, her brother Jarod, and her Wardens have all left the Broken Isles and rejoined their kaldorei kin in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (presumably making the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20the%20Watchers\"&gt;Isle of the Watchers&lt;/a&gt; an Alliance or Alliance-leaning territory), actively assisting their efforts in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. All of this makes it possible that at least some inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; have aligned themselves with Tyrande and Malfurion's night elves, possibly after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, helping to counterbalance the Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; of Highmountain and Suramar."}

She can be reached through climbing the tower itself, although defeating her will not be an easy task.

She attacks every few seconds, and switches targets frequently, although she does sometimes repeatedly strike the same player, presumably due to excessive threat. Players seeking to avoid her attacks can stand where the tower itself obstructs her line of sight, preventing her from targeting them. For ranged classes, or while waiting for a group to gather to assault the enemy base, the easiest option is to stand very close to the to the tower itself. Her attacks are otherwise very dangerous for lone Horde in the area, receiving the full brunt of her wrath.\nQuotes.\nDon't worry about the &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt;.

Here, warm volcanic stone ledges make for excellent nesting sites, while snowy featureless expanses serve as prime hunting grounds for these ferocious predators to seek flesh with their dual sets of eyes and nostrils. Their thick hides protect them from the elements, as well as from the arrows of frustrated hunters. Adventurers seeking to display a two-headed rylak trophy should remain wary of both sets of fangs... and those seeking to tame a new mount should consider the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s tendency to armor the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skyreaver\"&gt;largest rylaks&lt;/a&gt; and lead them into combat. &lt;a href=\"Mulverick%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mulverick&lt;/a&gt; is one of few &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf orcs&lt;/a&gt; to have mastered the art of rylak riding.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt;, allies of the Iron Horde, are enslaving the rylaks dwelling at &lt;a href=\"Darktide%20Roost\"&gt;Darktide Roost&lt;/a&gt;, off the southern coast of .\nIn the main universe, the rylaks of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; were tamed and ridden by an orcish clan referred to as the \"Nelghor-shomash\" (\"Cry of the Beasts\"), later known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragomaw fondly referred to their rylak mounts as \"nelghor\", or \"loyal beasts\". When the clan later ventured to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and encountered &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, it would apply the term \"nelghor\" to them as well, and all orcs would eventually refer to dragons as \"nelghor\". The name of the Dragonmaw clan never changed, but its meaning surely did. After the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; had conquered much of Draenor, the threat of starvation caused the orcs to hunt most of Draenor's native creatures to extinction. The Dragonmaw turned on their trained rylaks and used them as a source of food.\nOne of the most ancient and powerful types of rylaks are the black variants, living in the highest reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Stonefury%20Cliffs\"&gt;Stonefury Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;.\nA brilliant &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; once had a thought that riding a rylak would make travel much faster than using pack animals or walking. Roughly crafted from thick leather and utilizing an excessive number of knots, a special seat could comfortably accomodate an ogre. However, it could only be saddled on a rylak the size of a small mountain which seems to explain why no one has ever seen ogres fly.\nInterestingly, the rylak known as &lt;a href=\"Roardan%20the%20Sky%20Terror\"&gt;Roardan the Sky Terror&lt;/a&gt; apparently has &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Feather\"&gt;feathers&lt;/a&gt; and is called a \"bird\" by both and &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;. Rylaks lay eggs and collect an immense amount of fur when building their nests.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, several of them have been moved with the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; army to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a hunter pet.\nRylaks are &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;tamable&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt; family.

Waking the &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s and locating the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s, they found out that one of each was slain by frost magic. Merithra was worried that the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; were attacking again, and advised Rymek to be cautious as she sent the drakonid and the adventurer to aid &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt; in his magical research further in the gardens. There, Rymek asked the adventurer to kill &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Grovetalon\"&gt;Frenzied Grovetalon&lt;/a&gt; who, as he said, had tried to swoop him when he first arrived in the gardens. He learned about Gerithrus's plan to bring back &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed Gerithrus trying to reestablish the Aspect's ties to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Tear\"&gt;Emerald Tear&lt;/a&gt;s, in order to bring her closer to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, Rymek expressed curiosity about the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, so Merithra sent him there. He met &lt;a href=\"Somnikus\"&gt;Somnikus&lt;/a&gt; and spoke with him, while he sent the adventurer to give a &lt;a href=\"Rymek%27s%20Gift\"&gt;crystal gifts&lt;/a&gt; that he had created to the guards of the bough. Rymek chatted the grieving dragon up and he allowed the drakonid to see the Emerald Dream portal. He approached the portal with Gerithus and suddenly channeled frost power and transformed into a Primalist. As Gerithus realized, he knocked the adventurer back with his tail away from the portal. Gerithus and the guards were all put in ice blocks as an ice wave radiated out from Rymek and countless &lt;a href=\"Ice%20elemental\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Air%20elemental\"&gt;storm elementals&lt;/a&gt; charged the portal.\nRymek and his followers cut the dragons off from entering Ancient Bough from outside, but Merithra devised a plan not only to enter the area from the Dream, but also finish Gerithus' plan to bring back Ysera. Rymek then moved to &lt;a href=\"Lunedane\"&gt;Lunedane&lt;/a&gt; in search of &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;The Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera was indeed brought back, and she entered the bough from the Dream. With the aid of the adventurer, the entrance was made available and the dragon and druid forces entered and retook it. Gerithus had seen where Rymek had gone and he quickly told his mother and grandmother. Then, they moved after Rymek to Lunedane, with Somnikus being the first to go. As they entered it, they found Rymek and his forces assaulting the area. Somnikus managed to get to him and stopped him from reaching the World Tree, but was defeated and left wounded on the bridge, with a &lt;a href=\"Frostdrake\"&gt;Frostdrake&lt;/a&gt;, leading to Rymek. His two Azure Dragonspawn guards maintained two &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Core\"&gt;Frost Core&lt;/a&gt;s. Right after Somnikus' fall, the green flight arrived. When the adventurer killed the dragonspawn, destroyed the cores, and killed the Frostdrake, Somnikus sent the adventurer to finish off Rymek. With the aid of Ysera's &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; magic, the adventurer killed Rymek, his last words being about the mistrust of the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Winky came back! No flameflies needed.\nCan a dwarf get a celebratory belly rub? Come on now!

Ripped into the southern coastline lies &lt;a href=\"Daggercap%20Bay\"&gt;Daggercap Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe majestic fortress known as &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; is located in the center of this region; it is a dungeon complex and one of its sections is one of the two first instances (the other one being the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;) that players encounter when first arriving to Northrend.\nHowling Fjord contains bases of both factions and does not have a faction-specific emphasis. From the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; settlement of &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Spears\"&gt;Isle of Spears&lt;/a&gt;, located off the southwestern coast, there is a &lt;a href=\"giant%20turtle\"&gt;giant turtle&lt;/a&gt; vessel able to transport players to &lt;a href=\"Moa%27ki%20Harbor\"&gt;Moa'ki Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and from there on to &lt;a href=\"Unu%27pe\"&gt;Unu'pe&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe area was vrykul's seat of power when they were created, and like most of the ancient races, they tried to sleep their way through the Curse of Flesh turning them from immortal stone to mortal people\u2014which also allowed them to sleep through the Sundering.\nThird War.\n\"NOTE: The Howling Fjord and Daggercap Bay are part of a repeating retcon stating that the area was the landing place of Arthas Menethil and his soldiers during the Third War, the information alternating with the Forgotten Shore in the Dragonblight.\"\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; arrived with his soldiers to destroy the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; and punish him for the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; unleashed in his homeland. Arthas and the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; explorer &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; joined forces against Mal'Ganis, who they thought to be the Lich King's lackey. When Arthas's father summoned him home again, the prince responded by hiring mercenaries to burn his own ships, and blaming only them for the act of treachery, thus forcing his men to stay and fight. He searched for and obtained the cursed blade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby region of &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, mortally wounded Muradin in the process. He used Frostmourne to defeat Mal'Ganis but lost his soul to the Lich King as a result.\nArthas then wandered for a time, losing his mind. When he returned to his camp, he slaughtered his followers and raised them as mindless Scourge and some as &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s also maintained a number of isolated outposts around &lt;a href=\"Daggercap%20Bay\"&gt;Daggercap Bay&lt;/a&gt; by the time of Arthas's expedition to Northrend, and the &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s also had small settlements here.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; sending the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; across Northrend woke the slumbering &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; up, and they returned to claim the keeps and villages they'd abandoned for thousands of years.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; commanded the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate the Scourge with the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reaching Northrend, it established a beachhead on the Howling Fjord, where they found how far the deep the Lich King's reach went - many of the vrykul had fallen under the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;'s sway, and they hurled themselves at the Alliance's defenses until their numbers were spent. The settlers of &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; had to deal with newly reawakened vrykul warriors, who raided them from their home of &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; prospectors have discovered a new race of &lt;a href=\"iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; which may hint to their own ancient origins. Finally, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; have settled here and engineered a new plague, ready to strike at the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Their main settlements are &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Landing\"&gt;Vengeance Landing&lt;/a&gt; and the town of &lt;a href=\"New%20Agamand\"&gt;New Agamand&lt;/a&gt;, named after the famous &lt;a href=\"Agamand%20Mills\"&gt;mills family&lt;/a&gt; which once lived in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Keleseth\"&gt;Prince Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, who came to reside at Utgarde Keep as a result of their vrykul's alliance, oversaw Scourge operations in Howling Fjord and made himself a general pain in the rear around the region, working with Ingvar the Plunderer to organize raids.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance presence in the area remains still strong, with their fortresses turned toward diplomatic goals. The Horde, tuskarr, and taunka, continue to have settlements and presence here as well. The vrykul too, and they are mostly keeping to themselves, with Valgarde's walls still seeing regular attacks.\nGeography.\nThe place has green meadows cut with chill-you-to-the-bone rivers, pine forests, with the fresh and chill breeze out of them, as well as tall and rugged fjords.\nNotable characters.\nThe Howling Fjord will reputedly see several famous faces on the front against the Scourge, including &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, and the legendary weapon &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThere are well over 140 quests in the Howling Fjord.\nPlayers who are making the Fjord their first stop in Northrend had better be prepared to defend themselves. It is a zone riven by territorial disputes: In the east, the Alliance and the Horde continue their heated rivalry in an attempt to gain the coast. In the west, the Alliance is harried by the Northsea Freebooters. Running up the center of the land mass, both factions struggle with fiercely entrenched vrykul forces.\nMost of the major questlines are shared by Horde and Alliance, with only the quest NPCs and their locations being unique. This should produce elevated levels of conflict on PvP servers, as competition for quest mobs and target locations will be tight.\nRegardless of who they are, players should expect to gain notoriety in the tuskarr and pirate bands as dark spiritual influences become increasingly apparent. What secrets are held by the giant races of the land? Are they best left unrevealed?\nRares.\nRare Elite NPCs associated with the achievement:\nIn the RPG.\nThe Howling Fjord, located in the southwest of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, is a great name for this place. They call it that because the wind races in from the &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt; on all three sides, producing a constant howl like a maddened beast seeking its prey. Most people who arrive in &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; purchase low, fur-lined caps with flaps for the ears, or headbands that slant down in back, or thick hoods, anything to keep their ears from ringing when outside.\nOther than the noise, the Howling Fjord is pleasant. It is not as heavily forested as the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, or as hilly, but the temperature here is a little milder; between that and the flatter terrain it is an ideal place to grow grain and other crops. Small &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; dot the landscape, particularly down south near Valgarde. To the north the trees begin again, and creatures roam there from the hills above, making it more dangerous but also an excellent place for &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Howling Fjord has dark forests, open plains, treacherous rocks, and the only city \u2014 and port \u2014 on the continent. The last item in particular makes it an ideal place for Northrend adventures.\nThe &lt;a href=\"White%20Shark%20tribe\"&gt;White Shark tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s reside here.\nHistory.\nThe Howling Fjord was a favorite on Northrend from the first time explorers reached the continent through &lt;a href=\"Daggercap%20Bay\"&gt;Daggercap Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The natural harbor provided an ideal launching point for expeditions throughout the landmass.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; arrived, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; swept across the continent, conquering its races and claiming many of the towns and citadels. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; arrived with &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Lich King and punish him for the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; he had unleashed. Arthas and the noble &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; joined forces against the Lich King's ally, the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas's father&lt;/a&gt; summoned him home again, the prince responded by burning his own ships, thus forcing his men to stay and fight. He obtained the cursed sword &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; in this region, killing Muradin in the process, and defeated Mal'Ganis but lost his soul to the Lich King as a result. Arthas staggered away alone after the battle, and his men were left behind, stranded on Northrend. These humans and dwarves founded Valgarde. They also built the fortifications that protect it to this day. As Valgarde grew, its residents forced the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s back into the Grizzly Hills and beyond, making the region safe enough for brave &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s to till the land.\nPeople and culture.\nThis is the only region in Northrend dominated by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. That is entirely because of Valgarde, however \u2014 without that city it would be an even match between the dwarves in the region and the Drakkari and the furbolgs. No one is factored the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s in, either, mainly because they don't let most people close enough to count them.\nAlmost everyone lives in Valgarde. The exceptions are the farmers, who have their thickwalled farmhouses by their fields, and the hunters and &lt;a href=\"trapper\"&gt;trapper&lt;/a&gt;s, who live in small camps among the trees and come south only to trade or sell.\nThis region is also the only &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;-dominated part of Northrend, and here the Drakkari and even the furbolgs are the ones at risk.\nGeography.\nThe north edge of the Fjord has low hills and thick forest. The land smoothes out to the south, however, and the trees fade back, to be replaced by grain and a few hardy fruits and vegetables. Daggercap Bay dominates the southern end, which is all rock. Most people live in Valgarde or in a semicircle above it.\nThe fjord has its share of wildlife. &lt;a href=\"Bear\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and other creatures prowl the forests, and small animals sneak through the farmland as well. &lt;a href=\"Bird\"&gt;Bird&lt;/a&gt;s roost in the trees and steal grain and seeds, and the warmer climate and rich soil draws &lt;a href=\"Insectoid\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt; and other vermin as well.\nThe Howling Fjord has only one major settlement, and that is Valgarde. Everyone else lives in isolated farmhouses or small hunting camps. Even the Drakkari and the furbolg wander down from the Grizzly Hills or &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; and set up hasty camps among the trees.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Mel'Thandris was entrusted the &lt;a href=\"%3AScythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;:Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; after it was used to seal away the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt;, and after Mel'Thandris died in the final battle of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt; the scythe was stored here.\nVelinde eventually came here after finding a book in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; describing the war, and discovered the scythe.\nThe vale was home to a tribe of &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Terrowulf\"&gt;Terrowulf&lt;/a&gt;, who had completely overtaken the ruined Shrine of Mel'Thandris located there. It was the worgen's chilling calls that gave the vale its new name. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were sent by &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Melyria%20Frostshadow\"&gt;Sentinel Melyria Frostshadow&lt;/a&gt; to study the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;Tome of Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt; about the mysterious wolf-men.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shael%27dryn\"&gt;Shael'dryn&lt;/a&gt; hid a piece of &lt;a href=\"Dartol%27s%20Rod\"&gt;Dartol's Rod&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Worn%20Chest%20%28Ashenvale%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; at the shrine.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Rexxar and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; visited the area. The troll ambassador noticed the withered treants still present. The pair watched &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestesses of Elune&lt;/a&gt; tending to the Shrine of Mel'Thandris, singing prayers for the worgen."}

{"id": "327553", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=327553", "title": "Hozen", "text": "The hozen are a &lt;a href=\"monkey\"&gt;monkey&lt;/a&gt;-like race that live in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and various islands of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Short-lived and immature, they are a passionate and playful race, mischievous pranksters that \"act like a group of 14 year old boys running around together in the jungle.\" The hozen are native to Pandaria, and are found all over the continent.\nMostly a wild and independent race, hostile to any who wander into their hunting grounds, one tribe of forest hozen were befriended by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s earned their grudging respect. Equipped with machine guns and weapons from the Horde, this hozen tribe were trained and recruited to join the battle against the Alliance and their &lt;a href=\"Jinyu\"&gt;new allies&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe hozen are uncannily dexterous foragers and hunters who dwell in &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s among treetops and mountains of Pandaria. They are a simple race driven by their passions.\nThe hozen are a short-lived race. Their elders are typically no more than twenty years old, usually fourteen or fifteen, and few hozen survive past their twentieth birthday. As a result, their relative maturity when compared to the other speaking races is quite minimal and their society lacks roots (and rules) as a result. Uncouth and impulsive, hozen nonetheless play, live and squabble together... at least until their clans grow so large that they collapse into multiple smaller groups.\nIn contrast to the very reserved and polite jinyu, the hozen are a passionate people that love to love, love to hate, and love to feel any emotion they can feel, as long as they feel it strongly. Initially, the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt; considered the hozen to be innately violent, often selfish and shortsighted, unable to work together long enough to build a proper civilization of their own. However, as time passed, Yu'lon questioned her assumptions and realized that, while it is easy to see the short-lived, short-tempered hozen as troublemakers, they live full, wild lives in the years they have.\nKun-Lai Summit.\nThe hozen of the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai&lt;/a&gt; mountains are unusually aggressive, even by hozen standards. Food and supplies are often scarce in this hostile terrain. When times are hard, the hozen leadership may declare a \"ravage\" on nearby settlements. During a ravage, every hozen strong enough to walk joins in on a massive swarm attack on nearby villages. In this way, they ensure they either acquire enough food to last the winter, or they lose enough of their weakest to ensure their current supplies are enough.\nFor years, the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"grummle\"&gt;grummle&lt;/a&gt;s have maintained an uneasy peace with the hozen in exchange for food tributes. Fear of the Shado-Pan keeps the local tribes in check... Usually.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt;, several races settled in the land surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the hozen among them. The bold and mischievous monkey-men came to inhabit the dense jungles surrounding the vale. They worshipped the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s, and in return, the spirits offered them knowledge and guidance. For a time, there was peace.\nLong ago, only a few years before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, a hozen known only as the &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20King\"&gt;Monkey King&lt;/a&gt; had become the leader of an ungovernable people. He had risen to power without spilling a single drop of blood and was beloved by every hozen tribe, despite that hozen fought endlessly, constantly, for the simplest reasons. Any disagreement meant physical violence, but the Monkey King knew this. So he told the hozen tribes, \"I am the Monkey King. Your tribe supports me with all its heart.\" When a single hozen would question him, he would tell them that their tribe's leader had already agreed to it. No hozen wanted to challenge their leader on a whim--and be in a fight--so they declared, \"You are the Monkey King.\" When the tribe leaders learned his name, all of their subjects were already calling him the Monkey King. They were confused, but they did not want to fight their people, so they did not challenge him either. The Monkey King's wild claim, his lie, eventually became true because nobody dared to disagree with it. Soon tribal fighting had ceased. The Monkey King passed judgment on all disputes and the hozen obeyed.\nThe hozen have been at war with the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; for a very long time. At some point long ago the hozen approached them for help; the jinyu felt sorry for them and taught them how to survive. The jinyu gave them their trust, but over time the hozen grew strong and bold and began taking the land for their own. During &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest of Pandaria, both the hozen and the jinyu agreed to help the other withstand the onslaught of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; armies. However, on the eve of the jinyu's final stand against the mogu, the hozen betrayed them, having secretly made a pact with the Thunder King in exchange for preferential treatment (a promise that was never kept). The hozen's betrayal ensured the defeat of the jinyu and created a bitter rivalry between the two races that would last for centuries.\nFacing the hozen's \"dirty guerilla tactics\", the jinyu are outwitted by the hozen at every turn. The hozen are vastly superior on land, especially in areas with thick tree cover, but the jinyu have a strong advantage on or near water, allowing them to defend &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Village\"&gt;Pearlfin Village&lt;/a&gt;. The jinyu consider the hozen \"careless, filthy beasts\".\nThe hozen took part in the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Revolution\"&gt;Pandaren Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, covertly digging tunnels that would lead them behind the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; defenses.\nCulture.\nHozen love to hunt and fish, and often will assault anyone and anything in their hunting grounds. The other races of Pandaria are therefore careful to avoid these areas, but this is often not enough to avoid conflict. The hozen's notoriously short tempers grow even shorter when their hunger pushes entire clans, including elderly and young hozen, to ravage food sources outside of their territory, either gathering enough food or seeing enough hozen die in the process to ensure the survivors\u2019 continued health.\nHozen skulls are often found scattered among their huts and campfires. &lt;a href=\"Jinyu\"&gt;Jinyu&lt;/a&gt; collect hozen skulls as prized tokens, and use them to perform ceremonial rites; the older the skull, the more potent its magic. Hozen are known to keep and tame &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;s, although they have also been known to be preyed upon by tigers, as well as by &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s. Hozen seem to live on a diet composed mostly of fish, or as they call them, \"slickies\", and sometimes catch them using bait made from bugs' legs.\nThe Jade Forest's mountain hozen fear the venomous &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Viper\"&gt;Grove Viper&lt;/a&gt;s and often hunt them out of pure spite.\nName name.\nHozen have a rite of passage for their people that celebrates martial skill. Most hozen respect good fighters, or good \"grookers\" as they say. Those that have shown their strength in battle earn their \"name name\". Instead of being addressed by their name once, they are addressed by their name twice, and this is shown as a title of respect.\nCombat.\nSome young and rambunctious hozen are trained from an early age to use boxing gloves so they don't accidentally kill their tribe members, and more importantly, to keep them from picking their noses. The hozen rely on dirty guerrilla tactics. Ambushes and traps. They are able to swing and leap from tree to tree and use thick trees for cover. Hozen sometimes take prisoners, keeping them in bamboo cages.\nTypes.\nThere are jungle hozen and mountain hozen, the heartier kind, and &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hozen\"&gt;Forest Hozen&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"the%20Monkey%20King\"&gt;the Monkey King&lt;/a&gt; there are also sky hozen.\nWhile most hozen are hostile, there are some of the less wild forest hozen that have made themselves homes amongst the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, often acting as &lt;a href=\"Farmer\"&gt;farmhands&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s. A hozen can start their own proper farm in the &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt; if they want to, and even earn a place as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Tillers%23Council\"&gt;Tillers council&lt;/a&gt;. Some have begun training in &lt;a href=\"Tian%20Monastery\"&gt;Tian Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Jade%20Forest\"&gt;the Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Such individuals are accepted on their personal merits, and there is no prejudice placed on them by the pandaren due to the actions of their species as a whole.\nTwo hozen with wings, &lt;a href=\"Ginger-Ginger\"&gt;Ginger-Ginger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flap-Flap\"&gt;Flap-Flap&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. When asked how they acquired wings, the Monkey King responds \"There are many secrets both mysterious and divine, you have yours and I have mine.\" They are presumably the sky hozen that the Monkey King mentioned.\nWisdom.\nThe following are notes of wisdom proclaimed by the &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20Wiseman\"&gt;wisest of hozen&lt;/a&gt; on the Wandering Isle:\nHozen 'wisdom' can also be found recorded on scrolls in the form of &lt;a href=\"Hai-pu\"&gt;Hai-pu&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nHozen lore can be discovered through the following lore objects, hidden throughout &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;:\nDiscovering all of these objects will earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20in%20the%20Mist\"&gt;Hozen in the Mist&lt;/a&gt;, and initiate the &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20in%20the%20Mist%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Hozen in the Mist (quest)&lt;/a&gt; quest, inviting the player to visit &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt;, who will tell the player &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20in%20the%20Mist%20%28quest%29%23Notes\"&gt;a short story about the hozen&lt;/a&gt;."}

It serves as the traditional home for the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt; clan, and specifically the &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt;, notorious for their taming of the local &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s. As the largest settlement in Stormheim, Hrydshal is a major feature in the region and contains one of the largest concentrations of vrykul on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBuilt into the cliffs at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Thorim%27s%20Peak\"&gt;Thorim's Peak&lt;/a&gt;, Hrydshal is the largest settlement in the region of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the few possessing defensive walls. For many years, the &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt; who inhabit the city have practiced the skill of &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt; taming and riding. This era began with the exploits of &lt;a href=\"Hakkap%20One-leg\"&gt;Hakkap One-leg&lt;/a&gt;, who founded the tradition. It has become characteristic of Hrydshal, as drakes and their riders dominate much of the population.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Hrydshal was ruled over by &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Irglov%20the%20Merciless\"&gt;Thane Irglov the Merciless&lt;/a&gt;. Hrydshal's allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt; clan would ultimately align it to the Burning Legion itself, as &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; formed a dark pact with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. This placed the city at the center of the conflict taking over Stormheim and made it an important base for the Legion's loyalists. To his followers, Skovald presented a gift by transforming them into the &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt;. The Drekirjar would subsequently betray their ancient pact with the &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt; storm drakes, instead enslaving them to be used in the God-King's war.\nSoon, however, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would arrive in the area on their search for the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this quest, they had to gain access to the roosts of the Thorignir high above Hrydshal, which meant going through the city. On the orders of Commander &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dread-Rider%20Cullen\"&gt;Dread-Rider Cullen&lt;/a&gt; respectively, the Alliance and Horde infiltrated Hrydshal, using &lt;a href=\"Stormforged%20Grapple%20Launcher\"&gt;stormforged grapple launcher&lt;/a&gt;s to bypass its formidable walls. As they did so, they also sabotaged much of Hrydshal's defenses, including its complement of &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20Harpoon%20Launcher\"&gt;harpoon launchers&lt;/a&gt;, while cutting through many Tideskorn. The invaders would press on to Thorim's Peak in order to liberate the surviving Thorignir.\nAfter the outsiders rescued the Thorignir and their matriarch from the Felskorn, &lt;a href=\"Vethir\"&gt;Vethir&lt;/a&gt; would lead his kin in a blistering attack on Hrydshal in order to exact retribution. The attack would slay many Drekirjar and do serious damage to the settlement. Not content with this alone, Vethir's Thorignir would launch many subsequent assaults, with major casualties for the denizens of Hrydshal.\nAt this time, the vrykul of Hrydshal would continue their practice of raiding into the neighboring region of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, home to the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks would often capture many prisoners, and these were taken back to Hrydshal itself to be imprisoned in public cages. The mythical vrykul known as &lt;a href=\"Vydhar\"&gt;Vydhar&lt;/a&gt; would eventually send champions to liberate these prisoners, in order to fulfill an ancient debt to the Highmountain tauren.\nSome time later, following the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s initial failure to secure Stormheim, Hrydshal and the Drekirjar came under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Velbrand\"&gt;Jarl Velbrand&lt;/a&gt;. Velbrand would eventually be confronted by &lt;a href=\"Sigryn\"&gt;Sigryn&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of Skovald, as she sought to claim her right to rule the Tideskorn. She would engage the Jarl in combat, and upon besting him secured his allegiance to her cause. Sigryn would later be crowned the new God-Queen of the Tideskorn clan, thus placing Hrydshal under her overall authority."}

There he would stay with his crazy uncle at &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt;. His uncle found send him to do various tasks to improve his agility, speed and aiming skills. One these tasks was to gather some toads from the swamp. He grabbed his &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rider%20Air%20Rifle\"&gt;Red Rider Air Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and went for the hunt. However, he soon realized that killing these critters was boring so we used the gun to kill flies. To still bring something back to his starving uncle and companions, he got them some &lt;a href=\"Sawtooth%20Crocolisk\"&gt;Sawtooth Crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s. There was also a time when he visited his crazy grandfather in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; where they would go fishing. Like his uncle, he would give him some hard tasks for training. One of these tasks was to tie a rope around him and jump overboard. Thanks to this, he became the first person to swallow two elusive gill-breathers. After his training, he decided to travel the world with legends like &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt; to see in what kind of trouble he would get in.\nLoch Modan.\nThere was a time when Payne was found in &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;. There he hunted &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Bear\"&gt;Grizzly Bear&lt;/a&gt;s with a &lt;a href=\"Whittling%20Knife\"&gt;Whittling Knife&lt;/a&gt;. During his hunt, he was ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Sagepaw\"&gt;Sagepaw&lt;/a&gt;. However, the major got the better of him as he ended up with fist-full of &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; teeth, three new scars, and a very warm fur blanket.\nZul\u2019Farrak.\nThere was a time when Major Payne traveled to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; to face the demigod &lt;a href=\"Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt; in which he won and ended up with a electrified scale cloak.\nOutland.\nPayne entered &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and faced &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPayne would join the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; as an initial in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. His commander sent him on a scouting mission in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s didn't notice him, a Fel Reaver screaming so loud that Payne's eardrums were hurting did. The &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Reaver%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Fel Reaver&lt;/a&gt; stepped on Payne, but he was able to fight back and defeat him.\nSometime later during his training, he and a couple of other soldiers were sent to &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Tempest%20Keep%29\"&gt;the Eye&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the biggest reaver he ever saw, the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Reaver\"&gt;Void Reaver&lt;/a&gt;. While the reaver was strong, Payne and his teammates won.\nAfter all of this, he advanced through the ranks and eventually ended in Northrend.\nArgent Tournament.\nAside from the scourge, Major Payne had to deal with a pesky rogue who was causing him trouble at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; and also left a scar on his back. He also commented that the now deceased rogue used poison from &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nTownlong Steppes.\nAfter his success against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Major Payne travailed to Pandaria and went to weaponless to &lt;a href=\"Shan%27ze%20Dao\"&gt;Shan'ze Dao&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. He uassually would do a regularly hike just so he can swing cloudrunners around by their tails and laugh in &lt;a href=\"Hei%20Feng\"&gt;Hei Feng&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s face. However, one time he ended up fighting &lt;a href=\"G%27nathus\"&gt;G'nathus&lt;/a&gt; and after twenty-three seconds he ended up eating the eel.\nIsle of Giants.\nWhen he heard of a secret club who liked to round up large, ferocious beasts into a corral and try to ride them. Payne believed they were stupid for their outfits were torn to shreds, so Payne created his own gang (The Direhorn Expert Riding Professionals Syndicate). Every Tuesday, they would go to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Isle of Giants&lt;/a&gt; and ride majestic beasts. On the island he also defeated &lt;a href=\"Oondasta\"&gt;Oondasta&lt;/a&gt;.\nTanaris.\nPayne was also called upon during the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; where he defeated &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ra-den\"&gt;Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; and also the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Animus\"&gt;Dark Animus&lt;/a&gt;. After that he went to &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; to search for treasure. When he found a whale's skeleton, he was approached by a Living Sandling who according to him he was taking revenge after his onslaught on the isle. The sandling was no match and Payne easily took him down, but not before leaving a sand trap that took one of his boots. The matter upset him so greatly that he traveled back to the Isle of Thunder on foot to fight more sandlings.\nUldum.\nWhile exploring the caverns of Uldum, he accidentally set a booby trap. After surviving, Payne ran through the forest and along the &lt;a href=\"Akhenet%20Fields\"&gt;Akhenet Fields&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly, he ended up being cased by &lt;a href=\"Pygmy\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt;. Soon he met up with &lt;a href=\"Budd\"&gt;Budd&lt;/a&gt; and escaped on a &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;. While on the plan, Payne felt something hugging his leg. When they landed, Payne was disgusted when he found out it was a snake.\nBattlefield: Barrens.\nWhile not seen during the events, Payne does admit that he was present during the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. He also quotes that he think that &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; is just a ego maniacal bully and that he prefers how thing where in the past.\nDarnassus.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cold%20Trixxy\"&gt;Stone Cold Trixxy&lt;/a&gt; needed someone to help her with her team strategy, she immediately called Major Payne. Because &lt;a href=\"Historian%20Llore\"&gt;Historian Llore&lt;/a&gt; had asked Payne to research the temporal anomalies that were happening on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, he was found in Stormwind at the moment when she reached him. He immediately got on &lt;a href=\"The%20Bravery\"&gt;The Bravery&lt;/a&gt; and left Stormwind early to sailed to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter taking the portal leading to the city, he was amazed by Darnassus's beauty. He then headed to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, where he greeted &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and played a &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;new card game&lt;/a&gt; with Malfurion Stormrage and lost. After the game, he went to the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. There he wrestled a &lt;a href=\"saber%20cat\"&gt;stormsaber&lt;/a&gt; and climbed a few trees with one arm. While he was having fun, an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Protector\"&gt;Ancient Protector&lt;/a&gt; caught his attention. He approached it and the two spoke about its job and its relationship with the night elves. Soon after he traveled to Winterspring and found Trixxy.\nQuotes.\nI will fight with honor and valor for the glory of the Alliance!\nArticles.\nMajor Payne's Pet Menagerie.\nSince March 2013, Major Payne has taken it upon himself to help readers to prepare themselves \"to conquer all of Azeroth\u2019s Battle Pets\".

The world of Azeroth is rife with adventure. Even the smallest villages have their stories of monsters assailed, treasures discovered and battles won. Yet only a few adventurers in each generation rise to face the next level of challenge, to become true heroes. Of those heroes, fewer still survive their trials to become legends that will be remembered for all time. Decades, centuries, even millennia later, their names are still known: Malfurion Stormrage, Tyrande Whisperwind, Orgrim Doomhammer, Korialstrasz, Uther Lightbringer and the other characters are beings of great renown and greater ability, legends."}

This flamewaker gained his exalted status by proving to be nearly invincible in the battles that raged within the elemental plane. Rumor has it that Executus supplanted &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt;, and the two have been rivals ever since. Although this rumor has yet to be confirmed, there is certainly no doubt that Ragnaros does not tolerate failure. Thus, the lesser &lt;a href=\"flamewaker\"&gt;flamewaker&lt;/a&gt;s (and, of course, Baron Geddon) eagerly await a misstep by Executus, anticipating their chance to vie for the coveted attention of the Firelord.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s heroes, recruited by the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;, stormed the Molten Core, they had to overcome Majordomo Executus, second only to the Firelord himself.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, after becoming the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, replaced Executus as Ragnaros' majordomo.\nSpawning.\nExecutus will only be spawned after you have deactivated &lt;a href=\"the%20runes%20of%20warding\"&gt;the runes of warding&lt;/a&gt;. This means you'll have to defeat every other boss (except for Ragnaros, who is summoned after Executus's defeat, and &lt;a href=\"Lucifron\"&gt;Lucifron&lt;/a&gt;, who actually doesn't have to be killed) in the Molten Core before you can fight him. Pre-&lt;a href=\"3.0.8\"&gt;3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, you also had to douse the runes using &lt;a href=\"Aqual%20Quintessence\"&gt;Aqual Quintessence&lt;/a&gt;. You obtained the Aqual Quintessence by gaining Honored status with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;, and completing the quest chain ending with &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20the%20Enemy\"&gt;Hands of the Enemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nExecutus comes with four &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20Healer\"&gt;Flamewaker Healer&lt;/a&gt;s and four &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20Elite\"&gt;Flamewaker Elite&lt;/a&gt; guards making this a total of a nine enemy encounter. Executus will \"submit\" and the fight is won when all the adds are dead. He then appears in Ragnaros' chamber and will summon the Firelord to begin the encounter. Ragnaros will then, before he engages the players, kill Executus as punishment for not being able to stop them.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Flamewaker Elites also have a spell. In addition, Flamewaker Healers will become immune to crowd control after two flamewakers are killed, instead of four.\nStrategies.\nExecutus is not the target of this encounter; to win you must kill all his guards. \nYou can sheep the healers, however you can only keep them \"chain-sheeped\" for the beginning of the battle, but sheeping is disabled after 4 of the adds die.\nUse &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;s when bringing down the healers. This is important for stopping spell casting and bringing them down fast.\nPull.\nThe &lt;a href=\"MT\"&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;, a hunter, and a paladin will engage Executus. The paladin will pull with divine shield. This paladin will attempt to stand closer to Executus than the MT throughout the fight; Executus usually teleports the closest player to him to the fire pit. The hunter distracting shots Executus whenever he charges off so that the tank can regain aggro. Executus is susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Taunt\"&gt;Taunt&lt;/a&gt;, but teleporting the MT, thus lowering his aggro makes him randomly wander away from the MT and into the main raid.\nAlternatively you can use a fifth &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;, or hunter pet to pull Executus.\nSheeps.\n&lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s will pull their adds from the group with &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt; and then sheep them. &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s will pull their adds to the &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;s. From a Mage point of view, while sheeping, it is critical to drink a Fire protection potion 2 minutes prior to the fight. As well, while sheeping, you should ALWAYS have &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Shield%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Mana Shield (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; up, as well as detect magic on the sheep. Never lose your target unless you are far away from all other sheeps and you keep your eye on it. Bandage right after casting a new polymorph. Do NOT &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; while magic reflection is up. &lt;a href=\"Sheeping\"&gt;Sheeping&lt;/a&gt; is fine with damage reflection. At the pull, Mages should have mana shield up. Get within max distance of Counterspell and use it to pull aggro, and immediately sheep.\nBe sure to keep notice of which shields are up on the mobs. White means that casters should take a break from hurling DPS, and purple means that melee classes should stay back (aside from the tank, who should be keeping aggro). We have mods which will give notification when the shields go up and down.\nEach &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, except the portal caster, is assigned to a Mage. If the healer unsheeps while shield is up or the Mage dies, pally needs to stun or off tank till shield is down. Alternatively, you could use a hunter for this.\nPowers.\nEvery so often, Executus will give his helpers a shield. The shields last for 10 seconds and either have a 50% chance of reflecting magic attacks, or can reflect up to 100 melee damage when hit. Keep an eye on raid chat for these.\nKilling the adds.\nThe order of the kills is important to new guilds trying this encounter and less so to those who have done this enough times to allow some small errors.\nFollow the Leader.\nFor new guilds, the most forgiving method is to kill one Elite, then the four Healers, then the other Elites. This means that you won't have tanks switching targets mid-way through the fight, with the exception of the Leading Tank. It also frees up the Mages a little quicker, increasing the DPS.\nAssign one Tank to Executus. 4 Tanks to the Elites. 4 Mages to the Healers. One of the Tanks on the Elites is the Leading Tank. His Elite is killed first. He then chooses a sheep, and starts to tank it. Everyone follows him, and kills it. Then he chooses another sheep, and so on, until all of them are down.\nOnce the Healers are down, the Leading Tank makes his way to the nearest Elite, and the raid kills that. Repeat until all adds are down.\nMaterials.\nThis battle is a test of the mana efficiency of the healers, who should bring as many &lt;a href=\"Major%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Major Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt;s as possible. Other raid members should be liberal in their use of fire and shadow protection potions, healing potions, and bandages.\nAlternate strategy: Simultaneous kills.\nAnother way to do this is to sheep all 4 priests, then kill 2 elites (A &amp; B). The raid then focuses 1 additional add (C), before killing 2 at the same time (D &amp; E). It is a matter of preference whether to kill a Healer (C) and then eliminate the two remaining Elites (D &amp; E) simultaneously, OR kill an Elite (C) and then kill a Healer (D) and the remaining Elite (E) together. Either way, there will be 2 tanks free when the remaining three Healers break out of &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;, which means 1 tank will have to transition from an add that was just killed to the third Healer. After the three Healers are picked up, they can be killed one by one.\nThis strategy frees the tank groups from excessive healing and allows more DPS to flow to the adds, but is a bit tricky to implement. Killing targets D and E in rapid succession allows the raid to not have to deal with 4 targets at once when the Healers become immune to &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternate strategy: Wounded Elites.\nPolymorph the Healers, kill two Elites, and bring the other two Elites to 30% health. Break a sheep and kill that Healer; there are now 3 sheeped Healers and 2 damaged Elites. Break the next sheep and kill that healer - after it is dead, both tanks not tanking the Elites must pick up the Healers that have broken their Polymorphs, while the raid assist trains the two elites that were brought down to 30% earlier. Then kill the two remaining healers. The idea here is similar to the strategy outlined above, but wounding the Elites first allows the raid to kill not two but \"three\" adds in a row at the point of sheep becoming ineffective.\nPost Level 60 Strategy.\nWith level 80 healers and tank, and probably level 80 dps, too (or at least 70), pull Executus and keep him and all the adds on the tank. AoE the adds. Also, try to stay off the coals in case you have level 60-ish melee dpsers.\nReward.\nMajordomo Executus himself does not drop loot as he does not actually die. He instead offers access to the &lt;a href=\"Cache%20of%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Cache of the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation: Executus himself does not provide reputation gains with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;. However, both &lt;a href=\"Flamewalker%20Healer\"&gt;Flamewalker Healer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Flamewalker%20Elite\"&gt;Flamewalker Elite&lt;/a&gt;s provide 20 reputation each, for a total of 160 reputation per defeat of the encounter.\nQuotes.\n\"The Firelord and his brethren once held sway over this entire world, mortal.

Now empowered by Ragnaros as the new Majordomo of the Firelands (replacing the deceased &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt;) and the leader of the treacherous Druids of the Flame, Fandral seeks to bring ruin to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; rather than live in a world without his beloved child.\"\nAbilities.\nIn all difficulty settings, Majordomo Staghelm has a hard enrage timer of 10 minutes.\nStrategy.\n\"The fight consists of two alternating phases which will change depending on your raids positioning.\nForm 1: Fire Scorpion\nForm 2: Fire Cat\nEach of the forms has a unique set of abilities, and these abilities become more powerful each time he switches forms. He casts these abilities when he reaches 100 energy, and regenerates energy more quickly the longer he is in a single form.\nIt is recommended that you pull him with your raid stacked up, forcing him into Scorpion form. It's base ability is Flame Scythe, a frontal cleave attack that splits the damage done amongst all targets hit. Fandral will only remain in this form as long as enough players are stacked in front of him. Any place works for stacking, but the middle of the circle on the platform is recommended as it works well as a range indicator for the Cat phase.\nIf the raid spreads out, Staghelm will transition into Cat form instead. When he reaches 100 energy in this form, he will cast Leaping Flames, jumping at a random ranged party member and leaving a pool of fire 20 yards across under them. He will also spawn a copy of himself called a Spirit of Flame when he leaps. The melee should immediately kill these spirits as soon as they spawn.\nThe goal in this encounter is to leave him in a single form as long as possible, until his energy regeneration simply becomes too high from his Adrenaline stacks for your raid to handle any more, then cluster up or spread out to force Staghelm to change forms. The soft-enrage for this fight comes from the fact that every time he changes form, his Flame Scythe and Leaping Flames will hit harder due to his Fury stacks. \nHere is a short summary of the time it takes his energy to go from 0 to 100 based on Adrenaline stacks:\n 0 Adrenaline stacks: 18 seconds;\n 1 Adrenaline stack: 15 seconds;\n 2 Adrenaline stacks: 12 seconds;\n 3 Adrenaline stacks: 11 seconds;\n 4 Adrenaline stacks: 10 seconds;\n 5 Adrenaline stacks: 9 seconds;\n 6 Adrenaline stacks: 8 seconds;\n 7 Adrenaline stacks: 7 seconds.\n 8 ...\nRemember, the number of Scythes your raid can take is not a fixed number. You'll need to figure out your healers' limits, and that limit will go down every Scorpion phase as Fandral gains Fury stacks. It is also important to make sure each phase last as long as possible, as the phases get harder and therefore must be shorter as the fight goes on. After the last Flame-Scythe, you want to spread out as fast as possible, use blink, Stampeding roar, disengage and therelikes, to make the switch as smoothly as possible.\nIf you choose to tank the Scorpion in the middle of the circle, your ranged dps and healers will want to spread on or just outside the runic circle during the Cat phase. Leaping Flame will target ranged raiders based on their spec role, not based on how many are at range. All ranged dps and all healers are eligible targets, regardless of how close they are to Fandral.\nMost raids can start out with 5-7 Scythes and 6-8 Leaps before transitioning, reducing as the fight goes one. Number of Scythes during the seed phase will need be reduced, as the damage from each will be higher due to the reduced number of people soaking each as people run out for the explosion. \nEvery third shape-change (including his initial change into form when he enters combat), he'll briefly stun the raid and cast either Searing Seeds or Burning Orbs, depending on which form he is swapping into.\nShifting to Scorpion:\nShifting to Cat:\nSolo strategy.\nFandral will only be in Cat form for the entire encounter. As the player is constantly taking damage from Fandral, Concentration will not come into effect. Pop CDs on the pull and try to blow him up before his Adrenaline gets too high and he casts Leaping Flame constantly. When he does cast it, move to the edge of the area of effect, then plant, and do more damage before moving again. Cleave the Spirit of the Flame adds that spawn on each leap. Shift to damage-on-the move tactics after about 10 stacks, as by that point Fandral will leap every 5 seconds or so.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The ritualistic duel has been often used to obtain a position of leadership, such as a fight for the position of group leader, &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but not necessarily. Mak'gora is practiced by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; clans as well.\nDescription.\nMak'gora used to be traditionally a combat to the death, but under &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall's&lt;/a&gt; rule it became a non-lethal combat, though participants can choose to forgo this change.\nRefusing a Mak'gora can mean dishonor. When used as a fight to the death, being spared can be perceived as a grave insult for orcs, at least for &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlords&lt;/a&gt;. In one unnamed orcish clan, the participants were expelled from their clan and left for dead when they refused to kill each other during their Mak'gora.\nIn &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; clans, only an ogre may challenge another ogre to a mak'gora, but the challenger may then choose a champion to fight on his/her behalf.\nThe rules of a Mak'gora seem to be different between each Mak'gora since they are chosen and set by the participants themselves. Generally, there are thus no specific rules. There are only two consistent themes in all Mak'gora: once dropped, a weapon cannot be retrieved by either opponent and that the pair must fight to the death or until submission. &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has never been stated to be forbidden, and has, in fact, been used in multiple Mak'gora duels and thus seems to be permitted. Similarly, many Mak'gora duels have involved both fighters wearing body armor as well, but it can also be forbidden when explicitly required.\nFor example, the \"traditional\", \"old way\" rules chosen for the Mak'gora between &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; were:\nThe rules chosen for the Mak'gora between &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra&lt;/a&gt; were:\nIn many instances of Mak'gora, no rules whatsoever are defined beforehand. For instance in both the first and the second Mak'gora between Thrall and Garrosh, the Mak'gora between Saurfang and Malfurion, or the Mak'gora between Saurfang and Sylvanas.\n\"Warcraft\" film universe.\nThe mak'gora is an ancient tradition for the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s on . It is a duel fought to the death between participants. It can be fought hand-to-hand or with weapons, but the use of magic is considered cheating.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

She is a capable hunter and tracker.\nBiography.\nBlackwater Raiders.\nMakasa was born as the fourth child of &lt;a href=\"Marjani%20Flintwill\"&gt;Marjani Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, captain of the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Makemba\"&gt;Makemba&lt;/a&gt;\" of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. Her other brothers were &lt;a href=\"Adashe%20Flintwill\"&gt;Adashe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akashinga%20Flintwill\"&gt;Akashinga&lt;/a&gt;, whom she liked the most, and &lt;a href=\"Amahle%20Flintwill\"&gt;Amahle&lt;/a&gt; with whom she used to fight by tickling until she no longer was ticklish. They had four different fathers but none of them took care, so Marjani acted as mother and father. The four siblings were raised aboard the ship instead of inland. As such, Makasa came to know &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; like the back of her hand, knew how to work on ship and fight at an early age. Marjani was especially tough (in a good sense) on her daughter because she saw herself in her youngest and she thought that her only daughter could one day rule the Raiders.\nBy the time she turned 15, she knew how to fight, raided several ships and took lives. When Adashe became a captain, she joined his crew on the \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20King\"&gt;Sea King&lt;/a&gt;\" as a lookout, with the other two brothers joining as well as mates. &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Barker\"&gt;Joe Barker&lt;/a&gt; was chosen as his first mate. After several weeks, the \"Sea King\" plundered a merchant ship \"&lt;a href=\"Winter%27s%20Knot\"&gt;Winter's Knot&lt;/a&gt;\". When they were enjoying its Lordaeron wine, Adashe's ship which was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;' two ships, the \"&lt;a href=\"Killmonger\"&gt;Killmonger&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Orca%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Orca&lt;/a&gt;\". The semi-drunk crew was easily defeated, with several members killed. The Flintwills, Joe and some others were tied. While the \"Orca\" left with its spoils, \"Killmonger\"'s &lt;a href=\"Ironpatch\"&gt;Ironpatch&lt;/a&gt; came to deal with the prisoners and immediately executed Adashe. Seeing this, the remaining tied brothers charged at the pirate captain. However, Ironpatch's crew bested the two and the orc killed them. As he noticed Makasa and was about to execute her as well, his attack was parried by Captain &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;. The crew of the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\" had silently sneaked on the \"Killmonger\" and then on the \"Sea King\", fighting against the Bloodsails and releasing the captured Blackwater Raiders. Joe and Makasa immediately joined the fight. Her goal was the orc captain, so she grabbed Adashe's harpoon and threw it at Ironpatch's chest, plunging him into the sea.\nWith the Bloodsails defeated, Makasa offered herself to join Greydon's crew as she now owed him a life debt. Joe approached and told Thorne that it is a custom of her ancestors, so Greydon couldn't refuse. Seeing how he just lost his second and third mate, and how the two fought, Thorne decided to take Joe as his second and Makasa as his third. Joe, however, aware he just failed his own captain, instead proposed him to take Makasa as the second mate and himself as the third. Captain Greydon agreed. As she boarded the \"Wavestrider\", her life as a pirate was over, as were the lives of her brothers who were sunk into sea. Greydon invited her to tell him about her life and Makasa came to knew the love of a father. Greydon promised her that he would not use the life debt she now owed him. Makasa remained with the crew, traveling aboard the Wavestrider for the next two years.\nMore than a year later, the \"Wavestrider\" crew arrived to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Durgan%20One-God\"&gt;Durgan One-God&lt;/a&gt; took her to see &lt;a href=\"Thunderdrome\"&gt;Thunderdrome&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the crew stopped in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in order to board Greydon's son, &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;. The two didn't become friends at that time nor during the next six months. Despite this, she kept a constant watch over him, with various orders and teases. They had an ongoing joke about not putting her in his sketchbook. Makasa and Aram were the only ones not having a contract on the ship. As the second mate, she was often seen near Greydon in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Flayers%27%20Point\"&gt;Flayers' Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nMakasa has been waking Aram up and after six months their relationship would change drastically. The \"Wavestrider\" was betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Cobb\"&gt;Jonas Cobb&lt;/a&gt; and got into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;. During the fight, Greydon called for the life-debt - to protect Aram as he released both of them out of the \"Wavestrider\". Rowing the boat they managed to land in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; and Aram convinced her to go to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. She maintained her role as a guardian, providing him forest's food. They were soon joined by the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; (much to her disdain) and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt;. After Murky was caught by the Hidden, Aram's group stumbled upon a group of &lt;a href=\"Gordunni%20clan\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Wordok\"&gt;Wordok&lt;/a&gt;. She managed to kill three of his ogres - &lt;a href=\"Kerskull\"&gt;Kerskull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bordok\"&gt;Bordok&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kronk\"&gt;Kronk&lt;/a&gt; - but was forced to jump into a nearby river. She followed their trail and caught up with them. She refrained from attacking the ogres directly but imagined killing Wordok with satisfaction. She followed them into &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; where she watched the events unfold, trying to get Thalyss' attention. She was eventually reunited with Aram and the druid when the Hidden entered the city and Malus challenged &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;. As the chaos erupted Makasa rushed to save Murky from being torn apart by Wordok. She stabbed the ogre and was in turn embraced by the murloc. She noticed that Wordok stood up and began to approach them but was soon stopped and killed by the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe ultimately left the ruined city on the &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"One-Eye\"&gt;One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; with Aram, Thalyss, Murky, and Hackle. Thalyss was injured and succumbed to his wounds atop &lt;a href=\"Skypeak\"&gt;Skypeak&lt;/a&gt;. Thalyss made her promise to help Aram in his quest, which she now gladly confirmed to do. After he died, she removed two arrows from his back. Upon burying the elf and witnessing Aram's revelation about a voice of light, the group resolved to continue to Gadgetzan.\nThe relationship between the two youngsters improved as Aram realized that Makasa considered Greydon a father. The two started treating themselves as siblings. At this point, they have been in Feralas for close to a month. The day after Thalyss died, she asked Aram to sketch her.\nSpeculation.\nHer brothers were killed by &lt;a href=\"Ironpatch\"&gt;Ironpatch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, but the first book says that there was no possibility of saving them from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. It could be speculated that she blames the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; because Ironpatch was an orc. Alternatively, it could be an oversight and a mistake."}
