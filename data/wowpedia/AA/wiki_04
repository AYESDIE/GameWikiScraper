Bring 5 of the Corrupted &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; Samples you find to &lt;a href=\"Chemist%20Fuely\"&gt;Chemist Fuely&lt;/a&gt;. \nDescription.\nFelwood is a forest far north of the Barrens, even farther than Ashenvale. There, slimes are found all around pools of water blessed by the touch of Fel. The Scourge decimated the area with attacks of Infernals and other demonic magics\u2014the slimes supposedly crept up through the earth during these attacks.\nGather samples of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; slimes and we will use the testing equipment next to me to create a control group for our tests against other samples you gather. \nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nI will need at least five corrupted samples for our control group, &lt;name&gt;. Continue to gather &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; slime samples until you're able to give me that which we'll need. The Lady Sylvanas decrees it... \nCompletion.\nAh, excellent. These samples will do nicely. I thank you for your help.\nOnce we've gathered all the samples of slimes, we'll be able to determine more. I am beginning to suspect that Lady Sylvanas' hunch was not only correct, but more insightful than even she could have predicted. These samples are very interesting. Just seeing how they've reacted with my compounds... hmm, yes, we'll definitely need to investigate further.\nNotes.\nKill any of the various &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt;s in Felwood. Each one will drop a &lt;a href=\"Felwood%20Slime%20Sample\"&gt;Felwood Slime Sample&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen, return to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, and use the &lt;a href=\"Testing%20Equipment\"&gt;Testing Equipment&lt;/a&gt; (via the repeatable quest &lt;a href=\"Testing%20for%20Corruption%20-%20Felwood\"&gt;Testing for Corruption - Felwood&lt;/a&gt;) on each sample. This turns each Felwood Slime Sample into a &lt;a href=\"Corrupt%20Tested%20Sample\"&gt;Corrupt Tested Sample&lt;/a&gt;. Open all the tested samples, which will hopefully give at least 5 &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Felwood%20Sample\"&gt;Corrupted Felwood Sample&lt;/a&gt;s for this quest.\nIt is recommended to get at least 20 Felwood Slime Samples, and to test them all before turning in this quest. Not every one will result in the required quest item (rate is about 30%), but each will at least contain some junk to sell, or useful consumables, and cannot be tested once this quest is complete."}

He appears in the and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; as High Abbot Landgren, before dying, being resurrected and finally promoted to Archbishop Landgren in &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Harbor\"&gt;Onslaught Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLandgren originally served as high abbot of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in the . After getting the idea to create a new splinter faction of the Crusade, &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; prayed to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; alongside Landgren for guidance on what the force should be called. The &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, posing as the voice of the Light, told them to name it the \"&lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;\". During the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attack on the Enclave, Landgren and Abbendis were at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Hold\"&gt;Scarlet Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt;, fending off upset &lt;a href=\"Citizen%20of%20Havenshire\"&gt;Citizens of Havenshire&lt;/a&gt;, before \"the Light\" sent the both of them a vision of the Enclave's destruction, urging them to leave for &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; with the newly-formed Scarlet Onslaught and abandon the rest of the Crusade to their fate.\nAfter the Onslaught made landfall in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, one month into the construction of &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen\"&gt;New Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, Landgren proclaimed that the Light was going to send the Onslaught a visitor to lead them to victory. Shortly after, Mal'Ganis arrived in the guise of &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Admiral Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;, whom Landgren and &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Street\"&gt;Bishop Street&lt;/a&gt; took to with great zeal. The admiral passed on \"a new blessing\" from the Light to Landgren, leading to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"raven%20priest\"&gt;raven priest&lt;/a&gt;s. Landgren added this new \"blessing\" to the ends of Onslaught prayer books.\nIn order to find out more about the Onslaught, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Skully\"&gt;Agent Skully&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s disguise themselves as a raven priest and then speak with Landgren in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen%20abbey\"&gt;New Hearthglen abbey&lt;/a&gt; after luring away his &lt;a href=\"Devout%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Devout Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;s by ringing the &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20Bell%20Rope\"&gt;abbey bell&lt;/a&gt;. Landgren agreed to speak in private and brought the adventurers to the cliffs above &lt;a href=\"Crusader%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Crusader's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, where he revealed that he could see through their disguise and that \"the Master\" had warned him that the adventurers would come for him. Instead of allowing himself to be killed, Landgren then committed suicide by jumping off the cliff, in the hopes that Admiral Westwind would allow him to return.\nLandgren was later resurrected, promoted to archbishop, and put in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Cathedral\"&gt;Crimson Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Harbor\"&gt;Onslaught Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.

After being tortured, Landgren revealed that Westwind was hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Hollow\"&gt;Hidden Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "14802", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14802", "title": "Language", "text": "A language is a lexicon of words that various characters use to speak to each other and communicate. In \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", most &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s have a unique language they speak that only they can understand. Each &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; shares a common language of the dominant race (&lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;).\nA language may or may not have an associated alphabet for writing. Several languages may share the same alphabet, or may have a specific alphabet used only for that language.\nLorewise, there are at least 39 languages on Azeroth and hundreds more throughout the cosmos.\nIt should be noted that traditionally (in the &lt;a href=\"Real-time%20strategy\"&gt;RTS&lt;/a&gt; games and the pen &amp; paper &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;) almost all intelligent races speak Common. The ability for &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s to learn additional languages was planned early in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" but was not developed, likely due to the tendency of cross-faction communication to be insulting and profane. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; were originally able to speak Common and thus communicate with Alliance players, but this was removed with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Gutterspeak\"&gt;Gutterspeak&lt;/a&gt; due to, once again, the tendency of cross-faction communication to be insulting and profane. For a long time, it seemed unlikely that this functionality would ever be added. When the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; joined the Horde and the Alliance, players could speak the same language, but not understand those of the opposite faction. With the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, however, who all speak &lt;a href=\"Demonic\"&gt;Demonic&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance and Horde cross-faction communication was reintroduced to the game. At the same time, the language barrier that had come between Horde and Alliance pandaren was lifted. With the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; speaking &lt;a href=\"void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; joining the Alliance, yet another channel for cross-faction communication was opened. Cross-faction communication is restricted to &lt;a href=\"say\"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"yell\"&gt;yell&lt;/a&gt;, and players will not be able to understand custom &lt;a href=\"emote\"&gt;emote&lt;/a&gt;s from players of the opposite faction.\nAlliance languages.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s primary language is &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde languages.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s primary language is &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\nChanging chat language.\nThe language a player's character speaks, for those with more than one, can be changed by going into the &lt;a href=\"chat\"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; menu. Clicking on the \"Chat Bubble\" on the chat box toolbar, then highlighting \"Language\" with the cursor, will make a list of known languages to appear. From there, the player can click one to choose which language they prefer to speak.\nIt may be worth mentioning that when the language is changed, it only affects &lt;a href=\"say\"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yell\"&gt;yell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; chat. General and &lt;a href=\"whisper\"&gt;whisper&lt;/a&gt;s will be unaffected. Also, it tends to irritate a player's guild when they speak their \"native\" language.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0\"&gt;patch 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, it seems the &lt;a href=\"LanguageID\"&gt;scripting ability&lt;/a&gt; to speak other languages has been modified to check whether the character can normally speak that language.\nOrigins.\nAs with many other features of the Warcraft setting, many of the languages are derived from early fantasy or the role-playing game \u2014 not in the sense of the actual languages, but in what kinds of languages are present in a given world. This connection is mostly obvious from the shared culture and parallels or outright duplication of language names, primarily on the outer reaches of Warcraft lore that appear in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 which started out as an offshoot of Dungeons and Dragons.\nEuropean realms and real-world languages.\nEuropean &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;s are each associated with a real-world language such as English or French. In &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, players are grouped only with players of the same language. However, Alliance players in a battleground may speak a different language than Horde players. In that case, even being able to translate between Common and Orcish would leave another barrier for many players."}

Although he initially thought that the clan should die out due to the Blade's repeated notions of demon worship and treason, by the end of the festival he has changed his tune slightly to find some worth in the remaining members of the clan. Namely referring to &lt;a href=\"Arnak%20Fireblade\"&gt;Arnak Fireblade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mordak%20Darkfist\"&gt;Mordak Darkfist&lt;/a&gt;; Lantresor noted that while they may be warlocks, they are his kin.\nHistory.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nA &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and half-&lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; descent, Lantresor of the Blade was amongst the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces that invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where he would serve under both &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; before returning to home. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, he ruled over the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; after the previous ruler &lt;a href=\"Krol\"&gt;Krol&lt;/a&gt; went missing. The Boulderfist found themselves losing ground against the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn spurred them with taking over territory such as the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Ruins\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; that belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;. They also planned for an assault on &lt;a href=\"Telaar\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn time &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mo%27mor%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Mo'mor the Breaker&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers of the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; against the Boulderfist before sending them on a diplomatic mission to peacefully end the attacks on their holdings by speaking with Lantresor. After a short conversation the blademaster and the envoy came to an agreement to help one another. Thus at Lantresor' direction, the envoy attacked the &lt;a href=\"Kil%27sorrow%20clan\"&gt;Kil'sorrow clan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kil%27sorrow%20Fortress\"&gt;Kil'sorrow Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and planted Warmaul banners, framing the ogres as the attackers, while also having them strike at the Warmaul and plant Kil'sorrow banners framing the orcs for the attack.\nWith the Warmaul and Kil'sorrow now locked in conflict against one another, Lantresor declared that the envoy had saved his clan from extermination. He subsequently sent the envoy back to their people, with the message that \"Lantresor of the Burning Blade and his Boulderfist ogres accept the offering of peace.\"\nDragonflight.\nLantresor was one of the many who attended the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; held at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. He noted how the orcs had a decent home for themselves and reflected that there was even room for &lt;a href=\"Half-breed\"&gt;half-breeds&lt;/a&gt; at this new Kosh'harg, citing the presence of &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;. He then expressed his hope that &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was rolling in his grave. Meanwhile, his presence was noted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; Horde loyalists &lt;a href=\"Arnak%20Fireblade\"&gt;Arnak Fireblade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mordak%20Darkfist\"&gt;Mordak Darkfist&lt;/a&gt; who had come to represent the clan at the festival. The two were in awe, noting how he was a legend amongst their clan, and feeling intimidated inquired into orc champions introducing them to him. \nLantresor, by virtue of being the oldest surviving blademaster, has assumed leadership of the clan. Unfortunately, his views of the clan are poor; noting its repeated inclination to mayhem, treason, and demon worship, refusing away new applicants to the clan when orcs are speaking to the various chieftains. He expressed that the Burning Blade didn't deserve their loyalty and that the clan was accursed and should wither and die.\nBy the end of the festival, Arnak and Mordak were joined by Lantresor at their clan table. For his part, Lantresor has changed his tune slightly. He made note that the two were not blademasters, but warlocks, but did not express any hostility towards them; instead taking note that they may very well be the last kin he has left.\nQuests.\nHorde must first complete the chain that starts with &lt;a href=\"The%20Impotent%20Leader\"&gt;The Impotent Leader&lt;/a&gt; to get Lantresor's first quest."}

He had a talisman which allowed him to communicate with &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, which he later gave to Vereesa, in order to be guided by the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;.

He participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; with other hill dwarves alongside four of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and also &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; when he arrived to take advantage of the situation.\nNight of the Dragon.\nYears later, he was sent some time during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to discover what was going on at Grim Batol. As a veteran of the Battle of Grim Batol and his command experience, he was the perfect choice. Accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Grenda\"&gt;Grenda&lt;/a&gt; and many others, they captured a &lt;a href=\"skardyn\"&gt;skardyn&lt;/a&gt; and began interrogating him about the Grim Batol. The dwarven group was attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s and fled.\nRom and his warriors would be later be encountered by his old comrade Vereesa, who would learn of Rom's encounter and demand details of what the blood elf looked like. While Rom found nothing truly distinctive to him the details he revealed allowed Vereesa to know that the blood elf they encountered was her cousin, Zendarin who she hunting for going after her children to drain them of their magic to increase his own. Soon after Rom and his companions would come into the contact of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt;, who would surprise Rom and Vereesa by revealing that she knew &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the trio, the others carrying out their duties, Rom was questioned by Vereesa about why he looked older than he should, to which he confided to her and Iridi that it was due to the evil inside Grim Batol. Veterans like himself had aged quicker and a good many had died before their time. Later Rom and everyone would come under attack by &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and Rom would vanish in the struggle. Thought dead, Grenda would assume command of the dwarven forces and along with Vereesa were captured by the &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rask\"&gt;Rask&lt;/a&gt;.\nWounded with a broken arm Rom venture from the caverns of Grim Batol he had fallen into and eventually reunite with Iridi, after saving her from a group of skardyn. Surprised to learn that &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; had arrived and convinced by Iridi that freeing &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; would beneficial, the duo moved forward and were successfully in their task. Further emphasizing their victory was that once freed Zzeraku attacked &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. As the two dragons continued their battle Rom wanting to do knowing nothing more but led Iridi and his people out of Grim Batol, and directed Grenda to led the others out of one of the passages. To Rom's surprise Grenda then pointed past him which Rom to dodge an attack by Rash. Ordering Iridi to reach Rhonin and knowing Grenda would follow his previous orders, Rom engaged in combat with Rask. During the fierce fight Rask would deliver Rom a fatal blow but rather than give into death the dwarf pushed forward and using his remaining strength severed Rask's head from his body. His enemy slain Rom would fall soon after into death, where he would be greeted by his old friend &lt;a href=\"Gimmel\"&gt;Gimmel&lt;/a&gt; and the other dwarves claimed by Grim Batol welcomed their old comrade before vanishing to the great halls of the afterlife."}

These are combined into packages which are in turn hierarchically combined with other pledge packages for &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s and rewards. \nAll of the Love is in the Air token gifts are non-functional as regards their name and picture. You cannot read a Romantic Poem item.\nSource.\nRomantic Poem is the one and only token gift items that can be found inside a or a , given by Undercity non-guards NPCs as part of the Love is in the Air event. (The Gift of Friendship contains only the token gift; the Gift of Adoration contains other functional gifts as well.) \nYou will need one free inventory slot or a current stack of less than 20 Romantic Poems in order to remove a Romantic Poem from its container. To remove the Romantic Poem from its container, right click the Gift of Adoration or Gift of Friendship to open it. \nIngredient.\nIf you have five or more Romantic Poems in your inventory, right clicking on any of them will consume five and create a &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Romantic%20Poems\"&gt;Book of Romantic Poems&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nInventory space.\nThe Gift of Adoration: Undercity and Gift of Friendship: Undercity container items do not stack. Opening your Gifts of Friendship: Undercity should save inventory space, since the Romantic Poem token gifts stack 20 high. It is generally useful to NOT &lt;a href=\"autoloot\"&gt;autoloot&lt;/a&gt; a Gift of Adoration container - the Love is in the Air event items quickly consume any available inventory space. If you have autoloot turned on, you can hold down the shift key while right clicking the Gift of Adoration to not autoloot it. You can then remove only the items that you need at the moment. \nBe careful when combining these into packages, the Romantic Poem token gift item stacks 20 high, but the Book of Romantic Poems package item does not stack at all.\nUndercity non-guard NPCs.\nFor the Love is in the Air gift items given by non-guard NPCs, the race of the NPC, not the location, determines which city's gift item you get. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; NPCs give Undercity gifts regardless of which of the participating cities they are in. \nThe &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;s, though they are non-guards and have hearts over their heads, do not give gifts.\nTransferability.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item.

It is an homage to .\"\nThe two of them can be found backstage in &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;Return to Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nFighting Romulo and Julianne is a very intensive fight. In phase one, the raid fights Julianne, who primarily casts spells, in phase two the raid fights Romulo, who only does melee, and in phase three the raid fights them both. \nPhase One.\nIn phase one, you will fight Julianne. She is a caster and should be interrupted as much as possible to conserve mana. The interrupters should focus on Eternal Affection, which heals herself for a lot of health. Interrupting the other spells, however, is good for conserving healer mana. She is immune to &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt;, but not to other interrupting abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Shear\"&gt;Wind Shear&lt;/a&gt;. \nDispelling her Devotion buff should be prioritized, however, since it increases her DPS a lot. It is a magic buff and can be removed with &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Devour%20Magic\"&gt;Devour Magic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Felhunter\"&gt;Felhunter&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Purge\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Slam\"&gt;Shield Slam&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;).\n\"Note: She is immune to (&lt;a href=\"Warlocks\"&gt;Warlocks&lt;/a&gt;') &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Tongues\"&gt;Curse of Tongues&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIt is helpful to have her die in a corner separate from Romulo, to make it easier to pick her up in phase three.\nPhase Two.\nDuring phase two, the raid fights Romulo. He is a warrior-type boss, has approximately 190,000 health, and hits quite hard. Like Julianne, his buff should be removed with the aforementioned spells, because it greatly increases his DPS. \nHe should be tanked with his back turned to the wall, so that the melee DPS will not get knocked back too far by his Backward Lunge. \nIt is possible to &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; Romulo, and though it should be done as much as possible (especially if you don't have someone to dispel it), it is best to do it when he gains Daring to compensate for his higher DPS in that stage. Like Julianne, he should die in a corner.\nPhase Three.\nMany players believe Phase three is the true event, because you now fight Romulo and Julianne at the same time. The tactics of Phase One and Phase Two still apply. However, since the raid now has less mana and is engaging both bosses at the same time, it is harder. \nThe raid splits up into two groups; one group focuses on Romulo and one group focuses on Julianne. The Romulo group is generally ranged (due to his melee abilities) with a warrior tank (for disarm) and the Julianne group is melee and interrupters.\nThe two bosses \"must\" die within 10 seconds of each other, or the dead boss resurrects with full health, just like the &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20pack\"&gt;core hounds&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. The damage-dealers may need to switch between targets to ensure that they die at the same time.\nMiscellaneous.\n /cast [target=Romulo] Dispel Magic\n /cast [target=Julianne] Purge"}

The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt; faced Ronokon's army alone, ferociously thinning their ranks until the pit lord himself, enraged by Ashamane's intereference, was forced to step forth and personally deal with her.\nThe Wild God and the annihilan dueled in the forests of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; for hours. Ronokon was a cunning fighter and knew how fast Ashamane could kill, so he kept his opponent at bay with his jagged, &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-wrought spear, content to inflict small, grazing wounds. After so much war, Ashamane's strength was beginning to fade, but her will was still unbroken. With the last of her strength, she leapt at Ronokon. The pit lord managed to drive his spear through her chest, but her claws dug into his shoulders and her fangs sank deep within his neck. The annihilan thrashed madly in an attempt to pull the Wild God away, but she held on and her teeth remained embedded in his throat until he died in a violent explosion that tore a deep gash in the land and burned Ashamane to ash.\nThrough Ashamane's sacrifice, she had given Suramar's residents enough time to shield their city from the Legion and protect themselves from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; that would follow. The site of the battle between Ronokon and Ashamane had been altered forever, and where there had once been a hill, now there was a cliff and a deep valley. It took many years for the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to restore the area to its former beauty, but despite the lingering traces of Ronokon's corruption, there was always a sense that something was opposing it and helping to sweep it away. Some druids came to believe that Ashamane's spirit lingered in the area, still committed to defending her wilds from the invaders who had threatened it. The druids later built a shrine at the site of Ronokon's death to honor Ashamane's sacrifice, and upon which they placed her &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20Ashamane\"&gt;fangs&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 all that remained after her violent death."}

Based in the Ravencrest ancestral seat of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the Rooksguard acted as a personal army to the masters of the hold.\nThe force has likely been in existence since the first members of House Ravencrest began carving out the fortress that would become Black Rook Hold, and since then have taken an active role in both the hold's and family's protection. This notably included the defense of Black Rook Hold when it was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Outside this, the Rooksguard also fought as part of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; throughout the same war to thwart the Legion's invasion.\nHistory.\nThe Kaldorei Empire.\nBased upon a rigid class system where the aristocracy ruled, the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; hosted a large number of noble lord and ladies, as well as princes and princesses, who each held great power among &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; society. The &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ravencrest\"&gt;House of Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, one such noble house, based itself east of the capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; in a great fortress carved out over numerous generations, thousands of year ago. Named &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, this is presumably where the force who guarded it, the Rooksguard, obtained their name. The Rooksguard were notable as a well-trained force that heeded the command of the master of Black Rook Hold and the House of Ravencrest, which were forever intertwined.\nIt is unclear whether, prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the Rooksguard took an active part in the Kaldorei Empire's wars, or if they were simply charged with manning and protecting Black Rook Hold. If they did accompany members of House Ravencrest to battle, which is entirely possible, then they may have taken part in many of the defining conflicts of the time, such as the night elves' prolonged wars with the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes to the south.\nDemonic invasion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; broke out, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began their first invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and began laying waste to much of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Before long, &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;a resistance&lt;/a&gt; was established to oppose the demons, and was headed by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, lord of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; and leader of the Rooksguard. As such, the Rooksguard would have accompanied Lord Ravencrest during many of the ensuing battles, with all of the remaining kaldorei military might being mustered to this end, even including the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe role of the Rooksguard became most notable when the Resistance forces were finally pushed back to Black Rook Hold itself. Despite the overwhelming power and numbers of the Legion Lord Ravencrest, the Rooksguard, and several other important figures prepared to defend the fortress, hoping to buy time for the evacuation of nearby &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. In the following battle, the Rooksguard put up a stalwart defense against the demons, but suffered extremely heavy casualties in the process, with more than half being outright slain during the fighting. Despite this, and with the aid of the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the Burning Legion was driven temporarily from the hold.\nAs the war progressed, the Kaldorei Resistance continued to be forced back, having to abandon Black Rook Hold, before eventually turning the tide against the demons and advancing towards &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; again. During one battle with the Legion, however, Lord Kur'talos was assassinated, stabbed from behind, by an agent of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, who ordered his death. Ravencrest's death dealt a grave blow to the resistance, and he was succeeded by the less-skilled noble &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt;. Without a leader, it is likely that the Rooksguard simply remained a part of the resistance army until the war's conclusion.\nAfter the end of the War of the Ancients and after &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was shattered in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; that followed, the kaldorei found themselves isolated on a new continent, where they went about founding &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20%28faction%29\"&gt;a new nation&lt;/a&gt; and society. With the House of Ravencrest as a faction no longer in existence (though &lt;a href=\"Illysanna%20Ravencrest\"&gt;some family members&lt;/a&gt; remained alive) it is likely that whatever remained of the Rooksguard disbanded.\nLegion.\nThousands of years following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; once more, beginning its &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; on the world. Although thought to have been lost along with much of the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; had in fact survived the Sundering and remained intact on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the demons' arrival, an orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; loyal to the Legion known as performed a ritual within the Hold which, as an added effect, raised all the spirits of those who had once defended and lived there, including that of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; himself and his Rooksguard. Made to see the Legion's enemies as demons, the spirits were trapped believing that the War of the Ancients was still ongoing, forever reliving its horrors.\nEventually, a force of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; ventured deep into Black Rook Hold itself, defeating large numbers of its undead Rooksguard defenders. They ultimately reached Lord Ravencrest himself who finally saw through the demons' illusions during the battle, and used the power of his ancestors to help the champions break the Legion's influence on the fortress. With this achieved, the Burning Legion's spell over the Hold's spirits was broken--temporarily.\nEventually, more undead soldiers begin to appear from Black Rook Hold. &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; discovers that this assault is led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Erdris%20Thorn\"&gt;Lord Erdris Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, who was a key commander of Lord Ravencrest's forces and who was actually risen later than the soldiers that had come from the hold so far.

{"id": "13082", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13082", "title": "Root", "text": "Root effects are a form of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; which cause the victim to be locked in place, unable to move. Root effects are sometimes known as immobilize effects in-game. A root effect differs from a &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt; effect in that the target is still able to use &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; attacks, but cannot move from its location as long as the effect is active.\nMany root effects are subject to &lt;a href=\"diminishing%20return\"&gt;diminishing return&lt;/a&gt;s. Roots are movement impairing effects, and so can be countered with effects such as &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Hand of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nRoots are primarily used to prevent targets from escaping; or to prevent targets from dealing melee damage by keeping them out of melee range. Roots therefore tend to be of little use between two ranged types, or between two melee types. Roots are generally far more important and powerful abilities in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, where their proper use can be critical. The most common use of roots in &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; is to prevent enemies from fleeing when their health gets low, preventing them from aggroing other mobs.\nRoots are useful to melee classes such as &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s seeking to get close to ranged classes such as &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s; and useful to ranged classes such as mages seeking to evade melee classes such as warriors. Since melee damage depends on being in close proximity to the target, the proper use of roots (along with &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;s and similar effects) can make the difference between victory and defeat. Roots and snares are critical for &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt;, a technique primarily employed by mages and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s to keep melee enemies out of effective range while the player continues to deal damage to them.\nMore specific uses of roots include preventing enemy players from moving out of &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt;, where they could hide from attacks, heal or drink; preventing a healer from moving into casting range of an ally in need of healing; and slowing the progress of flag carriers in &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNote that if a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; with no ranged attacks is rooted from range, it will be unable to attack its current &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; target. However, if players are standing in melee range, it will attack the player that has the highest &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; level. Thus, it is not wise to stand near a rooted mob, or root one within a crowd of players without prior warning.\nAbilities.\nThe following are some examples of abilities and procs that can root targets:\nCounters.\nItems which can dispel root effects:\nSome examples of class and race abilities which can dispel root effects:"}

Leading a large strikeforce of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; troops, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lord Lothar&lt;/a&gt; was sent to attempt a parlay with the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. No reports have been heard in days... Assuming the worst, Admiral Proudmoore and &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; agree that it falls upon you to stage a final siege upon Blackrock Spire. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;feral Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt; wildlands have offered the service of their &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20rider\"&gt;Gryphon Riders&lt;/a&gt; to assist in the decimation of the foul Orcs that have desecrated their homeland and slain the leader of the Alliance forces.\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the Horde in his search for the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, he took half of Doomhammer's standing forces with him. This robbed the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of his chance to destroy &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with it, and forced him to spend time chasing down the traitors. Ultimately, the orcs, now disorganized and at half strength, had to abandon their campaign in the &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;Northlands&lt;/a&gt; right on the eve of their final victory. This gave the Alliance time to regroup, and launch an offensive of their own. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, they managed to retake much of southern &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the orcs to withdraw to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, their headquarters.\nDeath of Lothar.\nThe Alliance would have to pass through the Spire in order to retake the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and Doomhammer was unwilling to retreat any further. The stage was set for the one of the final battles between the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a desperate attempt to break the siege, Doomhammer personally led a charge out of the mountain to engage Lothar directly. The two squared off in a titanic battle. The duel raged for hours and left both combatants battered and bloody, but in the end, Doomhammer's youth and natural Orcish strength gave him the edge. He cut down Lothar and then retreated back into the Spire, leaving behind a handful of human survivors, including the paladin &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, who would since be haunted by survivor's guilt.\nDoomhammer had hoped that the loss of their charismatic leader would cause the Alliance to splinter, but the plan quickly backfired on him. When the rest of the Alliance received no word from the group many travelled to Blackrock Spire to destroy the orcs. Enraged over the loss of their leader, the Alliance launched a full-scale assault on the mountain and surrounding region.\nStrategy guide account.\nLothar's intent during the parley was to accept the unconditional surrender of the Horde. Unfortunately, Doomhammer wanted to fight till the end. When Lothar and his troops arrived near Blackrock Spire, they were ambushed by a huge group of trolls and ogre magi. Lothar fought with courage, but his forces were outnumbered.\nMilan's unit arrived later and found only workers and injured soldiers hiding in the few structures they had managed to defend upon their arrival on the northern shores of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The town had been sacked once already, which meant that Lord Lothar was likely dead already. With the survivors describing the landing of enemy &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s, the Alliance reinforcements decided to cripple their navy before concentrating on a major land assault. They immediately boarded their own few warships and, escorted by a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;, set out westward to follow the trail of the transports.\nTwo enemy &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; were sunk before turning north, and near the mainland they spotted an &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt; being built. Not wanting to let them collect &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, they waited for the slower &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; and planned an attack. Two enemy &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s waited to the southeast, while a &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt; on land was judged able to strike targets only on the west side of the platform. First, the Alliance commander sent their gryphon to chase and sink the juggernaughts, while the warships sailed to the east side of the platform to begin demolition. By the time the gryphon had done its work, the platform fell and was replaced with a &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; to prevent rebuilding. They completed the task, they then sent the battleship and gryphon north to strike the landed transports, and thus prevented the orcs under the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;orange standard&lt;/a&gt; from using them ever again.\nNext on the list was the oil production of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;red standard&lt;/a&gt; orcs, and for that Milan's forces sailed directly into the harbor toward another newly built platform, and again sent the gryphon to remove a catapult from the southeast shoreline near it. Then, while the ships pounded the platform, the gryphon started firing on the landed transports north of it to prevent them from making any deliveries. Next went the cannon tower west of the enemy shipyard, and by then the platform had been removed and replaced by a destroyer. Waiting until the tower was out of the way, the battleship then went to work on the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, and its destruction ended their attacks by sea.\nA third and final threat to Milan's base was the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20roost\"&gt;dragon roost&lt;/a&gt; on the central island, but it required a bit more effort. While the Orcish navy was being neutralized, Milan's workers built a few &lt;a href=\"guard%20tower\"&gt;guard tower&lt;/a&gt;s for minimal defense, then concentrated on all the structures and upgrades required to launch more gryphons into the air. They also built a &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; to produce more battleships, but their &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; was starting to run dry.\nTo solve the problem temporarily, a single transport was launched to ferry some workers east. There, the workers built a secondary &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; on a small island with another mine. This extra income allowed them to assemble a flotilla of four battleships, four destroyers, and three transports with which to land a mixed force of rangers and knights on the central island.\nFirst, the warships removed as many enemy towers as possible, with the destroyers concentrating on any dragons that threatened. The land units came ashore on the north side and quickly swept into the village, slaughtering the defenders and finishing towers before removing the rest of the foul structures. More workers were ferried in, and a third hall was set up to plunder the rich mine there. From this point, the Horde was defenseless against the mobs of gryphons they launched from four &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;aviaries&lt;/a&gt;. Standard landing parties of knights and ballistae made slow but steady work of anything remotely orcish, while gryphons circled overhead.\nThe entire combined Alliance forces were determined to avenge Lothar, and the soldiers knew that if they destroyed Blackrock Spire, the war would be won. The battle lasted for days. Thousands on both sides died. Dwarves, elves, humans, and gnomes had battled with orcs, ogres, trolls, goblins and daemons around the slopes, neither side giving ground.\nNovel account.\nIn the midst of the battle, Turalyon rallied the Alliance forces with the battlecry \"For Sir Lothar!\" and led a fierce charge into the Horde. The piercing cry finally put fear into even the orcs and daemons amidst the height of their bloodlust and their ranks crumbled to the frenzied knights and rangers. Doomhammer was defeated, captured, and dragged in chains to Lordaeron by Turalyon himself. The Horde was broken by this battle and continued to be hounded all the way by the vengeful knights of the Alliance. Soon after, most of their allies abandoned them, and they were forced to make a retreat into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nSoon after the battle a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Hovel\"&gt;great statue&lt;/a&gt; of Lord Lothar was erected at the base of Blackrock Spire. It still stands, despite being surrounded by a camp of orcs, and Lothar still points his sword defiantly at the Mountain's peak. The orc survivors of the battle were rounded up and placed in the first of the Alliance &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; that would soon house the majority of their race. Orgrim Doomhammer eventually escaped captivity to wander through the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battle, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Commander Mograine&lt;/a&gt; took a dark crystal from the body of an orc spellcaster he had killed. The shadow energy was so overwhelming that it mangled Mograine's right hand. He kept the crystal locked away for over a decade until finally revealing it to friends in the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; at a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. This crystal \u2014 absorbing the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; energies from the paladins and priests present \u2014 became the basis for a weapon intended solely to the destruction of the undead, better known as the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetcon.\nIn the actual gameplay of \"Warcraft II\", when the mission starts, the player immediately sees Lothar torn apart by a mass of ogres and troll axethrowers along with a few other knights. There is no way to save Lothar as he cannot be controlled, though a very skilled player may be able to save the knights. In later sources, including the , the battle was changed to say that Lothar and Doomhammer duelled together.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, this new force successfully threw back the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' assault on Dalaran and secured a foothold on the Broken Shore itself.\nBased from the position of &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt;, the Armies of Legionfall quickly set about engaging the Legion throughout the Broken Shore, securing further gains against &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. The mortals' primary goal remains the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the focal point of the Burning Legion's invasion, where they seek to sever the Legion's link the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWrath of the Deceiver.\nThe outcome of the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; saw the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the death of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; , and the failure of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s plans in the region. The recovery of the final &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillar of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, also marked a new milestone in the fight against the Legion's invasion as a whole.\nWith all the ancient artifacts in hand, the portal facilitating the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' assault on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; could finally be sealed shut permanently, ending the immediate threat to the world. This portal, however, was located at the very center of the Legion's presence on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. A meeting was subsequently called by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to plan for the impending assault, with representatives from all of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;Class Order&lt;/a&gt;s in attendance.\n on &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar outlined to those gathered the importance of striking against the Legion immediately, now that all the Pillars of Creation were in their possession. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; went on to preach caution and vigilance to those gathered; yet unbeknownst to even Velen, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; himself was observing the gathering from the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Infuriated on seeing his former friend, Kil'jaeden ordered a massive attack on Dalaran itself, after communing with his master &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;s began bearing down on Dalaran, the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; were quickly mobilized to deal with the threat. Along with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and forces from the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;Class Order&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Order Hall champions&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded an assault on the demons on and above the nearby &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitial assault.\nImmediately, forces from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; counterattacked the Legion demonic vessels, beginning a series of heated battles on the ships' decks. Meanwhile, another force sent from Dalaran struck out toward the Broken Shore itself, clashing with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on the coastline along the southern coastline, and quickly carving a path through the demons inland.\nAfter closing numerous portals and defeating Legion reinforcements, the mortal champions used a large portal created by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to the demon command ship hovering near the battlefield.\nHaving planted explosives around the vessel, the invaders then confronted the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; commanding the Legion's forces, &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;. Although he was not slain, Mephistroth retreated from the battle following the fight, leaving the ship in the mortals' hands. Shortly thereafter, the explosives were detonated and the ship was annihilated. The attack on Dalaran subsequently ground to a halt, while the Armies of Legionfall exploited their victory by establishing a permanent base on the Broken Shore, in the form of &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe conflict continues.\nSoon, the Armies of Legionfall began operating from several other locations throughout the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Point\"&gt;Vengeance Point&lt;/a&gt; to the north and &lt;a href=\"Aalgen%20Point\"&gt;Aalgen Point&lt;/a&gt; in the east. The garrison of &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s at Vengeance Point, in particular, came under heavy attack from demonic forces, which attempted to overwhelm the outpost. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt;s ultimately succeeding in stemming this tide early in the conflict.\nWith a base established, the Armies of Legionfall rapidly set about constructing various other important structures at Deliverance Point which would aid in the fight against the Burning Legion. In particular, the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Tower%20%28Broken%20Shore%29\"&gt;Mage Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Disruptor\"&gt;Nether Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Command%20Center\"&gt;Command Center&lt;/a&gt; became a major focus of the Order Halls, the building of which in turn required a great deal of resources and supplies secured across the region. Even when completed, however, these structures became key targets for demonic attacks and thus rarely remained intact for long.\nAround this time, a sizeable group of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, independent from the majority of the race loyal to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, arrived on the Broken Shore to pledge allegiance to the Burning Legion in exchange for great power. Incidentally, these naga took up residence at &lt;a href=\"Felrage%20Strand\"&gt;Felrage Strand&lt;/a&gt; along the coastline of the Broken Shore, as well as within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; proper. They went on to join in the fight against the Armies of Legionfall, and became a target for the invaders as they attempted to push the Legion from the isles.\nIn response to the incursion into the Broken Shore, the Burning Legion gradually increased its efforts in assaulting the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Large-scale invasions&lt;/a&gt; were launched in all the Isles' regions, with the denizens of each fighting desperately to repel the attacks. Forces engaged on the Broken Shore were subsequently forced to leave occasionally to aid the defeat of these invasions.\nMeanwhile, Legion forces on the Broken Shore (continuously supplied from the Tomb of Sargeras) continued battle with the determined Armies of Legionfall. A great deal of resistance came in the form of the \"&lt;a href=\"Sentinax\"&gt;Sentinax&lt;/a&gt;\", a powerful &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; which patrolled the skies over the Broken Shore, raining fire on those below and opening portals to initiate attacks.\nThe Cathedral of Eternal Night.\nIn keeping with their objective of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, an attack was planned on the fallen temple to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; in order to begin the process of closing the Legion's portal. A large force engaged the majority of the demons guarding the structure, while an elite team of champions aided by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; began to ascend to the upper reaches. They carved a path through the Legion defenders before reaching the summit of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt;. There, the party was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;, still commanding the Legion's defense of the Broken Shore.\nSeeking to return the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; (a Pillar of Creation) to its resting place and thus close the demonic portal, the mortal invaders battled the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to stop them. In the ensuing fight, Mephistroth was slain and an echo of the former &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; appeared and spoke to the champions. She revealed to them what would truly be required to close the Legion's portal; the Pillars of Creation would have to be used in the depths of the Tomb of Sargeras. By placing the Pillars of Creation in the tomb, it would consequently restore Aegwynn's wards and push back against the Burning Legion invaders. Afterwards, the champions must venture into the depths of the tomb and use the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; to eradicate the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; and sever the Legion's link to Azeroth.\nUnbeknownst to the armies of &lt;a href=\"Legionfall\"&gt;Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; and Aegwynn's echo, when re-entered the tomb, he tore down Aegwynn's wards and opened a doorway for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; to invade. Consequently, this allowed the fel army to tear at the vault in hopes of reanimating &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;Fallen Avatar&lt;/a&gt;. The protective wards which were meant to secure the temple now become a hindrance and the champions must now use the Pillars of Creation to unbar their way.\nAfter weeks of a hard-fought battle, Azeroth's heroes, at last, enter the dark &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"%3APillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;:Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to unbar &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;'s protective wards, the band of heroes eventually defeated the remnants of the fel army in the vault and faced &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' own &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, and Azeroth's heroes pursued &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; and vanquished him once and for all. With the death of Kil'jaeden, the Deceiver's command ship began to crash on Argus. Khadgar teleported everyone to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; through a rift Illidan had opened with the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; before the ship exploded. However, after arriving safely on Azeroth, it was revealed Illidan had left a rift from Azeroth to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; open, much to Khadgar's dismay. Horrified, Khadgar asked Illidan what he had done, and Illidan responded that sometimes the hand of fate must be forced.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Eventually, you will enter a big communal hall with 1 or 2 mobs and of course Thule Ravenclaw at level 20. \nFighting Thule.\nThule has a minion that he can resummon, so you will need to fight both him and his minion at the same time.\nThule casts Hex of the Ravenclaw, which reduces your DPS and increases his.

The Horde unit kept the &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; that had brought them close to the shore north of town. With eight workers at their disposal, the shipyard went up near where the destroyer was anchored.\nSoon they had both a shipyard and an &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; on the north shore, with several &lt;a href=\"Oil%20tanker\"&gt;tankers&lt;/a&gt;, gathering &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; from a nearby &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;. Four destroyers were launched to clear the seas, then all five were sent far to the northeast where the enemy platform needed removal. From there, they swept westward to the coastline near Hillsbrad, sinking a &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt; that had managed to make a single delivery of humans to the Horde base. To prevent further annoyances of that sort, the Horde warships made quick work of the Alliance's coast structures, leaving the nearby enemy tower standing so they could watch. The destroyers remained near the shore while the Horde prepared to land their own force.\nWhile a new &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; provided training for six grunts and six trolls, the Horde constructed two transports for them and the lumber mill cut new, nicely balanced throwing axes for the raid. Once the transports had been loaded and delivered to the waiting destroyers, they placed a single warship close enough to shore to pound the Alliance tower. This panicked their soldiers into thinking they could stop them at the shoreline; as they came, the Horde's other warships opened fire. With the coast reasonably clear, the transports landed and released the Horde soldiers to level the town. All the defenders were slaughtered first; then their structures fell like straw huts.\nAftermath.\nAlthough the Horde had successfully left the townships of Hillsbrad and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in ruins their base on &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed and they were driven from the shores of Lordaeron. With the cities decimated rumors spread throughout the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; like wildfire of their impending doom. Although they had lost their base, Doomhammer was pleased with his commander's and &lt;a href=\"Utok%20Scratcher\"&gt;Utok Scratcher&lt;/a&gt;'s success and ordered them into in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; to help defend the outpost in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt;.\nNovel account.\nThe armies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; protected the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; against larger numbers of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; warriors, but despite their resistance the orcs managed to land and spread thousands of their soldiers into Lordaeron.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

With three already recruited, a leader was needed, and the Lich King chose the recently fallen &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; for this honor.\n&lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; initially opposed this order, considering that Tirion deserves more than a life of anguish and undeath, as he was one of the greatest champions &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; has known. He eventually agreed to follow the will of the Deathlord, but warned them that there will be no redemption for what they were about to do, and since the Silver Hand would not give up easily, they would have to launch an attack on &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s arrived at Light's Hope Chapel and waited outside, planning their distraction and invasion. Under the directions of Darion Mograine, the Deathlord went to the tomb behind the chapel where the power of the Light was weak, in order to raise an army of ghouls that will distract the Argent Sentries long enough for them to make their way to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the distraction in place, the Ebon Blade overpowered &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; and made their way through the defenses of the Silver Hand. In the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Hall of Champions&lt;/a&gt;, where Tirion's body rests, the death knights faced &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; who tried to stop them, but was defeated as well. Just as the Deathlord was about to claim Tirion, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; intervened and burned the surrounded death knights. Not wanting to let the Ebon Blade fall, Darion opened a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gate\"&gt;Death Gate&lt;/a&gt; for the others to escape and went through the portal but died from his injuries.\nAs the assault ended with the victory of the Silver Hand, Darion Mograine was later raised by the Deathlord abord as the fourth and final horseman. With the Four Horsemen assembled and Darion as their leader, the Knights of the Ebon Blade would be prepared for the war with the Legion.\nThe battle was not without consequences, as the relations between the Ebon Blade with the Silver Hand and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; deteriorated greatly.

One of the greatest and largest of these trees, Zan\u2019vess, towers over the small ridges south of the Briny Muck \u2013 and its imminent sha corruption endangers not only the local Mantid who rely upon it, but all those they might attack in their resulting madness.\"\n\"To end the threat, you\u2019ll need to take to the skies, destroying the wavering energy fields that protect the great tree while being blasted by the mantid\u2019s natural defenses. After your aerial assault, you\u2019ll break through insectoid monstrosities and battle to the tree on foot, where you\u2019ll fight face to mandible with the mantid guardians who\u2019ve dedicated their very lives to Zan\u2019vess\u2019s protection.\"\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral%20Zigg\"&gt;Rear Admiral Zigg&lt;/a&gt;, this island contains the last remaining forces of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; that are protecting a large weapons cache that &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; would like to retrieve for the Horde.

The encounter consists of &lt;a href=\"Steelbreaker\"&gt;Steelbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Runemaster%20Molgeim\"&gt;Runemaster Molgeim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormcaller%20Brundir\"&gt;Stormcaller Brundir&lt;/a&gt;. Killing any one of the three will give a &lt;a href=\"enrage\"&gt;soft enrage&lt;/a&gt; of +25% &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to the other two and grant them additional abilities (similar to &lt;a href=\"Fathom-Lord%20Karathress\"&gt;Fathom-Lord Karathress&lt;/a&gt;). Killing the second of the trio will grant the last with a final stage apart from their usual abilities which must be dealt with in different tactics.\nThe hard mode of this fight requires players to kill Steelbreaker last.\nBackground.\nBosstiary.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"iron%20army\"&gt;iron armies&lt;/a&gt; are led by three fearsome generals, each representing a different race. These leaders are known as Stormcaller Brundir, Runemaster Molgeim, and Steelbreaker.\"\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The iron legions of &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; are commanded by three fearsome generals, each representing a different &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; race. Stormcaller Brundir, Runemaster Molgeim, and the giant Steelbreaker fight in the name of the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;'s true master, the malevolent &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOverview.\nDefeating a member of the Assembly of Iron will heal the remaining two to full health and grant them Supercharge, which increases damage and grants access to additional abilities.\nAbilities.\nHard Mode.\nDefeating one of the Assembly of Iron buffs the remaining members with Supercharge. Steelbreaker is the most difficult member of the Iron Assembly if he is the last member of the Assembly standing.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1: All three alive.\nPlayers can choose to kill the trio in any order they wish, though the popular and easiest route is Steelbreaker, then Molgeim, then Brundir. Be warned that when you kill a boss, the remaining bosses will return to full health. This prevents the raid from being able to take down multiple bosses at the same time.\nJust like Maulgar, Illidari Council, Karathress, etc. all of these bosses have to be pulled and tanked away from each other in precise positions. Molgeim and Steelbreaker can be tanked in the two front corners of the room, but Brundir must be tanked towards the back for his Overload (30 yards) which will deal a lot of damage to anyone that is not a tank (often times killing them). Note that Brundir's tank can simply eat the Overloads, since the tank should have a dedicated healer, otherwise only doing raid healing. If it is an issue, the tank should move away as well, then move right back to Brundir when the channeled cast is over. Any casters and the tank on Stormcaller Brundir that can interrupt should be interrupting Chain Lightnings whenever possible. The healer assigned to Brundir's tank should be close to Steelbreaker's back when the fight begins, 35+ yards away.\nMolgeim will often put a Rune of Power underneath either Steelbreaker or Brundir so they must be pulled out of the rune far enough to where they're no longer benefiting from the buff and melee or ranged players can bunch up in this rune and output higher damage upon the primary target.\nSteelbreaker on occasion will deal a Fusion Punch which the tank must call out for focused healing and a magic dispel of the nature debuff that is inflicted from the punch. Use either a Paladin's &lt;a href=\"Cleanse\"&gt;Cleanse&lt;/a&gt;, a Priest's &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt;, or a Warlock can use their Fel Hunter pet and use &lt;a href=\"Devour%20Magic\"&gt;Devour Magic&lt;/a&gt; on the tank. If you are killing Steelbreaker first, melee must bunch up to benefit from &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Growth\"&gt;Wild Growth&lt;/a&gt; used to counter the nature aura damage.\nPhase 2: One Boss Dead.\nWhen one of the Iron Council dies, the other two will gain additional abilities. For the most part, they will be tanked in the same general areas but these new abilities will compensate for the dead boss. \nSteelbreaker will gain Static Disruption which will cause a random raid member not in melee to take 75% more nature damage for 20 seconds. The whole raid will need to be spread out as this is an aoe and will be extremely irritating to heal through if it hits more than one player.\nMolgeim now has a Rune of Death, which will be cast on a random raid member. It is a big, green rune that is impossible to visually miss. Melee and ranged must bunch up and be ready to move in the same general path to avoid confusion, splitting up, and getting out of range of heals.\nBrundir will gain Lightning Whirl, which animates like whirlwind and will shoot random lightning bolts at raid members which will deal a large amount of nature damage to random raid members. It can, and should, be interrupted.\nPhase 3: Two bosses dead.\nWhen two of the three bosses are dead, the last one will separate into a unique phase different from their usual abilities in the previous phases. Players must be alert during this phase because elements are introduced that will almost instantly wipe the group if they don't coordinate around them.\nSteelbreaker.\nBlow Bloodlust/Heroism and hit Steelbreaker with an almost impossible amount of DPS to kill him before you run out of tanks due to Meltdown. The DPS and healing requirements of this achievement are extremely high so it is not recommended for most groups.\nRunemaster Molgeim.\nMolgeim will open up a Rune of Summoning (purple void zone spawn akin to the voidwalkers in TBC) which will spawn lightning elemental adds which will explode for a high amount of damage to anyone within 30 yards when they reach their aggro target. They spawn one at a time, but up to 8 or 9 adds total will be spawned rapidly. They are tauntable and will race after the random players, but they can be taunted by tanks for an emergency target switch. Improved Blizzard and Earthbind Totem DO work on the lightning elementals. All players should move as far from the zone as possible, dropping AoEs in prep for the add arrivals. All AoE helps, however every effort should be made to avoid meeting the adds in melee. If an add bolts free of the AoE, targeted members should run while ranged helps dps down the loose add. Good communication and proper reaction to the add spawns is essential. Also to note, while not necessarily safe, melee dps can help kill the adds as long as one is not chasing them, although it is preferred to let ranged dps take down the spawns.\nStormcaller Brundir.\nBrundir will lift up into the air and gain Lightning Tendrils. Anybody within a 10 yd range of Brundir will get hit by these tendrils for high nature damage; standing near him for more than a couple of seconds will prove fatal if you are not a tank. He is tauntable, but will clear aggro every time he lifts up into the air, and taunting during Lightning Tendrils will not change his target or course. Occasionally he will fall to the ground and melee can move in to attack, but he will lift again without warning and hit them with his tendrils.\nDrops.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Archivum%20Data%20Disc\"&gt;Archivum Data Disc&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Archivum%20Data%20Disc%20%28heroic%29\"&gt;Archivum Data Disc (heroic)&lt;/a&gt; also drops if runemaster Molgeim is killed last.\nRelated achievements.\nThe following achievements are for the encounter's hard mode.\nQuotes.\nSound Files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0Assembly%20of%20Iron\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: Assembly of Iron&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Attacking a new target will cause the pet to switch to that target after a few seconds. The Assist stance also incorporates the Defensive pet stance; pets set to Assist with no current target will attack any target that attacks itself or its master.\nPets in Assist will not register their master's attack until the attack itself is completed; it is usually preferable to manually command the pet to &lt;a href=\"Attack\"&gt;Attack&lt;/a&gt; before the cast is complete, especially when opening with abilities with a long cast time (such as &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Fire\"&gt;Soul Fire&lt;/a&gt;), or if using the pet to &lt;a href=\"tank%20%28role%29\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssist was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.2\"&gt;Patch 4.2&lt;/a&gt;, replacing &lt;a href=\"Aggressive\"&gt;Aggressive&lt;/a&gt;. Although less dangerous than its predecessor, Assist is still hard to control. Pets set to Assist cannot reliably be made to attack a specific target other than that of the player; they will always switch to the player's current target, even if repeatedly commanded to &lt;a href=\"Attack\"&gt;Attack&lt;/a&gt; another. This can be problematic when dealing with multiple enemies, such as when quickly dealing with adds while mostly focusing on a more important target. This can be particularly disadvantageous for melee pets, causing them to waste much time running from one target to another. Setting the pet to Defensive (or Passive) is often preferable in these situations, allowing the player to focus the pet upon a specific target. As with Defensive, pets in Assist with no current target will immediately attack any target that attacks it or its master, which can be problematic in &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen soloing, Assist can be useful for causing the pet to immediately assist the player in attacking their current target, although using the &lt;a href=\"Attack\"&gt;Attack&lt;/a&gt; command is still quicker and more effective, especially when using the pet to tank."}

Like all other hearthstones, it is flat and gray with blue runes denoting the word \"home\" and the name of its owner.\nHistory.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; agreed that it would be a good idea to let Anduin get away from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; whenever Varian was in one of his \"Lo'Gosh moods\". Jaina arranged for a hearthstone to be created specifically for Anduin and bound it to her hearth in her tower on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. It was initially bound to Jaina herself until she gifted it to Anduin, allowing him to teleport over for a visit whenever he liked. The prince later used the hearthstone to escape &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; when it was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;. He materialized in Jaina's tower just as she was meeting with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, causing the first meeting between Anduin and Baine.\nYears later, Anduin bound the stone to the private receiving room in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After a visit to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, he used the hearthstone to return to Stormwind, as it was the middle of the night and he didn't wish to disturb anyone. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; was about to go to her husband &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;'s side in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin lent her the hearthstone so that she could safely bring Malfurion back to Stormwind. Tyrande found Malfurion wounded by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; on the battlefield and, after a standoff with Saurfang, used the stone to return with her husband to Stormwind."}

The act was intended to officially seal &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;'s reentry into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and was overseen by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral names were put forward for the ship before its delivery, including Anduin's Wrath, Dawnsailor, Tiffin's Melody, and The Lionheart. The final decision on this would ultimately be left in the hands of an Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; who was pivotal in its construction. The ship's maiden voyage took it from &lt;a href=\"Port%20Fogtide\"&gt;Port Fogtide&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt;, where it was personally received by King Anduin himself.\nHistory.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; raged on, Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; sought to construct a new vessel for King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in order to fully symbolize &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;her kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s return to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, she began recruiting &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt;s from across the kingdom to take part in the project, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; and an Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;. Having first located the famed shipwright &lt;a href=\"Dorian%20Atwater\"&gt;Dorian Atwater&lt;/a&gt; and convincing her to construct the vessel, the group next went about securing &lt;a href=\"Port%20Fogtide\"&gt;Port Fogtide&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; to act as a dockyard, while also collecting necessary materials from across Kul Tiras.\nWood for the vessel was sourced from the &lt;a href=\"Algerson%20Lumber%20Yard\"&gt;Algerson Lumber Yard&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, though the shipment needed to first be purified of dark influence with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded in cleansing the wood at their request, and sent the Thornspeakers to Stormsong to further aid construction. Meanwhile, ore required for the ship had to be retrieved from &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Hills%20Mine\"&gt;Bleak Hills Mine&lt;/a&gt; in northern Drustvar, run by &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Wright\"&gt;Chelsea Wright&lt;/a&gt;. With her aid, the mine's storeroom was secured, and the contents sent straight to Port Fogtide.\nWith construction nearing completion, Jaina Proudmoore set about securing a crew for the vessel. Working with her brother &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to serve as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina's agents also enlisted &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pike\"&gt;Brother Pike&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Tarenfold\"&gt;Lieutenant Tarenfold&lt;/a&gt; as master gunner, and the &lt;a href=\"Outriggers\"&gt;Outriggers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; to form the bulk of the crew. Outrigger Captain &lt;a href=\"Rosaline%20Madison\"&gt;Rosaline Madison&lt;/a&gt; would also agree to serve as first mate, despite initial reservations. Just before its first voyage, Tandred would ultimately convince shipwright Atwater herself to leave retirement and act as boatswain on the new ship, reasoning that if she wanted the best boatswain possible for her creation, it would have to be her. Naming the vessel was left in the hands of Jaina's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;, based on suggestions from those present. Options included:\nOnce named, Brother Pike performed a ritual blessing and dedication on the vessel, before it set off on its maiden voyage to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to be presented to King Anduin. On the deck of the ship, Anduin was officially presented with the gift as a symbol of Kul Tiras's renewed pledge, with other Alliance leaders also in attendance. Anduin himself expressed his gratitude for the gesture, and once again welcomed the Kul Tirans into the fold. The ship would dock in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrew.\nThe flagship's crew is composed of notable individuals handpicked from across &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, including:"}

The trio shared many adventures in the Azerothian wilderness in their youth such as when they were attacked by jungle trolls in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Lothar studied battle and history. At a considerably early age, Lothar joined Stormwind's military, quickly becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;King's Honor Guard&lt;/a&gt;. He was later knighted and arose to the position of Armsman in the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Horse&lt;/a&gt;. Lothar's renown reached as far as &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and its kingdoms, including &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gurubashi War.\nYears after the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind's farmers and settlers would increasingly push southward claiming territory close to the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Skirmishes would erupt between the Gurubashi and Stormwind forces but the elderly King &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; would refuse to order an invasion into Stranglethorn and was focused on fighting a defensive war, much to the outrage of his son Prince Llane. While the King's strategy against the Gurubashi was effective it would be unable to stop every attack, one which saw slow, barbaric, and gruesome deaths delivered to the villagers of three towns in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. This would ultimately prove to be the final straw of Prince &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin Lothar, and &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who in defiance of Llane's father's continued de-escalation, journeyed south to bring war to the Gurubashi. Though initially shielded by Medivh's magic the three friends would end up in the fight for their lives when they battled &lt;a href=\"Jok%27non\"&gt;Jok'non&lt;/a&gt;, a Gurubashi Warlord empowered by &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the three friends would prove victorious and return to Stormwind, shaken by Medivh's powers. \nWhile none of the Gurubashi who witnessed Jok'non's death survived, it took very little imagination for the trolls to surmise who was responsible. Rallying under Jok'non's son, &lt;a href=\"Zan%27non\"&gt;Zan'non&lt;/a&gt;, the Gurubashi launched &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;an invasion&lt;/a&gt; intent on destroying Stormwind. In the face of the troll onslaught, Barathen recalled all his forces to the stronghold's gate, believing that the survival of Stormwind would depend on one colossal battle. As the death toll mounted on both sides, Barathen mounted a desperate counterattack against the Gurubashi. Though almost succeeding in claiming Zan'non's head, Barathen would die on the field of battle. Llane, driven by guilt, would plead with Medivh to unleash his power on the Gurubashi as he had done against Jok'non. Though frightened by his own power, Medivh would accept Llane's request and destroy the Gurubashi forces (Zan'non included), an act that would ultimately avenge Barathen. After the conflict was over, Lothar would see only approval upon being raised as one of the military's top commanders.\nIn the years that followed, Lothar discreetly sent dozens of the kingdom's apprentice spellcasters to Medivh, who rebuked all of them.\nThe First War.\nWhen reports of mysterious creatures lurking around the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; reached Stormwind, rumors spread through the streets that they were either vengeful spirits, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s armed with some new breed of power, or a strange race from across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. King Llane dispatched Lothar to uncover what these new creatures were. Lothar led a small force of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to scout the Black Morass, resulting in humans clashing with &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time in a series of bloody skirmishes. Lothar and his men scored a number of small victories, yet for every orc killed two more seemed to take its place. The humans were more outnumbered in each subsequent battle, and Lothar was eventually forced to pull back without venturing deep enough into the heavily guarded Black Morass to find the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Lothar informed King Llane the invaders were bringing in reinforcements from somewhere, and the kingdom readied itself for a full-scale war that became known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. One of Lothar's first tasks was to recruit more soldiers.\nLothar and his soldiers soon crossed paths with the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; on a scouting mission to the Black Morass. He had encouraged his friend to rejoin Stormwind's defense, though understood that Medivh struggled with the power he unleashed on the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; years ago. The Guardian played along and feigned a fear of tapping into unwieldy magical powers, though his true intention was to buy time for the Horde to boost its strength. Lothar also spoke with Khadgar, telling him about Medivh's troubled past and asking him to act as a caretaker in addition to an apprentice.\nThe orcish leader Warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; ordered raiding parties to cut deep into Stormwind's lands to drive panic into the human populace. Entire villages in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the southern &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; fell, their inhabitants either killed or forced to flee. By the time Stormwind's patrols rode to defend the villages, the Horde was already gone. They were an enemy unlike any the humans had ever faced.\nLlane had named Lothar the \"King's Champion\", the highest military rank in the kingdom, and entrusted him to end the orcish threat. Deciding to use the orcs' mobility against them, Lothar studied the pattern of targets the Horde would strike and set up ambushes along their paths of retreat. A loyal knight named &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt; was given command of large numbers of troops by Lothar. In some cases, small units of human knights were able to bring down entire orc raiding parties without any casualties. The orcs soon realized the humans were unlike any enemy they had ever faced as well.\nThree years after the Dark Portal had been opened, the orcish raids on the countryside had razed farms, towns, villages, forges, and trade houses, causing ruin to Stormwind's economy. Even more dire, many sources of food supply had been destroyed or fallen into the Horde's control, threatening &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with running out of supplies in a few months. With this knowledge in mind, Blackhand decided to bring the Horde north to conquer &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and from there launch an attack on Stormwind City. The Horde marched on the foothills of Redridge with little resistance and believed the humans would not attack before they reached Stormwind City, which was exactly what Lothar wanted them to think.\nAn orc raiding party led by Blackhand went into the mountains hoping to claim &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lothar and his &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s suddenly charged down the slopes without warning and surrounded the orcs in a spectacular ambush. The Horde &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s fought hard but almost all of them were slain. Lothar himself had almost killed Blackhand, but the two &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s accompanying Blackhand had turned the tide of battle with their fel fire and forced Lothar to withdraw. Blackhand was humiliated by his brush with death and blamed the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; for not sensing the ambush. He personally executed the two warlocks that saved his life for incompetence. Weeks later, a larger force took Lakeshire and the surrounding land.\nAfter Brightwood, Westfall, and the Redridge Mountains had fallen, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched onto Stormwind City. Thousands of Horde soldiers marched through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and encircled Stormwind, cutting off all access except for the sea. Blackhand had ordered &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to lead their &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans in the assault on Stormwind. To weaken the city's defenses, &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s bombarded the city walls through the night, and at dawn Kilrogg and Cho'gall launched their attack. While orcs charged the battlements, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s engulfed Stormwind's soldiers in &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; fire, resulting in staggering losses. As it seemed Stormwind would fall that day, suddenly cries of an attack came from the Horde's rear lines. Lothar and the majority of Stormwind's knights had moved around the Horde by sea. The King's Commander was now leading a charge through Elwynn Forest, catching the orcs in the rearguard completely by surprise as the knights cut through their lines. As the Bleeding Hollow and Twilight's Hammer tried to push back the knights, Stormwind's large gates opened and soldiers poured out of the city to flank the orcs in a counterattack. Outflanked on both sides and suffering many casualties, the orcs were left with no choice but to flee. This was the greatest disaster to ever happen to the Horde, which withdrew to Redridge to devise a new plan. Lothar and King Llane had received information about the Horde's battle plans from Khadgar, who had learned of them from &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, which helped prepare for the attack on Stormwind.\nAt one point during the war, the &lt;a href=\"%3ATome%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;:Tome of Divinity&lt;/a&gt;, a book of great value to the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt;, was stolen by a rogue band of &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; led by the ogre lord &lt;a href=\"Turok\"&gt;Turok&lt;/a&gt;. Lothar led an expedition into the ogres' hideout, the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to recover the tome, but were completely overrun and held captive to be killed slowly. Lothar remained imprisoned within the caves for twenty months before he and his few surviving men were saved by Azerothian troops led by the &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Crown\"&gt;Defender of the Crown&lt;/a&gt; sent by the &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20of%20Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbot of Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; and King Llane. He retrieved the Tome of Divinity and returned to Stormwind, safeguarding the book at &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. Reintroduced to the conflict, Lothar continued to lead the forces of Stormwind against the orcs.\nIn Year 3, Lothar met with Khadgar, the apprentice to his old friend Medivh. When the Champion and the apprentice were alone, Lothar told Khadgar about Medivh's coma and told him that he is worried about the Magus. Some time later, he had a message sent to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; in order to bring Medivh into Stormwind City as he was dealing with the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Hugarin\"&gt;Hugarin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huglar\"&gt;Huglar&lt;/a&gt;. Lothar was shocked when the wizard Khadgar arrived to tell him that the great mage had betrayed humankind by summoning the orcs into Azeroth. Despite this information, Llane could hardly believe that the magus would willingly betray Azeroth and instead believed all his actions, however, suspect, could be justified as part of a brilliant scheme. Llane felt confident in Medivh's allegiance and that his army and Medivh would be enough to beat back the Horde. Forced to choose between his convictions and his loyalty to the king, Lothar chose to follow his instincts and personally led a force to storm Karazhan and kill Medivh. Lothar charged &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad&lt;/a&gt; with commanding Stormwind City's defenses in his absence. The band of troops, along with Lothar, Khadgar, and the half-orc Garona, descended into the lower tower and confronted the mad Guardian. Khadgar finally managed to stab Medivh in the heart, and Lothar removed his head with one swipe from his greatsword. Medivh was the first Guardian to be killed in combat in centuries.\nUnfortunately, the death of Medivh could not stop the rampaging onslaught of the Horde. Lothar and his warriors, returning home from Karazhan, hoped to stem the loss of life and save their once-glorious homeland. Instead, they returned too late and found their beloved kingdom in smoking ruins. The orcish Horde continued to ravage the countryside and claimed the surrounding lands for its own. After their courageous king was murdered, the people of Stormwind were forced into hiding. Lothar and his companions swore a grim oath to reclaim their homeland at any cost. Lothar, knowing that the Kingdom of Stormwind had been lost, declared the war lost in Year 4, and decided to save what remained of his once mighty people. He gathered the tattered remnants of the army and as many civilians as he could save and led them in a desperate &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;retreat&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, eventually landing upon the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second War.\nWith Llane dead and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Varian&lt;/a&gt; still a child, Lothar - as Knight-Champion - acted as Varian's regent until Stormwind could be retaken. Once he arrived in the court of King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron with Varian and Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, the apprentice of Medivh; Lothar told his dire story to all who would listen. Lothar's eloquent pleas ultimately brought the human kingdoms together for an emergency council, where his friend Terenas' masterful politics created the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Having been contacted by Terenas with Lothar's tale, the normally aloof &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; sent a contingent of their forces, knowing that they could finally pay off their debt to the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; bloodline for saving their lands during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; were attacked by the Horde as well and quickly pledged themselves to Lothar. The Alliance was later joined by the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, who had been forced out of their lands by the Horde's advance.\nBecause of his great skill in warfare, his experience in battling with the orcs, and because the kings of the north were not comfortable placing their troops in the command of a rival nation, Lothar - a neutral party and a descendant of &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; - was named the Supreme Commander of the Alliance forces. During his time in Lordaeron, he was approached by &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; who told him how depressed he was when Lothar told him of the fall of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. To compensate, Alonsus introduced the new class of the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; to Lothar and asked him to make them his commanders. He accepted and quickly named &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; (who reminded him of Llane) his second-in-command, and Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; (his longtime friend), &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, and Khadgar as his lieutenants. Lothar was 56 years old by the time the orcs had reached the shores of Lordaeron. Throughout the Second War he led his forces from battle to battle with valor and skill, earning the nickname of \"Lion of Azeroth\" from the sight of his shield flashing through the orc ranks. After the Horde's mysterious retreat from Lordaeron and Grand Admiral Proudmoore's naval victories against the Horde at sea, Lothar led the armies of the Alliance to liberate much of Khaz Modan (meeting up with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;) and Azeroth, eventually breaching the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; itself. Lord Lothar, seeing that the Horde was fracturing from within, gathered the last of his forces and pushed Doomhammer south, back into the shattered heartland of Stormwind. There, the Alliance forces trapped the retreating Horde within the volcanic fortress of Blackrock Spire. Lothar was killed at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; after a force of Alliance troops under his command was ambushed by Horde forces.\nHe became separated from the main body of his troops in the war's greatest battle. Amid the chaos, he was forced into combat with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;; after a long and draining fight, Lothar was defeated in single combat after his sword was shattered by the Doomhammer, his skull crushed by a powerful blow from the legendary weapon.\nDoomhammer believed that Lothar's death would break the fighting spirit of his forces, but what happened was quite the opposite. After Lothar's death, his most trusted general, Turalyon, took up his shield and sword, defeated Doomhammer, and led the armies of the Alliance to eventual victory over the Blackrock Spire's defenses; allowing Lothar's old ally and friend, Khadgar, to later destroy the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy and memorial.\nAnduin Lothar, of age 57, did not live to see his beloved homeland rebuilt and freed from orc control, but a massive stone statue depicting Lothar in his final charge where he fell in battle was built and still stands in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, pointing defiantly towards Blackrock Spire. The materials for Lothar's monument had ironically been hauled by orcs put to work after the Second War. Lord Lothar's legacy lives on in all the free peoples of Stormwind. The &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;current king&lt;/a&gt; of the nation bears Lothar's name.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, led by veterans who had fought alongside Lothar in the Second War, named themselves the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; \"in honor of the greatest, most selfless man we ever knew\", as Khadgar relates it. The &lt;a href=\"Monument%20of%20Remembrance\"&gt;Monument of Remembrance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; was also built as a memorial to everything he fought for.\nSometime during his life, Lothar wrote what is considered to be the ultimate compendium of battle strategy, simply titled \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Treatise%20on%20Strategy\"&gt;A Treatise on Strategy&lt;/a&gt;\". Lothar's masterwork describes, in his own words, the proper deployment of forces and strategies needed to win almost any battle.\nLothar is remembered during the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the Burning Legion's infiltration of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar appears in two visions: The first is of him and Llane watching over Medivh in his coma, and the second is with Khadgar looking over a fallen Medivh after the latter's death.\nEquipment.\nThree swords have been attributed to Anduin Lothar. It is unclear if these three weapons are related, one and the same, or entirely different weapons. Pieces of his armor have also made significant appearances.\nIn the RPG.\nPersonality.\nLothar is a strong and highly charismatic leader, capable of commanding attention and radiating determination and conviction to those serving under him. Though most often appearing emotionless, he is deeply passionate about his friends and countrymen. His loyalty is first and foremost to the people of Azeroth, and he will fight with the full extent of his considerable skills in battle 'til his homeland is reclaimed.\nIn combat, Lothar works best as part of the knight cavalry, charging into his enemies with his sword, Quel'Zaram; preferring to outmaneuver enemy commanders, but retreating when prudent. He is at his peak when commanding others. Following Medivh's betrayal, Lothar has a profound respect for spellcasters, and will target them, hammering through lesser warriors to reach wizards and sorcerers in the rear.\nWeapon.\nAs a youth, Lothar came across a magnificent sword that was dubbed Quel'Zaram, &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; for \"High Blade\", by his long-time friend and companion &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20%28film%29\"&gt;film universe&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar had a sister, &lt;a href=\"Taria%20Wrynn\"&gt;Taria&lt;/a&gt;, who married Llane. Taria was made canon to the main universe in \"&lt;a href=\"Chronicle%20Volume%202\"&gt;Chronicle Volume 2&lt;/a&gt;\", but it is unknown if she is still Lothar's sister in canon. This seems unlikely as \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" refers to Lothar as the last of the Arathi bloodline. However, she could still be Anduin's sister if the Arathi bloodline follows &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.britannica.com/topic/Salic-Law-of-Succession\"&gt;Salic Law of Succession&lt;/a&gt; which prevents women or their children, be they male or female, from inheriting the throne. In that case, Varian could be both Lothar's nephew and not part of the Arathi.\nAlternate timelines.\nA version of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; existed in a &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt; where history turned out completely different and which was entered by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; era.\nAnother alternate version appears as a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;."}

A proud and noble warrior, Lothar was accredited a position within the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;King's Honor Guard&lt;/a&gt; at a considerably early age.
