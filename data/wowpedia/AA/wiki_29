While she suspected that some deviate critters had survived, further investigation show that they did and are multiplying out of control.

They were eventually destroyed by the eredar leadership for consorting with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and attempting to install Thal'kiel as dictator of Argus.\nThe symbol of the Wakeners is the Scythe-like object seen on the draenei banners.\nHistory.\nSpecialists in the arts of conjuration and binding, the Wakeners were renowned for their clever &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; constructs \u2014 which helped build the Argussian capital's wondrous architecture \u2014 and their exploration of new frontiers in summoning.\nHowever, their leader Thal'kiel thirsted for ever more power, and one day he made contact with a dark presence in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; who showed him visions of power beyond imagining and gave him the ability to summon lesser &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 knowledge he then immediately spread to his Wakeners. Believing this to be the start of a new era for Argus, Thal'kiel conducted a demonstration of this new knowledge before the eyes of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, the rulers of Argus, by summoning a storm of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s to destroy his old arcane constructs as a symbolic display of the new age. However, the demonstration did not garner him the approval he had expected, for Velen harshly condemned his actions and forbade Thal'kiel from ever summoning demons again.\nAfter the disastrous demonstration, Thal'kiel withdrew to his chambers for weeks, neither eating nor sleeping, his only companions being the demons he summoned and then banished in rage. When he emerged, having become twisted as if aged by centuries, he summoned his Wakeners (who loved him like a father), told them that \"The new era begins\" and ordered them to resume their demonic experiments. Using powerful spells to hide their operations from the eyes of Velen and Kil'jaeden, the Wakeners began summoning increasingly powerful demons with the sole purpose of installing Thal'kiel as dictator of Argus. However, Thal'kiel's ambitious young apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, was eager to prove himself to Argus' leadership, and so slipped away the night before the planned coup to inform Velen and Kil'jaeden of his master's plans.\nArchimonde himself broke the wards hiding Thal'kiel's army and led a contingent of magi to storm the Wakeners' secret training grounds. The Wakeners were caught off guard and easily defeated, and the demons were quickly slaughtered when they found themselves leaderless. As Thal'kiel tried to summon in more reinforcements, Archimonde decapitated his former master with a single stroke of his blade. The eredar now known as &lt;a href=\"Talixae%20Flamewreath\"&gt;Talixae Flamewreath&lt;/a&gt;, another student, escaped the raid as she was mysteriously missing at the time.\nAfter they crushed Thal'kiel's rebellion, the eredar rulers' magi burned the Wakeners' bodies so their &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; taint would not spread, and they destroyed the rebels' writings to suppress the knowledge of their foul arts. Archimonde oversaw the effort, and when it was done, he was hailed as a hero, and would years later rise to rule Argus alongside Velen and Kil'jaeden.\nAfter Thal'kiel's fall, the Wakeners were taken over by &lt;a href=\"Aargoss\"&gt;High Wakener Aargon&lt;/a&gt;. Under him they delved into the mysteries of soulbinding and invented &lt;a href=\"Vigilant\"&gt;Vigilant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt might be notable that all known members were either corrupted by fel &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; or eventually joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are enslaved by &lt;a href=\"Arzeth%20the%20Merciless\"&gt;Arzeth the Merciless&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"terrorguard\"&gt;terrorguard&lt;/a&gt; empowered by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Taskmaster\"&gt;Illidari Taskmaster&lt;/a&gt;s; Arzeth wanders nearby the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27naar%20Key\"&gt;Sha'naar Key&lt;/a&gt;, which is the key to release the elders.\nSome of the Dreghoods were sent to Zangarmarsh to do manual labor for &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dreghood%20Brute\"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; of them were sent to &lt;a href=\"Darkcrest%20Shore\"&gt;Darkcrest Shore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkcrest%20Enclave\"&gt;Darkcrest Enclave&lt;/a&gt; while others deep down in &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Umbrafen%20tribe\"&gt;Umbrafen&lt;/a&gt; tribe, allied with the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, is especially cruel to escaped slaves.\nA few have managed to escape to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Telhamat\"&gt;Temple of Telhamat&lt;/a&gt; and at least one has managed to escape to &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Post\"&gt;Cenarion Post&lt;/a&gt;. The Dreghoods in the Temple of Telhamat are now led by the &lt;a href=\"Omenai\"&gt;Omenai&lt;/a&gt;, they are sending heroes against the Illidari Taskmasters. Some of the free Dreghood are trying to relearn the old ways of the Light from the uncorrupted draenei.\nShould the elders be released and &lt;a href=\"Arzeth%20the%20Merciless\"&gt;Arzeth the Merciless&lt;/a&gt; defeated the tribe would be free, however, there aren't many that care about the fate of the broken in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and even some think of them as evil.\nSociety.\nThey used to follow the path of &lt;a href=\"shamanism\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt; (they could manipulate the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, wind, and &lt;a href=\"earth\"&gt;earth&lt;/a&gt;). Also they were known as good leatherworkers, as leather clothes bearing their tribe's name can be found throughout the area."}

{"id": "17188", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17188", "title": "Drek'Thar", "text": "Drek'Thar (sometimes spelled Drek'thar) is the elder &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href=\"farseer\"&gt;farseer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, and served as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s tutor many years ago. Drek'Thar had to prove his worth during the Horde's dark period, being one of the first shaman eager to learn the dark arts of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. He found the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;spirits of the elements&lt;/a&gt; to be close companions, so &lt;a href=\"shamanism\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt; became his path to might. Despite his power over the elements, Drek'Thar always maintained his meekness and wisdom. He continues to shepherd the younger shaman of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the old traditions of his people.\nCurrently Drek'Thar is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, and the General of the Frostwolf armies in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one of the few remaining orcs from the &lt;a href=\"old%20Horde\"&gt;old Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the current faction. Besides being a shaman, Drek'Thar is also a trained warrior. He was once the &lt;a href=\"Farseer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; of the Frostwolf clan, but ended up passing that role to &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt; a few years after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is also an elite boss located at &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Keep\"&gt;Frostwolf Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly history.\nSome claim that Drek'Thar was blind from birth, and others that he went blind later in life. Drek'Thar was an apprentice shaman to the Frostwolf far seer, &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Kashur\"&gt;Mother Kashur&lt;/a&gt;, for many years on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. When Kashur was killed while hunting, Drek'Thar became the senior Frostwolf shaman. Unlike his chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, Drek'Thar was willing to accept &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement due to Mother Kashur's spirit (&lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; in disguise) confirming that the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were plotting against them. When the elements abandoned the orcs following the beginnings of their genocidal campaign against the draenei people, Drek'Thar and the other shamans of the orcish race followed the evil &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and his apprentices from the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; into the path of the warlock. As such, he followed all assaults by the Horde on draenei hunting parties as well as on innocent civilians, including women and children. He was also present with Durotan during their meeting with &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. Drek'Thar wanted to attack the prophet but Durotan stopped him.\nWith the Horde's opinion turning against Durotan and the Frostwolves for his public defiance of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and his refusal to partake of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;\u2014or allow any of his clan to do so\u2014the Frostwolves were eventually exiled into the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. It was sometime during this exile that Drek'Thar renounced the way of the warlock and rediscovered the path of the shaman. With the aid of the elements and a little patience, Drek'Thar managed to convince the white wolves of Alterac to come to their aid. With Durotan and his heir gone, Drek'Thar assumed the leadership of the Frostwolves. He has since those dark times been redeemed, however, he still holds himself personally responsible for his actions.\nLord of the Clans.\nAlmost 18 years later, the powerful farseer discovered Thrall had been found alive while attempting to search for his clan. Giving the torn swaddling cloth he had kept since he was found to Drek'Thar, the farseer revealed that Thrall was the heir of Durotan \u2014 and the Spirit of Fire revealed to him at that first meeting that Thrall had potential as a shaman. After testing Thrall's humility as well as his pride \u2014 both qualities necessary for those who take the path of the shaman, he told the younger orc \u2014 Drek'Thar took the son of Durotan under his wing and began to train him in the ways of the spirits.\nShortly before he began Thrall's initiation, Drek'Thar sent his white wolf companion, &lt;a href=\"Wise-ear\"&gt;Wise-ear&lt;/a&gt;, to locate the nomadic Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and lead him to the Frostwolf camp. Doomhammer arrived as a cloaked stranger who spoke contemptuously of any attempts to free the orcs in captivity or fighting the humans. Enraged, Thrall challenged him to combat and defeated him; it was then that Doomhammer revealed his identity, and Drek'Thar revealed that he had set this confrontation up in order to convince Doomhammer to take Thrall under his wing when the Frostwolves united with the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Clan\"&gt;Warsong Clan&lt;/a&gt; to liberate the encampments.\nDuring the battle for the fifth encampment \u2014 now the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 both Doomhammer and Drek'Thar's old companion, Wise-ear, fell in battle. Drek'Thar convinced Thrall to put on Doomhammer's black plate armor to show that the Horde had a new Warchief. His advice proved to be sound, and the new Horde rallied behind their new leader after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Third War.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Drek'Thar traveled across the sea and helped Thrall found the kingdom of the capital of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and conducted many magical experiments in the surrounding landscape.\nDrek'Thar was trying to create a potion that required &lt;a href=\"%3Ashimmerweed\"&gt;:shimmerweed&lt;/a&gt;, a rare herb found only in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt; (named so for the &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s which lived there). The Thunder Lizards had become increasingly hostile of late, so when &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Orgrimmar, Drek'Thar instructed him to retrieve six bushels of shimmerweed. Rexxar did so and Drek'Thar rewarded him. However, Drek'Thar was puzzled by the increasing hostility of the thunder lizards, and assumed that perhaps there was an outside force behind it.\nDrek'Thar went to investigate himself and found that the behavior Rexxar had reported was true. At Thrall's request, Rexxar joined Drek'Thar in Thunder Ridge and collected several Thunder Lizard eggs to study. Upon further investigation, they found that &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s had begun to harvest lumber throughout the region, and the upset ecology was driving the thunder lizards mad. Rexxar wanted to level the &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;, but Drek'Thar stopped him, saying that it would breach the non-aggression pact signed by Thrall. Instead, they had to kill the raging beasts despite Rexxar's reservations.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nSome time after Rexxar departed to wander the wilds of Kalimdor, Drek'Thar returned to the Frostwolf lands in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, where he continues to lead the Frostwolf clan from the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Keep\"&gt;Frostwolf Keep&lt;/a&gt;. He leads the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and Frostwolves in the defense of Alterac Valley against the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;, who encroach on the northern edge of the valley.\nTo this day, he carries the guilt of his actions during the early days of the Horde and has never forgiven himself.\nAt some point, Drek'Thar retold the history of the orcish race on Draenor and Durotan to Thrall. He cried while speaking of it.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nSince the sealing of the Dark Portal, one group of orcs retained their original brown skin and maintained the traditional shamanism of the orcish race. They are called the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, and are led by Greatmother &lt;a href=\"Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt;, grandmother of Thrall. Upon hearing that there is a clan of uncorrupted orcs in Outland, Thrall immediately attempted to set out to the Dark Portal and traveled to the plains of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, however his duties as Warchief delayed his visit for some time.\nLater with his duties as warchief temporarily sorted, Drek'Thar and an honor guard of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; accompanied Thrall from Orgrimmar to the Mag'har settlement of &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in Nagrand. This was Drek'Thar's first visit to Draenor (now Outland) since the Frostwolves crossed into Azeroth.\nWorld of Warcraft: Shaman.\nDrek'Thar was revealed to be the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;'s most revered seer. By the time Drek'Thar traveled to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, it was said that he has lost the strength of arm and mind. He was carried by both &lt;a href=\"Palkar\"&gt;Palkar&lt;/a&gt; and an orc, and was already a little bit senile because he was confused by where he was, as he said he was in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Drek'Thar hysterically spoke about a foreboding shadow and told &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln&lt;/a&gt; to ask &lt;a href=\"Wise-ear\"&gt;Wise-ear&lt;/a&gt; about it. Eventually, Palkar took him out and calmed him with some herbs. Palkar and the orc took him to Orgrimmar, just as he wanted after witnessing a fire in Mulgore.\nLater, Muln relayed his fears with Drek'Thar about &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s indecisive stance. Drek'Thar told him that it was his fault as his advice to Thrall has been useless lately. Drek'Thar told Muln that lately he's been seeing two futures and his visions have been less reliable for Thrall. Drek'Thar told Muln that a time will come when the Earthen Ring will become Azeroth's salvation or lead it to ruin. Drek'Thar suddenly becomes frantic and warns Muln about the \"&lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;fire that consumes all&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Shattering.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, all hostilities in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; had ceased as part of a treaty between the Alliance and the Horde. Shortly before the emergence of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Drek'Thar, now seemingly going senile and cared for by a young orc shaman named &lt;a href=\"Palkar\"&gt;Palkar&lt;/a&gt;, started having visions, some of which he forgot most of their content within moments of waking. These included visions of the world breaking apart and an attack on a peace meeting between night elf and tauren druids. Drek'Thar pleaded with Palkar to send runners to Ashenvale to warn the druids that a band of orcs was about to attack a gathering of druids. Runners were sent and warnings were issued to the night elves, but no orcs were found in the area and it accomplished nothing except to make the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; more suspicious of the Horde.\nTwo months later, Drek'Thar had a vision of the world breaking apart and the elements crying out in pain. Again, Drek'Thar pleaded with Palkar, this time to send word to Thrall about the visions of the world breaking. Palkar, believing this to be part of Drek'Thar's senility, dismissed the visions. A short while later, Drek'Thar again had visions of the elements crying out and the world breaking apart, but as soon as he was about to share his vision with Palkar, senility claimed him and all he could remember was that something terrible was about to happen, but could not recall what.\nA short time later, word came from &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt;, one of the tauren &lt;a href=\"Longwalkers\"&gt;Longwalkers&lt;/a&gt;, that an attack did indeed occur on a group of night elf and tauren druids in the spot that Drek'Thar had specified. Palkar realized that despite his senility, Drek'Thar was right, and resolved to send a message to Thrall of Drek'Thar's visions of the world breaking apart. A short time later, Drek'Thar had a vision of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; being hit by tidal waves, which wrecked ships, drowned people, and totally submerged the harbor up to its highest point. The vision shifted to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, where a crack in the earth made a huge sinkhole. Drek'Thar wept and had another vision of a mysterious person trying to break down the door to their residence. He instructed Palkar to bar the door and not let this person inside. Palkar agreed to the request, but wondered who the intruder was and why Drek'Thar was so adamant he not be let in.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Drek'Thar appeared to be disabled and used a wheelchair.\nBeing pushed by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Galvangar\"&gt;Captain Galvangar&lt;/a&gt;, he was approached at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt;, for the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; in dealing with the remaining Alliance within Lordaeron. However, Drek'Thar declined, citing a refusal to work with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. He referenced his own dark past, contrasting the regret and remorse he feels to the unrepentant actions of the Forsaken. Cromush was greatly dismayed by this turn of events, contemplating whether this refusal was Drek'Thar \"forsaking\" the Horde, and resolved to defeat the remaining enemies in the region without the aid of the Frostwolves.\nLegion.\nSeveral years later, during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Drek'Thar was seen walking again, though this may not be something he can do reliably.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer reached Prestige Rank 2, Drek'Thar could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. He was present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulated the adventurer for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"%3AHigh%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;:High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nHe also appeared as a guest within the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and bestowed his blessing upon his fellow shamans. Contrary to his appearance in the early parts of the invasion, he was once again in his wheelchair. To Horde adventurers, Drek'Thar recognized them by their confident stride and said he heard stories of how some people went &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;back to Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, though he didn't know how he couldn't bear to see his old home as it once was. To Alliance adventurers, Drek'Thar wondered if they once met on the field of battle, and said he can see the spirits shining in them and that the Alliance must be proud to have them.\nDragonflight.\nSeveral more years after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall's family came to visit Drek'Thar, as Thrall's son &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt; wanted to speak to him about his upcoming &lt;a href=\"om%27riggor\"&gt;om'riggor&lt;/a&gt;. A conversation between Drek'Thar, &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; prompted the three to revive the forgotten orcish tradition of the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival, as well as to replace the rite of the om'riggor with a new &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;. Drek'Thar named &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt; the new Farseer of the Frostwolf clan in his place.\nTactics.\nAbilities.\nDrek'Thar in Alterac Valley is a formidable opponent who can easily tear apart an unprepared Alliance force, especially with dedicated Horde defenders. He has two guard wolves, &lt;a href=\"Drakan\"&gt;Drakan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duros\"&gt;Duros&lt;/a&gt; that respawn every time you pull Drek'Thar outside of his bunker, if they are not alive when he returns. \nStrategy.\nContrary to popular myth, his guard dogs do not respawn when looted. They respawn when Drek is reset. The best way is to just rush in and tank him while a few of the attackers kill his dogs. That way you only deal with the dogs once.\nDrek'Thar is relatively easy to tank by a single player, as he does not have any abilities that drop aggro. It is merely necessary to assure constant healing.\nIt is possible to kill Drek'Thar with one or two warmasters still alive, it primarily involves having more than one tank and plenty of healers. If more than two warmasters are alive it is best advised to destroy the East and West Frostwolf Towers first.\nTo prevent perpetually resetting him, it is wise to have a few &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s inside Drek'Thar's fortress and have them keep &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;pulling&lt;/a&gt; him back inside when he's about to run out and reset. Keep in mind that this will mean that whoever gripped him will have aggro for a few seconds so it is best to only assign this job to death knights who are able to tank properly.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Drek'Thar was an old fogy who had a role similar as in the novel. He had a vision of an orc raised in slavery which would later rise to lead the clan, and taught &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic ways. He had a son named &lt;a href=\"Kal%27Thar\"&gt;Kal'Thar&lt;/a&gt; and was to be played by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Jay\"&gt;Tony Jay&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe also narrated the trailer of the game:\nIn the RPG.\nDrek'Thar serves as Thrall's primary representative in the Eastern Kingdoms (which is good because Thrall has someone he can trust in charge); it is, however, inefficient because Drek'Thar's home in the Alterac Mountains is not readily accessible to the main body of the Horde. Drek'Thar is described as an orcish &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter their banishment from the Horde and the assassination of their chieftain, the clan was led for a time by Drek'Thar, an ancient and wise shaman. Drek'Thar organized the day-to-day activities of the clan, but he never assumed the title of &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;. The shaman also created a strong tie between his clan and the native white wolves of the mountains; they were different from the large black wolves the Horde had worked with, but the white wolves proved equally loyal.\nQuotes.\nHeart of Azeroth.\n&lt;The blind shaman hears your footfalls as you approach.

Once the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; collapsed, they began running for the docks and Ga'nar noticed , wanting him to challenge but Drek'Thar stopped him. Once they reached the ships, the shaman and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; left Tanaan for &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen they landed, Drek'Thar vouched for the Horde and Durotan accepted new allies. For a time he stayed in &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;, later taking &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the commander to &lt;a href=\"Wor%27gol\"&gt;Wor'gol&lt;/a&gt;, home of the Frostwolves. Once there, the shaman reunited with Wise-ear and blessed the adventurer through a &lt;a href=\"shamanstone\"&gt;shamanstone&lt;/a&gt;.

The Thunderlords were a part of the Iron Horde, of which the farseer received a vision. The Iron Tide would conquer all of . He sent the commander to warn Durotan about the vision.\nWhen the Frostwolves launched their counter-attack on the Thunderlords and captured the Thunder Pass, Drek'Thar participated the fight against the invading Iron Horde orcs. During the battle, he noticed Thrall's fighting technique and commented that he had a &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;great teacher&lt;/a&gt;. Draka suggested the shaman to collapse a cliff. He began summoning a lightning but needed more time so Ga'nar went to hold off the enemies. Once the spell was completed, the cliff collapsed burying Ga'nar and the Iron Horde, blocking any more incursion.\nOnce the war moved to , Drek'Thar answered the call of the elemental &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt; and asked the commander to help him to restore the balance of the elements caused by the disappearance of . It was revealed that had captured the missing Fury. The farseer and the commander entered , commanding him to eliminate the threat of the &lt;a href=\"pale%20orc\"&gt;pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s and release the captured elemental spirits.

They were soon joined by the commander and while Draka fought the attacking &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt;, Drek'Thar meditated and received a vision about a captured elemental Fury in &lt;a href=\"Magnarok\"&gt;Magnarok&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Exurotus\"&gt;Exurotus&lt;/a&gt; was captured by &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kron\"&gt;Kron&lt;/a&gt;.

During a battle with a wolf, it bit him on his head and ruptured one eye, the second went blind afterwards.\nFollowing the massacre of the Frostwolf clan by the rest of the Horde, Drek'Thar's current location is unknown. noticed that his and Palkar's bodies were not among the dead, but was uncertain whether they had escaped or merely been taken to serve as fuel for the . If they were taken prisoner, they may have been killed to fuel the opening of the , or may still be alive.\nHistory.\nDying Draenor.\nDrek'Thar was present when &lt;a href=\"Garad%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Chieftain Garad&lt;/a&gt; refused &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s offer to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Drek'Thar was disturbed by Gul'dan's presence and claimed that death followed him. Sometime after Gul'dan left, Garad became increasingly ill. Drek'Thar could not discover why. Unknown to all, Gul'dan had secretly poisoned Garad with the ceremonial dagger giving to him at the end of the parlay. Garad died in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Redwalker%20clan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Redwalker clan&lt;/a&gt;. After laying Garad to rest, Drek'Thar asked the spirits to bless their new chieftain &lt;a href=\"Durotan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;. Although approving of him, both Drek'Thar and Durotan realized that something was off with the spirits.\nAfter their attack was repelled by the Frostwolves, the Redwalkers moved north. Through unknown means, they took their strength from the spirits, all the while anticipating that the Frostwolves would come to the spirits' aid. Drek'Thar and his fellow shaman were unable to hear the weakening spirits, resulting in the Frostwolf clan being caught off guard when the volcano near their home erupted. As the Frostwolves settled within a new area to call home, they were once again approached by Gul'dan. Drek'Thar praised Durotan for refusing Gul'dan's offer.\nSome time later, the spirits were able to get a message of sorts to Drek'Thar and Durotan. They lead a party north to aid the spirits, leaving leave Draka and Doomhammer in charge of the village. With Durotan and his war party gone, the opportunistic Redwalkers struck against the Frostwolves in order to wound them and use them as a food supply. Meanwhile, Drek'Thar was a vessel to speak with &lt;a href=\"Geyah%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt; and both were stunned and horrified that the spirits were weak and would be no more. However, the spirits had enough energy for one last gift. While Durotan and the rest of the party rushed south to help save the clan, Drek'Thar remained behind to keep their dying frost wolves company.\nThe Redwalkers were ultimately destroyed and Drek'Thar reunited with the rest of the clan, which marched to join the Horde under Durotan's orders.\nWarcraft.\nWhen Durotan learned that only a small scouting party of the Horde's fittest warriors were to pass through the , Drek'Thar was not included in the small list the chieftain decided on to accompany him to Azeroth. However, Draka asked him to reconsider, reminding him of how many times the shaman's visions had saved Frostwolf lives. After considering this Durotan relented, on the condition that Drek'Thar would not fight, only heal and advise.\nDurotan was concerned Drek'Thar would be discovered, and on the day of the portal's opening the shaman wore a hooded cloak pulled low to hide his white hair and covered eyes, with Palkar guiding him. When the Frostwolf encampment was destroyed on Gul'dan's orders, Durotan couldn't find Drek'Thar, Palkar and their items, and was unsure whether they were taken as a fuel for fel or if they escaped.\nSpeculation.\nIt is speculated by fans that the unnamed orc portrayed below is Drek'Thar.\nThis elder orc's appearance fits the description of Drek'Thar in the official Warcraft film novel: \"His hair almost completely white now, but his body still muscular, as straight and tall as the newcomer\u2019s was stooped.\" He was attacked during the destruction of the Frostwolf camp. After some resistance, a horned skull was stabbed into his unprotected stomach. The injury caused him to vomit blood and left him defenseless, struck down by the attacker. He is expected to be killed on site or taken as fuel for fel, which matches the description in the novel."}

A part of the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20clan\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt;, the Drekirjar have famously maintained a pact with the local &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s for ages, granting them an unprecedented command of the skies. In recent times, however, the rise of &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; has seen the Drekirjar betray this alliance, with disastrous consequences.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Drekirjar are one of numerous &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; factions that have inhabited &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; for millennia. These groups are loosely tied together in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20clan\"&gt;Tideskorn clan&lt;/a&gt;. The Drekirjar themselves are based from their city of &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt;, which sits in Stormheim's far southeast in the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Thorim%27s%20Peak\"&gt;Thorim's Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, the Drekirjar entered into a new era when &lt;a href=\"Hakkap%20One-leg\"&gt;Hakkap One-leg&lt;/a&gt; first learned to tame the nearby &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s. The relationship between the two races was mutually consenting, and they would form a pact with each other that lasted many years. The result was the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar%20Galeborn\"&gt;Drekirjar Galeborn&lt;/a&gt;, the fiercest airborne combatants on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Hakkap himself would fall in battle during a major thunderstorm over the skies of Stormheim. Buried within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt;, his legacy would live on in all Drekirjar &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20rider\"&gt;dragon-riders&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Drekirjar fashion their armor from &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Drake%20Scale\"&gt;storm drake scales&lt;/a&gt;, and possess specialized equipment to make regular trips up the mountains, such as grapple launchers, climbing threads, oiled cloaks to keep the rain out, and enchanted lodestones to keep the lightning at bay.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of Stormheim were deeply affected by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during its &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Led by their new leader, the God-King &lt;a href=\"Skovald\"&gt;Skovald&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul allied with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, the Drekirjar being no exception. Many of the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt; accepted the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; gift, and became Felskorn.\nThe new allegiance of the Drekirjar did not bode well for their relationship with the &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s. The vrykul broke their ancient pact with the Thorignir and chose instead to begin enslaving the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. They would launch an all-out assault on &lt;a href=\"Thorim%27s%20Peak\"&gt;Thorim's Peak&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwing%20Rookery\"&gt;Stormwing Rookery&lt;/a&gt; along with their demon allies, with the goal of corrupting the storm drake young for the Burning Legion and seizing the dragons' power. The Thorignir put up a fierce defense of their home, delaying but not stopping the total conquest of the mountain.\nOn the verge of defeat, the Thorignir would ultimately find allies in the form of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;outsiders&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; who sought the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. These champions infiltrated the Drekirjar base in &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt; and caused great damage to the town's defenses. They also proceeded to the summit of Thorim's Peak, where they aided the Thorignir in fighting Skovald and the Drekirjar.\nAs the battle continued, the storm drakes and their allies were able to free the Thorignir broodmother &lt;a href=\"Thrymjaris\"&gt;Thrymjaris&lt;/a&gt; before she fell to corruption. Following this, numerous other drakes who were captured by the Drekirjar were also freed just in time. The Thorignir then prepared themselves at the mountain's peak for a devastating assault on the Drekirjar's city.\n&lt;a href=\"Vethir\"&gt;Vethir&lt;/a&gt; and his allies spearheaded the attack; together, they descended on Hrydshal and bathed the town in lightning, which saw hundreds of Drekirjar fall. Despite the significant setback, the vrykul would continue to try and enslave more dragons, and the Thoriginir would respond by launching more attacks on Hrydshal.\nThe Drekirjar also made several raids into the neighboring region of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;. They would return with numerous prisoners and bring them to Hrydshal. At the direction of &lt;a href=\"Vydhar\"&gt;Vydhar&lt;/a&gt;, the outsiders infiltrated the city and liberated the tauren. Several prominent figures within Hrydshal would also be targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Wardens\"&gt;Wardens&lt;/a&gt; at times throughout the conflict on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Irglov%20the%20Merciless\"&gt;Thane Irglov the Merciless&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tideskorn reborn.\nSometime after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, his daughter and heir &lt;a href=\"Sigryn\"&gt;Sigryn&lt;/a&gt; went on a quest to become the new God-Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt;. Hoping to unite the &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, she first had to contend with claimants from the other Tideskorn factions. She came face-to-face with &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Velbrand\"&gt;Jarl Velbrand&lt;/a&gt; of the Drekirjar in Hrydshal, where he challenged her to combat. Sigryn and her ally were able to overcome Velbrand, who yielded his claim to the throne and pledged the Drekirjar in support of Skovald's daughter.\nVelbrand would then accompany Silgryn to the Halls of Valor during her attempt to kill &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; himself. They were stopped by Sigryn's own ally, the outsider &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; and agent of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, who confronted Velbrand, Sigryn, and &lt;a href=\"Runeseer%20Faljar\"&gt;Runeseer Faljar&lt;/a&gt; of the Bonespeakers. Sigryn returned to her senses before she could take this further, and went to ask for &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;'s forgiveness. She received no punishment, instead the &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; made her God-Queen of the Tideskorn, uniting the Drekirjar and the other vrykul of Stormheim under one banner once more."}

While this is usually true for pure stat-boosting items, some vendors sell fashionable clothes, such as colorful shirts. Use the dressing room to help you choose when to take the plunge and buy something you might otherwise have ignored!\nAlso remember that you can preview items you are unable to wear. Check in with the Battlegrounds or PvP vendors and see how good you will look after your rank or reputation has increased.\n\"Tip:\" When you browse a vendor's wares and use the dressing room feature, you can close the vendor window, keep the dressing room window up and check out another vendor's wares. That way you can, for example, see how a certain weapon available at one vendor looks on you with a particular piece of armor available at another. You can even combine this with other methods, such as the chat link.\nChat.\nAny equipable item link can be previewed with the dressing room. To do so, just Ctrl+Left-Click on an item linked in chat. This technique is very useful to send \"preview\" links for things you can preview normally only on yourself. You can use it to link:\nQuest rewards.\nWhen you take a quest, you can now see how the reward will look on you. Ctrl+Left-Click on the icon and the dressing room window will pop up. If you want to show the new item's look to your guild mates or friends, you can Shift+Left-Click on the item's icon to display a link in a chat line, and they can then also see for themselves how it would look on their own characters.\nProfessions.\nYou can use the preview with any recipe you know, with a Ctrl+Left-Click on the icon of the final product in your professions window.\nTips: You can't preview the recipe's end result unless you have learned the recipe. But, you can always ask higher level crafters to /whisper you back with the item link.\nIf you want to avoid losing money and time when trying to sell crafted equipment, just link the item in chat to a prospective buyer. Keep your components handy to make that item on-demand instead of making one that may not sell.\nGroup loot.\nWith the possibility of previewing loot in a group or raid when an item drops, never-before-seen fashion arguments might start occurring (e.g.: \"But those purple pants will match my dinner set!\"). Thus, it is very important to remember that it is always better to loot only after combat has finished and everyone who died has been revived. Otherwise, the time to roll could run out before anyone had a chance to preview and then roll. If you trust everyone in the group or raid, it is better to have the Master Looter option activated. The master looter can then provide everyone with the links.\nBank and inventory.\nWhen you organize your bank and your bags, it is not always easy to remember the exact appearance of your equipment. And, to equip everything you own can be a major pain. With the dressing room, just organize the items per bag, and if you want to see how they'd look, Ctrl+Left-Click on all of them. This will also help you to not click on \"Binds when equipped\" items and equip them only when you don't want to do so. \nAuction House.\nAs the example in the opening paragraph illustrates, using the dressing room feature in the auction house will help you make up your mind about which item to bid on. If two items are similar in stats, why not go for the one that will look better on you? Likewise, when you obtain \"Binds when equipped\" items in the world, the dressing room feature will help you decide whether you want to keep it for yourself or auction it off."}

A &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt; found him and the small fleet with which he sailed; the dwarf told him of the war and begged him to come to the assistance of Drisburg. Falerevere, who was a staunch believer in human supremacy above the other races, sneered at the dwarf but agreed, and put his sail to the wind.\nUpon sighting Drisburg, the duke saw that the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; had landed a small army on the coast and laid siege to the town. The defenders fired &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s and a few &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s at their besiegers, but there was little they could do. Falrevere calculated and came to the conclusion that if he landed and fought the Scourge, Drisburg would have about a 50% chance of surviving the onslaught, but most of its people, and Falrevere's people, would die. Since many of Drisburg's citizens were gnome and dwarf immigrants, Falrevere's choice was clear. He turned his ships around and bid goodbye to the doomed settlement. Many of his crew members railed against this action. Falrevere threw the loudest overboard."}

Their brutish appearance can hide their cleverness. Having once been the slaves of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; himself, the drogbar have long lived in relative peace with the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, but shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s return the drogbar leader, &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt;, stole the ancient &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, initiating a war between the two races.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; implies that the drogbar are failed &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; creations. The drogbar were once slaves to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; himself, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; the Earth-Warder, and they were the ones who placed the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;-forged &lt;a href=\"Adamantine\"&gt;adamantium&lt;/a&gt; plates on the Aspect when his body began to fall apart. Neltharion also had the drogbar experiment with ways to merge the elements into a &lt;a href=\"Elementium\"&gt;binding ore&lt;/a&gt;. He believed it would be the ultimate tool in his rise to power. There were at least fifty attempts. One revolt occurred before the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; but was swiftly ended by Neltharion. The revolt's leader, &lt;a href=\"The%20Grey%20One\"&gt;The Grey One&lt;/a&gt;, was petrified into a statue as a constant reminder of who the drogbar truly serve. When Huln finally arrived and used the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; to banish Neltharion from the region, the drogbar were freed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane tribe&lt;/a&gt; were the ones to first establish a fragile peace pact between the tauren and the drogbar as a means to survive in relative peace. As part of this agreement, they mutually benefit from one another's resources through trade at designated areas outside drogbar caves. The drogbar provide spell components from inedible plants, rare minerals, gems, potent alchemy and other rarities as a trade offering to the tauren, and in return, the tauren bring the drogbar grain, fish, leather goods, and lumber. They make a mutual exchange at these ritual sites, then go back to their respective homelands. It's a symbiotic relationship \u2014 they don't like each other, but they need each other.\nThe drogbar at one point warred against the followers of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; warlord &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Volund\"&gt;Volund&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, soon after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival, a drogbar leader named &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul the Underking&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the unity of the two races and stole the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact protected by the Highmountain tauren. Using the terrible power of the Hammer, the Underking intends to take control of Highmountain. Not all drogbar work for Dargrul, however. The &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20tribe\"&gt;Stonedark tribe&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt;, in gratitude to an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who saved them from the &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem tauren&lt;/a&gt;, joined the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nThere is also at least one group of neutral drogbar that had a settlement in what is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Feltotem%20Caverns\"&gt;Feltotem Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, but after the Bloodtotem became the Feltotem, these drogbar were pushed out by concerted demon and Feltotem attacks. Their current location is unknown.\nDrogbar that are part of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; can be found in Highmountain's &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Roads\"&gt;Deep Roads&lt;/a&gt;. Another Old God-affiliated group of drogbar is the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrogbar can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nDrogbar are not violent by nature, despite their size.\nLiving in caves, the drogbar make the most of what they have. At least one particular species of &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt; is known to be gathered and prepared for consumption. Rock is used for furniture; tables are an obvious application, while \"resting stones\" are chairs, and long, rectangular slabs are \"sleeping stones\". Stones that make different sounds when struck can used for drums, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Tinkrul\"&gt;tink rocks&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Boprul\"&gt;bop rocks&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Clomprul\"&gt;clomp rocks&lt;/a&gt;\". The drogbar have always been masters at &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, tribal &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; would wear heavy, three-stoned necklaces. These necklaces were passed down from master to student.\nWith their powers over the earth, the drogbar know how to carve stone into containers such as cups and shallow bowls, to ones with lids. With a channel carved around the outside for a leather strap, lidded containers can be small ones with a plug of wood, to large, stout ones with a matching stone lid fitted into the top. Entire waterwheels made of stone are used as a power source for simple engineering, fed by subterranean waterways that flow into the caves. Stone conduits suspended from sturdy wooden supports embedded in the walls also partially redirect subterranean water for the peoples' convenient use. Many of these items are most likely crafted by drogbar Stoneshapers, who are also known to calcify the dead bodies of important drogbar to be commemorated as statues.\nWhile most drogbar appreciate the rough edges of a raw gemstone, others prefer a smoother, rounder jewel. Rather than using standard gemcutting tools, they use a hand-cranked stone device, which tumbles the gems over the course of several weeks. These are typically operated by servants, slaves, or disobedient youngsters.\nFor some, snail racing (including a racing circuit) is a popular pastime. Snails are also used as a culinary ingredient at least by the Stonedark (whether they are the same species as the ones used for racing is unknown).\nThere are rumors that the ancient drogbar collected powder from the residue of dragon's breath.\nThe Basilisk Bazaar is an event held by the drogbar where they trade, fight and skin their lizard pets.\nMagic.\nThe drogbar have a mastery of the earth and creatures that dwell within it. &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; believes that they began learning strong magic after the theft of the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorms.\nThe drogbar have a close kinship with Highmountain's giant &lt;a href=\"worm\"&gt;worm&lt;/a&gt;s. They use caves such as the &lt;a href=\"Rockcrawler%20Chasm\"&gt;Rockcrawler Chasm&lt;/a&gt; to train and breed fledgling rockcrawlers that in time grow in size and strength, morphing into monstrous siege worms that the drogbar ride into battle. The drogbar feed their fledgling worms &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt; eggs so they'll grow strong enough to serve as mounts.\nAn enormous worm called &lt;a href=\"Naraxas\"&gt;Naraxas&lt;/a&gt;, mother of monsters, has been worshipped by the drogbar since the age of Neltharion. Constant sacrifices are made to the creature so she can nurture the generations of horror the drogbar use against their enemies. During the battle of &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, the drogbar used spawn of Naraxas to burrow their way to the surface and deploy their troops.\nThe great worm &lt;a href=\"Jorhuttam\"&gt;Jorhuttam&lt;/a&gt; is worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20tribe\"&gt;Frostcrag tribe&lt;/a&gt; of drogbar.\nLanguage.\nNot much is known about the drogbar language. One of the more common terms is \"brul\", apparently an honorific.\nThe drogbar language shares one term with &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "14532", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14532", "title": "Drop", "text": "A drop is any item obtained from the environment, such as an item looted or \"dropped\" off of enemy &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s or found in &lt;a href=\"chest%20%28container%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. A drop is also known as &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuest drop.\nA drop of a &lt;a href=\"quest%20item\"&gt;quest item&lt;/a&gt;. Many quest items only drop if the player currently has the associated quest in their &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Log\"&gt;Quest Log&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost items that require a drop of only a single item, such as the retrieval of a specific item, or the removal of a head from a named mob, each player in the group that loots the mob can each loot one of the items.\nQuest items that require you to collect a certain number of items can only be looted by one player at a time.\nThe former can be looted by any questholders regardless of loot priority (such as Group Loot or Free For All), the latter are looted as normal. If only one person has the quest to collect a number of items, they may loot from each mob that drops a quest item, regardless of loot priority. They will also be able to loot any money, and start any loot threshold rolling on items whose quality is at or above the loot threshold.\nThere are still other quest items that drop regardless of having the quest or not. Some of these have alternate uses, others are used only for the quest they are attached to. Often they are not soulbound items, and can be traded, sold or bought by and from players.\nThe final Quest Drop is the drop of an item that starts a quest. Each player in the group can loot the item, regardless of loot priority. The quest item may still have a level requirement, and some quest items of this nature can be used in other ways (e.g., Ghosthowl's Pelt may be used as a cloak).\nWorld drop.\nA world drop is a (usually &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20equip\"&gt;bind on equip&lt;/a&gt;) item that has a very low chance to drop from mobs, &lt;a href=\"Chest%20%28container%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, or other sources within a certain level range. Some will only drop from specific types of creatures. World drops are largely impossible to farm for because none of their sources have more than a miniscule chance of dropping them. Because of their rarity, many world drops fetch high prices on the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;\u2014especially those with desirable appearances.\nSome world drops have been affected by the various changes to zones' levels over the years. For example, &lt;a href=\"Oozing%20Bag\"&gt;Oozing Bag&lt;/a&gt; drop from level 40+ &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"worm\"&gt;worm&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"old%20world\"&gt;old world&lt;/a&gt; zones; but as of &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, mobs in these areas only &lt;a href=\"Zone%20scaling\"&gt;scale&lt;/a&gt; up to level 30 unless you're on the relevant &lt;a href=\"Timewalking%20Campaign\"&gt;Timewalking Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinent drop.\nThis isn't a very widely used term, but some uncommon or better random drops are actually restricted by continent.\nFor example, items from the &lt;a href=\"Bristlebark%20collection\"&gt;Bristlebark collection&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bristlebark%20Boots\"&gt;Bristlebark Boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bristlebark%20Bindings\"&gt;Bristlebark Bindings&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) can drop from any mob within a certain level range in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Silver-thread%20collection\"&gt;Silver-thread collection&lt;/a&gt; items (like &lt;a href=\"Silver-Thread%20Gloves\"&gt;Silver-Thread Gloves&lt;/a&gt;) only drop in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nZone drop.\nZone drops are like \"partial\" world drops. They have a very low chance to drop from mobs within a specific &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;, or area. Like world drops, some of them drop from certain types of creatures\u2014such as the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Dredwing%20Pup\"&gt;Crimson Dredwing Pup&lt;/a&gt;, which can drop from any &lt;a href=\"dredbat\"&gt;dredbat&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatic drop.\nA drop that only comes from a specific mob or group of mobs. \n\"Example: The &lt;a href=\"Spellforce%20Rod\"&gt;Spellforce Rod&lt;/a&gt; only drops from &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co.%20Surveyor\"&gt;Venture Co. Surveyor&lt;/a&gt;s in a certain area of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBoss drop.\nA type of static drop that only comes from a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; mob in an &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;. The best ones are usually &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpic drop.\nA drop of an &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; quality purple item inside or outside an &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;. Most drop inside instances, but there are a few that drop outside.\nLegendary drop.\nA drop of a &lt;a href=\"legendary\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; quality orange item inside or outside an &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;. Most drop from the highest level raid instance &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es and then only occasionally. In the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, legendary items drop from dungeons, raids, and world bosses.\nArtifact drop.\nA drop of an &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; quality (brown goldish) item. With the introduction of \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\", many artifact items are now dropped during class-specific questlines and from bosses. "}

The conflict immediately succeeded the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and saw the two factions clash for mastery of the entire continent, as well as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at large.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; set out to conquer the rest of Azeroth so that the orcs would have a new homeworld of their own. He was responsible for instigating a renewed campaign to seize control of the other lands to the north, certain that the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms would avenge themselves if the orcs didn't strike first. At the same time Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, the former Champion of Stormwind, led his surviving people across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the shores of Lordaeron. He met with &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and warned him of the invasion to come. A meeting with the leaders of the other human nations was called and led to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, which would eventually grow to encompass almost all of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;' major races, with Lothar as Supreme Allied Commander.\nThe Horde led two major assaults. The southern offensive was through the dwarven lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; which the Horde conquered, except for the dwarven capital city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and gnomish capital of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. The northern offensive came from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Horde achieved early success by using enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragons\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt; and almost took the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron after &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; betrayed its comrades, the war began to turn in favor of the Alliance due to a number of factors, most notably the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the betrayal of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Outmaneuvered and outmatched, the Horde was ultimately forced to retreat south to its previous holdings. The Alliance armies pushed the Horde back to the bridges of the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; and eventually liberated Khaz Modan during pursuit, then caught up and did battle with Doomhammer's forces in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, the outcome of which proved a decisive victory for the Alliance. However, Lothar had fallen in the battle and leadership was taken up by his second in command, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe war soon came to an end after the final battle at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; which was subsequently destroyed. The conflict had raged on for over a year, and had seen the destruction of villages and populations on an unprecedented scale, leaving entire kingdoms devastated in its wake. The Alliance would last for many years to follow and lead the nations of Azeroth to become more intertwined with each other. Though the Horde found itself thoroughly defeated, the conflict did not secure long-term peace on the continent. Two years later, a new war would once again break out, culminating in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nFollowing the events of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the survivors of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; led by the hero &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; fled north across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the northern kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to beseech aid from King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. The survivors' arrival additionally served as a warning to the other &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nations of the relentless threat posed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;; a threat which could no longer be denied. Following an impassioned plea by Lothar, King Terenas organized a gathering of leaders from all the human nations in Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, an event which became known as the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt;. Having finally awoken to the seriousness of the Horde threat, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s human nations presumably began to pursue large military build-ups in preparation for war.\nMeanwhile, the Horde began to consolidate its new holdings in the far south, further pillaging Stormwind City and effectively destroying all human holdings south of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. In a coup d'\u00e9tat led by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to end what he saw as their corrupting influence over the Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed along with its puppet Warchief, &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, in the final days of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; Doomhammer now fervently pondered the future of his people, and eventually came to the conclusion that the Horde must march against the remaining human nations. Doomhammer was aware of the gathering of leaders in Lordaeron from his scouts and realized that if the Horde did not strike against this threat immediately, then they would surely be overwhelmed by the combined might of their enemies. Thus, Doomhammer began to prepare the Horde to make war once more.\nHistory.\nArming the Horde.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; learned much about &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; politics and culture from prisoners, and came to recognize the strategic and overall symbolic importance of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, to take the capital, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; required more powerful weapons.\nFour years after their arrival on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde's strength was much depleted from constant war, and they now sought means to strengthen itself in preparation for the renewed offensive. Much of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s previously-strong infrastructure now lay in ruins, and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s failed to salvage much of use from the kingdom's ashes. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, had recently unearthed an ancient artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, a disc of immense power dating back to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Potent though it was, the Dragonmaw required more time to fully unravel its secrets, a task given to &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe orcs had recently opened contact with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who were delighted to learn of Stormwind's destruction, having harbored a hatred of humans dating back many years. The trolls pledged to support the Horde in its continued war, on the condition that Doomhammer rescue the Amani leader &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, who had been captured and was currently being held near the town of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; eventually emerged from his magically-induced coma (after attempting to probe the mind of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;) not long after Stormwind's fall. Having purged the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; and other elements of Gul'dan's warlocks from the Horde, Doomhammer fully intended to complete the task by dispatching their leader. Desperate, Gul'dan produced a proposition should his life be spared: disavowing his connection to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he promised to provide the power to create new types of incredibly powerful warriors for the orcs, capable of countering humanity's potent &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s. Though distrustful, Doomhammer gave Gul'dan the chance to prove his worth, and provided his consent for the warlock to form a clan of his own, the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreavers&lt;/a&gt;.\nGul'dan then set about delivering on his promise, though he attempted to ensure that the powerful new warriors created were loyal to him alone. Along with his &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan gathered the spirits of the slain members of his Shadow Council. Though Horde dead were sacred, slain humans would serve as the perfect vessel for these disembodied souls. Eventually, the orc warlock succeeded in infusing the spirit of the once-orc Teron'gor into the corpse of a deceased knight. Teron'gor, now known as &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, would rise as the first of a new type of soldier, the \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;\". These beings wielded &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt;, rather than &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magics, and though their horrifying appearance and foul nature disgusted Doomhammer, their incredible power would be required in the coming conflict.\nThough Doomhammer managed to reinforce the Horde with ogre enforcers, most of the forces on the other side of the Dark Portal couldn't be mobilized in time for the next war. With several new potent weapons in its arsenal, the Horde now looked toward replenishing its armaments, supplies, and other resources. For this, the orcs turned their attention on the nearby &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; kingdom in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion of Khaz Modan.\nOccupied by the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, the region of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; was rich in a variety of resources, including valuable metal ores and oil, in addition to the dwarves' mighty forges. Before launching their assault on &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; thus decided to first seize Khaz Modan, and they quickly began a full-scale invasion of the region.\nSix years after the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the orc army advanced into Khaz Modan amidst a major blizzard, though their arrival did not take the dwarves by surprise. &lt;a href=\"Sapper%23Demolition%20Squad\"&gt;Demolition teams&lt;/a&gt; skillfully collapsed numerous mountain tunnels and passes, delaying the Horde's approach, while the dwarves also contacted their traditional allies: the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, in the west. Together, the dwarves and gnomes pooled their resources to resist the invasion, and established strong defensive positions across Khaz Modan.\nDespite their organization, the dwarf-gnome coalition was little match for the Orcish Horde. Outnumbered, their outposts and settlements eventually fell one by one before the furious advance of the orcish forces. Hundreds were killed in defense of their homeland, but these defenses gradually withered before the onslaught. The dwarves and gnomes ultimately retreated to their mountain strongholds of Ironforge and Gnomeregan respectively.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; focused his attention on Ironforge, seeing the dwarves as the greater of the two threats, and quickly laid siege to the underground city. The dwarves recognized that this would be their last stand and were prepared to die fighting. They mobilized all of their resources and nearly their entire population took up arms to resist the siege. Though the Horde assaulted Ironforge in great numbers, the death toll proved horrendous for the orcs. For every dwarf that fell, ten orcs were brought down with them. Eventually, the cost grew so great that Doomhammer called off the siege.\nAt the same time, some orcish forces also advanced on Gnomeregan, though with similarly disastrous results. The gnomes used their advanced technologies to defend their home, rigging various powerful explosive traps in the forests surrounding Gnomeregan that exacted a bloody toll on the invaders before even reaching the city. When the attackers finally reached Gnomeregan, the city's virtually impenetrable great iron gate withstood weeks of bombardment from Horde siege engines. The siege of Gnomeregan too was ultimately called off.\nThe two cities had proved too costly in time and manpower to take properly, but Doomhammer already had what he needed in the form of Khaz Modan's rich resources. The &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; stationed the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; outside each city, ordering them to keep the dwarves and gnomes contained for the duration of the war. Horde smiths quickly got to work in the region, and before long were fully equipping the Horde with vast quantities of new armaments and siege weapons, placing the orcs one step closer to their goal.\nFormation of the Alliance.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; further marshaled its strength in the south, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt; continued in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Those in attendance still found themselves debating a proper response to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish threat, as well as the merits of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; unity. In attendance were all major rulers of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s human nations, including: &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;King Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Archmage Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;King Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Also present was &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Sir Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, representing the recently-ruined &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nRefugees from &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; brought news of the conflict there, as well as the Horde's intentions on encroaching north; news which shocked the human leaders and gave a sense of urgency to the council. King Terenas and Anduin Lothar pushed heavily for all of humanity's kingdoms to unite into one mighty Alliance in order to defend their people. Lord Admiral Proudmoore was also supportive, largely due to his friendship with Lothar, and King Trollbane's close relationship with Lordaeron also secured his support. Archmage Antonidas too was in favor of an Alliance, having received firsthand accounts of the orcs' power.\nOnly Kings Greymane and Perenolde stood in opposition to unity, at first due to skepticism as to true threat the Horde posed, and eventually out of a fear of losing regional power in the process. Additionally, King Perenolde personally feared that there existed no real hope of defeating the Horde, and King Greymane was adamant that Gilneas would be able to stand by itself without the aid of others.\nThe arguments between the human leaders began to grow so intense that Gilneas and Alterac threatened to quit the negotiations entirely. It was then that &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, one of Lordaeron's most famed &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, stood to address the gathered rulers. With Stormwind's young prince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; at his side, Turalyon delivered an impassioned and charismatic speech, pointing to Stormwind as an example of what awaited any nation that fell to the Horde, and urging those in attendance not to let their pride and lust for power lead humanity to destruction. As he concluded his address, the priest cited humanity's shared virtues of bravery, devotion, and leadership as proof that they could overcome any foe together.\nTuralyon was rewarded with widespread applause, his words having gotten through to even the most doubtful present. That very day, the council voted unanimously to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, comprising all of humanity's kingdoms.\nIt was soon decided that Anduin Lothar would best serve as commander of the new Alliance's military, being from Stormwind and thus occupying a uniquely neutral position among the kingdoms. Lothar accepted the position with humility, recognizing the near-unprecedented power he now wielded as Supreme Commander of the Alliance army; few in history could ever call upon the collective might of humanity combined. Lothar's first order was for the Alliance's forces to gather in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, a region blocking the Horde's advance.\nAmid this preparation, Lothar also began to look into finding something for all the disparate nations to rally behind, irrespective of heritage. Though &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; were suited to this role, they were wholly unfit for the dangers of combat, as evidenced by events in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. A solution was presented by the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Its head, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Archbishop Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, worked closely with Lothar in the formation of a new order of warrior-priests, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s. A handful of chosen knights and other individuals were trained stringently in both the ways of combat and the Light. Representing the highest values of humanity, this group of paladins became known as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaol's training of the paladins training was vigorous, and they accompanied the Alliance army as it massed in Hillsbrad. Each paladin was gifted with a unique and sacred &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt; by the Archbishop which embodied a specific virtue they were to adhere to. Lothar himself was so impressed with their progress that he took paladins &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; as his lieutenants.\nLothar continued to bolster his forces, seeking aid wherever it could be found in preparation for the war ahead. To this end, the Supreme Commander contacted the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; nation of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. As a descendant of the famed king &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar was able to make use of an ancient oath sworn to the ancient king by the high elves in times past, during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the high elves proved reluctant, not viewing the Horde as a serious threat.\n&lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; only subsequently sent a small, token, fleet to aid the Alliance. Some high elves, however, disobeyed the king's orders, choosing instead to join in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and answering Lothar's call to war. Chief among these was the renowned &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; captain &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who led a handful of her kin south with her. Though disappointed with the generally poor response from Quel'Thalas, Lothar nonetheless welcomed those elves who arrived, particularly Windrunner and her skilled rangers.\nPreparing to sail.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms rallied in the north, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; plotted their next move. After crossing the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; just north of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and overrunning more dwarven strongholds at &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt;, the only land route to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; led across the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;, a narrow crossing and one that could easily be fortified and defended. Doomhammer subsequently chose to do the unexpected; the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s would construct a fleet of warships and launch a surprise attack directly into the heart of the humans' lands.\nWith the support of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;, Doomhammer succeeded in convincing the Horde of the plan's merits. Thus, construction of a vast fleet began at a bay in the southwestern &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; (the eventual site of &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;). While the orcs possessed little maritime knowledge, the Horde's &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani trolls&lt;/a&gt; were able to guide them in building varied and crude vessels.\nTo augment this, Doomhammer also enlisted the aid of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. The warchief provided the goblins with vast quantities of gold as payment for new technologies, maps, information, and ship-building services. The orcs had virtually no need for gold currency, and they were still rich in it from plundering the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde and goblins subsequently set to work on constructing the new fleet.\nAt this same time, the Red &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; were on a hunt for the missing artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon had been recovered by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; (through the subtle guidance of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;) and thus Alexstrasza's search eventually led her to the Horde. Disgusted by the violence the orcs' had wrought in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, the Life-Binder and her servants quickly descended upon the one who possessed the Demon Soul: a Dragonmaw orc named &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe red dragons had underestimated Nekros, who was still being guided by Deathwing, and the ensuing confrontation proved disastrous. Unleashing its full and terrible power, Nekros struck out at Alexstrasza with the artifact, forcing the Dragon Aspect to crash into the nearby mountains. Nekros then had Alexstrasza subdued and placed in chains, lashing out at her if she or any member of her dragonflight attempted to intervene. The Dragonmaw now exercised complete control over the red dragons, who desperately feared something would befall their matriarch if they resisted.\nWarchief Doomhammer, overjoyed at the subjugation of the dragons, ordered the Dragonmaw clan to occupy the nearby fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, an old and long-abandoned &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarf&lt;/a&gt; stronghold. The orcs chained Alexstrasza in Grim Batol's depths, forcing her dragonflight to follow. There, Nekros and his followers set about training and fitting the red dragons as they had done with the &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. With the eggs that the Life-Binder continued to produce, the Dragonmaw hoped to create a new generation of loyal and deadly mounts.\nSeas of fire.\nAlthough they had taken efforts to conceal their activities, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s work to build a fleet was eventually discovered by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; scout ships. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s remained unfazed, however, and finished their construction work before eventually boarding the ships. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; remained confident that the Horde would arrive in Lordaeron before the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; could muster an effective defense. The warchief's sights were firmly fixed on Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;; if the capital fell, he believed the fledgling Alliance of nations would subsequently unravel.\nHundreds of ships packed with soldiers and supplies departed from the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; and set a course for human territories. As they traveled through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde fleet was spotted by naval forces under &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and were eventually intercepted near the island of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde's lumbering ships were significantly outmatched by Proudmoore's forces, which hailed from the traditionally-seafaring island nation of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. The human ships were able to easily outmaneuver their enemies, and their cannon volleys succeeded in tearing the orc vessels apart.\nAs dozens of transports sank, and countless Horde soldiers drowned, Admiral Proudmoore redoubled his efforts, realizing that the destruction of the entire orc army was within his grasp. However, the Horde fleet was not alone. Doomhammer, who had been wary of the humans' naval superiority, had ordered the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to supply the newly enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; as support. Though reluctant to do so as battle mount training had not yet been completed, &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; sent three red dragons to protect the Horde fleet as it crossed to Lordaeron. When the Battle of Zul'Dare began, these dragons descended on the Alliance ships, wreathing them in flames.\nUnable to respond to this new aerial threat, and suffering increased losses as a result, Admiral Proudmoore called for a full retreat. As the Alliance armada scattered, the Horde forces were preserved and continued their advance toward &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe shores of Lordaeron.\nWith the Horde's victory at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was unable to oppose &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s landing in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. Very few defenses were pre-existing in the region, and as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; forces rushed to the area they floundered in disarray. The entire Horde army continued ashore (though the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s refused to go any farther and kill any more humans), and began securing territory inland. Doomhammer's forces marched towards the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, which would provide them a clear, if perilous, path to the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlliance forces were hastily ordered to block the orcs' path, which had been predicted by Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. Though all northern and western routes to the capital were now barred, the human armies remained in a brittle state, terrified by the overwhelming numbers and ferocity of their foes. Many were reassured by the presence of the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; who, having completed their training, now rode among the Alliance ranks.\nBefore long, the two sides clashed, constituting the first time the full might of the Horde met that of the Alliance. Amid the carnage, the human forces held; in addition to Lothar's paladins, they were supplemented by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s highly skilled &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as powerful &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. Both groups rained death down on their enemies, slaughtering many Horde warriors. As the fighting intensified, an unnatural and deathly fog crept over the battlefield. Where the mist touched the bodies of the Alliance fallen, they would rise again in undeath and throw themselves back at their former comrades. Heading this effort was a group of hooded, shadowy figures atop skeletal horses; the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe unholy warriors proved highly effective in battle, able to bring to bear potent necromantic magics against their adversaries. Additionally, the death knights had devastating psychological consequences on human soldiers. Deeply horrified by the mounted knights and their magics, the Alliance lines quickly began to buckle. The day was ultimately saved by the paladins, who charged into the fray wielding the full power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Their radiance steadied their human brethren, struck down the reanimated dead, and drove back the death knights' foul mist.\n&lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, and the other paladins used their powers to heal wounded Alliance troops, and boost the morale of those still in combat. Having rallied under the inspirational aura of the paladins, and recovered from their initial shock, the Alliance forces regrouped and slammed into the Horde lines with renewed determination.\nInto the Hinterlands.\nA stalemate eventually developed, with isolated battles continuing across Hillsbrad. Although both sides were evenly matched, Doomhammer and the Horde leadership were aware that as time passed, the Alliance could amass more and more reinforcements. The decision was made to push east in an attempt to find a longer, but unprotected, path to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. For this, Doomhammer needed the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani trolls&lt;/a&gt; to act as guides for the region; the trolls agreed to help on the condition that the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s made good their promise to help free the captured Amani warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Scouts reported Zul'jin's location to the warchief, and Doomhammer wasted no time in organizing a large raiding party to &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20of%20Zul%27jin\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; the prison camp located near &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The warchief's forces easily overwhelmed the defenders and liberated the Amani leader, who was then offered a permanent place within the Horde for himself and his people.\nZul'jin initially refused Doomhammer's proposal, viewing it as a path to servitude under the orcs. After being reassured that he would retain full autonomy over his people, and stand as an equal to the warchief, Zul'jin changed his mind, on a single condition: if the Amani agreed to join, the Horde would help them in destroying their perennial rivals, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The path to the high elven kingdom would require his forces to move farther north than previously planned, yet Doomhammer understood he needed the trolls' support. The Horde's position remained precarious, and he would require every advantage he could muster to ensure victory.\nWith everything prepared, the Horde began to push east. A strong rearguard of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;'s lieutenants, protected the army as it gradually crossed a mountain pass into the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. With the Amani to guide them, the Horde forces traveled relatively quickly through the region, taking a path bound for Quel'Thalas, while Zul'jin rallied all nearby Amani trolls to join in the march. The advance went uninterrupted until winged shadows began to appear in the skies. Rather than the Horde's own &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, these winged creatures proved to be the region's fearless &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;-riding Wildhammer dwarves.\nHighly isolationist, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; was virtually unaware of the Horde's existence, only discovering their presence when they barreled into their territory in the Hinterlands. Based from &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves bombarded the Horde army with &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s from atop their mounts. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Thane Kurdran&lt;/a&gt;, ensured that the orcs were under constant harassment from the skies, viewing the invaders as a threat to the clan's safety. The Horde could field no reliable method to deal with the Wildhammers, all their dragons having remained behind with the ships. As a result, serious losses were suffered as the Horde's numbers were slowly whittled down.\nIn order to resolve this issue, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; led his army in an assault on Aerie Peak itself. With their capital threatened, all Wildhammer forces were recalled to take part in the battle developing outside its walls. Doomhammer then took half his forces and slipped away from the conflict north, leaving the remainder of the Horde to continue the fight in the Hinterlands. The warchief continued north unmolested, just as &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; entered the Hinterlands at the head of the Alliance army. Lothar immediately came to the aid of the Wildhammers, and their combined might eventually broke the siege of Aerie Peak, driving the Horde into the forests.\nIn gratitude, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; pledged his people to the Alliance; the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; gryphon riders to the Alliance arsenal was well-received by Lothar, who was deeply concerned over the Horde's complete aerial superiority in the form of the dragon riders. Lothar and the Alliance soon learned from Kurdran of half the Horde army moving north, information which was received with dread. With Doomhammer having outmaneuvered his forces, Lothar dispatched &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and a large portion of the Alliance army to track down the escaped Horde force. All other routes to the capital were apparently secure, with all paths through the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; having been blocked, and so the remainder of the Alliance army stayed in the Hinterlands to deal with the remaining Horde there.\nAshes of Quel'Thalas.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and his sizeable force continued its march towards the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; uninterrupted, having succeeded in losing the pursuing &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. As they passed the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, Warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; entered the city to rally his entire race to join in the impending assault on their enemies. Whipped into a frenzy, thousands of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s streamed out of Zul'Aman, ready for battle, and marched alongside the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in its advance on high elven lands.\nOuter high elven defenses were easily razed to the ground by an army the size of which Quel'Thalas's citizens had never seen. Though their advance was unstoppable, Horde magic-users soon discovered that their powers were becoming gradually weaker the further they pushed into elven territory. The &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; quickly discovered the source of this anomaly. The \"&lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;\" (meaning \"the Gatekeeper\") was a large magical shield place over Quel'Thalas by its occupants thousands of years ago. Consisting of a network of huge &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s, this defense mechanism prevented outside entities (mainly the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;) from detecting the arcane magics wielded by the elves, and also served to weaken the powers of foreign wielders of magic, such as the trolls or &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough suspicious, the warchief permitted Gul'dan and his followers to dismantle the runestones; doing so would, Gul'dan claimed, remove the dampening effect on the Horde's magic. The warlock and his allies quickly went about reducing one of the great stones, which they would chisel into an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. Harnessing the power inherent in these stones, one of Gul'dan's lieutenants in the form of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; was able to perform a ritual of immense power that could turn ordinary &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;two-headed ogre magi&lt;/a&gt;. These newly-created ogres were incredibly gifted in spell-casting, and provided the Horde with another potent weapon for its upcoming offensive.\nWith the powers of its spellcasters returned, the Horde continued its push through Quel'Thalas. The army ravaged the countryside as it marched, burning villages to the ground and slaying every elf in its path toward the elven capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; issued orders to resist the invaders, calling on his greatest generals and warriors. There seemed to be little hope for Quel'Thalas, however, before the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and a large Alliance army.\nWhile Turalyon deployed his forces against the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; returned to Silvermoon City to meet with her kin. There, she notably brought the head of a freshly-slain &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; warrior before the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, throwing the grisly trophy at King Anasterian's feet. The ranger then implored her king to join forces with the Alliance to push the Horde from their lands permanently. Enraged and moved to action, King Anasterian called for the full mobilization of his armies to take the field. The elven war machine was able to provide many &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Eleven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; for the conflict, as well as numerous craftsmen for the Alliance &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;s. These efforts were largely coordinated by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Now, for the first time in hundreds of years, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and elves were united against a common enemy, and the Horde suddenly found itself at a conspicuous disadvantage.\nUnfortunately for this new union, red &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s soon arrived to drastically turn the tide of battle. Having finally mastered their mounts, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; were now ready to descend into battle with the full might of the enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon-riders' appearance threw the dwarven &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s present into disarray, as they had no experience battling such beasts. The dragon fire decimated the Alliance ranks, burning their troops to cinders. The Horde's actions destroyed much of Quel'Thalas's forests, and soon a firestorm enveloped the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; whose smoke blotted out the sun.\nTo escape the flames, the majority of the high elves took shelter in Silvermoon City. Though they could no longer resist the Horde by force of arms, the elves turned to another source of power for salvation. By harassing the boundless energy of the sacred &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; (the epicenter of high elven power and culture) Quel'Thalas's sorcerers were able to summon a colossal shield around the city. Long having served as a means to build and expand their civilization, the Sunwell now formed a barrier that Doomhammer's forces found impossible to break through. The Horde smashed against the shield time and again, yet even the dragons' fire was unable to pierce the shield.\nWarchief Orgrim Doomhammer was deeply displeased at this turn of events and chafed against the time being wasted on the elven kingdom. His objective since the outset of the Second War had been the fall of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, and the longer the Horde spent laying siege to Quel'Thalas, the higher the likelihood of this goal going unrealized. Although he still had not fulfilled his pact to the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, Doomhammer decided to call off the assault on Silvermoon City and to instead march south, back towards human lands. The path the Horde would travel would take them through the perilous and inhospitable &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the Amani categorically refused to abandon the siege of Silvermoon. They vowed not to cease their assault until all of high elven civilization lay in ruins. Infuriated, Doomhammer was nonetheless forced to leave the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s behind, despite their immense value in the war so far. &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; observed these events with interest, and finally acted on schemes which had been in the making for years. He came to the warchief with a proposal. He claimed that he and his &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; were mere days away from finding a way to break through the elves' shield, and if they remained behind while the rest of the Horde began its march southwest, then they could ensure the destruction of Quel'Thalas before rejoining the Horde with the Amani in tow.\nAs ever, Doomhammer did not trust the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, and yet Gul'dan was able to convince both him and Zul'jin of the merits of this course of action. In truth, Doomhammer had little time to worry about such issues; with the Alliance armies scattered across the east, the Horde would never get a better opportunity to march on Capital City. He agreed to give Gul'dan three days to bring down the barrier, but left behind the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to keep watch on him, and force him to begin the march west if he exceeded his time limit.\nUnbeknownst to Doomhammer, Gul'dan no longer had any intention of wasting his time on Quel'Thalas\u2014or the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, for that matter. A few days following Doomhammer's departure, the warlock gathered his allies and revealed his plans to abandon the Horde in favor of reaching the infamous &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; where, he promised, each and every one of them would be granted unimaginable power. Under the warchief's very nose, Gul'dan had been turning many of the spies placed within his clan to his own side, and they were now loyal only to him. &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; were also committed to following him, and so Gul'dan's plans were set in motion.\nThe Amani, uninterested in Gul'dan's promises, continued their siege of Silvermoon. The Dragonmaw clan was reluctant to risk annihilation by actively engaging Gul'dan and his allies, and so instead chose to depart to warn the rest of the Horde of this betrayal, even as Gul'dan's forces began their journey south. The Amani ruthlessly continued their fight against the high elves, though they were now fighting alone and it was all ultimately in vain. The trolls were eventually beaten back after much bloodshed, Zul'Aman was besieged, and Zul'jin himself was taken captive by a group of rangers led by &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, though he narrowly escaped and went into hiding.\nMeanwhile, the Stormreavers and Twilight's Hammer met little resistance by the time they eventually reached the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. There, they commandeered a portion of the Horde fleet and set off west into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after the beginning of the invasion of Quel'Thalas, a small band of orcs broke off from the main invading force and &lt;a href=\"Razing%20of%20Blackwood\"&gt;burned&lt;/a&gt; the human community of &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; to the ground, killing all of its inhabitants in spite of the valorous defense marshaled by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Garithos\"&gt;Baron Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. His son &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar&lt;/a&gt; was then among the human &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s who were fighting to defend the high elven homelands, and he blamed the Thalassian people for his family's death.\nSiege of Capital City.\nDoomhammer's &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; continued its journey west, eager to reach the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; capital before their prize slipped through their fingers. The primary obstacle in the way of the invaders would be the formidable &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountain range&lt;/a&gt;; if they were adequately defended, these alpine passes could slow Doomhammer's advance for months. Fortunately for the Horde, however, their arrival was greeted by the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, who had an offer. &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;King Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; had, from the beginning, been reluctant to do battle with the Horde, believing them to be unstoppable even by &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;an Alliance&lt;/a&gt; of human nations. The arrival of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s at his doorstep, among them terrifying &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, was the last straw for the King of Alterac.\nTo assure survival, Perenolde sought to make a deal with Doomhammer, even if doing so meant committing high treason and betraying the Alliance. The king agreed to give the Horde safe passage through the mountains in exchange for a promise that Alterac be spared their wrath. The warchief was quick to accept and, with the help of King Perenolde, the Horde army was successfully able to avoid all defensive positions in the mountains as they made swift progress towards the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving in the area, Doomhammer immediately ordered his forces to begin a full siege of the city, understanding that time was of the essence if they were still to claim victory.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance army still in the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; region scrambled to prevent disaster. Though they had suspected for some time that the Horde would eventually move to strike at Lordaeron's capital, yet the sheer speed with which they did so came as a dire shock. None had foreseen the possibility of King Perenolde's betrayal, and the implications were now disastrous. Though Turalyon and most of his army made for the city with all the haste they could muster, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; still doubted that it would fall before reinforcements could arrive.\nWithin Capital City itself, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas II&lt;/a&gt; took charge of the city's defense. The king was not personally experienced in the ways of war, but he was cunning, determined, and highly charismatic. He rallied the city's populace with moving speeches, spurring them on with the knowledge that humanity's future would be decided in the coming conflict. Against advice, the king took a position of the city's very battlements as he personally oversaw the outer defenses. Even Doomhammer himself held a certain respect for Terenas's tenacity, as well as that of his people. Yet, as siege engines continued to reduce the walls of Capital City, the warchief knew that it would inevitably fall as soon as the remainder of the Horde arrived from Quel'Thalas.\nThe three clans\u2014&lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt;\u2014had been left behind to oversee the final destruction of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, yet they were noticeably late in rejoining the main Horde force for the siege. A damning omen came in the form of Turalyon's approach from the east. The arrival of this army drew Horde resources away from the siege, which slackened slightly as a result. Doomhammer did not dread Turalyon and his forces\u2014he dreaded what their appearance represented. If Turalyon had arrived before the other Horde forces, then other Alliance armies were shortly en route as well. The need to breach the city became critical, and although the Horde still possessed the death knights and other powerful assets, they required the numbers of the other three clans to effectively storm the battlements.\nEventually, the Dragonmaw clan arrived alone from the east, reaching Doomhammer's army but bringing calamitous news; Gul'dan had taken the other two clans and fully abandoned the rest of the Horde. The warchief also learned that the Alliance had discovered King Perenolde's actions, and troops from &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; led by King &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; had seized the kingdom and its open mountain passes, blocking them properly. The Horde army in Tirisfal was now completely isolated, and could harbor no hope of receiving additional reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. It was in this moment that Doomhammer understood the campaign was lost; at this point, even if Capital City fell, he would be unable to withstand the full power of the Alliance present.\nFilled with rage at such a momentous setback, Doomhammer gave the orders for a full retreat back to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, sending a Dragonmaw messenger to deliver the same command to the Horde forces still in the Hinterlands. The warchief hoped to regroup what remained of his armies in an attempt to salvage some success from the war. To cover their retreat, the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; riders were dispatched to waylay the Alliance forces, while the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; were given the mission of pursuing and dispatching Gul'dan for his betrayal that may have cost Doomhammer the war.\nFull retreat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was in full retreat as it attempted to escape back to friendly territory and stay ahead of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; armies in ruthless pursuit. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; just managed to break through &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s troops, and made a desperate dash for the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; in the south, closely followed by the primary Horde force under &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. After long weeks of marching and scattered battles with the Alliance, Doomhammer's warriors were in a poor state as they limped into the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;. Time was a luxury they could not afford, however, and they did not pause as they pushed on into the cold mountains of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; proper.\nThe Alliance was quickly able to push enemy forces back across the Thandol Span and retake it, with naval support from the newly-retaken island of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt; were also subsequently liberated as the human armies pushed further south, though &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; was left virtually untouched, with the Alliance unaware of the major Horde presence there.\nAcross the seas, at the newly-raised &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; had finally met his end at the hands of the tomb's &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic guardians. His followers, including the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans, had similarly been slaughtered by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, leading the Black Tooth Grin, had pursued Gul'dan's followers to the island as ordered, and ensured that very few of the traitorous &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;'s lackeys escaped.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; riders sent by Doomhammer eventually found the Black Tooth Grin on their return journey. They relayed the news of Gul'dan's death to the warchief, who relished the news and regretted only not having been able to deliver the death blow. Those forces still returning by sea, however, would be unable to aid Doomhammer's army in its current predicament. The Horde force that arrived in Khaz Modan was less than half its original size, and the warchief understood he would not be able to resist the Alliance in this state. Khaz Modan itself would be indefensible, particularly if and when the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s rejoined the fight.\nDoomhammer sent messengers back to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; itself to gather reinforcements from the savage and bloodthirsty clans who remained behind there. Any soldiers available to fight would be required, and he now designated &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; as the rendezvous point at which the Horde would make its stand. Deep in Horde territory, the mountain's location would allow Doomhammer to trade space for time and make the Alliance pay for every step closer. The &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, which had occupied Khaz Modan for most of the Second War, was given the dire task: they would delay the Alliance army in area for as long as possible to buy time for the rest of the Horde.\nThe warchief also contacted &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Chieftain Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, telling him to gather all of his scattered dragon riders for the final battle. He was also ordered to transport &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and any other &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; immediately, and guard the Black Tooth Grin as they sailed back to safety.\nSupreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; pressed his army to keep pace with the retreating Horde, urging them onward in the knowledge that ultimate victory was within their grasp. A great deal of credit for this swift pace, after months of withering marches and battles, also went to the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s who accompanied the army. Working with the soldiers day and night, healing the wounded, and providing encouragement to the doubtful, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in maintaining high morale and a sense of resolve among the human forces. The Alliance's push into Khaz Modan was rapid, and they quickly defeated the Bleeding Hollow clan.\nNow freed from the invaders, the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; emerged from their cities for the first time in years. They celebrated the lifting of the siege on their homeland and eagerly joined the Alliance, pledging their support to destroy the Horde once and for all. Hunting parties, often led by paladins, scoured much of the region to root out any remaining enemy presence before the main army moved on.\nAt sea, northwest of Khaz Modan, the Black Tooth Grin clan continued their voyage back to Horde-controlled territory. When word reached them of the Horde's retreat to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend and Maim Blackhand altered their course for &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, still under Horde control, and from which they could make their way to Doomhammer. Near the island of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Alliance's navy finally overtook the Horde fleet. &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; once more commanded his ships to strike at the lumbering orc vessels, though this time his forces were supported by dwarven &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s. The agile birds now had experience battling the Horde's red dragons and were able to skillfully outmaneuver their larger foes. Meanwhile, down below, the Alliance fleet virtually annihilated their enemies, blowing Horde ships apart with &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; fire and sending many to a watery grave.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Crestfall\"&gt;Battle of Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; ended in a decisive Alliance victory, securing human naval supremacy against the Horde, and preventing additional enemy reinforcements reaching safety. Dal'rend and Maim's ship, as well as several others, managed to escape the slaughter, though the vast majority of their fleet now resided at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite the presence of the gryphon riders to neutralize the dragon threat, the beasts were still successful in doing terrible damage to Proudmoore's navy. In addition to many ships and sailors lost, including the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;Third Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, the admiral's own son, &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt;, was killed in the dragon's flames, a loss that would forever haunt the commander.\nMarch on Blackrock Spire.\nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army began its advance into the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and toward the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest bastion at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, along with &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, pressed on relentlessly to lay siege to the mountain itself. Despite all his efforts, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; still did not possess the reinforcements he needed nor desired; the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; and their dragons from &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; had not arrived yet, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; had been nearly wiped out at the sea &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Crestfall\"&gt;Battle of Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, and no forces from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; would make it in time to be of any aid. Despite this, Doomhammer refused to bow to defeat, and instead resigned himself to a glorious last stand against his enemies.\nThe warchief called on the Horde to rally and remember its past, stoking their bloodlust and making them eager for the battle to come. Though the siege engines pounding the main gates had not yet breached them, the great doorway to the mountain suddenly yawned open and thousands of Horde warriors spilled out from its depths. Doomhammer himself led the main Horde charge, though he was under no illusions he could defeat the vast Alliance army through sheer force. Instead, he focused on cutting a path toward the Alliance's commander, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, believing that (as with the orcs) the sight of their leader falling on the field of battle would strike a crippling blow to the human ranks. The abrupt and unexpected Horde attack caught their enemies largely off guard, and Doomhammer's suicidal charge eventually allowed him to cut a path to Lothar himself.\nThe Supreme Commander engaged Doomhammer in single combat without flinching, and a duel between the two commanders ensued even amid the carnage going on around them. Much of their forces looked on with bated breath as the sound of sword against hammer rang out across the region. While Lothar was large and powerful, even by orcish standards, and had the advantage of skill and experience, Doomhammer was yet even larger and stronger and had the advantage of fighting in his prime youth. Though both were skilled warriors, the warchief eventually began to gain ground against his adversary; forcing him gradually back with unrelenting ferocity. Ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; shattered Lothar's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Royal%20Sword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; in one great sweep, driving Lothar to his knees. With a final swing of his weapon, the warchief crushed Lothar's skull, killing him instantly.\nThe outcome of the duel between the two warriors had an immediate impact on their respective armies. Heartened to see their leader triumphant, the Horde forces pressed ahead with renewed vigor. Alliance soldiers were meanwhile filled with sorry, fear, and doubt. They were losing their will to fight, as sorrow and despair spread through their lines. Unwilling to accept what was happening around him, however, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, one of the late Lothar's closest lieutenants and friends, unleashed all his holy powers. Radiating pure light from his person, Turalyon blinded all those around him, bringing an immediate halt to the fighting. Instantly, the paladin retrieved his commander's broken weapon from where it lay and knocked a stunned Orgrim Doomhammer unconscious with it in one blow.\nTuralyon took up the mantle of commander, calling on all his allies to fight on, even in such a dark hour. He invoked the memory of Anduin Lothar, pointing to how their commander had never given into despair, even at the very bleakest of moments. As &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Lothar's sons and daughters&lt;/a&gt;, it was their duty to carry on his legacy and fulfill his quest to rid &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; of the ruinous Horde.\nEvery member of the Alliance who heard Turalyon that day was filled with an entirely new sense of hope and justice that rivaled the despair experienced mere moments before. Wasting no time, their new commander reformed their ranks and, with a final battle cry, the Alliance once again crashed into the Horde army. The orcish forces buckled under the impact and were subsequently shattered beyond any hope of recovery. The Horde host scattered in all directions, with many fleeing south back toward the distant &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Some small groups continued to fight on near the mountain; instead of putting them to the sword, Turalyon ensured that these few were overwhelmed and captured alive. The fallen warchief, and all the prisoners seized during the battle, were bound in chains, signifying a definitive end to the conflict.\nDestruction of the Dark Portal.\nThe defeat at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; irreparably shattered &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. A large group of those who fled the battle made their way south, led by the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;. Their intention to reach the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and, by extension, the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, was ruthlessly harassed by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and his armies. They tracked Gorefiend's force as it reached the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was eager to discover the exact location of the mystical portal from which the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s had first invaded their world, which had eluded the human leadership thus far.\nTuralyon and his forces descended upon their enemies just outside the Dark Portal itself. The ensuing battle proved to be one of the most brutal and desperate fought in the war, with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and their death knights battling furiously for simple survival. In the end, they were able to hold off their Alliance foes long enough for the majority of their own forces to escape through the gateway. Unwilling to take the risk of pursuing, Turalyon ordered his soldiers not to follow the Horde through. Instead, he chose to have the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic gateway sealed forever.\nTo carry out this task, Turalyon called upon the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow spellcasters. Together, they gathered around the Dark Portal and channeled an immense spell to rip the structure apart. The incantation succeeded in pulling apart the very threads keeping the rift open, forcing the path to another world to slam shut. The backlash of residual energy blasted apart the stone frame of the Dark Portal in a blinding arcane explosion. As the portal crumbled to dust, the gathered Alliance forces jubilantly cheered the development. The destruction of the gateway to Draenor marked the end of the Second War and, for the vast majority of those gathered, the end of a dark and personal chapter in their lives. The Alliance was victorious, yet the cost had been high.\nAftermath.\nFor the Horde.\nIn the wake of the disaster that was the Second War, the Horde was left fragmented and temporarily broken. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the final days of the war only to be blocked access by the large &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army present. Having failed to arrive in time to take part in the battle at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the Bleeding Hollow now disappeared into the wilds near the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; to plot their next move rather than risk destruction by attacking the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSimilarly, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; had also failed to take part in the final climactic battle. Seeing the Alliance victorious, and still remaining undiscovered, the Dragonmaw now fortified themselves within their fortress at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. There, they continued their work of breeding and training &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, to be used as a powerful weapon should the need arise.\n&lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; had also survived the war. They had continued their sea voyage back to Horde territory, and arrived at Blackrock Mountain some time after the battle there. Hiding their presence, they succeeded in gathering other Horde survivors (mainly from the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;) and reoccupied the stronghold in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; when the Alliance eventually pulled out of the region. The two sons of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; now formed what they deemed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;\"true\" Horde&lt;/a&gt;, renouncing the failed leadership of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;the previous warchief&lt;/a&gt; and ruling their new faction as they saw fit. They contacted several other fragmented groups, such as the Bleeding Hollow and Dragonmaw clans, in their attempt to reforge the once-mighty Orcish Horde. Though Kilrogg Deadeye had no interest in joining what he believed was a \"false\" Horde, the Dragonmaw agreed to pledge their support.\nOther isolated Horde elements remained scattered throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, alone or in packs. Members of the Alliance, often in groups, dedicated their time to hunting down these individuals. The famed &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; became one notable example, and the hatred harbored by these hunters often led them to kill their prey on sight. As they combed the vast wilds and remote mountains, many of the orcs found were captured and placed with the multitude already in captivity from the war.\nLife for the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, remained bleak. Those who escaped there at the end of the Second War returned to a world dying from &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies, where all natural life remained on the brink of extinction. Though many of these orcs felt only despair at this time, the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; remained hopeful of future success. He began to formulate a plan that may have yet brought about the salvation of the Horde, and he would eventually find the perfect ally for this in the infamous former &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the Alliance.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; struggled to maintain its existence, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; enjoyed victory celebrations in every city. All of its varied races\u2014&lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014were united in commending the great victory achieved. Despite such jubilation, the peoples of the Alliance were also struck by the terrible cost of such a victory. The &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; had been rocked by war for the last seven years; countless villages and cities had been razed by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and thousands of soldiers and civilians had been slain in the savage conflict, from the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; to the forests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the surviving combatants were forever haunted by physical and psychological wounds suffered in the war, with plenty having experienced or outright witnessed the deaths of numerous loved ones.\n&lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s death weighed heavily on a great many in the Alliance, who had long looked to him as a source of inspiration and hope. An immense stone statue of the fallen commander was subsequently erected on the very spot where he was slain in the final battle at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and points towards the distant spire. Ironically, the materials used to construct the memorial were hauled by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; prisoners put to work following the war's end.\nIn the wake of war, Quel'Thalas proved to be a reluctant member of the Alliance at best. Relations deteriorated as the human kingdoms began to distance themselves from Quel'Thalas, and the elves in turn started to view the deteriorating coalition with increasing coldness. &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; perceived the Alliance's retreat to Lordaeron during the war as a betrayal which left the elves to deal with the rampaging &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; alone. Anasterian claimed that the Alliance had abandoned Quel'Thalas in its darkest hour, and while not all of the high elves agreed with this assessment, a significant portion did.\nThe tension eventually came to head when King Anasterian withdrew his support from the Alliance entirely. The official stance was that the humans' poor leadership resulted in the burning of &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; reminded him of the many humans who gave their lives to protect Quel'Thalas); in addition, with Anduin Lothar dead and the Horde defeated, Anasterian considered the debt to &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; and his descendants repaid. With few exceptions\u2014including some elven &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sorceress\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es, as well as Anasterian's son and heir, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Kirin Tor of Dalaran\u2014the majority of the elven race shut themselves inside their enchanted kingdom.\nIn the aftermath of the Second War, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; commander &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, having led the Alliance armies to final victory in the conflict, now focused on doing whatever he was able to rebuild. He helped to organize a gathering of Alliance leadership in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, where many of the key issues still facing their people were discussed and addressed. From the outset, these leaders agreed to pool their nations' resources in rebuilding their war-torn kingdoms. Notably absent from these discussions was the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Alterac&lt;/a&gt;; a verdict on how to deal with the mountain nation for its betrayal was still being awaited.\nAn important item on the agenda became the reconstruction of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the first victim of the Horde's invasion of their world during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. King Terenas II fully pledged his support to this end, and personally guaranteed the eventual ascension of the young &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to the throne of Stormwind. Stormwind itself soon became a potent symbol of humanity's future, with many viewing its rise from the ashes as proof that others could do the same. Although many Stormwindian refugees in Lordaeron returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to help rebuild, many more chose to stay. To these individuals, their old home was a reminder of all they had lost, and they preferred to continue with their new lives in Lordaeron.\nTuralyon himself personally oversaw much of Stormwind's reconstruction, and while he did so his fellow &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s went to work in Lordaeron. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;'s purpose and duties did not disappear with the defeat of the Horde. In coordination with the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, these paladins dedicated themselves to healing the sick and providing shelter and support to the many victims of the war.\nThe question of what to do with the vast quantities of captured &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s became one of the more controversial issues facing the Alliance. The kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; argued for the execution of the prisoners, though Lordaeron itself was against the idea. They argued that the Alliance's capacity for mercy is what elevated them above the callous Horde. In keeping the tenets of civility and honor, they proposed the orcs be locked away in Alliance-funded &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Internment%20Act\"&gt;Alliance Internment Act&lt;/a&gt;, where they would no longer pose a threat. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; also supported this course of action; they were eager to study the orcs (particularly their strange magics) and asserted that doing to would give them a strategic advantage if war ever broke out again.\nAn agreement was finally reached: the Alliance would fund the construction and maintenance of a series of internment camps to house the captured orcs, which would be overseen by &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, one of Stromgarde's most celebrated warriors. If order could be effectively preserved, then the camps would be allowed to remain. If not, the Alliance would revisit execution. The camps would ultimately prove tenable, though much bitterness remained over their existence. King Terenas was subsequently forced to levy a new tax in order to effectively pay for the vast camp system, an act which inspired some unrest within the kingdom. Gilneas still regarded the camps as a pointless burden on the Alliance, which was already spending a fortune on Stormwind's reconstruction. This controversy would eventually serve to drive Gilneas away from the Alliance in the years that followed.\nFor Azeroth.\nAs the rest of the Alliance busied itself with other matters, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; (newly appointed to the role of &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt;) remained far to the south, watching over the location where the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; once stood. There, he monitored the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies still seeping from the vicinity. When the Dark Portal was active, this energy killed much of the land in the surrounding region, yet this did not cease even after the portal's supposed destruction. Khadgar soon discovered the reason for this. A connection, in the form of a lingering dimensional rift, still existed between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough he could not close this rift, Khadgar and his magi were able to hold the fel energy at bay, preventing it from spreading across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and bleeding the land of life as it had done on the orc homeworld. These findings were quickly brought to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leadership, with the warning that so long as the connection between the worlds existed, another invasion would remain a possibility. Khadgar called on the Alliance to fund the creation of a fortress from which his magi could monitor the rift and continue to negate the spread of the fel. After some debate, the request was approved, and &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; arose on a hill overlooking the southern portion of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; (now the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;).\nUltimately, the invasion Khadgar feared would eventually come. Under the leadership of the orc &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, a reformed &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; would once again charge through the rift between the worlds. The invasion's goal, however, would not be conquest, and a prepared Alliance would soon find itself launching its own invasion, &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;this time of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;evlplayer&gt;\n&lt;/evlplayer&gt;"}

Strictly speaking, the term refers to the latter half of the conflict usually called the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; (specifically, the part of the Third War from &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s summoning at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to his fall at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;), though numerous other events, namely the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; were lead-ins or preparations for the conflict. The invasion is divided in three parts:\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was a lead character in this invasion, and attempted to completely destroy &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. As he climbed the tree, the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; was sounded, calling countless of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s to self-destruct simultaneously while attacking Archimonde. This failed with &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s death on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. It is analogous to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchimonde then proceeded with the original objective of the invasion. The mighty demonlord carried out the invasion to attack the World Tree. By draining Nordrassil's energies, not only would Archimonde gain untold power, his demonic Legion will also be able to drain the night elves of their source of power and immortality. But &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had allied with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowtooth%20clan\"&gt;Shadowtooth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dark%20troll\"&gt;Dark Trolls&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barkskin\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolgs&lt;/a&gt;. Archimonde's &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;ascent up Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; was agonizingly slow, being forced to destroy every successive base with the help of &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe bases, consisting of the humans, orcs, and night elves, did slow his ascent - however, his cunning mind and monumental power enabled the Legion to defeat the bases very quickly, going up against the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;, until he reached the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; base which he destroyed easily with a wave of his hand. He grew in size as he climbed, determined to destroy the World Tree. He calculated no one in the world at the time had the power to stop him. Yet he miscalculated. It was not someone who could destroy him but rather many. Archimonde did not think that the gathering wisps were of threat to him or the demons. \nAs Archimonde climbed, Malfurion raised the Horn of Cenarius and called to the ancestral guardians. They rose from the forest and amassed around Archimonde. They fell upon him, detonating in a massive explosion that destroyed the demon warlock and incinerated the forests around the World Tree; nature herself would not allow his defilement to occur."}

Plus, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; has kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 but to what nefarious end?\nPlot.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; is once again assaulted by &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;'s whispers. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; (still possessing &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt;) urges the boy to ignore the voices and instead give himself to the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for unimaginable power, an offer which Med'an resists. &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; reflects that the youth's growing power has made him the prize in a battle between two dark entities and that he won't be able to hold them both off forever. The &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; steps forward and taunts Kathra'natir into releasing Valeera and possessing him instead, pointing out that after three thousand years, the dreadlord is still too weak to do anything except possess a frail child. Incensed by the challenge, Kathra'natir's spirits erupts from Valeera's body and surges into the mage. After a moment of silence, Meryl regains control, though his white eyes now glow red. Valeera thanks him for freeing her. Meryl makes her promise to tell no one about his possession, then teleports himself, Med'an, and Valeera back to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, where they meet with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon seeing Med'an, Aegwynn realizes with a start that he looks like &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and, like her son, is a beacon of power. While Jaina, Med'an, and Valeera walk to Garona's cell, Meryl and Aegwynn talk about Med'an's parentage; more specifically, that he is the son of Medivh and Garona. Aegwynn points out that Med'an is only an adolescent even though Medivh was killed almost thirty years ago. Meryl posits that it's due to the boy's mixed blood; &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, and something else. He confides that he hasn't had time to tell the boy about his father, and either way Med'an only just went through the shock of learning about his mother. Meanwhile, Jaina, Med'an, and Valeera enter Garona's cell only to discover that she has disappeared. Med'an wants to go out and search for her, but Jaina tells him that he needs to stay and rest for the night.\nMeanwhile, Garona awakens in &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt; and sees her captor, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, standing over her. She immediately tries to attack him, but he reveals that he is her uncle and that she is actually &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, she is the result of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; breeding one of his warriors to Maraad's sister, and Maraad has been searching for her ever since he learned of her birth. Startled by the revelation, Garona remembers being raised in &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; and hated by the other orcs for being ugly and deformed; a \"wrong\" face, feet that almost looked like hooves, and a somehow more human-like appearance. Gul'dan lied that she was &lt;a href=\"half-human\"&gt;half-human&lt;/a&gt;, sent her to Medivh, and compelled her to kill &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt;. Garona tells Maraad that &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; still has Gul'dan's control word and could compel her to kill again. Since Maraad isn't able to remove the control, at least not yet, Garona concludes that the only way for her to be free is to kill Cho'gall or die.\nIn Theramore, Med'an overhears Meryl and Aegwynn talking about him. Aegwynn asks Meryl to find Garona, since Jaina will be bound by her promise to Varian to recapture the assassin. Shortly after, Valeera eavesdrops on Meryl telling Aegwynn that he's found Garona in Onyxia's Lair. The &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; immediately sets off for the cave on a &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;, with Med'an pursuing her on a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThinking that her son is still held by Cho'gall in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, Garona prepares to leave Onyxia's Lair to rescue the boy but is interrupted when Valeera arrives. Maraad offers to distract the elf while Garona slips outside. As soon as Valeera enters the lair, Maraad attacks her. As they fight, the blood elf and draenei both demand to know what the other is doing in the cave.\nGarona steals Valeera's wyvern and flies off but is met by her son, who explains how he was rescued. Garona replies that she needs to leave and is a danger to Med'an until the magic on her mind has been removed, which is why she left him with Meryl in the first place. She tells her son to meet with Maraad in the cave below, wait with him and Meryl, and tell Jaina Proudmoore everything he knows, since they may need to stop Cho'gall if she fails in her venture. First, however, he'll also need to rescue Valeera from the fight with Maraad. Mother and son part ways, both telling each other to be careful.\nMed'an quickly enters the lair and pushes Maraad and Valeera apart with a blast of wind. Maraad realizes that the boy is his grand nephew. Suddenly, the voice in Med'an's head returns and assaults him with more whispers.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; says a solemn farewell to Varian and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; as he prepares to depart with the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to establish &lt;a href=\"Fordragon%20Hold\"&gt;a base&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar&lt;/a&gt;. As the king and prince watch Bolvar leave, Anduin wonders if there's something wrong with himself for wishing for peace even though Varian loves to fight. The king assures his son that he is a valiant boy, and it is perhaps Varian that there is something wrong with for feeling most alive in battle. Varian continues that a &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;terrible war&lt;/a&gt; is coming, but hopefully after the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; has been defeated, Anduin's time \u2014 a time of peace and healing \u2014 can begin. The king finishes by telling his son that \"when that day comes, you will be greater than I\".\nBack in Onyxia's Lair, Maraad heals Med'an with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, quieting the voice in his head. As Med'an prepares to teleport himself, Maraad, and Valeera to Theramore, he asks his uncle to teach him to wield holy magic, which Maraad agrees to. The group arrives in Theramore and meet with Jaina, Aegwynn, and Meryl. Maraad explains that he was led to Garona by a vision telling him that his niece would be instrumental in saving &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and could help avert a coming catastrophe.\nMed'an, Aegwynn, Maraad, Meryl, Valeera, and Jaina gather around a table to pool their information and decide what to do next. After recounting what they know of Cho'gall's plans, they conclude that with the armies of Azeroth focused on the Lich King, the best way to deal with the threat is to reform the ancient &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Privately, Aegwynn thinks to herself that she'll soon need to tell Med'an the truth about his father.\nGarona arrives in Ahn'Qiraj on her wyvern and lands on top of a structure from which she overhears Cho'gall talking to his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; minions. The &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; curses \"the boy\", remarking that he is as powerful as the prophecy said. The boy's power could supposedly release Cho'gall's master or destroy it, but his stubborn refusal to serve has left them with no choice. As he hears his master's voice in his heads, Cho'gall yells: \"BRING ME THE BOY! BRING ME MED'AN!\""}

Fighting a character of much higher level will generally present a significant challenge, while fighting a character of much lower level will generally prove far easier.\nHowever, level only determines each character's base stats. Mob and NPC abilities and strengths vary according to type and rarity. While the power of player characters may be roughly gauged by their level, &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt;, abilities and play skill can much a very large difference to a character's capabilities, and level should not be used as a direct measure of a player character's strength. Nonetheless, increased level provides an advantage for any character.\nPlayer level.\nLevel for player characters has additional significance. Abilities are made available to players as they increase in level; new areas become viable for questing and exploration; new &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s are granted; and new dungeons and battlegrounds become available.\nMost &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s have a minimum character level, which the player must meet before accepting the quest or equipping the item. Quests of similar level should be of similar difficulty to complete and items of similar level and &lt;a href=\"rarity\"&gt;rarity&lt;/a&gt; should have similar &lt;a href=\"stat\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLeveling.\nMost player characters start at level 1; &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt;s are notable exceptions. Players can increase a character's level by gaining &lt;a href=\"experience%20point\"&gt;experience point&lt;/a&gt;s. This process is known as &lt;a href=\"leveling\"&gt;leveling&lt;/a&gt;, and will steadily increase the character's &lt;a href=\"stat\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt;s, grant them access to new abilities, allow them to access new quests, equip more powerful gear, and access more challenging content. \nPlayer leveling is limited by the current &lt;a href=\"level%20cap\"&gt;level cap&lt;/a&gt;, and cannot advance beyond this level. Players below the level cap generally seek to increase their level through &lt;a href=\"questing\"&gt;questing&lt;/a&gt; and other activities. Once a character reaches max level, they are able to access the &lt;a href=\"end-game\"&gt;end-game&lt;/a&gt;, where the focus shifts from gaining experience and learning new abilities to tackling challenges and acquiring epic rewards. Player level can also be limited by not having purchased the latest &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;, or by running the game's &lt;a href=\"Starter%20Edition\"&gt;Starter Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nA portion of leveling can be skipped by purchasing and using a &lt;a href=\"Character%20Boost\"&gt;Character Boost&lt;/a&gt;.\nColors.\nThe characters and mobs you come across in your travels will have their &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; (determined by level) indicated with a color.\nLevel squish.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%209.0.1\"&gt;Patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt; implemented a level squish, which reduced levels across the board in order to make each level feel more meaningful, and to make leveling rewards such as abilities feel less sparse.

{"id": "17005", "revid": "5235176", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17005", "title": "Level cap", "text": "A level cap is the maximum &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; can reach in-game. With the release of \"\", this is level 70. The level cap is changed with the release of each &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe level cap represents the ultimate goal and culmination of the leveling process, with max-level characters having gained access to all class abilities and talents, and being able to access &lt;a href=\"end-game\"&gt;end-game&lt;/a&gt; content and equip the most powerful gear. By providing an equal limit for the progression of all characters, the level cap allows for competitive and balanced gameplay in both PvE and PvP. \nNote that character level is limited by &lt;a href=\"account\"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; type, with only players who have purchased the latest expansion able to reach the current level cap. With the release of \"Shadowlands\", \"Battle for Azeroth\" was added to the base game, requiring only a &lt;a href=\"subscription\"&gt;subscription&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"game%20time\"&gt;game time&lt;/a&gt; to start leveling up to 50. The has a level cap of 20.\nThe game is not over at the cap.\nWhen the level cap is reached, players who are used to the leveling game sometimes have difficulty working out how to continue their adventures. After reaching the cap, however, is where the game developers are hardest at work for the players.\nOnce characters reach the level cap, gameplay turns from &lt;a href=\"leveling\"&gt;leveling&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"end-game\"&gt;end-game&lt;/a&gt;. This represents the culmination of the leveling process and the beginning of the deeper challenges awaiting max-level characters. While play prior to this point is oriented around accumulating experience and gaining new skills, the end-game represents the polished 'final destination' for players, at which characters are fully developed and ready to tackle the biggest challenges in the game, or to relax and make their own adventure. \nFor a guide, see &lt;a href=\"End-game\"&gt;End-game&lt;/a&gt;.\nPower overwhelming.\nPlayers at max level are at the pinnacle of the leveling tree, with a strong advantage over those still struggling below. Zones that were once challenging are now easy; even group content from earlier levels can now be soloed at will. Combat with characters below max level is very likely to end in the max level player's favor.\nThe dark side of this disparity is &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt;; max level players are able to easily disrupt questing areas in use by players of the opposite faction, and can &lt;a href=\"one-shot\"&gt;one-shot&lt;/a&gt; most enemy characters. Sadly, even &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;s in most areas are unable to stand against well-equipped max level players, especially as the current expansion progresses and gear steadily increases in power. Of course, the best answer to this is usually to recruit some max level players of your own faction, or switch to a max level &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;, and make the griefer regret the day they flew into &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are various upsides to this imbalance. Max level players are able to complete lower level content with ease, allowing them to swiftly complete missed quests and achievements in earlier zones, and can travel through zones without being constantly attacked, since mobs will only attack players several levels higher than them if walked directly into. Max level also makes it possible to solo earlier group content such as dungeons and even raids, making farming loot such as mounts far easier, and for those interested in a challenge opening up a new subtype of play at slightly higher levels. \nMax level players are also in a good position to help lower level players, through assistance against griefers, providing buffs, items or gold, or helping them with group quests or difficulties. Max level players often help &lt;a href=\"guildmate\"&gt;guildmate&lt;/a&gt;s level their characters, and may also be able to help with transport if they have a two-person mount.\nNotes.\n \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" originally had a level cap of level 60, but as expansions are released, the level cap is increased by 5 or commonly 10."}

It is one of the core systems of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", which can be seen as a game divided in two parts: the game during leveling a character and the \"&lt;a href=\"end-game\"&gt;end-game&lt;/a&gt;\". Game features such as new &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s are unlocked gradually while leveling in order to ease the overall learning process, and to prepare the player for use of a full set of &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; as well as the widest array of available &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s and other challenges reserved for end-game. It can also be applied to &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s where one tries to gain more skill levels or points. Leveling in a manner as quick and efficient as possible is called &lt;a href=\"power%20leveling\"&gt;power leveling&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvolution.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nOn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\"'s release, leveling was primarily achieved through &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, fighting &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;non-player enemies&lt;/a&gt;, and venturing through instances. Each &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; was designed for a specific level range, and &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player\"&gt;player versus player&lt;/a&gt; activity didn't reward any experience points. Players could boost their gains only by &lt;a href=\"Rest\"&gt;resting&lt;/a&gt;: staying in major cities or inns (logged in or logged out of the game). There was a &lt;a href=\"level%20cap\"&gt;level cap&lt;/a&gt; of 60.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn \", the level cap was raised to 70.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn \", the level cap was raised to 80 and many changes arrived to the leveling process. With &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2&lt;/a&gt;, experience could now also be earned by completing objectives in &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Heirloom\"&gt;Heirloom items&lt;/a&gt; were also introduced to the game: these items scale with player level and offer bonuses to experience earned from completing quests and killing &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. These experience bonuses stack with each other and with the &lt;a href=\"rested\"&gt;rested&lt;/a&gt; bonus. &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Wintergrasp\"&gt;Essence of Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; was introduced as well: a &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; that is available for every player in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, as long as their own faction controls &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Looking%20For%20Group\"&gt;Looking for Group&lt;/a&gt; tool also facilitated dungeons in the game, making a lot of players opt to level only through this system.\nCataclysm.\nWith \", the questing process was completely revamped in the original zones of the game, introducing Blizzard's modern approach to quest design. The level cap was also raised to 85.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn \", the level cap was raised to 90.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nIn \"\", the level cap was raised to 100, and the heirloom system was enhanced, allowing &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s to create their own copies of unlocked heirlooms for free. Additionally, \"Warlords\" introduced an &lt;a href=\"Chauffeured%20Chopper\"&gt;heirloom mount&lt;/a&gt; which can be used from level 1.\nLegion.\nIn \"\", the level cap raised to 110. The developers also loosened the linearity of the questing experience, by enabling a &lt;a href=\"Zone%20scaling\"&gt;zone scaling system&lt;/a&gt; in the new zones of the expansion. This allowed the player to choose any zone order when leveling from 100 to 110, with quest rewards and monsters scaling accordingly to the player's level. In &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.5\"&gt;patch 7.3.5&lt;/a&gt;, this system was expanded to the rest of the game's zones:\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn \"\", the level cap was raised to 120. New &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt; characters started at level 20 instead of level 1. A &lt;a href=\"Party%20Sync\"&gt;party sync&lt;/a&gt; feature was also released in &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.5\"&gt;patch 8.2.5&lt;/a&gt;, allowing players to scale down to help lower-level friends in earlier levels and to replay quests with them. The &lt;a href=\"Recruit-A-Friend\"&gt;recruit a friend program&lt;/a&gt; bonuses and rewards was also revamped in this patch.\nShadowlands.\n\"\" will bring a level squish reducing the current max level from 120 to 50, new level 50 to 60 zones in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, and a new starting zone called &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt; from level 1 to 10. Old players will still be able to choose in which starting zone they will begin, and which expansion they will level from level 10 to 50, but new players won't have this option, instead they will have to do Exile's Reach and level in \"Battle for Azeroth\". Core race &lt;a href=\"hero%20class\"&gt;hero class&lt;/a&gt; characters will start at level 1 instead of at higher levels. Allied races will start at level 10 instead of 20."}

He is the supreme leader of the Oculus and the &lt;a href=\"ley-line\"&gt;ley-line&lt;/a&gt; conduit operation. The battle against him involves the use of the drakes.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Even heroes will tremble before Eregos, protector of the Oculus, defender of the ley line conduit, and executioner of interlopers. He will accomplish these tasks with the conviction of prophecy, securing the &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Spell-Weaver&lt;/a&gt;'s utter dominion over all things arcane.\"\n(Player Controlled) Drake Abilities.\nAmber (DPS).\nNote: \"Charges\" for the Amber drake are per drake / per target. i.e. One drake cannot use up the charges placed by another. So, for the final boss, you should alternate between using Temporal Rift and Shock Lance. Use Temporal Rift until *your* stack of charges reaches 10, then Shock Lance, then back to Temporal Rift. You DO NOT need to channel Temporal Rift for the full duration to reach 10 stacks! The rate that stacks are added depends on how much other damage is being done to the boss while you channel. If you use Time Stop, every mob present will immediately gain 5 stacks for you. This is a very handy tool for whelp cleanup since whelps with 5 stacks can be one-shot using Shock Lance.\nRuby (Tank).\nNote: As long as the ruby drake is mindful to use Martyr as often as possible, it really doesn't matter who has aggro from the boss - all damage will be redirected to the ruby. Evasive Maneuvers allows you to evade the damage from Martyr.\nEmerald (Healer).\nNote: As long as the amber drakes keep Temporal Rift up, it is quite easy for a single Emerald drake to keep Touch of the Nightmare up while also healing. The Temporal Rift debuff doubles the self-healing from Leeching Poison so you have plenty of HP to burn, and you only need to refresh it every 30 seconds.\nNote: It helps a great deal to keep three stacks of Leeching Poison rolling on Eregos. This usually requires ending Dream Funnel or Touch of the Nightmare early, but prevents you from having to reapply all three stacks of the poison again.\nStrategy.\nNormal Mode.\nEregos is a much simpler fight than previously, a standard 'cookie cutter' group is a ruby drake, an emerald drake, and three amber drakes. Please note that players' roles in the combat party do not matter when choosing a drake, the only factor to consider is gear quality. Since the drakes' abilities scale based on gear, everyone should equip their highest &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; equipment in every slot, regardless of stats. \nAt the beginning of the encounter the ruby drake should pull and use searing wrath as fast as possible while the emerald drake stacks leeching poison to three, during this time all three amber drakes should use temporal rift.\nOnce enough evasive charges are accumulated the ruby drake should use the martyr ability followed by evasive maneuvers with the emerald drake ready to restore lost health with dream funnel.\nAmber drakes should wait to use their shock lance until they have 10 shock charges on the boss. When the boss enrages, time stop should be used. Players should clearly establish a use order in advance to prevent unneeded time stops.\nThe ruby drake should not worry about losing threat once the initial round of shock lances from the amber drakes has passed, but should still use searing wrath to continue to help amber drakes generate shock charges. From here the main role of the ruby drake is to pick up whelps in order to continue to generate evasive charges for the martyr and evasive maneuvers combo.\nThe emerald drake should also keep leeching poison to three stacks at all times and not worry about adds. If the group is not taking considerable damage the emerald drake can use touch the nightmare, preferably while temporal rift is on the boss. Be aware that the boosted damage will likely cause the emerald drake to get top threat, so use this only if there is no threat of dying immediately.\nDone right, Eregos should fall quickly, in roughly two minutes or less, depending on the group.\nHeroic Mode.\nThere is very little difference in this fight in terms of group makeup, however Eregos gains a new ability in heroic that players should be aware of called Planar Shift.\nEregos will use this ability twice during the encounter, during which time he will be immune to all damage and create several planar anomalies that will float towards players. These must be avoided at all cost, preferably with the group sticking together, however some players prefer to scatter and regroup once planar shift ends. The danger in scattering is that if a drake is hurt badly during this phase the emerald drake rider may not be able to get in range to heal the drake before it dies.\nEmerald drakes should not attempt to heal during a planar phase as they cannot move while channeling, save any healing for after the phase ends as it is far worse to lose the emerald drake than to lose a ruby or amber drake.\nOther than the planar phase this fight is mostly unchanged and the normal mode strategy works well.\nVoid Strategies.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Void\"&gt;Ruby Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps the simplest void to do, it is recommended that you use two emerald drakes and three amber drakes, however a well geared and experienced group could use one emerald and four amber drakes.\nThe key to winning this fight use keeping leeching poison stacked at all times while all amber drakes use their temporal rift to build 10 shock charges and then use shock lance. It is also good for one emerald drake to be in charge of keeping touch the nightmare on the boss to reduce his incoming damage.\nTime stops should be saved until Eregos enrages, it is vital that an order is established so that no unnecessary time stops are wasted.\nThe emerald drakes can easily control any whelp adds by using their tab target to stack leeching poison on them, however they should ensure that they don't let the poison drop from the boss because it is vital to keeping the dps from the amber drakes very high.\nFor an alternative method, see the Amber Void strategy.\n&lt;a href=\"Amber%20Void\"&gt;Amber Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso relatively simple to accomplish, players can simply choose five emerald drakes for this achievement, or four emeralds and one ruby to mitigate damage. Using five emeralds will allow players to get the Ruby Void achievement at the same time.\nSimple enough, players need only keep leeching poison stacked to three at all times while taking turns using Touch the Nightmare. Ideally, by rotating the use this will cause Eregos to switch targets if he is dealing too much damage to a single drake. This negates the need of having to use dream funnel to heal another player.\nWhen whelps appear simply stack leeching poison on them. Also ensure that touch the nightmare is reapplied after each planar phase.\nIf a ruby drake is also present they should pick up whelps to generate evasive charges for a martyr and evasive maneuvers combo with emerald drakes keeping the ruby drake alive via dream funnel\n&lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Void\"&gt;Emerald Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is possibly the most difficult of the three voids to achieve, but can be accomplished with four amber drakes and a ruby drake. It is not recommended to attempt this achievement without a well geared group.\nThe key to this strategy is for the ruby drake to pick up the boss initially while the four amber drakes use temporal rift on the boss. The ruby drake will build charges for the amber drakes, once 10 shock charges are up all but one amber drake should shock lance. At this point it is nearly impossible for the ruby drake to regain top threat on the boss.\nFrom this point, the amber drake who did not shock lance the first round should wait until the other amber drakes have temporal rift on the boss again, this will cause the other drakes to immediately have 10 shock charges thus allowing for a very high speed burst of the boss.\nIf this is done well enough the boss will planar phase very fast leaving minimal time for an enrage, however when this occurs a time stop must be cast to prevent damage. An order should be established to prevent unneeded time stops.\nWhile the amber drakes are bursting down the boss the ruby drake should pick up any whelps that spawn in order to generate evasive charges to further prevent damage. Martyr should not be used until a healthy amount of evasive charges are available to prevent damage, otherwise the ruby drake will die quickly.\nWhile attempting this void it is very common for drakes to be killed, however players should never stop their rotations because this fight is still winnable down to the last drake provided the boss is near death.\nAlternative Method.\nYou can get both the Emerald and Amber Void achievements by using five ruby drakes. The chain effect from Searing Wrath can easily kill the whelps if everyone just attacks the boss. Rotate Martyr use when you have Evasive charges and simply run away when Eregos phase shifts.\nAnother method that can be done to obtain both Emerald Void and Ruby void is to use 5 Amber drakes. Have one person use Temporal rift while the other 4 just use shock lance; then when the 10 stacks for the first player is up, everyone else swap to channeling and the first guy who channeled can then shoot his Shock Lance which equals to about 100k damage doubled 4 times by the effect from Temporal Rift. Rinse and Repeat. Normally the whelps don't spawn but if they do just have someone do a time-stop and shoot them down, 5 stacks from time stop should be enough to kill them in one shot. When he 'bubbles', just run away and when he re-emerges repeat the dps phase.\nEmerald Void can also be done easily by simply having the healer not use their drake. The healer stands on the platform with the chest, and all the other players must stay in healing range except during Planar Shifts. After each Planar Shift, everyone needs to go back to the healer's platform. A well-geared healer can easily heal all the damage without having to worry about the vehicle mechanics.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Said junctions are catalogued in the &lt;a href=\"Arcanomicon\"&gt;Arcanomicon&lt;/a&gt;, the map of all ley lines gifted to Malygos by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLey lines exist all over Azeroth and are sources of deep and natural magic. They are often harnessed for magical purposes, from the creation of moonwells to the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28spell%29\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; spells created by &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;. The raw energy within ley lines can build and build if the flow is restricted, resulting in a ley fissure. These points become an easy access point for travel and further study. Many places overwhelmed with ley line energy can be deadly to the beginning &lt;a href=\"Teleport\"&gt;Dimensional Rifter&lt;/a&gt;. In places like these, the sheer number of rifts create instability and the potential for important belongings to be severed from your person.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; studied the ley lines of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and discovered several similarities to those on Azeroth. He believed this may indicate a similar genesis.\nLey lines on the surface tend to crystallize in the form of glowing purple &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; crystals, but they require time to form. Eating one of these ley crystals can lead to deadly arcane poisoning.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Runesaber\"&gt;Mystic Runesaber&lt;/a&gt;s feed on magic and have recently emerged from the shadows in search of ley lines.\n&lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, and presumably the rest of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, are capable of seeing the ley lines when they are underground.\nLey lines can also be redirected. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s to redirect Azeroth's ley lines into the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; and to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; which triggered the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sarcen%20Stone\"&gt;Sarcen Stone&lt;/a&gt; was created during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; to redirect ley lines and draw power away from the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s portal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; conduits located in the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt; can direct the flow of power within ley lines. The &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; use them to direct the power to &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nLey lines can be used to communicate over long distances by channeling the user's &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; through a projected &lt;a href=\"Rune%20magic\"&gt;runic&lt;/a&gt; construct. It was a technique that Malygos invented.\nLocations.\nAzeroth.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; redirected them, all ley lines on Azeroth led to a location under &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; then spent years reversing the damage done to Azeroth's ley lines, eventually restoring them to their former power.\nDraenor.\nMost of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s ley lines were destroyed or upheaved after &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; opened so many portals.\nIn the RPG.\nOverview.\nAcross the face of the world there flow lines of power - patterns of magical energy that carry vitality of the lands of Azeroth through them, like blood vessels in a creature. These lines of power are recognized subtly by every culture; the races of Azeroth identify them as those places sacred to the Light, the chosen locations of moonwells, haunted places where the power of death has tainted the flow of energy, and natural sites overflowing with elemental power that are sacred to shamans. Most cultures, however, only really focus on those places where the lines converge and meet, seeking to tap the most power from them. Those who seek to understand and master runic power understand that the convergences are not the only important part of this power - the patterns formed by the lines themselves are important as well. These patterns, which resemble letters in a strange alphabet, are called runes.\nThere are lines of power that run across the land in a select few areas, but these are not the only lines - simply the most obvious. Inside of these thick and corded ropes of power, there are also tiny, web-thin lines that run between these great ley lines, connecting them in a vast net of pulsing, subtle power.\nThose with great magical power and &lt;a href=\"ley%20walker\"&gt;ley walker&lt;/a&gt;s seek out these sites.\nA community which sits on top of a convergence of two or more lines of magical energy is called a \"ley line nexus\".\nGallery.\nFan art"}

These lines of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; are often harnessed for mighty magical purposes, from the creation of &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s to (some say) the powerful glowing dome in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. It is simply assumed that those with power eventually must seek out one of these sites. But those who study the mysteries of the ley lines discover something more. Certainly, there are lines of power that run across the land in a select few areas, but these are not the only lines \u2014 simply the most obvious. If these are thick, corded ropes of power, there are also tiny, web-thin threads that run between these great &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, connecting them in a vast net of pulsing, subtle power.\nThe ley walker is a &lt;a href=\"magician\"&gt;magician&lt;/a&gt; who has discovered this fact and seeks to harness the power of these threads. A ley walker is aware that, every moment of every day, these threads permeate all things, passing through, around, above and below all things, carrying magical energy from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to all things in the world. With diligent study and practice, ley walkers sense these powers.\nThe sorcerous feats of which these men and women are capable are impressive. They are able to draw upon the skein of power to augment their spells, tap into this web to maintain spells past their normal durations, to heal themselves, and to protect their allies from magic.\nThe ley walker's attunement to the raw magical energies of the world grants her certain abilities not available to other spellcasters. Rather than paying for metamagic augmentation with her own powers, she may draw upon the power of the world to make the sacrifice of magical energy on her behalf. The ley walker is able to infuse the power of the ley lines into her spells. The ley walker may draw the power of the ley lines into herself, allowing them to knit her body closed. The ley walker is able to rapidly traverse the ley lines that connect every place in the world. The ley walker may snatch up the threads of ley line energy and affix them to herself or an ally within 30 feet, allowing magical energy to strike the threads and flow away.\nOf the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; classes, &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"inscriber\"&gt;inscriber&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"runemaster\"&gt;runemaster&lt;/a&gt;s are most likely to take this class, for they are the ones who treat this knowledge as truly important \u2014 they steep their magics in this world, rather than in the world of the dead, or in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, inscribers and runemasters understand the secrets of these ley lines better than most, and so this &lt;a href=\"prestige%20class\"&gt;prestige class&lt;/a&gt; is natural for them. Any of the &lt;a href=\"divine\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt; spellcasters are likely to study this path as well, particularly &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shamans\"&gt;shamans&lt;/a&gt; and priests of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, this path is found among the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, though many dwarven ley walkers have expanded the realms of understanding by studying the strange ley lines that crawl through the deep caverns. Most folk don't know a ley walker from any other magician. It is only among societies of magicians (such as the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;) or priestly orders that those who study these arts stand apart, for they tend to steep their magical discussion in terms of interaction with the ley lines of the world, much to the irritation of other magicians, who find this set of symbols to be useless to them.\nIn such societies, ley walkers tend to have one of two reputations \u2014 crackpots who are obsessed with what is considered just a small facet of the magical knowledge in the world, or truly wise scholars and sages of a set of deep mysteries."}

During her search she met &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, defeating him in battle leaving him for dead. Some time afterwards, Malfurion and a band of adventurers confronted her. Leyara told them that Fandral was a true leader and that Malfurion was nothing more than a desperate dreamer with no strength to lead anyone, and that the Night Elves would see through his weakness. Malfurion warned her that Fandral has been corrupted but Leyara, unheeding of Malfurion's warnings, threatened to kill his companions as she did Hamuul... Only for Hamuul to arrive, having survived his injuries despite her assertion that she had seared the life from his body. Hamuul told her that he would release her from her pain, and hoped that she could finally find peace in death.\nNotes.\nShe makes her first appearance during the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Ritual%20of%20Flame\"&gt;A Ritual of Flame&lt;/a&gt;, Afterward, she nearly kills in the quest &lt;a href=\"Leyara%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Leyara (quest)&lt;/a&gt;. She is then killed in &lt;a href=\"Into%20the%20Depths%20%28Molten%20Front%29\"&gt;Into the Depths (Molten Front)&lt;/a&gt; and her story is told from her necklace in the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Rest%20is%20History\"&gt;The Rest is History&lt;/a&gt;. Completing all 4 quests will reward the player with the achievement &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20Leyara\"&gt;Legacy of Leyara&lt;/a&gt;, which is a part of the meta-achievement &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20of%20the%20Molten%20Front\"&gt;Veteran of the Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;. The player is also awarded with &lt;a href=\"Leyara%27s%20Locket\"&gt;Leyara's Locket&lt;/a&gt;, an item with a 60-minute CD that applies a 10-minute transformation into a Druid of the Flame."}

It's described as a warm, glowing rock. Cool to the touch, it reflects light in odd, playful angles. It's light like &lt;a href=\"mithril\"&gt;mithril&lt;/a&gt;, but holds much more magical energy than &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ironhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Ironhorn tribe&lt;/a&gt; have learned however that it's a sensitive ore, and its power will retreat inward if it's not respectfully extracted, with little waste, from the earth.\nMany &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; superstitiously carried bits of leystone as a lucky charm. Such charms were typically worn by rural farmers, struggling academy students, or those sitting on the cusp between commonfolk and nobility.\nLeystone reacts violently to anything it views as a contaminate. It becomes dangerously explosive when applying a foreign flux during blacksmithing, but a native flux, such as one made from &lt;a href=\"foxflower\"&gt;foxflower&lt;/a&gt;, will be more successful. The &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; have achieved full plate armor pieces by carving them from one single piece of metal. Armor crafted from leystone is light, yet strong and offers great mobility. When smelted with one part felslate and two parts &lt;a href=\"Leystone%20Ore\"&gt;leystone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demonsteel%20Bar\"&gt;Demonsteel&lt;/a&gt; is produced."}

The earth totem named &lt;a href=\"Leza%27s%20Totem\"&gt;Leza's Totem&lt;/a&gt; left behind after her death suggests she was a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nMany tauren dreamed of a valley \"golden with blossoms, filled with the hope of peace\", but only Leza had strong enough visions to possibly guide them to the elusive location. During Leza's pregnancy, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; sent an expedition, led by Dezco with Leza as navigator, to find the valley. With her direction the expedition was able to break through the mists of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, landing on the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe group went up the &lt;a href=\"Dojani%20River\"&gt;Dojani River&lt;/a&gt;, feeling a pull towards the north. At some point along this journey, Leza fell ill with fever, exacerbated by the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Sha of Despair&lt;/a&gt;. The sha's power also affected the other tauren, preventing Dezco from using the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to heal her. Due to the &lt;a href=\"Winds%27%20Edge\"&gt;Winds' Edge&lt;/a&gt; cliffs, the group was forced to make camp at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Cleft\"&gt;Thunder Cleft&lt;/a&gt;. Here, despite being three weeks from her due date, Leza went into painful labor. Her condition worsened when her brother, &lt;a href=\"Chezin%20Dawnchaser\"&gt;Chezin&lt;/a&gt;, was killed by &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Dezco tasked Horde adventurers with finding &lt;a href=\"Herbal%20Remedies\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pools%20of%20Youth%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;magical water&lt;/a&gt; to heal Leza, but during childbirth she passed away. Her final moments were frantic and painful, with Dezco futilely using the Light to try and save her. \nShe gave birth to twin sons, both of which survived. The expedition mourned her death, giving her a proper burial before continuing towards the valley.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Dezco traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; where he asked the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; to tell Leza that their son &lt;a href=\"Redhorn\"&gt;Kor&lt;/a&gt; was growing strong and that he would always love her, should they find her in the afterlife.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The order leader and Angus entered the Halls, only to find an empty cage. &lt;a href=\"Selthaes%20Starsong\"&gt;Selthaes Starsong&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; that was being detained in a cage next to Brambley's, explained that he had been taken by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. He would show them where Brambley went if they freed him. They thus retrieved the key, which was left hanging on a wall, and freed Starsong.\nTo thank them, Starsong gave the order leader a precious bauble of his, that he had strangely managed to keep hidden after being captured. He kept his word to the order leader and to Angus, who he described as \"grotesquely hairy\". Starsong revealed that Brambley had been taken to the felstalker pits beneath the great Burning Legion &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lightbreaker\"&gt;\"Lightbreaker\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving no time to waste, they rushed to the pits and into &lt;a href=\"Felmaw%20Cavern\"&gt;Felmaw Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. At the entrance, they found Brambley's helm, and came to the conclusion that it was already too late for him. Angus claimed that he couldn't leave Brambley here and asked the order leader one last favor, to help him find the rest of Brambley so he could take his remains back home, and give him a proper burial.\nAs they entered the cavern, they collected a skull, a left arm, a tibia, a right arm, and Brambley's dagger. They ended up facing a fel beast, &lt;a href=\"Mangelrath\"&gt;Mangelrath&lt;/a&gt;, which was lying on the floor, asleep. Angus decided that they had to slay the demonic beast, to avenge Brambley. But, above the beast, was hanging from the ceiling Brambley himself. After having slain the beast and freed Brambley, the latter asked Angus what he was doing with all these bones. He admitted that he believed they were his, to which Brambley replied that one of them wasn't even human. Brambley safe, they could return to the exit and leave the cavern.\nAngus at some point adventured to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, but was found in quite a predicament as he needed to defecate but did not have anything to wipe himself.\nQuotes.\nThe demons o' the Burnin' Legion have got another thing comin' if they think ol' Angus is cooked! I've got more tricks up mah' sleeve than a &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Dalaran mage&lt;/a&gt;!\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Elka%20Stormbrew\"&gt;Elka Stormbrew&lt;/a&gt;."}

Great souls\u2014good or evil\u2014have a lot of anima, while those who have lived humbler lives have less. It is believed by some that the elements of &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decay\"&gt;Decay&lt;/a&gt; have an influence in the soul's creation of anima. It infuses the Shadowlands and acts as the lifeblood of the afterlife, making trees grow and rivers flow, flowing through creatures, and connecting all the realms of the Shadowlands together.\nIn recent years, however, the machine of death has been broken. All souls who enter the Shadowlands now pour directly into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; instead of being distributed between realms, making the Maw grow larger and more powerful. As a consequence of this anima drought, the realms have been cut off from one another, breeding fear and distrust among the inhabitants - and with no incoming anima, the other realms of the Shadowlands have started to wither. Many creatures relying on anima have also started to starve, sometimes becoming aggressive in their search for anima.\nIn-game, anima is a resource gathered from various sources and can be used for different game mechanics, such as powering up one's &lt;a href=\"Soulbinding\"&gt;Soulbind&lt;/a&gt;, sending off &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20companion\"&gt;adventure companions&lt;/a&gt; on missions, or other features and upgrades specific to a &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20Sanctum\"&gt;covenant sanctum&lt;/a&gt;.

This vital fluid has been used by the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; to shape life since the time of the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, it was originally used by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known use of anima dates back from the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, when the titans, the shapers of Azeroth, had used such magic in their acts of creation. When &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; and ate his heart, he gained not only his power as keeper of storms, but the knowledge to utilize the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; and anima in a method called &lt;a href=\"flesh-shaping\"&gt;flesh-shaping&lt;/a&gt;. The newly crowned Thunder King used anima in the creation of mighty constructs called &lt;a href=\"blood%20golem\"&gt;blood golem&lt;/a&gt;s and the shaping of life forms, such a slave races like the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; raid, a large system of anima flowed into the &lt;a href=\"Saurok%20Creation%20Pit\"&gt;Saurok Creation Pit&lt;/a&gt;, home of &lt;a href=\"Primordius\"&gt;Primordius&lt;/a&gt;. This anima mutated &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s into a temporary saurok-like evolution. After the fall of the Thunder King, adventurers encountered the Fallen Keeper of Storms, Ra, underneath the Throne of Thunder. Ra demonstrated that he still had power over anima and used it offensively during his battle.\nThe Regent Lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, acquired an anima golem to study, hoping to learn its secrets. The &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; then used them to help purge the demonic corruption in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; and to defend during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and to fight alongside the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;' forces and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebels in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt;'s wounds appear to reveal anima beneath them. This suggests that anima may be Ra's blood, and that Lei Shen kept him alive to drain him of it. If true, this could imply anima is actually a product of the Plane of Order in some capacity, rather than truly related to Life."}

She becomes lost and confused, spiritually adrift in the world. The return to animism inspired revolutionary thoughts among some orcs. For centuries orcs lived as base creatures, destructive and bloodthirsty. The civilized races of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; looked down on the orcs, believing them primitive and savage. Now the orcs compare their new traditions with those of the Alliance and judge themselves spiritually superior. It is now the Alliance that seems primitive and uncivilized to the orcs; the Alliance holds fast to their complicated and sterile philosophies and denies the simple, vital truth of animism. Some orcs sneer at the Alliance, some pity them, and some care nothing for this dichotomy. Tauren practice animism by revering a spirit they call the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. The Earth Mother represents all the animistic forces of nature. River-spirits, sea-spirits, tree-spirits, rock-spirits, and animal spirits all reflect one facet of the Earth Mother. Orcs have a less organized philosophy; they see all spirits as individuals connected in a greater whole, like members of a great &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;s view &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; as a type of animism, and to an extent that theory is true. The &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s' religion of voodoo takes a decidedly different bent than the &lt;a href=\"shamanistic\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; beliefs of the orcs and tauren, though.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; items named after animists appear in the original &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, either as loot dropping from bosses, as quest rewards, or created from recipes.\nSpeculation.\n\"Animist\" may be a name given by trolls for druids."}

Over the generations, they have been nearly hunted to extinction by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. So few of them remain that they know they can never rebuild their tribe's population, and those who remain have dedicated their lives to slaying naga.\nBackground.\nThe ankoan are an offshoot of the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; who left &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago. Now their &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s hunt in the depths of the ocean. They have been nearly hunted to extinction by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade clan&lt;/a&gt; has been fighting back against the naga for generations. However, they have recently taken the fight directly to the naga's doorstep in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; after their former leader was slain by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and the Waveblade swore an oath to avenge them. The Waveblade clan was the only ankoan clan to take the fight directly to Azshara in Nazjatar. When &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces arrived in Nazjatar, they befriended the Waveblade while the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; allied with the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt;. The Unshackled leader &lt;a href=\"Neri%20Sharpfin\"&gt;Neri Sharpfin&lt;/a&gt; views the ankoan as impressive fighters but a bit standoffish. Since arriving in Nazjatar, the ankoan have taken up residence in &lt;a href=\"Mezzamere\"&gt;Mezzamere&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nThe ankoan are a nomadic race of fierce hunters. They have a natural affinity for the sea, so training local wildlife like &lt;a href=\"Fathom%20ray\"&gt;waveray&lt;/a&gt;s was a natural strategy in their battles against the naga. Ankoan believe the spirits of their ancestors continue to watch over them after death. To honor their dead, the ankoan place &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;wooden burial shrines&lt;/a&gt; over their graves. However, the names of those who have died a dishonorable or cowardly death are purposefully forgotten. The ankoan worship &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, ankoan children would fill empty &lt;a href=\"spider%20crab\"&gt;spider crab&lt;/a&gt; shells with sand and then hang them on the corals as decoration. Large swarms of &lt;a href=\"Frenzy\"&gt;deep sea frenzies&lt;/a&gt; are apparently one of the most horrific dangers in the deep sea that ankoan and naga alike fear, their numbers blotting out all light and devouring all unhidden flesh.\nSpeculation.\nThe ankoan may be descended or related to the &lt;a href=\"Razorfin%20tribe\"&gt;Razorfin tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; who left &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago."}

Though many have gone astray, they still possess valuable relics of the Silver Hand.\nDeep in Stratholme, under the watchful eye of &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Galford\"&gt;Instructor Galford&lt;/a&gt;, volumes of the Annals of the Silver Hand survive. Any volumes you could recover would be a fitting addition to the rededicated Light's Hope Chapel, don't you think?\nProgress.\nHave you recovered any of the lost histories of the Silver Hand?\nCompletion.\nThis is indeed one of the lost volumes! &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; will be most pleased when he learns of your find.\nNotes.\nSince the fall of the Lich King, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; has replaced the Argent Dawn in the Plaguelands of Lordaeron. So that players can continue to grind rep with the Argent Dawn, &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20George\"&gt;Raymond George&lt;/a&gt; offers this repeatable quest along with the repeatable &lt;a href=\"Aberrations%20of%20Bone\"&gt;Aberrations of Bone&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers must begin the long quest chain with &lt;a href=\"Fiona\"&gt;Fiona&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Thondroril%20River\"&gt;Thondroril River&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Plaguelands.

Simply turn in and re-take the quest, then run back through the cleared instance. It also helps to kill &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; on the first run through, as Argent Crusaders will spawn after his death and keep most of the remaning mobs busy."}

He appears as a recurring &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald%20storyline\"&gt;Ardenweald storyline&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%3ANight%20Fae%20Campaign\"&gt;:Night Fae Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSacrifice of Tirna Noch.\nAra'lon was responsible for looking after the &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s of Tirna Noch, one of which contained the soul of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;. During an encounter with the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;, Ara'lon swore an oath to protect the wildseeds in his care, no matter what trial he faced.\nWhen the anima drought fell upon Ardenweald, it became increasingly difficult for Ara'lon to find new anima. One day when returning from foraging, he came across members of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; sacrificing the wildseeds in Tirna Noch to preserve the little anima remaining. Ara'lon immediately attacked them, declaring that anyone who threatened his grove was his enemy. He stayed his hand when the Winter Queen herself appeared with other members of the Wild Hunt. Confused, Ara'lon told his queen that he had kept faith that she would save them from the drought, and he didn't understand why she would send scavengers to his grove. In response, the queen showed the sylvar a vision of a future in which all of Ardenweald had perished in the drought, and members of the Hunt explained that they had to sacrifice some groves to allow others\u2014and the forest as a whole\u2014to survive.\nAra'lon was faced with the choice of honoring his original oath or sacrificing Ursoc's wildseed to preserve the forest. He sorrowfully chose the latter, telling Ursoc that he would serve the wilds one last time and asking for the Wild God's forgiveness, before draining the anima from his seed, killing it. Afterward, Ara'lon joined the Winter Queen's Wild Hunt, swearing the protect the souls that could yet be saved.\nThe Wild Hunt.\nAra'lon joined a hunting party led by &lt;a href=\"Hunt-Captain%20Korayn\"&gt;Hunt-Captain Korayn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glitterfall%20Basin\"&gt;Glitterfall Basin&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, sent by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt; to aid Korayn, found Ara'lon and &lt;a href=\"Lumera\"&gt;Lumera&lt;/a&gt; as the only survivors of the party, the remainder killed by &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;. Ara'lon is able to confirm Korayn's suspicion that the enemy has far greater numbers than the Wild Hunt can combat. While Korayn pursued her hunters' killer, her former ally &lt;a href=\"Lorkron%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Lorkron the Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, Ara'lon sends the Maw Walker back to &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Vaal\"&gt;Tirna Vaal&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Cradle\"&gt;Spirit Cradle&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; the adventurer had connected with in that grove, which would allow the wildseed to be transported to safety. Later, as the wildseed is escorted to &lt;a href=\"Hibernal%20Hollow\"&gt;Hibernal Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, Ara'lon leads the Wild Hunt in defense of &lt;a href=\"Soryn%27s%20Meadow\"&gt;Soryn's Meadow&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the Drust and their &lt;a href=\"Blighted\"&gt;Blighted&lt;/a&gt; minions from overrunning the hollow. Ara'lon teams with the Maw Walker to beat back the invaders to clear the road and ensure the wildseed's arrival at Hibernal Hollow.\nTo secure enough anima to help the wildseed grow, Ara'lon directs the Maw Walker to his former grove of Tirna Noch. Ara'lon detects a massive amount of anima coming from the heart of the grove; though the anima of the grove had been reclaimed due to the drought, the heart had been empowered by the Drust with anima stolen from other groves. Ara'lon, the Maw Walker, and a sylvar huntress named &lt;a href=\"Niya\"&gt;Niya&lt;/a&gt; battle their way into the grove and confront the Drust champion &lt;a href=\"Vroth\"&gt;Vroth&lt;/a&gt;, who guards the &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Tirna%20Noch\"&gt;:Heart of Tirna Noch&lt;/a&gt;. Although the amount of anima within the heart could possibly restore Tirna Noch and other groves, Ara'lon accepts that his grove was sacrificed for the good of Ardenweald, and that the anima in the heart was needed elsewhere.\nThe wildseed from Tirna Vaal is revealed to contain the spirit of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. When the wildseed is brought to the Winter Queen at the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, she asks why she should expend anima to save what she calls her \"sister's pet\". Ara'lon beseeches her to remember that while some must indeed be sacrificed, some must also be saved; otherwise \"all that will remain will be empty shells and sorrow\". The Winter Queen relents, and Ysera is reborn.\nThe Fate of Ara'lon.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Herne\"&gt;Lord Herne&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Wild Hunt, dispatches Ara'lon at the head of a hunting party to &lt;a href=\"Blackthorn%20Grove\"&gt;Blackthorn Grove&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;, which has been overrun by the Blighted. When they did not return, Lord Herne dispatched a Maw Walker who had sworn to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and joined the Wild Hunt to find him. Using masks to infiltrate the grove, Ara'lon and the Maw Walker discover that of his hunting party, only &lt;a href=\"Gwyeir\"&gt;Gwyeir&lt;/a&gt; was still alive, but she was corrupted by the Drust curse. The spirit of the Drust &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeaker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kivarr\"&gt;Kivarr&lt;/a&gt; dispatched Ara'lon to find a &lt;a href=\"%3AWitch%27s%20Satchel\"&gt;:Witch's Satchel&lt;/a&gt; to help combat the Drust curse, but never returned; all the Maw Walker was able to find when retrieving the satchel themselves was Ara'lon's broken spear. Despite the efforts of the Maw Walker and Kivarr, Gwyeir ultimately succumbed.\nWhen Lord Herne and the Wild Hunt confront &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Drust invasion, at &lt;a href=\"Darkreach\"&gt;Darkreach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt; discovers that \"Gorak Zhar\" was in fact an illusion, and that their enemy was in fact Ara'lon, used in a Drust trick to distract from their true objective. Mortally wounded, Ara'lon warns that the real Gorak Zhar was on her way to the Grove of Awakening. Lord Herne swears that they will stop Gorak Zhar \"for Queen and grove\", which Ara'lon echoes before he dies.\nSpeculation.\nHe may have been the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Night\"&gt;droman&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Noch\"&gt;Tirna Noch&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

These crawling insectoid horrors possess a pair of powerful claws that rend and tear as well as a poisonous sting that can prove fatal to much larger creatures. Though they do not possess intelligence, they have a cunning that seems to anticipate its enemy's moves and alerts it to their weaknesses. Arachnathid are often found in groups, though they tend toward solitary attacks, except when in the presence of one of their mysterious \"overlords.\" They make their lairs underneath rocks, inside caves, or within shallow burrows. Arachnathid are territorial in nature and generally don't pursue opponents beyond the area they consider to be theirs. Smart travelers and native creatures generally give arachnathid a wide berth. They have no language, as such, though they do seem to communicate with a series of chitters and clacks intelligible only to other arachnathid. Some scholars theorize that they are related to the scorpids, a species found in warm climates.\nSpeculation.\nArachnathid seem to have a complex social structure, similar to that of nerubians, with \"kings\" and \"overlords\" as well as lesser minions (although those may be just names given by travelers to especially big examples of the species)."}

She used to have a unique appearance, with a slight mane and a striped tail. \nTaming Araga.\nConsidering her entirely unique appearance - she is the only cat with this skin - Araga is quite a prize for those hunters who love having special pets. However, Araga is one of the rarest cats in the game, if not the rarest, and as a result, probably the most difficult to find and tame. It can most likely be found around the &lt;a href=\"Headland\"&gt;Headland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corrahn%27s%20Dagger\"&gt;Corrahn's Dagger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gavin%27s%20Naze\"&gt;Gavin's Naze&lt;/a&gt;, where other unnamed mountain lions spawn.\nMany hunters lament camping under &lt;a href=\"Humar%20the%20Pridelord\"&gt;Humar&lt;/a&gt;'s tree waiting for him to respawn, but in fact, he's a cakewalk compared to Araga. Humar's respawn timer is 6\u20138 hours, while Araga's is 24\u201336 hours. Humar spawns in the exact same spot every time and does not move around, while Araga can spawn ANYWHERE in Hillsbrad Foothills where mountain lions are capable of spawning, and she wanders. Humar's tree is remote and most players not specifically looking for Humar will never go there... while Araga's most likely spawn locations are in high-traffic questing and traveling areas.\nIf you go to the green cliffs in southern Alterac and see her, consider yourself lucky, as there are a number of factors working against the chance of just happening across her. The chances of a player coming across Araga on their way to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; (for example), noticing her rare spawn status, killing her for the heck of it, and leaving the area as if they were never there, is very high. Something like that can happen the moment Araga is spawned. For a hunter looking to tame Araga, there is nothing you can really do except camp the site as much as possible and don't give up.\nThe easiest way to get this pet, and many others, is to wait until there is a server restart, and wait for her around the time she would respawn - in Araga's case, 24\u201336 hours after the restart.\nLoot.\nDrops a randomly-enchanted &lt;a href=\"uncommon\"&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt; item in the level range of 23 to 26.\nPatch changes.\nAraga has mysteriously lost her tail stripes, making her look much more like a normal cougar. Blizzard explained that the stripes were a result of a graphical \"anomaly\"."}

They have an affinity for arcane magic and secrecy. Most are aggressive to both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, although there are friendly members of the arakkoa to be found.\nThe winged arakkoa or high arakkoa, were the proud descendants of the once-grand &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization, a glorious empire of the sun that ruled vast territories alongside the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; empire centuries ago. While many of the great works of their forebears remain a mystery, the arakkoa in the time of Draenor's final days\u2014proud, hateful and defiant\u2014mastered their own form of sun magic. From atop the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, they gazed down on Draenor with scorn and sought to restore their people to the heights of their power.\nA second group of arakkoa, called the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;, were born from the treachery of their kin. Transformed into hunched shadows of their former selves by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt; and gifted with a mastery over &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; by the raven god &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, in Draenor's final days they desperately sought to survive the genocidal efforts of &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;those who had betrayed them&lt;/a&gt;. Without champions, and without hope, the Outcasts ultimately heeded the influence of an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; and were lost to the darkness in which they'd once taken refuge.\nHistory.\nThe Gods of Arak.\nThe origins of the arakkoan race and its two distinct subcultures are tightly bound to the three primal gods of the Draenic region known as &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;: The strong and graceful &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, mother of the &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt;; the slight but clever &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, father of the &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt;s; and the cold and scornful &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, father of the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. Preceding the creation of the arakkoa, Sethe and Rukhmar clashed above the Spires. Rukhmar, forewarned of Sethe's attack by Anzu, managed to cast the serpent down from the skies\u2014but it was Anzu who stepped in to deliver the killing blow. With his last breath, the defeated Sethe cursed his own flesh and blood to rot and corrupt all that it touched. As Anzu devoured him in an attempt to contain the curse, a trickle of blood escaped, creating the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt; where it touched the ground. The curse crippled Anzu, making him flightless and pained by dark visions.\nAnzu could not bear to present himself to Rukhmar, for if she had not seen him worthy before then surely she would now be disgusted by the aberration he had become. He disappeared into the forest deeps, and he ignored Rukhmar whenever she called for Anzu to show himself. Though Sethe's curse weakened Anzu, it also gave him new power: the power of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; that Sethe had once commanded. As Anzu grew more familiar with his abilities, he shrouded himself in a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;realm of shadow&lt;/a&gt; to hide from Rukhmar forever.\nAfter much fruitless searching, Rukhmar gave up. She was humbled by Anzu's sacrifice, but she was also horrified by the curse that now darkened her home. Rukhmar took to the skies and left Arak, eventually settling atop &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Summit\"&gt;highest peak&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; once connected the origins of the arakkoa to &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, he was only partially right: it was Rukhmar who went on to create a new race of children. Rukhmar decided that if she could not find Anzu to thank him, then she would reward his sacrifice by creating a new race in his honor. Using her own life energies, Rukhmar transformed some of her &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt; followers into the arakkoa: \"heirs of Arak\". They embodied Rukhmar's physical grace and majesty, as well as Anzu's intellect and cleverness.\nDawn of the Apexis.\nRukhmar intended that the arakkoa would one day return to Arak, but not yet. Sethe's curse still lingered, and she did not want her children to suffer from it. After they had matured and become wise, Rukhmar intended to lead her children back to their ancestral home. Her only fear was that she would not live long enough to do so, for she had expended much of her life essence in creating the arakkoa. She would never be as powerful as she had once been, and she knew she would eventually grow old and die.\nFor many generations, Rukhmar watched the arakkoa develop from afar. Occasionally she communed with them, telling them stories of Arak, Sethe's evil, and Anzu's nobility. She taught them the rudimentary ways of commanding the Light, and they were quick learners. They mastered the Light and became adept healers and seers. Much of their primitive customs revolved around the worship of Rukhmar, who they revered as the goddess of the sun, which they saw as the source of their Light magic. But they were not content with the Light alone. Due to Rukhmar's teachings, they revered Anzu just as much as they did she, and they studied the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; that he had excelled in, becoming great sorcerers as well.\nThree thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, as the arakkoa flourished, Rukhmar felt her own life fading. She communed with her children one last time and urged them to claim Arak for themselves. Rukhmar took to the winds and soared south, and the arakkoa followed. But just as they reached Arak, Rukhmar breathed her last breath. Flames consumed her form and she burned like a second sun in the sky. The arakkoa saw Rukhmar's passing as a sign of their ascendancy. They vowed to create a grand civilization that would outshine any other culture on Draenor in order to honor her. The light of their knowledge and their power would blaze in the heavens just as Rukhmar had.\nCalling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt;, the arakkoa claimed the highest reaches of Arak's spire. They harvested timber from the surrounding woods and metals from the nearby mountains and built illustrious gilded structures around their new home. Using their mastery of the Light, the Apexis crafted enormous lanterns burning with enchanted flames that hung along the length of the spire. Guided by tales of Anzu and his noble sacrifice, arakkoa sorcerers investigated the Sethekk Hollow. By carefully studying the cursed pools, they unraveled the mysteries of shadow magic and developed the unique ability to combine the arcane with the Void. Embracing both Light and Void, the Apexis believed they were both natural parts of life. Two factions formed within the Apexis: the Anhar order studied holy magic, while the Skalax studied shadow and arcane magics. Both groups occupied the upper echelons of arakkoa society, sharing equal prestige and influence.\nAs the arakkoa solidified their power in Arak, they also began to explore the rest of Draenor; though not expansionists, they were curious. Outposts were forged across the land to observe local flora and fauna, and by studying and mapping the forests and mountains they were in awe when they realized that many of these were the &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;remains&lt;/a&gt; of ancient &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; that had once walked Draenor. Based on stories from Rukhmar, the Apexis realized the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; were the primordial giants' offspring. They watched the endless warring between the two with pity and fascination. However, they never intervened; they had inherited a touch of Rukhmar's arrogance and to play a part in the lives of land-dwellers was seen as beneath the Apexis.\nAgainst the Evergrowth.\nA thousand years passed. Two thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the rise of the arakkoa did not go unnoticed by the rest of Draenor's inhabitants. The nearby forest of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; teemed with Primals, and one among them was the ancient and powerful &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt;. Not only did he command powers of nature and the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;, he also learned from the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;s of the Sporemounds, &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt;, and communal sentience that once united all of Draenor's plantlife. He had the ability to manipulate other Primals and guide their actions, and he found the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; the most promising of them all. But while the Botani focused their attention on the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, Gnarlgar became aware of the Apexis. Seeing their society as an affront to nature with magic that burned plantlife to cinders or inundated it with darkness, Gnarlgar believed that unless the arakkoa were stopped they would conquer all of Draenor. He obtained a fossilized root of &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt; and rallied the botani to his side to stop the arakkoa so they could rebuild the Evergrowth. Gnarlgar not only worked to create a new Sporemound named &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt; out of Botaan's root, he also used Spirit to gift thousands of trees with intelligence and will - creating the &lt;a href=\"Gnarled\"&gt;Gnarled&lt;/a&gt; - while his botani spawned new genesaur in their pools.\nThe Apexis did not initially pay attention to the stirring Primals, believing it to be a part of the war with the Breakers. Yet as the forests around Arak grew thicker, vines climbed the spire and planted trees that grew with astonishing speed. Eventually, members of the Anhar and Skalax went to investigate Talador, but very few of the scouts ever returned, and those who did report the horrifying news. From what they knew of the Evergrowth, the Apexis quickly realized that the monster that was growing had to be a Sporemound, and knew if it awoke then it would both annihilate the arakkoa and bring devastation to Draenor. Knowing their race's survival depended on it, the Anhari and Skalaxi leaders mobilized the Apexis and formed an invasion force, with their priests and sorcerers forming the bulk of the military. They flew through the skies over Talador, ignoring the Primals and focusing on the monstrosity forming deep in the forest.\nDespite Anhari blades and Skalaxi curses, the arakkoa could not break the Primals as they descended into the forest. Gnarlgar entered a trance that allowed him to touch the Primals' minds and coordinate their movements, causing every vine and root to move against the Apexis as they worked in perfect unity and forced the arakkoa back into the sky. Nearly half of the arakkoa army had died, shocking the Anhar and Skalax. The Anhar proposed a solution: a weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; that would channel the sun's energies into incredibly destructive power. As the Anhari began to craft it at the highest point of Arak's spire, Gnarlgar quickened Taala's maturation. The thorn-skinned Sporemound stirred and marched toward the spire with the other Primals on Gnarlgar's mental command.\nBut the Breath of Rukhmar would not be finished in time. Knowing this, a small number of Skalaxi sorcerers volunteered to give the Anhari the time they needed. During their defeat in Talador, they had discovered the existence of Gnarlgar and learned of his ability to command the Primals. They knew that killing him would deal a great blow to the enemy forces, and so shrouded themselves in shadow to reach Talador and Gnarlgar unseen. Gnarlgar sensed their presence and broke from his trance to quickly dispose of the sorcerers, but not before the arakkoa struck with their dark powers. The curse rotted Gnarlgar into a blackened husk and he collapsed next to the bodies of his assassins.\nGnarlgar's death broke the unity of the Primals, sending confusion through them, and for a time they halted at the edge of Arak. The Skalaxi had bought the arakkoa time and the Breath of Rukhmar was completed. A violent tremor shook the spire as solar energies roared through it and a white-hot beam exploded from the mechanism to lance through Taala's chest, blowing it apart in a cloud of spores and ash. The Breath of Rukhmar sliced through the botani, genesaur, and Gnarled, incinerating thousands in an instant. The few that survived retreated to Talador in terror, but they were engulfed in flames by the Anhari. The forests that had crept into Arak were seared away. Once the attack was halted, blackened earth and smoldering roots stretched as far as the eye could see. Because of the arakkoa, the Evergrowth would never return again in any form, and a new golden age for mortal civilization dawned on Draenor.\nHeight and fall of the Apexis.\nCenturies after defeating the Evergrowth and 1,200 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Apexis had flourished into an empire and their population had swelled. They saw themselves as the most powerful force in the world, that not even the mightiest of Primals had been able to contend with. With nothing to threaten them, the Apexis dedicated themselves to the advancement of science and magic, and knowledge became their culture's most coveted resource. The Anhar and Skalax became the caretakers of wisdom with the duty of cataloging history, the study of magic, and information about the world and its various creatures. Rather than keeping this knowledge in tomes or scrolls, the Anhari and Skalaxi sorcerers combined their magic to develop &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s. By merely touching one of the crystals, an arakkoa would consume all of the knowledge contained within and could even experience the memories of whoever had crafted it.\nThe Apexis applied their magics to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20guardian\"&gt;mechanical constructs&lt;/a&gt; that would do their bidding. The arakkoa had always been arrogant, and they had become even more so after their victory. They deemed those who walked the surface to be unclean and used their constructs to mine and gather other resources from the ground.\nThe Apexis had blueprints for a \"Temple in the Sky\", but it is unclear if they ever actually built it. This might be the temple they built on the top of the spire of Arak.\nDuring the height of Apexis culture, a small group of Anhari priests sought out the remains of Rukhmar. They found her charred bones near the spire, and they used their magics to resurrect her. But it was only a partial success. This new Rukhmar had only a sliver of the original's power and intelligence. Nonetheless, the Apexis worshiped her as their goddess reborn. The Anhari infused her with their Light powers, granting her a long life so she could soar the skies for millennia.\nThe Anhari priests constructed a gleaming sun temple around the Breath of Rukhmar used centuries before. Hundreds of arakkoa gathered each year to commemorate the Apexis victory and honor Rukhmar. Other arakkoa visited shrines carved into the solid rock near the foot of the spire where the Skalaxi sorcerers performed rituals to honor Anzu and his ancient sacrifice. Though Apexis culture seemed destined to continue its rise, a rivalry developed between the Anhar and Skalax as each vied for the support of the greater populace. The Anhari knew that to seize power they would need to control knowledge. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Priest-Lord%20Velthreek\"&gt;Priest-Lord Velthreek&lt;/a&gt; ordered his followers to gather as many Apexis crystals as they could, and the Anhari did so in secret over a number of years, storing them in their sun temple atop the spire.\nThe Skalaxi and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Lord%20Salavass\"&gt;Sorcerer-Lord Salavass&lt;/a&gt; eventually uncovered what was happening. They believed that knowledge was a basic right for all arakkoa and Salavass called for the immediate release of the crystals. However, Velthreek ignored the demand. He declared the Anhari the sole rulers of the Apexis and that they would decide who would access the crystals and their knowledge. In addition, he claimed that he and the Anhari were the living representatives of Rukhmar herself. Therefore, following their teachings was the only way to attain her favor. Salavas was cunning and knew what would happen to his order if they did not act: the Skalaxi would become marginalized in society and gradually lose influence. He gathered his followers and struck at the sun temple to take the Apexis crystals by force.\nThe battle that erupted at the gates to the sun temple quickly spilled into the lower levels of the spire, with some arakkoa allying with the Anhari and others with the Skalaxi. The civil war engulfed the spire for many months, and to turn the tide of the conflict the Anhari harnessed the Breath of Rukhmar. As the weapon ignited and they prepared to incinerate the Skalaxi, Salavass knew they would be doomed against it and led a handful of his most gifted sorcerers to the top of the spire where they stormed through the Anhari guards. As the Ahhari cut down the intruders Salavass weaved a spell to destabilize the Breath of Rukhmar. It worked, but the result was catastrophic: a furious explosion erupted from the Breath of Rukhmar, instantly killing most of the arakkoa on the spire and shattering the land. After the light dimmed, all was dark.\nThe explosion had split Arak's spire into many smaller spires and the surrounding region was left a barren wasteland. In time, it came to be known as the Spires of Arak. It would take generations for life to bloom in the area again, and even longer for the surviving arakkoa to recover from what had happened. The Apexis society was no more, but from its ashes new cultures would arise. In the years to come, what happened to the Apexis to make them vanish would become a mystery. Some believed their golems turned on them.\nThe ogres of Goria.\nAfter Apexis society collapsed, arakkoa priests and sorcerers had spread across the land, taking with them many of their race's Apexis crystals. Two hundred years later, small conclaves of what remained of the Skalax order began to search the land for more of these lost pieces of knowledge and power. They sought to preserve the wonders of their people, and some even believed finding enough would usher in a new Apexis golden age. The Skalaxi leader of this age, &lt;a href=\"Yonzi\"&gt;Yonzi&lt;/a&gt;, learned of a critical cache buried beneath the ruins of an Apexis settlement on the northwest coast of Talador now occupied by the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; slaves. Ogron were too violent to barter and bargain with, but the ogres were more intelligent than the ogron, and more importantly, angered by their enslavement.\nThe Skalaxi approached the ogres in secret and began to teach them the ways of the arcane. Because the ogres were descendants of &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt; who was, in turn, a creation of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, they were naturally attuned to the arcane. The arakkoa had never seen new spellcasting techniques developed so effortlessly and were delighted. One of the first ogres to master the power was &lt;a href=\"Gog\"&gt;Gog&lt;/a&gt;, who the Skalaxi believed to be the perfect leader to incite rebellion. Gog did rebel, but not against the ogron: he targeted the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, whom the ogron and ogres revered and feared as gods. Though stunned, the arakkoa could not argue with the results. Gog did not only kill one gronn with his magic, but several. By his fifth, stories of his deeds were known to all captive ogres on Draenor, erasing their fear of both gronn and ogron. Under Gog, the ogres rose up against their ogron warlords and Gog was renamed Gorgog: \"King Gog\". The city became &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;, \"Throne of the King\".\nThe Skalaxi quickly moved into Goria to search for Apexis crystals and artifacts in the ruins Goria was built on, but Gorgog quickly put an end to it. As a sorcerer himself, he had no interest in giving away any potential source of power. The arakkoa left, but not for long. Yonzi and his Skalaxi were infuriated and they decided to take the land by force. They launched a surprise attack on Goria in the dead of night, but Gorgog and his apprentice arcanists, as well as the countless newly freed ogres, fought back. The arakkoa were defeated and Yonzi was captured. His death was slow and gruesome. Despite the promise of undiscovered Apexis crystals, further arakkoa incursions into Gorian lands were few and far between afterward. In the slowly expanding &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; Apexis crystals became highly prized and eagerly sought out by ogre sorcerers.\nThe Adherents and the Outcasts.\nThe next arakkoan culture was that of the sun-woshiping High Arakkoa. Six hundred years after the fall of the Apexis, and six hundred years before the Opening of the Dark Portal, the greatest and most loved king of these arakkoa was known as &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;. The Anhar order shared power with the line of kings, but worship of Rukhmar had become twisted and distorted by time, and respect for Anzu had long since disappeared. The &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, formed from the cursed blood of the dead god Sethe, had become a form of punishment and any who disagreed with the Anhari were deemed heretics and cast into the pools. Due to Sethe's curse, they would undergo similar flightless mutations to Anzu upon contact with the pools.\nTerokk's victory over the &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pridelord%20Karash\"&gt;Pridelord Karash&lt;/a&gt;, who had been tormenting the arakkoa and causing them to ask why Rukhmar had apparently withdrawn her favor, caused the arakkoa to celebrate Terokk as a living legend. Indeed, they even claimed him to be Rukhmar's reincarnation. The Anhari began to grow nervous, for up until this point they alone had been allowed to speak in the sun goddess's name. Terokk used his widespread support to build a new city, &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, that called back to the accomplishments of the ancient Apexis. He created new laws restricting the authority of the Anhar order, declaring that high arakkoan society must be guided by a thirst for knowledge and wisdom, not by fear and superstition.\nThis prompted the Anhari to action. In the dead of night, they cast Terokk down from Skyreach into the pools of the Sethekk Hollow. The blood mutated Terokk: his body transformed, his wings shriveled, and his sanity began to leave him. It was Anzu, the Raven Lord who had first encountered &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Sethe's curse&lt;/a&gt; and who for so long been watching the arakkoa from the shadows, that took pity on Terokk. He gave him command over both sorcery and shadow magic with which to save his sanity\u2014and the sanity of his loyalists who were cast down with him\u2014and &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;The Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt; with which to contact him. Terokk had become one of the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;, and with the help of Anzu built the city of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; among Apexis ruins as a refuge for his kind. The regions of Talador near to the Spires of Arak came under their control and became known as Terokkar Forest. Meanwhile, from that day forward Skyreach would be ruled not by a king but by the Anhari alone, now calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Adherents covered up Terokk's rule, writing of it in many scrolls and tomes as a time of darkness where the tyrant Terokk had committed crimes and depraved acts. According to this false history, Terokk's tyranny was brought to an end when the Adherents rose up against him and liberated the arakkoa from oppression. Rukhmar then turned her back on Terokk and he became shriveled and maddened.\nOther lawbreakers would be tossed into the pools, and eventually the surviving Arakkoa Outcasts became a civilization unto themselves. Deep in the shadowed trees at the base of the Spires, Sethe's curse passed from one generation of Outcasts to the next without any hope of a cure. Rukhmar and her Adherents feared and hated these cursed arakkoa and the dark magic gifted to their Talonpriests by Anzu, and so waged war on them. To aid in their battles, the Adherents searched for ancient Apexis technology, unleashing powerful &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20guardian\"&gt;golems&lt;/a&gt; to subjugate their enemies and &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;turrets&lt;/a&gt; that fired beams of concentrated light to purge the Outcast settlements with flame.\nAs the years wore on, Terokk's health declined, grief tore at his heart, and Sethe's curse chewed at his mind. He began to hate the world, abandoning Skettis and even sacrificing the lower castes of his own people to dark powers in search of a cure. His fellow Outcasts did not seem to know the reason for this abandonment and attributed it to their turning away from the worship of Rukhmar. Hoping to rejuvenate their king, the Talonpriests sealed Terokk away deep within the shadows. All that remained of their beloved leader were several artifacts he left behind, among them his &lt;a href=\"Terokk%27s%20Quill\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Terokk%27s%20Mask\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"The%20Saga%20of%20Terokk\"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt;. But Terokk was foretold to return some day.\nThe Rise of the Sethekk.\nThe high arakkoa cryptically predicted the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; a century before it happened.\nAt some point the arakkoa invaded the &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the orcs to hide in fear in their villages until they were inspired and led to victory by &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;. While it's unclear if these were members of the Adherents or not, the arakkoa at the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Haal%27esh\"&gt;Den of Haal'esh&lt;/a&gt; in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; may be remnants of this invasion.\nAfter some time, in the wake of continued and escalating attacks by the Adherents of Rukhmar, the Arakkoa Outcasts sought to contact Terokk. Their rituals were unsuccessful, however, and without any champions to guide them the Outcasts became increasingly dire and desperate. The &lt;a href=\"Sethekk\"&gt;Sethekk&lt;/a&gt; cult, followers of the dead god Sethe, gained more power, and the Outcasts spiraled into darkness. The loss of Terokk also saw the loss of &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;The Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, cutting off communication between the Outcasts and the only god who had watched over them after being rejected by their own &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;creator&lt;/a&gt;, and the Sethekk began to harness Sethe's powers to find the raven god and bend him to their will. The only arakkoa who would continue to worship Anzu were those of the &lt;a href=\"Grishna\"&gt;Grishna&lt;/a&gt; cult, located today in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of northern &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The Grishna would come to be considered heretics.\nRise of the Horde.\nThe arakkoa survived the harshness of Draenor for decades, though they suffered terribly during both the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde's&lt;/a&gt; rampage across their world and the civil war between Adherents and Outcasts. By this time, the Sethekk and the Outcasts had abandoned Sethe in favor of an &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Old%20God\"&gt;unnamed Old God&lt;/a&gt;. The summoning of &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; was mistakenly seen by the Sethekk as the arrival of their master on the planet, and so the Sethekk leader &lt;a href=\"Talon%20King%20Ikiss\"&gt;Ikiss&lt;/a&gt; led them to the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Halls\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt;. A group known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Conclave\"&gt;Dark Conclave&lt;/a&gt; attempted to summon this Old God in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; to stop the Horde, but &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; used a powerful spell to destroy their camps and twist their spirits, successfully delaying their rituals.\nThe high arakkoa posed one of the greatest threats to the Horde due to their rediscovered Apexis technology, most prominently the solar cannon atop Skyreach. &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; called on &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt;, which lived in Arak, to deal with the arakkoa. Kargath not only used his Shattered Hand, but also the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; to form a lightly armored but highly mobile army. They stormed the forests near Skyreach but were not prepared for the arakkoa's weaponry. The searing beam of fire that lanced across the forests incinerated dozens of orcs where they stood. Rather than mount another direct assault, Kargath sought out allies in the Outcasts and struck a bargain: if the arakkoa infiltrated Skyreach and destroyed the weaponry, the orcs would join the fight and slaughter the high arakkoa. Then, the Outcasts could take Skyreach.\nEnticed by the offer, the Outcasts snuck into Skyreach and waged war on the city. What they lacked in numbers they made up for with their magic and destroyed the mechanism atop the city. A blinding explosion tore through the sky and set the heavens aflame. When Kargath and his forces finally arrived, they slaughtered the high arakkoa as promised and cast their bodies from the city. However, the battle-crazed orcs also turned on the Outcasts. Kargath saw them as a threat. Knowing they were cunning and intelligent, he assumed they would one day learn to wield the same powers the high arakkoa had and he could not take that risk. But in addition, he simply enjoyed betraying the wretches. Kargath's followers did not kill every high arakkoa they came across. Some were taken prisoner and cast into the Sethekk Hollow based on stories the Outcasts had told them. Kargath reveled in the sight of the last of the high arakkoa writhing in agony as shadow energy transformed them.\nIn the end, the Horde's assault on the Spires of Arak destroyed high arakkoan civilization and killed nearly all of the Outcasts. Only a small number of wingless arakkoa survived, including those that had recently been hurled into the Sethekk Hollow. The Outcasts shrouded themselves in shadows and took refuge from the Horde in the deepest corners of Terokkar Forest. The high arakkoa who had recently been transformed rallied around an individual named &lt;a href=\"Grizzik\"&gt;Grizzik&lt;/a&gt;, a former Skyreach guard. He led his followers to Auchindoun, knowing most orcs feared those haunted ruins. There, he nursed a bitter hatred of the Horde and awaited the day when he might exact vengeance. Dark forces had claimed Auchindoun years ago, and the arakkoa spent their time studying them, worshiping them, and eventually falling under their sway.\nThe Second War.\nThe first known contact of an arakkoa with the races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;expedition to Draenor&lt;/a&gt; several years after the Horde's rampage. Grizzik, emboldened by his people's suffering at the hands of the orcs, offered to serve as a tracker and guide for &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;'s forces, leading them to the Bleeding Hollow fortress of Auchindoun and aiding in the battle there.\nWhen Draenor shattered and became Outland, the Spires of Arak were destroyed, taking with them Rukhmar and the remains of Sethe. The arakkoa in Skettis, as well as those who had fled to Auchindoun and the dark corners of Terokkar Forest, escaped the destruction.\nThe Legacy of Terokk.\nBy the time the modern &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; came to Outland, the minions of Terokk\u2014who was still largely revered by the arakkoa\u2014were working in his name to commit evils throughout Terokkar Forest, with the Talon King himself having succumbed to the curse and descended into madness during his long residency in shadow. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Shienor\"&gt;Veil Shienor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Reskk\"&gt;Veil Reskk&lt;/a&gt;, the Eyes of Skettis allowed Terokk to spy on those areas. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Skith\"&gt;Veil Skith&lt;/a&gt;, the arakkoa used the &lt;a href=\"Darkstone%20of%20Terokk\"&gt;Darkstone of Terokk&lt;/a&gt; as an altar of worship and kidnapped children. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Rhaze\"&gt;Veil Rhaze&lt;/a&gt;, the spirits of arakkoa slain in the Auchindoun explosion remained with Terokk's influence remaining on them. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Lithic\"&gt;Veil Lithic&lt;/a&gt;, his minions corrupted &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt; into his service. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Shalas\"&gt;Veil Shalas&lt;/a&gt;, the closest colony to Skettis, the arakkoa &lt;a href=\"sage\"&gt;sage&lt;/a&gt;s conducted wars against the Light.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Skettis%20Exiles\"&gt;Skettis Exiles&lt;/a&gt;, taken in by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; and led by &lt;a href=\"Kirrik%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Kirrik the Awakened&lt;/a&gt;, saw Terokk for what he had become. They now reside in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, where they battle against Terokk's forces. Meanwhile in Auchindoun, having finally dominated the will of Anzu, the very deity that had saved their forefathers from madness, Ikiss and the Sethekk had the raven god attack the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Adventurers of the Alliance and Horde ultimately invaded his stronghold, however, and ended his and Anzu's lives.\nMeanwhile, deep inside Skettis, the arakkoa continued their battles against all who opposed their efforts to bring Terokk back from the shadows. The &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Sha'tari Skyguard&lt;/a&gt;, an airborne detachment &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; warriors, established a base at &lt;a href=\"Blackwind%20Landing\"&gt;Blackwind Landing&lt;/a&gt;, just outside of the Blackwind Valley where Skettis is located. At this point, the &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest\"&gt;Talonpriest&lt;/a&gt;s dwelled in the world of shadows where Terokk had long ago been sealed. On &lt;a href=\"Terokk%27s%20Rest\"&gt;an island in the middle of Blackwind Lake&lt;/a&gt;, Terokk awaited the proper alignment of the stars to herald his return. With the help of the Sha'tari Skyguard and Skettis Exiles the adventurers who had slain Ikiss also invaded Skettis and prepared a ritual to summon the maddened Talon King before the proper time. This led to Terokk returning to his now shattered planet as a weakened shadow of his former self who immediately attacked the adventurers for interfering. In the ensuing battle, the adventurers killed the once-mighty Talon King, ending the final legacy of Arak.\nThough many arakkoa remain in Outland, their once-proud civilization remains largely scattered and in ruins. Without the leadership of their deities, it falls upon the strength of the arakkoa themselves to determine what comes next for their people.\nTraveler.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, several arakkoa were part of the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Highlord Xaraax&lt;/a&gt;. They were stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; led an Azerothian force to invade the fortress, defeating the enemies.\nAlternate Draenor.\nWhen the Raven Swallows the Day.\nOn an &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Arakkoa Outcasts got the champions they so desperately needed. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s met with the arakkoa &lt;a href=\"Reshad\"&gt;Reshad&lt;/a&gt; during their darkest hour when the Adherents of Rukhmar were in the middle of their genocidal campaign. With these champions' help, the Adherents' Apexis excavations were set back and Outcasts were saved from slavery. The long-lost &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt; was also found, at long last reuniting the arakkoa with for the first time since Terokk vanished. The &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Sethekk's&lt;/a&gt; ritual to dominate Anzu's will was stopped, &lt;a href=\"Talon%20King%20Ikiss%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ikiss&lt;/a&gt; was killed, and Anzu slew Sethe's spirit. The Sethekk would never rise to power as they had in the main timeline.\nThe Outcasts attempt to summon and commune with &lt;a href=\"Terokk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; was successful in this universe, now that their champions from Azeroth-Prime had aided them in gathering his relics. However, Reshad believed that summoning Terokk physically would be a mistake and it was likely that he would only spiral them further into darkness. Instead, against &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt;'s wishes, the champion was imbued with Terokk's power and took on his form to battle . Despite the Avatar of Terokk losing the battle, Terokk's spirit told the arakkoa to forge their own path, lay the past to rest, and raise new champions.\nWith Anzu's blessing, the Outcasts called upon &lt;a href=\"Ka%27alu\"&gt;Ka'alu&lt;/a&gt;, his consort. Ka'alu aided the Outcasts in an assault on the Adherents' Apexis weapons, destroying their solar-powered cannons. Afterward, Skyreach itself was attacked and &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;High Sage Viryx&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Adherents of Rukhmar, was killed. This led to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Order of the Awakened&lt;/a&gt;, an organization of both cursed and high arakkoa; however, the Arakkoa Outcasts do not trust them. As for Rukhmar herself, she was ultimately slain as well.\nWith their champions reuniting them with Anzu, dismantling the Sethekk, and stopping the genocide of the Adherents, the Arakkoa Outcasts found hope in the darkness and looked toward a brighter future. Some of the Outcasts came to realize that the ancient arakkoa had known that having light and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; in equal measure was natural. Only together would the Outcasts and their winged cousins succeed.\nThe Burning Legion.\nFollowing 's takeover of the Iron Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began its invasion of Draenor in earnest. The Sethekk allied themselves with the Legion and its in order to revive &lt;a href=\"Rasthe\"&gt;Rasthe&lt;/a&gt;, son of Sethe. In addition, Iskar and several other members of the Outcasts turned to Gul'dan and consumed &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic to rid themselves of Sethe's curse and regain their wings.\nBoth the Sethekk and Iskar's group of fel arakkoa moved to Tanaan Jungle to assist the Legion's invasion. To combat the two groups, the Order of the Awakened has begun operations in the jungle as well. Reshad with the help of the adventurers spied on them. Horde and Alliance sent heroes to battle them in the areas the arakkoa controlled.\nDuring the march of the Hellfire Citadel, Iskar and his followers were killed.\nBiology and culture.\nArakkoa are as \"smart as any &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; you ever met\", according to &lt;a href=\"Gremni%20Longbeard\"&gt;Gremni Longbeard&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Grizzik\"&gt;Grizzik&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that arakkoa are able to become fluent in languages at a remarkable rate by observing speakers for only a short time.\nThey have brightly feathered bodies in a veritable rainbow of colors, hooked beaks, clawed hands, taloned feet, and an erectile crest of feathers on their heads. High arakkoa stand tall and have wings coming from their arms, while the cursed arakkoa are hunched over and wingless. Arakkoa gender is not reflected in feather color or any other detail apparent to non-arakkoa. This lack of sexual dimorphism means most non-arakkoa have a difficult time telling them apart. Female arakkoa, such as &lt;a href=\"Ornekka\"&gt;Ornekka&lt;/a&gt;, do have distinctly feminine voices, however.\n in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; notes that the fel corruption within the jungle's &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis crystals&lt;/a&gt; has begun to affect many of the arakkoa. They are so accustomed to the power it grants them that more succumb to the whispers every day.\nThe arakkoa decorate their weapons and armor with fantastic jewels.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemist\"&gt;Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s have found uses for the oils secreted by arakkoa feathers. Their feathers are also desired for magical rituals.\nCustoms.\nBoth flying and cursed arakkoa have caste systems; &lt;a href=\"Hazzik\"&gt;Hazzik&lt;/a&gt; mentions it in regards to the cursed, while &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt; mentions that of the high arakkoa. Arakkoa are given a place in society before they are even given a name. The cursed arakkoa wear ragged cloaks about their bodies and two of their castes appear to be \"sage\" (with ornate shoulder and head ornaments) and \"warrior\" (with a metal helm and mail epaulets) classes. High arakkoa, meanwhile, dress in anything from robes to extravagant armor. Some of their castes appear to be guards and priests.\nThe Adherents pair young arakkoa together. Doing so means the fledgling members of the order can watch over each other and ensure that everyone follows the decrees Rukhmar. If one accomplishes a great feat, both would be showered with praise. Likewise, if one transgresses, both would be punished. \"Clutch brother / clutch sister\" is a symbolic term, rather than literal.\nFlying arakkoa also carry with them &lt;a href=\"dreamcatcher\"&gt;dreamcatcher&lt;/a&gt;s that are said protect them from Sethe's curse. The dreamcatchers allegedly absorb the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt; and then get rid of the darkness in the morning light. Outcast Arakkoa have repurposed the dreamcatcher not to ward off the Curse of Sethe, but to capture and harvest tiny amounts of essences from their lost gods.\n&lt;a href=\"Rukhmar%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Rukhmar's Grace&lt;/a&gt; is the name given to the time of year when the sun was at its highest and the days were long and bright. To mark the start of the period, high arakkoa were required to attend a ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; and perform rites. As well, every time a mark on a sundial is cast on by a shadow they say a prayer to their goddess.\nThe Adherents are known to burn their victims alive in ritualistic sacrifice.\nThe cursed arakkoa have some knowledge of celestial bodies.\nBird breeding.\nThe arakkoa are well known for breeding various types of birds, such as owls and ravens, and training them as guards and companions.\nThe species of owl known as &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt; is particularly prized by the arakkoa and known to have valuable feathers. Some arakkoa are able to see through the eyes of these winged beings, using the rare skill to watch over the activities of others.\nFaith.\nOriginally, the arakkoa worshipped the sun goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, who created them. Talon King Terokk, who was Rukhmar's chosen, was believed to be the goddess himself and hence was highly revered by her followers, the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentral to high arakkoan culture is reverence of Rukhmar and the sun. Hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Solar%20Orb\"&gt;Solar Orb&lt;/a&gt;s are scattered around &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, which cast a never-ending light so no arakkoa need go without the sun's warmth, even on a cold and overcast day. In death all arakkoa seek to join Rukhmar in the skies above Draenor, and thus &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;cremation&lt;/a&gt; is vastly preferred to burial. Some have their ashes scattered high in the skies, others are collected in ornate urns and placed in crypts. While devotees of Rukhmar prefer cremation, the outcasts have taken to darker last rites.\nBelieving they have been abandoned by the sun, cursed arakkoa prefer to hide in the forests or beneath awnings during daylight hours. &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest\"&gt;Talonpriest&lt;/a&gt;s take this a step further and never show their faces to the sun, wearing ritual masks that act as a focus for their communes with Anzu.\nSome turned away from Rukhmar, but seem to still hold Terokk in high regard. The group of arakkoa once known as the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; worshiped &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; and Terokk, but by the time they became the &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; faction in Anzu seems to have become looked down upon and only worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Grishna\"&gt;Grishna&lt;/a&gt; cult. In the past, a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Ravenspeakers\"&gt;Ravenspeakers&lt;/a&gt; followed &lt;a href=\"Ka%27alu\"&gt;Ka'alu&lt;/a&gt; the Raven Mother, leader of all &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt;s and Anzu's consort.\nIn Outland, the arakkoa of Skettis now worship the &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Old%20God\"&gt;Summoned Old God&lt;/a&gt;, who is also worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk\"&gt;Sethekk&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Talon%20King%20Ikiss\"&gt;Talon King Ikiss&lt;/a&gt; (who thinks himself Terokk reborn). Before the worship of the Old God, the Sethekk followed &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;. Some arakkoa of the Sethekk cult also mention something known as \"&lt;a href=\"Darkfire\"&gt;Darkfire&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMagic.\nThe ancient Apexis used the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. While the Adherents of Rukhmar may appear to use the Light, they actually use a form of solar magic more comparable to the solar magic used by &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. Arakkoa sun worship has resulted in the creation of some strange and monstrous minions. The Outcasts, on the other hand, use &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt; similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Shadow\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s. This is particularly evident in the &lt;a href=\"talonpriest\"&gt;talonpriest&lt;/a&gt;s, who wield dark magic granted to them by &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; and use strange elixirs to pass over into a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;shadow realm&lt;/a&gt; filled with &lt;a href=\"fleshbeast\"&gt;fleshbeast&lt;/a&gt;s and other shadowy creatures. The Outcasts also wield arcane sorcery.\nColonies.\nThe arakkoan capital is the hidden city of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt;, located high in the mountains in the southeastern corner of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. In arakkoan myth, the city was built by &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; himself, with the help of the raven god &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, as a refuge for all &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;. Assuming the modern Skettis is in fact the same city, it represents the only remaining portion of the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, the ancestral home of the arakkoa and their primal gods long since lost to the transformation of Draenor into Outland.\nMost colonies established by arakkoa are known as \"Veils\", numerous examples of which can be found throughout Terokkar Forest. &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Shienor\"&gt;Veil Shienor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Reskk\"&gt;Veil Reskk&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the north of Terokkar near the border with &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, and several exist along the outer rim of the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Skith\"&gt;Veil Skith&lt;/a&gt;, where the Darkstone of Terokk is located; &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Rhaze\"&gt;Veil Rhaze&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed by the Auchindoun disaster; &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Lithic\"&gt;Veil Lithic&lt;/a&gt;, where the arakkoa corrupt avians into Terokk's service; and &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Shalas\"&gt;Veil Shalas&lt;/a&gt;, their greatest colony at the base of Skettis itself, where Terokk's sages wage war against the Light. The arakkoa also have established presences at &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Ruuan\"&gt;Veil Ruuan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Lashh\"&gt;Veil Lashh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Vekh\"&gt;Veil Vekh&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe exceptions to the \"Veil\" naming convention tend to coincide with unique traits in the arakkoa at each location. The &lt;a href=\"Grishnath\"&gt;Grishnath&lt;/a&gt; settlement in the Blade's Edge Mountains, for example, is the northernmost arakkoan settlement in existence and plays host to the only remaining worshipers of Anzu, the dread raven god of arakkoa lore. The arakkoa of the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Haal%27esh\"&gt;Den of Haal'esh&lt;/a&gt; in Hellfire Peninsula, meanwhile, are the only ones who have been observed settling in an entirely treeless environment, instead nesting in rocky crags; it is theorized that these are the same arakkoa that once waged war on the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, and perhaps most mysteriously of all, are the two areas where arakkoa appear to have settled in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. All that remain of these &lt;a href=\"Sketh%27lon\"&gt;Sketh'lon&lt;/a&gt; settlements are ruins and the ghosts of the inhabitants, who were twice thwarted in their attempts to summon a &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Old%20God\"&gt;mysterious god&lt;/a&gt; into their midst\u2014once by the orc warlock &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and again by fearless &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDespite the inquisitive nature of the arakkoa, there have been no attempts made of arakkoan settlement in Azeroth; only the occasional &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Visitor\"&gt;visitor&lt;/a&gt;. There have, however, been a few cases of solitary arakkoa doing business in Azeroth, such as &lt;a href=\"Erekem\"&gt;Erekem&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious criminal from Outland who attempted to assassinate the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; but was stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspiration.\nThe arakkoa are aesthetically inspired by the , an evil race of bird-men featured in the 1982 fantasy film \"\". Direct references to \"The Dark Crystal\" include the arakkoa capital of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; (a reference to the Skeksis themselves), the &lt;a href=\"Darkstone%20of%20Terokk\"&gt;Darkstone of Terokk&lt;/a&gt; (a reference to the film's title), and one of &lt;a href=\"Talon%20King%20Ikiss\"&gt;Talon King Ikiss&lt;/a&gt;' quotes, which references the catchphrase of skekSil, the main Skeksis villain of the film. They also bear a strong resemblance to the Shrykes of , both in appearance and architecture.\nThe name \"arakkoa\" may have been derived from the in , or the from the Disney movie . Though not proven, the lore of the arakkoa may also be inspired by the bird-like Chozo of the \"Metroid\" video game series, whose mysterious disappearance and powerful, ancient artifacts parallel those of the extinct &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization and the relics they left behind.\nAs with many of the races of the WarCraft universe, arakkoa culture may have a real-world analogue, here in the real world's . This is most evident in their caste system, but the high arakkoa also predominantly use \u2014weapons invented in India\u2014and some have traditional Indian names. The \"Warlords of Draenor\" alpha also contained a reference to in the Dungeon Journal entry for &lt;a href=\"Ranjit\"&gt;Ranjit&lt;/a&gt;, a boss in the arakkoa-themed &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; dungeon, but it was removed before the official release of the game. Furthermore, the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; zone is roughly shaped like the Indian subcontinent.\nAs a result of this Indian theme, the winged arakkoa may be partially based on the , a humanoid bird who serves as the (mount) of in Hindu mythology."}
