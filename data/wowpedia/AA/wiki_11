Due to his consumption of the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, he did not embrace his true heritage and eventually began to practice the dark magics prescribed by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike his fellow Dragonmaw, he did not become a fel orc.\nBiography.\nSecond War.\nZuluhed was apparently the last and only shaman to accompany the Horde. Since the elements and ancestors had abandoned the orc clans out of anger, many shaman turned to demonic magic; Zuluhed was one of the few who refused, out of distrust for Gul'dan and distaste for demonic magic.\nHe was eternally loyal to &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; during his reign as &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, and wished to remain so even after his death, so he pledged the allegiance of the small but powerful &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw Clan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, the sons of Blackhand: an alliance assumed to be broken when Rend pledged the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, most feared enemy of the Dragonmaw.\nDuring the Second War, Zuluhed received a vision of a powerful artifact hidden within the Redridge Mountains, and requested permission from &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to locate it. Despite Zuluhed's apparent loyalty to the sons of Blackhand \u2014 his chief rivals \u2014 Doomhammer believed that the elder shaman acted in the Horde's best interests, and agreed to allow Zuluhed and his clan to find the artifact in question. Following the source of his visions, Zuluhed came into possession of what he called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. He assured Doomhammer that he would be able to unlock its powers, but this proved difficult even with the still-formidable powers of the elder shaman. Zuluhed decided to give the artifact to his Second, &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, a former warlock, and with its power managed to capture the dragonqueen, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and subjugate her &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza, threatened with the death of her children, unwillingly gave the Horde an endless supply of her deadly progeny. Zuluhed, sensing the power within the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;s, directed the Horde there and after defeating the handful of dwarves dwelling here, Doomhammer claimed it for the orcs. He also followed the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and reported Orgrim that the dragon fires were inefficient against Silvermoon as the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; energy was used to shield the city.\nAt the end of the Second War, Zuluhed returned through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and thus was not present when Alexstrasza was freed and the majority of his clan destroyed at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nHe survived the destruction of Draenor and he eventually pledged what remained of his clan to &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Dark Portal was reopened, &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt; attacked Dragonmaw Fortress but Zuluhed and some orcs escaped his wrath.\nHe enslaved &lt;a href=\"Karynaku\"&gt;Karynaku&lt;/a&gt;, matriarch of the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20dragonflight\"&gt;Netherwing dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, to provide drakes for his new master. Zuluhed resided at &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Fortress\"&gt;Dragonmaw Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, east of the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Fields\"&gt;Netherwing Fields&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and is involved in the Netherwing quest chain where he is slain.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"Golluck%20Rockfist\"&gt;Golluck Rockfist&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde ambassador to the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, mentions the Dragonmaw's enslaving of Alexstrasza. He says \"Zuluhed and Nekros are dead, but the debt we owe to the reds is far from repaid.\" This seems to indicate that he was killed by allies of the Netherwing dragonflight, as requested by Karynaku in &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nFight.\nOnce you accept &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked (quest)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Karynaku\"&gt;Karynaku&lt;/a&gt;, Zuluhed the Whacked will appear by the entrance to the courtyard you're in along with 8 archers along the top wall. You can reset the quest by flying/jumping off the ledge. Zuluhed will despawn and you have to abandon the quest and reaccept. The right side room has some \"back rooms\" in it; running into those back rooms will also reset Zuluhed (but not his summoned demons).\nEasiest way to complete it is to get a cookie cutter group of a tank, healer, and 3 dps classes. It's easier to fly up to the courtyard, but you can also clear your way up the path. Clear out one of the rooms either to the left or right of the entrance, then accept the quest and have all of your group run into the room and start the fight. About 30 seconds into the fight, he starts to summon &lt;a href=\"Arcubus%20Destroyer\"&gt;Arcubus Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; a level 68 elite demon. His summon spell is has a half-second casting time so it's hard to interrupt. After 15 seconds, the demon will spawn and you have to deal with it as well.\nIf you clear both rooms, once he starts casting the summon, run into the other room. Zuluhed will follow, but the demon, being in an empty room, will not aggro and can be ignored. Just stay away from the door to that room.\nUnlike Zuluhed, the &lt;a href=\"Arcubus%20Destroyer\"&gt;Arcubus Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; does not automatically attack the party. It simply appears and sits there, not moving. Its aggro rules are the same as an ordinary &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014it will not aggro for the first few seconds of appearing, and then only if a player steps within &lt;a href=\"aggro%20radius\"&gt;aggro radius&lt;/a&gt;. That is quite small for a level 80 player, so one solo strategy is to stay in the same room but simply take a few steps back. If undisturbed, the &lt;a href=\"Arcubus%20Destroyer\"&gt;Arcubus Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; will sit passively even after Zuluhed falls, and will despawn after three or four minutes. \nThe archers are a serious threat. Many will start casting &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt;, which has a long (over 3 second) cast but hits for over 1000 on level 80 plate blues. This will quickly cut down a player or party who dwells out in the open or stands too close to a door. \nZuluhed also casts &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rain of Fire&lt;/a&gt; which hits for about 1000 per tick. It has a very small radius.\nIf you are trying to solo this at 80, some classes can find this very difficult. The main threats are the archers, the demons and his &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rain of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid the archers, clear a room in advance and run inside it before the fight begins - Zuluhed will come to you. Immediately step out of any &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rain of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Even with quick stepping, most of your damage will be fire. When an &lt;a href=\"Arcubus%20Destroyer\"&gt;Arcubus Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; spawns, quickly step back out of its aggro radius. For a level 80, the rightmost room has enough space for at least two demons to spawn and still be well out of their aggro radius. Don't end up near the doorway. (Preferably have the demons spawn nearer the doorway so you can run into the back room to reset the encounter if need be.) The instant Zuluhed falls, loot the key.\nSpeculation.\nIt is unclear how the shamanistic spirits continued to answer him, despite having forsaken most of the orcs, however, this may only apply to on Azeroth, as he was said to be able to contact them there, it is unknown whether or not he could on Draenor. They may have still answered him if he chose to not partake in the carnage, as he is not mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Rise of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\". But if he was only able to contact them on Azeroth, this may explain why he appears to be a warlock when encountered at Dragonmaw Fortress. Strangely enough however is the fact that he is not a fel orc, unlike the rest of his clan in Outland."}

Kill a few &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Boneworker\"&gt;Zandalari Boneworker&lt;/a&gt;s and pull him closer to the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Spirit%20of%20Tharon%27ja\"&gt;Eternal Spirit of Tharon'ja&lt;/a&gt;, who does not play a part in the encounter.\nZur'chaka will start channeling Spirit Bolts, which should be interrupted, or they will hit for 16,500 Shadow every half-second. He will also summon a Fountain of Skulls, which launches missiles all over the area randomly for roughly 10 seconds. If a missile hits the ground within 2 yards of a player, it will inflict 50,000 Shadow damage.\nEvery 40 seconds after the start of the encounter, Zur'chaka will Roll the Bones. He will cast Strengthen Bones on himself (), increasing all damage output by 10% for the rest of the encounter, cast Mend Bones at all enemies within 20 yards of him (), healing them for ~200,000 health each, or cast Fountain of Skulls again (). Strengthen Bones does stack, and affects his melee swings, Spirit Bolts, and Fountain of Skulls.\nStart unloading on Zur'chaka right from the start, as his damage output will only go higher the longer the encounter lasts. Interrupt his Spirit Bolts, which will not be cast that frequently, and dodge the Fountain of Skulls while still trying to do damage to him. He will Roll the Bones every 40 seconds, so make sure to be within 20 yards of him in case he rolls Mend Bones for the free heal. Otherwise, make sure not to pull any additional mobs while moving about."}

The Obliterator's malevolence gives pause even to mad &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, who considers the void lord's appetite for magic distasteful. But genocide makes strange bedfellows.\"\nStrategies.\nZuramat is a large Voidlord that is caged on the west side of the Violet Hold. Throughout the fight he will summon Void Sentries that will hit the party with a Shadowbolt Volley every few seconds - the only way to kill them is to get the Void Shifted debuff, which is obtained after getting hit by the boss with his Void Shift attack. This gives you a 15 second window to kill the void adds. Another strategy is to burn down the boss as fast as possible and ignore the adds - which will depend on your healer's effectiveness, as the damage being inflicted to the whole party can become massive towards the end of the fight. \nFor this boss you should place the tank in the center of the room and the rest of the group should make a half circle around the tank about 15 yards back, facing the broken wall. He will approach through the broken area of the wall and the tank should grab him and bring him to the center. \nThe Shroud of Darkness buff on the boss can be removed by the following:\nThis should help avoid anyone getting the healing debuff, and allow relatively uninterrupted dps.\nHe also casts Void Shift on one random player, this is a debuff that allows that player to see the Void Sentries that are holding the void spheres, this player should kill every sentry they can during the 15 seconds that the debuff lasts. \nThe Void Sentries have very little HP, so light AoE is usually sufficient to kill the Sentries while Void Shifted. If you need to single target the sentries, a targeting macro can be very useful. (/tar Void Sentry)\nIf you find that your party is unable to deal with the Sentries in a timely fashion, the defense crystals in the room may also be used to deal with them. \nUnholy Death Knights can throw up &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Zone\"&gt;Anti-Magic Zone&lt;/a&gt;, if so talented, for a protection effect. AMZ will mitigate 75% of the incoming shadow damage until it absorbs 10000 + (DK's AP * 2) damage in total, making the healer's job more bearable.\nNotes.\nIf your party wipes after defeating Zuramat the Obliterator, he will be replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Lord%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Void Lord&lt;/a&gt; during subsequent attempts.\nIn Hearthstone.\nZuramat appears as that can be encountered in the single-player experience in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

He believes technology can do anything. Like most goblins, the primary reason for his interest is the acquisition of wealth. Some years ago, he became convinced that he had discovered a technological key to unlimited riches. He has spent most of his career struggling to refine his processes, meeting with failure every time. With each attempt, he has built larger and larger devices, hoping perhaps that a larger scale would permit success, and paying no heed to the increasing dangerousness and instability of his devices.\nFinally, Goldknuckle has decided that he has designed the proper specifications for the device that will make him wealthy beyond compare. The next step was to find someplace secret where he could build it.\nGoldknuckle constructed a facility in the deep mountains of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, in the process \u2014 ignorant of how his labors could attract the attention he sought to avoid \u2014 cutting down trees and digging into the earth for resources he needed without regard to the balance of nature in the area. This activity draws the attention of a few &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammers&lt;/a&gt;, but the scale is currently too small for them to spend their efforts opposing the goblin. His efforts also stirred up and annoyed the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s in the area.\nOnce Goldknuckle finished his hideout, he began work on his greatest invention \u2014 a device he calls the World Tweaker. The device, he knows, will allow him to become the wealthiest goblin on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo achieve this goal, he intends to activate his world tweaker and change all the gold in the world into copper \u2014 all the gold except that stored in his private vault, of course. Once he does this, Zykos intends to emerge, declare himself ruler of the world, and order the other races to do his bidding. The first to suffer will be his rivals who think him mad. He'll show them the true\npower of technology. Oh, yes!\nOf course, Goldknuckle is completely insane. His device has no chance of achieving his goals. It does have an excellent chance of exploding, however, but Goldknuckle doesn't care."}

They were well known to a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; who were often the targets of their hunt. He is distrustful of many races, as the mortal races either try to kill or enslave his kind.\nWhen the surviving demons of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; reopened the Dark Portal, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, a blue dragon, was drawn to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; by a strange yet familiar source of magic. Zzeraku and &lt;a href=\"Valoku\"&gt;Valoku&lt;/a&gt; came across Tyrygosa after she had been struck down by the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt; and was captured by a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;. Valoku advocated that they help her as she was like them and could answer their questions but Zzeraku didn't trust her. An argument was sparked between the two Nether dragons that distracted the Broken enough for Tyrygosa to escape. Tyrygosa recruited the help of the two nether dragons in locating and rescuing her missing companion &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; but was misled and attacked by Zzeraku before he flew off abandoning her. Valoku flew off behind him.\nZzeraku encountered Tyrygosa again when she was later brought by Valoku to their Dragon lair. From Tyrygosa, Zzeraku discovers that he and his dragonflight are descendants of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. With the promise that Tyrygosa would free their brethren from their enthrallment, they partook in the battle for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; against Ragnok Bloodreaver's forces.\nTyrygosa convinced Valoku and Zzeraku to battle their own people in an attempt to free the nether dragons from the control of Ragnok, who was leading an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Valoku eventually placed himself in front of Tyrygosa to protect her from an attack by the enthralled nether dragons. His shield spell eventually faltered to their attacks and he burned away. This drove Zzeraku in a rage which caused him to start firing spells randomly at Valoku's killers. Eventually, one spell collided with the energies of the Dark Portal and destroyed it.\nFollowing the defeat of Ragnok Bloodreaver's army, Tyrygosa attempts to free the dragons Ragnok enthralled, but &lt;a href=\"Kadavan\"&gt;Kadavan&lt;/a&gt; informs her that those enthralled under his devices gradually weaken until they eventually burn out. Nothing can save them unless an extremely powerful source of arcane power can revitalize the dragons enough to free themselves. Tyrygosa, Kadavan, and Zzeraku open a dimensional rift to Azeroth and bring a group of enthralled Netherwing dragons to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; where they absorb its magical energies. Yet Zzeraku and the nether dragons grow mad with power and frustrated with everyone they've ever encountered trying to use them, decide to be masters of their own destinies and conquer Azeroth for themselves. Tyrygosa tries to reason with Zzeraku, telling him that by following Deathwing's path, Azeroth will rise against them and lead to their destruction. Though conflicted with Tyrygosa's sincere concern for his kind, Zzeraku believes that only by gaining power can he safeguard his people. The netherwing dragons attack the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, and in the midst of the chaos, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; awakens from his slumber. In his insanity, Malygos misinterprets the nether dragons' arrogant proclamations of being the embodiment of the Nexus and absorbs them and their power.\nThe dragon's Nether-warped physiology began to affect the Spell-Weaver himself, ultimately helping him regain some of his lost sanity. With his sanity restored to him, Tyrygosa's patron declared war on mortal spellcasters, sending his flight out to do his bidding. Only Zzeraku managed to escape, berating himself for not trusting Tyrygosa's warnings. He tried to seek out Tyrygosa's council on what to do next but as he roamed Azeroth, he was eventually captured by &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; who trapped him in &lt;a href=\"Balacgos%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Balacgos's Bane&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight of the Dragon.\nZendarin delivered the dragon to his mistress Sinthria.\nSintharia, now calling herself Sinestra, little by little fed the nether dragon to her newest creation, the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. Zzeraku, immobilized deep within &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, suffered greatly but refused to have his will broken. He was inspired by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt;'s attempts to free him, and flew into a rage when he saw harm done to her \u2014 breaking free of his bonds and engaging the twilight dragon in a battle that led them out of the halls of Grim Batol. There Dargonax fully absorbed the dying Zzeraku, who had decided to try and save Iridi at the cost of his own life. His sacrifice was not in vain, however: He catalyzed the minor defective part within the twilight dragon that Iridi and her allies were able to exploit and finally defeat Dargonax.\nIn Hearthstone.\nZzeraku appears as for the warlock class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"\"The extra Z is for \"zesty.\"\"\""}

This talent gives the paladin a chance to gain an additional attack on their next &lt;a href=\"auto-attack\"&gt;auto-attack&lt;/a&gt;, stacking up to 4 times.\nReckoning Bomb.\nThe term Reckoning Bomb refers to an attack that consumes multiple Reckoning \"charges\" at once, dealing a burst of damage via consecutive attacks. This is done by turning off &lt;a href=\"auto-attack\"&gt;auto-attack&lt;/a&gt; and allowing yourself to be critically hit until multiple stacks are accumulated, then turning it back on to use them all.\nReckoning could originally store an infinite number of charges, which meant Reckoning Bombs had the potential to deal massive amounts of damage. In May 2005, a paladin named Karmerr soloed &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; by unleashing a 1,816-charge Reckoning on him, killing him in a matter of seconds.\nShortly after this, Reckoning was hotfixed to store a maximum of only 4 charges."}

Then, when Lady Prestor receives Lescovar's killer following The Attack, the King is already missing, meaning the Missing Diplomat chain is intended to occur around the same time (perhaps immediately after). It can be further inferred that while the kidnapping was carried out after the Deadmines project fell apart with VanCleef's death, the abduction was planned well before that time and therefore was likely VanCleef's brainchild.\nCompared to these two plots, both of which threaten all of Stormwind, it would appear that the Stockade uprising organized by Thredd and Lescovar was intended merely as a side project, which explains why VanCleef did not have a very heavy hand in it."}

The video must first be captured and then encoded.\nPrior to the 2.2.0 release of World of Warcraft, two commercial software programs allowed screen video capture in game: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html\"&gt;iShowU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/\"&gt;SnapzProX&lt;/a&gt;. The default recording path of files for the World of Warcraft video recorder is by default \"World of Warcraft/Movies\". This folder can be changed by adding \"SET MovieRecordingPath \"/Volumes/SomeDisk\"\" in the \"World of Warcraft/WTF/config.wtf\" file.\nWorld of Warcraft Video Recorder Options.\nThis recorder is supported by Blizzard Entertainment, so assistance can be found at the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html%3FforumId%3D11111\"&gt;World of Warcraft Macintosh Forums&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe recorder has many options which can be accessed from the \"Mac Options\" submenu of the \"Game Menu\". These Options are as follows:\nEncoding Recommendation.\nTypical videos (since most Macintoshes come with a version of iLife/iMovie) should be at a resolution of 640x480@23.97 framerate, encoded with MPEG-4.\nFor entry-level HD encoding using a 2.8 GHz iMac with 4 GB RAM or a superior system, record at 1280*800 @ fps 1/2 of game frame rate, and compress with H.264 for smaller files and virtually the same quality as MPEG-4. Set Quality to High. This can then be letterboxed to fit 'normal' 1280*720 HD format.\nExternal Audio Recording and Editing.\nAudio recording of sounds not made by the World of Warcraft game can be recorded by three programs: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/audio/soundflower.html\"&gt;Soundflower&lt;/a&gt; (freeware), &lt;a href=\"http%3A//rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/\"&gt;Audio Hijack Pro&lt;/a&gt; (commercial) and the very simple and easy-to-use &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/\"&gt;WireTap Studio&lt;/a&gt; (commercial). \nAudio editing can be done with the GPL-licensed program &lt;a href=\"http%3A//audacity.sourceforge.net/\"&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt;.\n=Macintosh Movie Editing=\nThe following iMovie example was done in iMovie HD 6.0.3. Source video was MPEG-4, 640x480@23.97 fps.\nFinal Cut Pro (FCP) and Final Cut Express (FCE).\nFCP and FCE require specific qualities of files when importing.\nAralesh on Bloodhoof-US: \"FinalCut (Express or Studio) won't open files with anything other then [sic] PCM (Uncompressed) or Apple Lossless audio. And make sure your frame rate is at 29.97. \"\n- NOTE that testing has shown frame rate is not the determining factor in whether or not FCE will import a file.\nUnfortunately for the newbie to FCE, there's nothing that will let you know that your Sequence Settings is one of the most important variables in determining the final quality and resolution of your finished video. The following is from p202 of the FCE User's Manual:\n Sequence preset Image dimensions Frame rate Codec\n DV NTSC 720 x 480 29.97 fps DV/DVCPRO NTSC\n DV PAL 720 x 576 25 fps DV PAL\n HDV 1080i60 1440 x 1080 29.97 fps Apple Intermediate Codec \n HDV 1080i50 1440 x 1080 25 fps Apple Intermediate Codec \n HDV 720p30 1280 x 720 29.97 fps Apple Intermediate Codec - Recommended for producing entry-level HD video at a reasonable filesize.\n Keep in mind that you need to capture at this quality or above to take full advantage of it.\nWARNING:\nAfter about a year of using FCE and being continually frustrated with the quality of the end product, I finally found that even more than the Sequence Preset, the 'Render Control' tab hidden in the Sequence Settings will make a monumentally disproportionate impact on your final product. Frame Rate and Resolution should both be set to 100%. /FACEPALM.\nExport Settings Recommendations:\n 5000 kilo bit rate per second\n Single-Pass - I have yet to see an example of MP making a significant impact on my final product.\n 15/20-24fps - the average video watcher will start to notice sever choppiness at around 10-15fps, anything above 30 is just overkill.\n There's no real reason not to cap your in-game fps at 30-40 even, you'll hardly see the difference and get a small performance gain.\n 1280x720 low-end HD resolution\n Letterbox if necessary\n Key Frames Automatic or every 24 frames(?)\n Optimized for Download\n Sound bit rate 128kbps should be fine\n H.264 is a very good codec that's been around for awhile, and won't give anyone much trouble viewing the video\nRegarding bitrate, from http://strats.fusion-guild.org/index.php/CreatingMacintoshVideos#Pre-Editing :\nStarting with 5000 is a good \"test run\". Try dropping it to 2500 -- do you notice a drop in quality significant enough, or does it still look good enough? Try raising it to 7500 -- is it so good that it's worth the extra download time?\n=Direct Editing/Transcoding of Video=\nMany different programs allow transcoding video into different formats and splitting the audio and video into different files. These programs do not allow manual editing of frames.\nTranscoding can also be done using VLC, further info on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.tombfury.com/modules/newbbex/viewtopic.php%3Ftopic_id%3D5%26amp%3Bforum%3D4\"&gt;Tombfury.com Forums&lt;/a&gt;\nMultiplexing using Avidemux.\nThis example takes an audio file and adds it to a video file such that the audio plays when the video plays.\nPrerequisite: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.xvid.org/Software.83.0.html\"&gt;Xvid Quicktime Component&lt;/a&gt; (May also be beneficial to have &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.xiph.org/quicktime/\"&gt;Xiph Quicktime Component&lt;/a&gt; as well. They get installed to the same place: \"&lt;Macintosh HD&gt;/Library/Components\")\nEditing for YouTube.\nYouTube supports uploading of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/topic.py%3Ftopic%3D10524\"&gt;multiple formats&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube will lower the resolution to approximately 320x240 and to an average bitrate of about 380 kbps.\nImporting to FCE/FCP using Quicktime Pro.\nWHY: The video that is compressed by the WoW client is not importable into Final Cut Pro and Final Cut Express, the two most commonly used video editing programs on Mac OS.\nAdvantage: Using Quicktime Pro over iMovie just to get audio AND video into FCE seems to be a relatively simple process.\n1. record video/audio in wow and compress using wow \n2. open up in QTP, hit Command-I to see a little more hidden info about your clip. \n[2.5:] For HD Editing use Quicktime Pro to make initial cuts, it goes a lot faster than doing it all in FCE. You will run into problems with wanting to restore things you cut, but this can be worked around by saving the edited file under a new file name. With a little work and some caution you can avoid a huge bloated file full of un-needed video in FCE. Much easier to do the initial editing in QTPro than find out later when the rendering takes forever. \nTo quickly make initial cuts, use mouse and arrow keys to put the cursor on the first offending frame and press 'I' to place the In Marker, then place the cursor on the frame after the last offending frame and press 'O' to place the Out Marker and then Command-X to Cut. You can also use the Mac System Preferences to bind a key-combination to 'Trim to Selection' for cropping (essentially cutting all materials other than what you've selected. Alt-T is reasonably easy to remember and doesn't force you to do unnatural finger movements. Command-S to save.\n3. Command-E to export, decide where to save it. (Command is the funky weird Apple button, equivalent of the Windows button on PCs). Export: Movie to QuickTime Movie - unclear if this makes a difference for FCE. \n3 ALT. Alternative solution that works better for keeping track of large number of files which you may or may not have already readied for FCE: Export: Movie to MPEG-4.\n Settings:\n File Format: MP4\n Video Format: H.264\n Data Rate: 5000 kbits/sec Optimized for Download. [3000 is recommended by the Vimeo HD FAQ, but this way\n you will retain the option of having reasonably sharp backgrounds later in the editing process]\n Image Size: Current (even if your raw footage is at a much higher resolution than your final product will be \n - it is generally worth it to not make it smaller until you're doing final edits as you may need to\n zoom or crop later.).\n Frame Rate: 24\n Key Frame Every 30 frames [Vimeo HD FAQ recommendation]\n Video Options - Unclear on this, but Single Pass seems to be fine.\nThis solution leads to you not having to worry about figuring out which raw files you've already processed for FCE.\n4. Options button. Enable both Video and Audio. \nSound settings: Format Apple Lossless (PCM may work too, but I just don't really know much about this, ok? ok.) Rate 44.100 since that's what came from WOW afaik. Render settings Faster - dunno if this affects audio much, but I'm not much into audio quality in pvp/pve videos, there'll be music to cover it anyways. Preview button seems to work ok if you're in doubt. \n5. Leave unchecked the box 'Prepare for Internet Streaming' - I can't stand WoW videos on Youtube and like, the visual quality is just too bad. Anything I write about will be HD, or close to it. \n6. hit OK. \n7. hit SAVE. \n8. now you'll get a little window pop-up that'll have a floating bar showing exporting progress. with luck your average 1min pvp clip of about 1min footage = `70-100mb filesize will now be compressed into roughly 50-60% of that. \n9. Now you're ready to import this into FCE. You can either open FCE and then import, or right-click the file and choose 'Open With'. \n10. This entire process, once you've messed with the QTP settings, doesn't take all that long, since the export settings are saved. Open file from wow, stop video playback, Command-E, Enter and DONE.\n11. If you have a very large number of files that are going into one single video (think 3,000+) you will become intimately familiar with Blizzard's file naming conventions and its limitations. Quickly browse through videos and rename them with a code letter in front of or behind the time-location stamp file name that the WoW Mac client assigns. Examples:\n iNaxxramas_092008_200937kill.mov for an Instructor Razuvious cut in Naxx40 that shows the boss dying\n iNaxxramas__The_Military_Quarter_120508_180527e ck reds.mov for the same in Naxx25 as an Establishing shot\n that needs to be chroma-keyed for reds\nImporting to FCE/FCP using MPEG Streamclip.\nAccording to a poster in good standing on the Mac FCE forums:\nTry this free third party app:\nhttp://www.squared5.com/\nYou have to decide which format you want to work with in FCE and use that Easy Setup. Read the details when you are at the Easy Setup window, each are different to suit incoming audio and video.\nThen use Streamclip to convert your original footage to conform to your chosen Easy Setup, audio rate and video size.\nFrom http://strats.fusion-guild.org/index.php/CreatingMacintoshVideos#Pre-Editing :\nIt's quite possible that your editing program will not like the files produced directly out of the WoW client (e.g. Final Cut Pro doesn't). I don't think anyone knows why -- I suspect it has something to do with how the frame rate is recorded.\nThe good news is it's fast and easy to reprocess it with MPEG Streamclip and you don't see any noticeable quality loss.\n * Open your video with MPEG Streamclip\n * Select \"Export to MPEG-4...\" from the File menu\n * Settings:\n o Make sure Compression is set to H.264\n o Quality should be 90-100%\n o Set Frame Rate to \"29.97\"\n o Turn off Interlaced Scaling\n o Set the size to the size of your movie\n o Leave everything else the same, and click \"Make MP4\" \nNOTE: Does not appear to matter what the frame rate is set to. 23.98, 29.97 and 20 all work for film you want to import into FCE.\nIf you're unsure the size of your movie, open it in QuickTime and press \u2318I (command-I) and look in the info box for the dimensions information.\n= References =\nhttp://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1371474767&amp;sid=1 WoW Movie Recording Thread, messy but full of info if you read through it all.\nhttp://vimeo.com/help/hd has some Mac-specific guidelines for how to finalize HD video\nhttp://strats.fusion-guild.org/index.php/CreatingMacintoshVideos#Pre-Editing\nhttp://www.xs4all.nl/~jeschot/home.html JES Video Cleaner\nhttp://www.gimp.org/ GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program.

A player can generate a link (that can only recruit 4 friends every 30 days) that can be sent to a player they want to recruit and the recruitee can choose an already existing account that hadn't had a subscription for a year or create a new which would be linked to the recruiter. Players can also recruit themselves by linking a new free trial account on the same &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; account. Each recruit can provide 12 months toward the rewards.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.5\"&gt;patch 7.3.5&lt;/a&gt;, the XP boost was reduced from 200% to 50% and &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt;s no longer stacked with the boost. The Recruit-A-Friend program was closed on 11 June 2019 until &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.5\"&gt;patch 8.2.5&lt;/a&gt; with a redesigned system and new &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;-themed rewards. On 12 December 2022, accounts can be recruited after having no &lt;a href=\"game%20time\"&gt;game time&lt;/a&gt; for a year instead of two. &lt;a href=\"Patch%2010.0.7\"&gt;Patch 10.0.7&lt;/a&gt; once again introduced new rewards but kept the Explorers' League-themed rewards available for \"Legacy recruits\".\nBenefits.\nRecruiter Rewards.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%2010.0.7\"&gt;Patch 10.0.7&lt;/a&gt; introduced &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;-themed rewards. New recruits since the patch will count toward the rewards below.\nLegacy Rewards.\nThose that were recruited prior to the release of patch 10.0.7 are considered \"Legacy recruits\" and will only provide criteria toward the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;-themed rewards. Any new recruits will count toward the Recruiter rewards above.\nOriginal system.\nThe original system, referred to as \"Recruit-A-Friend\", closed on 11 June 2019 before the revamp that was introduced with &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.5\"&gt;patch 8.2.5&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a player chooses to recruit someone, the recruit is emailed an activation link for a . &lt;a href=\"Account\"&gt;Account&lt;/a&gt;s created through this referral system become \"linked\" with the recruiter's account. If the trial account is upgraded to a paid subscription, both the recruiter and the recruit gain benefits when they play \"World of Warcraft\" together.\nHow to recruit a friend.\nLog into a character in-game. Open the \"&lt;a href=\"Socials\"&gt;Social&lt;/a&gt;\" tab. Click the \"Recruit A Friend\" button ( ). Enter your friend's email address, and a custom message if desired.\nNow, your friend must open the email sent by Blizzard, and follow the link to create an account. Once the account is created, they need to verify it with Blizzard, through a follow-up email. Then they can follow the link in the invitation email again, and they will be prompted to choose which account to RAF link. Typically, this is WoW1.\nAfter this point, the accounts should be linked.\nOriginal benefits.\nBenefits for the original system lasted for 90 days after the recruitment."}

The various tribes claimed territories in the vast jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; but quickly began fighting one another.\nThe Bloodscalp tribe has since settled in the northwest of Stranglethorn and to this day the Bloodscalp fight off all interlopers, including the nearby &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter tribe&lt;/a&gt;, in order to hold onto the land they have taken. Bloodscalps have nothing but contempt for the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which is the first tribe of jungle trolls to have joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.7\"&gt;When Hakkar returned in Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, they tried to treat with the city by sending an &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt;. Following Hakkar's defeat, &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt; escaped only to be torn apart by the Bloodscalps.\nThe water elemental &lt;a href=\"Naias\"&gt;Naias&lt;/a&gt; is the mastermind behind the Bloodscalp and their exotic magic. Some Bloodscalps bear totems written in &lt;a href=\"Kalimag\"&gt;Kalimag&lt;/a&gt; that mark them as an ally of Naias and worthy to channel his power. The Bloodscalps have used Naias' magic to become the strongest tribe in the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodscalp%20Speaker\"&gt;Bloodscalp Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe violent and brutal jungle trolls of Stranglethorn Vale thrive on conflict. While the Bloodscalp tribe can afford only a unit or two of these warriors, the trolls can strike swiftly and inflict terrible losses on enemy units while keeping highly mobile. The trolls will throw spears before coming into close combat with their brutal axes. If pressed, they tend to go into a berserk rage to hack and crush their way through their enemies. Motivating a mass of berserker trolls is difficult, and these creatures don't make the most responsive of troops."}

Bloodstone ore is a soft material not suitable for forging weapons or armor when used alone, although it can be employed in the creation of fine jewelry. When used in smithing, bloodstone ore must be melted and mixed with iron. The resulting alloy is brittle and useless if the proper ratios are not employed. To complicate the matter further, the required ratio varies with every bloodstone ore vein. Only a skilled smith can identify the proper amount to use without ruining the alloy. Bloodstone ore is found in the deepest mines within the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, and a few small veins have been located within the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Deposits can also be found scattered through the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, usually close to the dangerous border of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;' domain. There are two types of bloodstone ore known to exist: lesser and greater. Lesser ore comprises more than 95% of all bloodstone deposits found on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, although the percentage is slightly less extreme in the depths of the Elemental Plane. As a result, lesser bloodstone ore is usually referred to simply as \"bloodstone ore,\" while the greater variety is always called by its full name. Bloodstone items are inevitably reddish in color, although the shading is subdued with lesser bloodstone ore. Greater ore produces a deep crimson metal that looks as though it is colored with fresh blood.\nLegends say that bloodstone is the result of the combination of demon blood with ordinary metal deposits. The foul ichor, it is said, sank deep into the earth and corrupted the veins therein. Still, the ore is not itself evil or demonic, though it can be used for that purpose. Certainly, demons favor this material and construct weapons and armor of it whenever they can. However, there is no reason why a paladin or other follower of the Light could not employ this useful material. Today, the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; believe that wherever the blood of &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt; fell during his final battle, it soaked into the soil to create a mineral the quilboar call \"bloodstone.\" Wherever bloodstone is found, giant thorns grow from the earth, and it is near these thorns that the quilboar prefer to make their homes (\"it seems that this lore has finally been given to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s instead\").\nThe well-known orc weaponsmith &lt;a href=\"Lor%27gahn\"&gt;Lor'gahn&lt;/a&gt; was notoriously insane, but he did produce a number of powerful weapons, each of which he gave a specific name and title. He often took to speaking to these items as if they were intelligent, which they were not. Perhaps the greatest of his creations was &lt;a href=\"Kang%20the%20Decapitator\"&gt;Kang the Decapitator&lt;/a&gt;, a bloodstone greataxe with an edge so sharp it could slice through flesh and bone like butter."}

The Horde spinoff was planned to hit newsstands in January 2010 and was originally intended to be a monthly series. However, in December 2009, Wildstorm announced that they had opted to transition the \"World of Warcraft: Horde\" and \"World of Warcraft: Alliance\" series to an original graphic novel format, allowing them to place greater emphasis on the art and narrative. The canceled Issue 1 and Issue 2\"' of \"World of Warcraft: Horde\" thus became the start of \"Bloodsworn\", while \"World of Warcraft: Alliance\" became the graphic novel \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Pop%20Mhan\"&gt;Pop Mhan&lt;/a&gt; was originally scheduled to be the artist of \"Bloodsworn\", but at some point left the project and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Jheremy%20Raapack\"&gt;Jheremy Raapack&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe graphic novel's cover, illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Horley\"&gt;Alex Horley&lt;/a&gt;, along with its official title, was revealed on July 21, 2011 during the Blizzard Licensed Products panel at Comic-Con 2011. In June of the same year, Jheremy Raapack stated that the comic might be released in late 2011 or early 2012, and added that development of the comic was at its highest. The graphic novel was finally released two years later, in August 2013."}

As long as the player has three stacks of Defend up, let them. The valiant will eventually tire of Thrusting for insignificant amounts of damage and run away to gain enough range to toss a Shield-Breaker followed by a Charge. Let the valiant get some distance, fire off a Shield-Breaker as soon as it is in range, then quickly close to melee distance to keep the valiant from firing off a Shield-Breaker shot of its own.\nRinse and repeat.\nCharge strategy.\nA somewhat more risky (but highly rewarding) tactic is to use charge instead of Shield-Breaker.\nWhen your foe attempts to gain distance for a charge of his own, back away while continuing to face him. You have a small window of opportunity while he turns back towards you in which to charge him first.\nAfter the charge lands, you will continue riding past (assuming you don't hit something). While you can't stop during this period, you CAN turn. By turning, you can keep the distance between you and your foe below that needed to charge. Turning gives you a little more time to close the distance to your foe, too, as he has to keep turning to line you up during his attempt to charge you.\nOften, you can fine-tune your turn enough that you can get a Shield-Breaker shot off before your foe closes with you. Note that he will have probably done the same with you. This is acceptable, because you will be able to return your defense to level 3 again shortly. And meanwhile, you will have reduced your foe by two levels of defense.\nMost likely, your foe will also restore a level of defense as well. If you managed to get off the Shield-Breaker hit, he will have lost one rank of defense (net) after the exchange.\nThe down side of this strategy is that if you fail to close after the charge, your foe will likely get off more Shield-Breaker hits than the more conservative strategy above.\nNote that Defend, Shield-Breaker and Charge have the same global cooldown, so you only have the opportunity to do one of them each time your foe tries to gain charging distance. If your foe attempts to gain distance while you are still refreshing that cooldown, you may want to simply stay with him and wait for the next opportunity.\nEnhanced Charge strategy.\nThere's an alternate strategy to charging, wheeling around, and possibly getting off another shield-breaker. First off, as always, keep up three stacks of defend. Note that defend, shield breaker, and charge all trigger the GCD, however melee neither triggers nor is affected by the GCD (it has its own 1.5 second CD). Thus, any time you're in melee, you can top up defend without breaking your melee rhythm (and you should, as there's nothing so embarrassing as dropping all three stacks of defend because you let the buff expire). Now, as for the strategy when your opponent wanders off, both Shield Breaker and Charge remove one stack of Defend, and both do damage. However, charge does over four times as much damage, and also closes distance.\nSo, the optimal strategy is: As the opponent starts to wander off, face the direction he's headed and possibly back up a bit. As soon as he's in shield-breaker range, fire that off. Then, as soon as the cooldown is up, Charge. If the timing is right, you will hit him with one less stack of defend, and you will close enough distance before he turns that that you're in melee range and you won't lose a stack of defend yourself. This way, you are first off hitting with the big damage of Charge when he's at his lowest level of Defend, and second off each time he gains distance, he loses two stacks of Defend. He'll often do this more frequently than he adds layers of Defend, meaning that you can quite possibly spend the majority of the fight with three stacks of Defend up against his one or zero. "}

See the\n\" quest chain.)\nBolvar asks you to speak to &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, who downplays the situation.\nPolitician that he is, Bolvar determines to make you an acting deputy of\nStormwind, and sends you back to Magistrate Solomon.\nUnderstandably, Solomon is not overjoyed to find that instead of an army,\nhe only gets you...\nAs deputy of Stormwind, Solomon says, you are required to report to\n&lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Maxwell\"&gt;Marshal Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;, back at &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Morgan's Vigil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you get there, Maxwell just laughs.\nIt seems you aren't the first to be so deputized. Brave men and true have\nbeen lost in this fight.\nThe former commander, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, had gathered a great amount of\ninformation before being ambushed and taken by the orcs. The only person\nto win free of the fight was &lt;a href=\"Ragged%20John\"&gt;Ragged John&lt;/a&gt;, who has retreated to a cave\nto the north.\nYou travel north to &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Crest\"&gt;Flame Crest&lt;/a&gt;, and locate Ragged John, and tease the\nstory out of him. It seems that the orcs failed their assault, and instead the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; captured Marshal Windsor alive!\nAct 2: The Search for Marshal Windsor.\n&lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Maxwell\"&gt;Marshal Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; directs you personally to go into the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;\nand find Windsor.\nYou gather a small group of adventurers, and venture into the depths.\nYou manage to defeat a number of the &lt;a href=\"Anvilrage\"&gt;Anvilrage&lt;/a&gt; guards, including\nan &lt;a href=\"High%20Interrogator%20Gerstahn\"&gt;interrogator&lt;/a&gt; who has the key to Windsor's\nprison cell.\nMarshal Windsor is furious with Bolvar. (Join the club, mate. They've got\ntruncheons and inscribed breastplates...) But without his notes, and\nwithout &lt;a href=\"Ironfoe\"&gt;Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt; (his mace), Windsor is despondent. The situation\nappears hopeless.\nYou return to Maxwell, who believes that Windsor has simply gone around the\nbend. Still, he rewards you for your dangerous work.\nUnwilling to completely abandon Marshal Winsor to his fate, you travel back\nto the depths, and go ... investigating.\nOn one of the bodies, you discover\n The note mentions\na couple of high ranking dwarves among the Anvilrage - &lt;a href=\"General%20Angerforge\"&gt;General Angerforge&lt;/a&gt;,\nand &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Lord%20Argelmach\"&gt;Golem Lord Argelmach&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou take the note to &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, who believes that between them,\nthese two &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; dwarven leaders hold the most of his notes. If you\nretrieve them, it will be enough to force the issue in Stormwind...\nYou and your friends venture into the dark places of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;\nand overcome both the general and the golem lord, retrieving Windsor's plans.\nMarshal Windsor seems completely re-energized by the return of the tablets.\nHe insists on leaving the dungeon immediately, and asks your aid in escaping.\nFirst, however, there's some unfinished business that he has to attend to,\nother members of the patrol he was with, fellow prisoners.\nYou escort him to a supply closet, where he rearms himself. He may not have\n&lt;a href=\"Ironfoe\"&gt;Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt; with him, but at least he's got good solid steel between him and\nthe world. He leads you across the prison compound to the other cells, where\ncertain people he sets free, and others - treacherous ones - he dispatches\nrough justice upon.\nEventually, though, you manage your way back out of the depths. Once in the\nclear, though, even you can't keep up with him. You make your way back to\n&lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Morgan's Vigil&lt;/a&gt;, and talk with &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Maxwell\"&gt;Marshal Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;. By the time you get\nthere, Windsor has been there and gone again, off to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAct 3: Revelation at Stormwind Keep.\nMaxwell tells you that Windsor's instructions are for you to meet him at the\ngates of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, with as many people as you can gather.\n\"(You do\n\"recall that Windsor was the post's commander, right? Maxwell was merely\n\"standing in for him in absence of direction from the Keep...)\"\nYou gather such a force as you are able, and head to Stormwind.\nYou meet up with Windsor at the gates of Stormwind, resplendent in polished\narmor, white charger and all. The guard at the gate challenges him, and\n&lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Prestor&lt;/a&gt; calls for his head.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; countermands her, though, commanding that none\nof the guards are to touch him.\nYou escort Windsor through the city to the keep, where he presents his\ninformation to the highlord. The highlord is stirred to action, yes, but\nit is too late for &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Prestor&lt;/a&gt; reveals her true\nidentity as the broodmother &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, slaying the hero and summoning\na good portion of the black dragonflight to wreak havoc.\nWindsor's act of defiance has broken Onyxia's hold on Bolvar, though, and\nhe makes up for lost time, slaying many of the black dragonflight (with\nyour aid), and forcing Onyxia to retreat.\nAct 4: The Drakefire Amulet.\nBreaking &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt;'s Medallion freed him from &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s\ncontrol. The amulet also gave him some access to Onyxia's mind, though.\nWith the amulet, you could penetrate the defenses around &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;,\nand perhaps put an end to her.\nBut the medallion is shattered, and must be mended if that is to be attempted.\nWhile he can't direct you to anyone specific, he can tell you that another\nof dragonkind might be able to help you rekindle its powers.\nYou search the world, and after much travail, find yourself in\n&lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, in the presence\nof the Matron Protectorate of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt; tells you that the amulet is one of Onyxia's scales, enchanted and\ntransformed. Useless now, she says, but repairable. To repair it, you have\nto get the blood of a black dragon champion. Haleh directs you to\none - &lt;a href=\"General%20Drakkisath\"&gt;General Drakkisath&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of the dragonspawn army of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou gather an army, and assault &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, beating back the best\nthe black dragonflight can throw at you. You defeat &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and\nhis mount &lt;a href=\"Gyth\"&gt;Gyth&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; that Gyth is part of.\nAnd finally, you face and slay the black dragonflight's general himself.\nYou return to Haleh with a vial of his blood, and watch while she repairs\nthe amulet, restoring its enchantment and effectiveness against Onyxia's\nwards.\nAs you leave with the amulet, she wishes you good luck on behalf of\nthe &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nThis permits entry into &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.

The battered remains of the once mighty &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have rallied to protect their last bastion of hope - the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Great Portal&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lord Lothar&lt;/a&gt; dead, you have been given the duty of leading the forces of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to ultimate victory over the Horde - a victory that lies with the destruction of the Great Portal itself...\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;'s forces could make the final assault on the Great Portal, they needed to find flat ground to build a village on. Predictably, there were strong defenses at the closest available land, so the first task was to clear the way for a landing with their few warships. Knights, footmen, and archers were loaded onto &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s and soon followed westward, for they would need to build quickly. A single &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; swept past the shoreline to the west to draw out catapults, then all three regrouped to attack single targets and retreat. This they repeated until all but one tower remained on the shoreline; however, the destroyers had been sunk, and the &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; was taking on much water when they decided to make a landing. Knights and footmen hit the north beach first and engaged the waiting ogres, and as soon as there was room, the archers came next to take out the tower, and soon the area was secure enough to fetch the remaining units.\nWhile building a &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;, their archers were lined up to bring down marauding dragons, and their two mages stayed safely behind to launch fireballs at the beasts as well. With this in mind, their next building priorities were &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; to train more archers. These would ensure the dragons were no longer a problem once they had a small army of them. The mine was quickly running out of resources, so they would soon need to claim another in the ogre village close by to the north. To clear the way, their growing number of archers were lined up behind farms and better-armored soldiers, and a single knight rode forth to bring the ogres into their arrow trap. &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;Spies&lt;/a&gt; reported that three more dragons far to the east were watching for smoke on the horizon, so they ordered their troops not to level the foul orcish structures until they were fully prepared to greet them. A second hall went up near the new mine to speed the collection of the great wealth within. This would ensure their survival against the next enemy village to the east, for soon they could afford to call on the skills of elite elven rangers to train their existing archers in the ways of deadly accuracy. With these at their disposal, they began destroying the rest of the Horde structures and easily defeated the dragons that came too late. It was not long before they had two more barracks, a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Stables\"&gt;stable&lt;/a&gt; to add more muscle to their forces. The muscle came in the form of many knights and two ballistae, all with the best weapons and armor they could make for them. Several rangers and the mages were left behind for defense, while a stalwart army marched eastward to begin clearing out the orcs once more. Milan's commander ordered them to stand their ground just outside in standard formation of knights first, rangers behind, and ballistae in the rear. Their greatest danger was the death knights that cast horrible plagues in their midst, so their forces were spread out to minimize their damage, and several knights were kept moving to ride them down on sight. Once the defenders were mostly gone, demolition began once again while they hunted down any remaining enemies hiding nearby.\nWith a third mine and hall to collect gold, they then built four &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;gryphon aviaries&lt;/a&gt; to claim the skies for themselves. Once they had a flight of eight in the air, these were sent out to wreak havoc on all the enemy ships in the waters surrounding the central island. In the meantime, a &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;gnomish inventor&lt;/a&gt; supplied fearless dwarves with explosives to bomb a path through the narrow line of mountains north of the third mine. This was done to place a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; much closer to a supply of &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, and with the accompanying &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;refinery&lt;/a&gt;, they could then produce &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s for the assault on the island. Their growing mob of gryphon riders then concentrated on drawing the defending dragons and daemons away from their &lt;a href=\"guard%20tower\"&gt;guard tower&lt;/a&gt;s. Meanwhile, transports were loaded with knights and ballistae to do most of the demolition and slaughter on the island while the gryphons kept the skies clear. Workers were brought to set up a second shipyard on the inner ring of water, and by then the fate of the Orcish Horde was sealed. The glorious destruction of the Portal was followed with weeks of celebration.\nVictory for the Alliance.\n\"Quiet settles over the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; with the blackened, burning remains of the cursed &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Portal&lt;/a&gt; serving as a solemn reminder of the evil that once stood here. After the long and savage battle, you stand victorious over the tattered remnants of the once mighty &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Hordes&lt;/a&gt;. Those &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s that survived the conflict have fled to the northeast in hopes of escaping your vengeance. You allow them their reprieve, knowing that the power of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has been forever broken and that the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; belong to its native sons and daughters once again.\"\nAftermath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; was routed and ultimately destroyed by troops under the command of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; during the battle.\nSpeculation.\nGiven the the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; were charged with the protection of the Dark Portal combined with the &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and Maim Blackhand being the leaders of that clan, its possible the Blackhand brothers were meant to be the leaders of the opposing force in this battle.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

This first episode introduces the characters of Deso, Macheath, and Drewbie, primarily; but features cameos from future stars Equoria, Sheil, Liuv, and Gnorlin as well.\nThe storyline of the series gets rolling. Our heroes find themselves on the losing end of a fight against the dragon Onyxia. Feeling utterly defeated, the group tries desperately to remember what they're supposed to be doing.\nPicking up where episode 1 left off, Deso has fallen off of Ironforge with a new friend, Liuv has somehow found himself naked in Orgrimmar, while Drewbie and Sheil try to get more info from Mac.\nDrewbie and Sheil tell the guildies to find a dwarf priest, while Deso observes the power of a girl character from Nynnja. The dwarf shadow priest, Tito, terrorizes Moonbrook, when Mac realizes he is a dwarf priest. Liuv, Gnorlin, and Equoria arrive back home, when Gnorlin finds his portal runes. A party occurs where Drewbie announces that they've found a dwarf priest. Everyone learns of the Burning Crusade expansion, and sets off for Outland, realizing that Wrath of the Lich King has come out already.\nRelated movies.\nThe Grind crew gets together to tell some ghost stories around the old campfire. All is going well til a scream rings out in the night.\nThe Grind crew reacts to Macheath's hideous new face. \nOther movies by Oblivious Films.\nAn easily frightened dwarf stumbles upon a strange machine in the middle of the road. Little does he know that this \"metal pig\" is about to take him and his friends on quite an adventure. From sexy dancing girls to deep dark dungeons (where a familiar man lurks), this Rumpus Machine has a mind of its own!\nCreated for and entered in the 2008 Blizzcon machinima contest, Mac convinced the voice actor for 'Deckard Cain', Michael Gough, to lend his voice to this movie as his well known Diablo character, although the name of the character was never mentioned in the film.\nA music video by Oblivious Films set to the song \"Super Bon Bon\" by Soul Coughing. Just a fun little thing they did before they started making \"The Grind.\"\nCast and crew.\nThe show is written, directed and edited by &lt;a href=\"Macheath\"&gt;Macheath&lt;/a&gt;.\nEveryone in the cast performs the voice of their own Warcraft character.

I'll be sending him my notes on the spirits with the hope that he'll realize the value of my insight.\nEach of the spirits has blessed a charm I've prepared for you.\nNotes.\nSorrow Wing Point is a large island very close to due south from Lake Ere'Noru, where you fought the Falcon guardian. The Shrine of the Hawk is on the east side of the central peak. When you summon him, don't panic when you see he has 50k HP. He CAN be overcome, it just requires the right tactic.\nThis guardian melees for about 1,000 damage on average, putting you very much at a disadvantage in melee. However, his ranged damage is comparably weak. He does do a version of &lt;a href=\"Viper%20Sting%20%28hunter%20ability%29\"&gt;Viper Sting (hunter ability)&lt;/a&gt; (drains mana) and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Curse of Blood&lt;/a&gt; (doubles damage done to you), which can be countered by &lt;a href=\"Abolish%20Poison\"&gt;Abolish Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Curse%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Remove Curse (druid ability)&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nThis guardian take enormous amounts of damage from magic, and if your casting criticals, it does even more. A report of &lt;a href=\"Roots\"&gt;Roots&lt;/a&gt; doing 300 damage every 3 seconds, &lt;a href=\"Wrath\"&gt;Wrath&lt;/a&gt; doing 2650, &lt;a href=\"Moonfire\"&gt;Moonfire&lt;/a&gt; doing 1850, and &lt;a href=\"Starfire\"&gt;Starfire&lt;/a&gt; doing 4200 may well understate the case. Recent experience, with moderate-good casting gear, had Starfire doing 10-12k per strike. This makes the fight fairly short despite his having some 50k HP.\nRegardless of how you are spec'd, then, this fight is a \"Root and Nuke\". Recast Roots in time to prevent the guardian from getting melee attacks off against you."}

He is able to both connect to some of the pieces of Ardenweald that have broken off and the &lt;a href=\"Underweald\"&gt;Underweald&lt;/a&gt; deep beneath Ardenweald. He is the origin of all mushrooms of Ardenweald, and perhaps all the Shadowlands. At some point, he used to reside in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;, but had chosen to leave until the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; begins helping restore Ardenweald and asks for his help.\nThough he technically exists across all of Ardenweald, underneath Ardenweald, and the pieces of Ardenweald that broke off, he appears normally in &lt;a href=\"Ring%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;The Ring&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20Terminus\"&gt;Fungal Terminus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stalks\"&gt;Stalks&lt;/a&gt;. He says he remembers the last time the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; invaded Ardenweald, unlike everyone else.\nWhile Marasmius left Tirna Achiad long ago, the Chief Mushroomancer &lt;a href=\"Cortinarius\"&gt;Cortinarius&lt;/a&gt; left the Heart of the Forest only at the start of the anima drought.\nFriendship and travel network.\nMuch like NPCs from past expansions (and &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;), Marasmius has his own reputation faction. All standings are gained via his daily quests, and more daily quests are unlocked at higher levels of the transportation network.\nInitial unlock.\nAfter upgrading the sanctum to unlock the transport network, &lt;a href=\"Zaki\"&gt;Zaki&lt;/a&gt; starts a quest chain to locate Marasmius and coax him back to the cause:\nLocations.\nAccessed via the mushroom ring in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; or at any of the locations in the field, Marasmius provides quick transport to the following locations:\nTier 1: Nurtured Roots.\nMarasmius asks for soil from various locations in Ardenweald, or he asks the Maw Walker to go on a bombing run with him to take out enemies in an area. Each daily quest is worth 350 reputation.\nTier 2: Fun with Fungi.\nAt Tier 2, Marasmius asks the adventurer to travel with him to the Deep Unknown, where a different task awaits each day. Generally enemies need to be killed, but occasionally he wants the Maw Walker to take a break. Each iteration is worth 500 reputation.\nTier 3: Blossoming Network.\nAt Tier 3, a portal to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; opens in the Heart of the Forest, and Marasmius asks players to travel with him to one of the remote islands at the far reaches of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;. The daily quest is worth 650 reputation.\nPortalbellos.\nAfter discovering the locations on Marasmius's daily quests, &lt;a href=\"Zaki\"&gt;Zaki&lt;/a&gt; will sell portalbellos, encouraging the mushroom network to send the player to their requested location.\nRewards.\n&lt;a href=\"Cortinarius\"&gt;Cortinarius&lt;/a&gt;, right next to Marasmius, is the quartermaster for the Marasmius friendship:\nQuotes.\nGossip changes with travel network progression and certain questlines.\nYou... I don't recognize you. How did you get all the way out here? Younglings these days...\nI'm not sure how you did it, but you got yourself into quite a mess, eh?

Shortly after the centaur's creation, the ruthless creatures murdered their father. The grief-stricken Theradras is said to have trapped her lover's spirit within Maraudon, corrupting the region. Now, vicious centaur ghosts and twisted elemental minions roam every corner of the sprawling caves.\"\nHistory.\nMaraudon was originally a massive cavern below the meadows of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Mashan'she&lt;/a&gt;. Before &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt; took up residence here, the &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Landslide%20%28mountain%20giant%29\"&gt;Landslide&lt;/a&gt; cultivated crystal gardens in the cavern. The giant &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rotgrip\"&gt;Rotgrip&lt;/a&gt; is also rumored to have lived in Maraudon's waters for millennia.\nIn the ancient past, Princess Theradras hid in these caverns to avoid being imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, and she eventually fell into a deep slumber. 1,100 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; awakened Theradras after mistaking her voice for that of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. She emerged from the depths and drained Mashan'she's life energies to restore her power, turning the region into the wasteland of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to investigate and entered Theradras' lair, where he encountered the princess and fell in love with her. Together they sired the first &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s, who in turn murdered their father. When Theradras chastised them, the centaur begged for forgiveness and promised to revere Zaetar's memory. Fearful of Cenarius' wrath, Theradras entombed Zaetar's body in her secret sanctuary, the Crystal Caverns of &lt;a href=\"Terramok\"&gt;Terramok&lt;/a&gt;. Influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, Theradras also trapped Zaetar's spirit and used its energies to transform her home into a den of corruption and suffering. The area immediately around &lt;a href=\"Zaetar%27s%20Grave\"&gt;Zaetar's Grave&lt;/a&gt; was spared from this and instead became a verdant paradise due to the life energies permeating Zaetar's body.\nThe centaur named the cave system \"Maraudon\" and would forever after treat it as holy ground, even after they proliferated across Desolace and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The cavern/temple is guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Maraudine%20clan\"&gt;Maraudine clan&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the most sacred sites in Desolace. The centaur clans protect the place with their lives, and only the most devout among their people\u2014spirits and the most sacred priests and priestesses\u2014are allowed to enter its holy halls. Its subterranean tunnels are populated by the ghosts of the first khans as well as Theradras' own elemental minions. The caverns are known for their prized crystals, which can be used as powerful reagents for &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vyletongue\"&gt;Lord Vyletongue&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Putridus\"&gt;Putridus&lt;/a&gt; followers\u2014agents of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u2014journeyed into Maraudon after hearing of its corruption. Vyletongue earned Theradras' trust by creating various minions for her, such as &lt;a href=\"Noxxion\"&gt;Noxxion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Razorlash\"&gt;Razorlash&lt;/a&gt;, who worked together to taint parts of the complex that had not yet withered under the princess' influence. At one point, Zaetar's nephew &lt;a href=\"Celebras\"&gt;Celebras&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; sisters traveled to Maraudon in the hopes of freeing their uncle's spirit, but they instead became corrupted by the caverns' dark energies.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power, Theradras worried that her centaur children might be driven to extinction. She infused them with her power and drove them to claim new territories outside of Desolace. Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to Desolace and learned from the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the only clan not loyal to Theradras\u2014that Maraudon was the source of the corruption in the region. The Horde's champions helped the Magram suppress the other clans in Desolace before traveling into the depths of the burial ground and defeating every creature inside it, including Theradras. This ended the spreading corruption in the region and eased the centaur's violent bloodlust. This also freed Zaetar's captive spirit, but he chose to remain in Maraudon.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, Theradras returned as &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Crown Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt; and aided the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; by sending earthquakes to the surface world. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Horde adventurers entered Maraudon with &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and killed her.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kherrah\"&gt;Kherrah&lt;/a&gt; was held prisoner in the upper area of Maraudon by the &lt;a href=\"Maraudine%20clan\"&gt;Maraudine clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodsworn.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;another powerful elemental&lt;/a&gt; emerged in Maraudon. He created a new race of centaur, called the &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt;, to spread across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and reclaim it from the other mortal races. The perfect ones and their ruler, &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt;, used Maraudon as their base of operations as they planned to invade the cities of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, all while the elemental stayed hidden deep in the caves, gathering his strength and bolstering the perfect ones' ranks daily. Aratas forbade the \"older breed\" of centaur from entering Maraudon; only he and his kind were welcome in the temple. To stop the centaur, a team of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; militia attacked Maraudon and defeated most of the perfect ones, but Aratas captured their leader &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt;, retreated into Maraudon, and summoned his elemental father. With the drifter &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt;'s help, the Garad'kra managed to kill Aratas and use his magical spear to destroy the elemental, saving the Horde.\nWings.\nThe different wings, although part of the same contiguous instance, can be directly accessed through three different portals from the overworld in Desolace. Entering Maraudon takes the player through a tunnel (simply titled \"Maraudon\") until they come to a crossroads at &lt;a href=\"Zaetar%27s%20Choice\"&gt;Zaetar's Choice&lt;/a&gt;. Heading north leads to the upper &lt;a href=\"Wicked%20Tunnels\"&gt;Wicked Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; and the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Wicked%20Grotto\"&gt;Wicked Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, heading east through &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Song%20Gate\"&gt;Earth Song Gate&lt;/a&gt; leads to the lower Wicked Tunnels and the portal to &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Song%20Falls\"&gt;Earth Song Falls&lt;/a&gt;, and heading south leads to the &lt;a href=\"Foulspore%20Pools\"&gt;Foulspore Pools&lt;/a&gt; and the portal to &lt;a href=\"Foulspore%20Cavern\"&gt;Foulspore Cavern&lt;/a&gt;.\nWicked Grotto.\nThe Wicked Grotto's bosses include &lt;a href=\"Tinkerer%20Gizlock\"&gt;Tinkerer Gizlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vyletongue\"&gt;Lord Vyletongue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Celebras%20the%20Cursed\"&gt;Celebras the Cursed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Meshlok%20the%20Harvester\"&gt;Meshlok the Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Rare%20mob\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; boss, can sometimes be found near Celebras's area. Only Lord Vyletongue is required to get this wing's &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; completion reward.\nGroups of non-elite imps patrol here, so &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; capability can be handy. Some satyrs use Gouge, incapacitating the tank and causing all the monsters to attack the next person on the threat list. Vyletongue himself comes with stealthed guards, and he teleports around the room during combat.\nFoulspore Cavern.\nThe Foulspore Cavern's bosses include &lt;a href=\"Razorlash\"&gt;Razorlash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Noxxion\"&gt;Noxxion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis wing's denizens are mostly &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lasher\"&gt;lasher&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s. Things to watch out for include some of the plants' knockback abilities, as well as the oozes, which must be kited and killed by ranged DPS. These oozes have an aura which does a large amount of damage every three seconds.\nEarth Song Falls.\nThe Earth Song Falls' bosses include &lt;a href=\"Landslide%20%28mountain%20giant%29\"&gt;Landslide&lt;/a&gt;, the bonus boss &lt;a href=\"Rotgrip\"&gt;Rotgrip&lt;/a&gt;, and the dungeon's final boss, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is a lush area filled with wildlife such as &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuest guide.\n\"Note: the last two quests (&lt;a href=\"Servants%20of%20Theradras\"&gt;Servants of Theradras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Princess Theradras (quest)&lt;/a&gt;) are automatically started when you complete each of them through the new quest pop-up.\"\nGuide.\nThis is a quick guide to doing the Maraudon &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; characters. &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; information has been added where possible.\nQuick run down.\nMaraudon can be split into several sections. At the start of the dungeon, you'll kill the mobs without blinking. You will eventually find an area with purple glowing rocks on the left, orange on the right. There is also a central entrance which takes you to the Princess, but for a full run-through, you won't do that at first. Following the rocks, you enter an orange area or purple area, which lead to orange and purple entrances to the instance.\nYou can do Orange or Purple Maraudon at level 32 or 33. On the other hand, the Princess requires at least a couple of level 39s. I can't emphasize this enough: bring ample &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;. There are a lot of points where you get attacked by a lot of non-elites, and &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; attacks are vital.\nOrange side.\nA couple of notable things: the bright green &lt;a href=\"Creeping%20Sludge\"&gt;Creeping Sludge&lt;/a&gt; move very slowly and hit very hard, so its best to stay out of melee range, with a tank kiting them, and have your ranged DPS take them out one at a time. These aren't very difficult to kite around since they do move very slowly. A few tips:\nYou've got to kill Noxxion for (&lt;a href=\"Servants%20of%20Theradras\"&gt;Servants of Theradras&lt;/a&gt;. About halfway through he will split up and spawn some non-elite elementals and will re-form after you've killed them.\nAfter Noxxion, you must kill (&lt;a href=\"Razorlash\"&gt;Razorlash&lt;/a&gt;) for (&lt;a href=\"Servants%20of%20Theradras\"&gt;Servants of Theradras&lt;/a&gt;.\nPurple side.\nInside is a very easy instance that drops a lot of green AH fodder. Vyletongue himself has four stealthed guards. Two of them can be pulled without aggroing him. He's easy, anyway. He must be killed for &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20in%20Maraudon\"&gt;Corruption in Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDo note, however, that the Satyrs can gouge your tank, which can be disastrous if you aren't prepared.\nYou'll notice that there's a lot of information about the orange side and not very much about the purple side. That is, quite simply, because the purple side is very easy in comparison.\nCelebras.\nYou get to him either by pushing on in the orange or purple sides. A bit of an insane battle because he keeps summoning non-elites. A lot of AoE is the only way to go here. No more monsters will appear, so this bit is completely safe. Phew, now you're halfway through the instance. If you push on, you'll fall into a big lake.\nThe Princess.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.8\"&gt;Patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, you could access the final part of Maraudon directly using the by bringing it to an alcove in the middle of the pre-instance area and using it. It would then open a portal to take you to the shallow part of Earth Song Falls. After the patch, the portal to Inner Maraudon is simply open to all without need for the staff.\nThe first part of this area is full of interesting bosses to kill, but they're all pretty easy apart from the Princess. The ordinary mobs present more of a challenge:\nThere are a lot of patrols. Always wait for them, because they'll wipe even a good group very fast. The worst is that you can get pincered at T junctions by patrols going different ways.\nThe princess herself is a level 39 elite, but has a kick like a mule. She has two main notable attacks. She fears melees quite a lot and has a large range AoE attack. Nature protection potions are extremely useful here. If your party is underlevelled, make sure you buy some before going after her. Although fast, she's very kitable. As long as you can stay away from her, a hunter or mage can pound away without difficulty. A good way of maximizing that is to actually have your ranged casters on opposite sides of her, although this can obviously cause problems for your healers. Important: Make sure you're not close to the edges, or else you can get knocked off and down into the river below.\nHaving killed her, you'll finish the quest &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Princess Theradras (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther interesting bosses.\nFor details of the items these mini-bosses drop, see &lt;a href=\"Maraudon%20loot\"&gt;Maraudon loot&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few other bosses need a mention as they drop blue items. Some, of course, are more interesting than others:\nUseful resistances.\nJust about everything in Maraudon uses &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; spells or &lt;a href=\"poisons\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;. Equipping gear with good &lt;a href=\"nature%20resistance\"&gt;nature resistance&lt;/a&gt; isn't necessary but will make your life easier.\nAgainst the princess, &lt;a href=\"shadow%20resistance\"&gt;shadow resistance&lt;/a&gt; is helpful for the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; effect. Once again, this is handy but not necessary.\nResources.\nHerbs:\nOre:\nIn the RPG.\nMaraudon is a holy place to the centaur \u2014 it is the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keeper of the grove&lt;/a&gt; and son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, and the house of &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, an earth elemental.\nZaetar rejected his keeper heritage when he joined with the princess of the chaotic earth elementals, Theradras. Their unholy union gave birth to the misshapen and cursed &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; who promptly slew their father for his part in their misbegotten creation. Fearful of Cenarius' wrath, the grief-stricken Theradras sequestered her dead lover's body in her secret sanctuary, the &lt;a href=\"Terramok\"&gt;Crystal Caverns of Terramok&lt;/a&gt;, where she watches over him to this day. Travelers who come to Desolace have little trouble spotting Zaetar's tomb, for the blessing of nature that permeates his being transformed his resting place into a verdant paradise of flora and tranquil pools. Today, this tomb is now trodden by the hooves of Zaetar's children who have claimed this great cavern as their sacred stronghold Maraudon.\nWithin the tomb is a maze of underground caves and tunnels, populated by the spirits of the long-dead centaur &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Earth%20elemental\"&gt;Earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"rock%20borer\"&gt;rock borer&lt;/a&gt;s also inhabit the site. It is rumored that &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s and other emissaries of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; have moved into these caverns as well.\nAlthough each of the five &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; tribes (known as Black tribe, Brown tribe, Green tribe, Red tribe, and Yellow tribe) maintained its own stronghold elsewhere in Desolace, this was once the region's &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; (shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;,) when there were no other cultures of any note in all of Desolace. At that time, the centaur had run all others down in their unceasing lust for conquest. However, now that Desolace has no affiliation, and members of other civilizations have moved back in, it is only one of several major settlements. Desolace no longer has a capital.\nMaraudon has a vast gathering of palatial tents surrounded by a palisade, the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spears\"&gt;Valley of Spears&lt;/a&gt;, it once served as a cultural center and meeting place for all centaur. However, in recent times, many of the centaur tribes are at war and now it is inhabited only by the &lt;a href=\"Maraudine%20clan\"&gt;Maraudine clan&lt;/a&gt;. They are the protectors of Maraudon and only the bravest and mightiest of the tribe's warriors are chosen to guard the tomb of Zaetar.\nBehind a series of spiked barriers in the center of this mesa stands &lt;a href=\"Terramok\"&gt;Terramok&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; vault rumored to hold Theredras, former princess of the vile earth elementals and legendary mother of the centaur race. Some even claim that Theradras guards the tomb of her husband, the keeper of the grove killed by the first khans. The only permanent centaur resident is &lt;a href=\"Krullaran%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Krullaran the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. The centaur of Desolace turn to the khans for protection, but they look to Krullaran for guidance. Many believe he communes with the titans and possesses insight to the glorious return that the centaur will someday make to the northern lands."}

However, by using the companion stone giant elemental from 'The Rune of Command', kiting is a whole lot easier. The elemental has a 4 second stun with a short CD, hits hard and with proper threat management, can tank the giant while you heal up. Beware of the giants that have a shadow buff. Their DPS is significantly higher.\nMegalith spawns to north-east of the base and killing him can be way easier than facing the other giants as he does not have the stacking &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20time\"&gt;Dot&lt;/a&gt; that the others have. He also have a pretty fast respawn time which makes the quest easy for soloing. Note that you'll have to kill him 5 times to complete the chain, so if he takes too much out of you, bring a friend along and kill the regular giants."}

There is also a side quest in which the player is given the option to go out and destroy a caravan of plagued grain before it infects all the outer villages.\nLoading screen.\n\"Early the next morning, &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; approach the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nDefend Hearthglen.\n\"An Undead army has arisen overnight and marched against Hearthglen. You must defend the town until Jaina returns with Lord Uther and his reinforcements.\"\nOptional Quests.\nGrain Caravan.\n\"The Undead have constructed a caravan to distribute plagued grain to the neighboring villages. If the caravan reaches them, it will transform them into Undead outposts. Intercept and destroy the caravan before your forces are hopelessly outnumbered.\"\nBattle.\n&lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrive at the village of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; where they discover the inhabitants are preparing for battle. The commander of the town guard tells Arthas that an undead army is coming to attack the village. Arthas tells Jaina to go and find &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; while he stays and defends the town. Jaina reluctantly obeys and teleports away.\nArthas then notices some suspicious-looking crates nearby. He asks what was in those crates. The commander replies that it was just a shipment of grain from &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and that the grain has already been distributed amongst the villagers. Suddenly, several of the villagers fall into a strange sleep and are transformed into zombies. Arthas realizes that the Scourge plague not only kills people, it brings them back as the undead.\nArthas and his troops swiftly dispatch the zombies. Soon afterwards the Scourge army arrives and begins its assault on Hearthglen. Arthas rallies his men and they fight off wave after wave of undead.\nIn the middle of the battle, Arthas learns that a caravan of plagued grain is passing through the area infecting other villages. Arthas and a small group of men track down the caravan and ambush it. They slay the undead escorts and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Wagon\"&gt;Meat Wagon&lt;/a&gt;s carrying the plagued grain. Arthas and his troops then hurry back to the village.\nAs the siege of Hearthglen continues the undead grow stronger and stronger with every attack. The defenders are slowly being whittled down. Finally, the undead launch a massive assault against the town. This attack is led by a pair of Liches who use their destructive powers to breach the defenses. Countless undead pour into the town and start overwhelming Arthas' forces. Arthas is on the verge of defeat when suddenly Uther and Jaina arrive with an army of &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; knights. With the undead now caught between Uther's forces and the remaining town defenders, the tide swiftly turns in favor of the humans.\nAfter the last of the undead are defeated, Uther and Jaina meet with Arthas to discuss the situation. Despite having won the battle, Arthas is humiliated that he almost lost. Uther sternly tells him that they can't afford to let pride distract them. What happened here was only the beginning. Arthas argues that the best way to defeat the Scourge is to kill their (supposed) leader &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; who resides in the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Uther warns Arthas that he can't do this on his own. Arthas retorts that he is going after Mal'Ganis with or without Uther's help.\nTips.\nAt the start of the mission (after fending off the initial attack), backtrack along the path Arthas took to get to Hearthglen and stop by the farmhouse there to pick up 3 additional Footmen. You can also destroy the &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen%20Building\"&gt;Hearthglen Building&lt;/a&gt; to access a crate that spawns a sheep. Killing the sheep grants &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Restoration%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Potion of Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is recommended that you complete the side quest as to prevent the Scourge from attacking you on all 3 fronts. In order to do this, you will need to split up your forces, with a sizable group plus Arthas taking the long way around the map to intercept the caravan (be sure to free up inventory spaces first as there will be item rewards along the way), while a smaller group remains behind in your base with the support of defensive towers. The smaller group can built up or have casualties replaced over time, but sending reinforcements to Arthas across the map is difficult to manage.\nOn Normal Mode the Scourge will largely ignore the opening on the eastern side of the base.\nRescuing &lt;a href=\"Mark%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; will grant the player &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Boots of Speed&lt;/a&gt;."}

The captain then consented to let her remain on board but warned she might have to fight if came down to it. During this time Heller had come to an agreement with the other captain in allowing for a diplomat to visit each and he appointed &lt;a href=\"Baenan\"&gt;Baenan&lt;/a&gt; for the task after he volunteered. However, negotiations collapsed instantly when Heller's demand for the Horde to leave the area would not be immediately met and he preceded to take &lt;a href=\"Nita\"&gt;Nita&lt;/a&gt; prisoner.\nHe then brought Nita to the rest of the crew and lied that the tauren had attacked him. After learning that the Horde was demanding their surrender and that not complying would see Baenan die, Heller declared that if Baenan's life was forfeit then so too was Nita's. A confrontation erupted as &lt;a href=\"Lintharel\"&gt;Lintharel&lt;/a&gt; spoke in Nita's defense and with Li Li and &lt;a href=\"Trialin\"&gt;Trialin&lt;/a&gt; aiding her, Nita was freed. Heller took advantage of the Horde ship exploding to run his sword through Lintharel for her \"betrayal\", but found his throat slit by &lt;a href=\"Atropa\"&gt;Atropa&lt;/a&gt; before he could deal the death blow. Atropa was presumably also the one to throw Heller's body over the side afterward."}

It's from here that the town is controlled, and formerly the rest of the region.\nHistory.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; had ruled Hearthglen from Mardenholde for several years, and &lt;a href=\"Arden\"&gt;Arden&lt;/a&gt; was the captain of the keep's guards. Tirion and his six advisors would sometimes hold council in the council room. At the room's center sat a large oak table, covered by an immense map that displayed the lands of Hearthglen down to the most minute detail. Its dining hall was spacious, and it had an adjoining sitting room. The Fordrings had the bedroom in their private chambers.\nMardenholde was the center of commerce and trade for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; principality of Hearthglen. The citizens of Hearthglen took great pride in the fact that the keep's mighty walls had never fallen to invaders, even during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;darkest days of the orcish invasion of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Some time before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the keep was overrun with traveling dignitaries and representatives from the various nations of the Alliance, who passed through Hearthglen on their secret diplomatic errands. Tirion feared that war was returning to Lordaeron.\n&lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Lord Commander Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Mardenholde and met with Tirion in the council room to speak about the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; activity near Hearthglen. When Tirion was charged with treason for aiding the orc &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, leading him to be &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;excommunicated&lt;/a&gt; and exiled, his deputy, &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Barthilas\"&gt;Barthilas&lt;/a&gt;, became the next leader of Hearthglen before moving on to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nAshbringer.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; was granted a base in Hearthglen. Surviving leaders like the &lt;a href=\"Mograine\"&gt;Mograine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Abbendis\"&gt;Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; were meeting here, including when they discussed the death of &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros&lt;/a&gt;. Guards brought in &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; who revealed a betrayal in their ranks. Saidan apprehended the priest, and &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; became suspicious of Fairbanks' words and left Hearthglen with his followers to form the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, while the remaining Silver Hand dubbed themselves the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, Mardenholde became the center of the Scarlet operations in the region, and was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion's son.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWith the help of &lt;a href=\"Myranda%20the%20Hag\"&gt;Myranda the Hag&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was sent to infiltrate the keep and liberate Taelan from the influence of the Scarlet Crusade.\nAfter his victory in the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the great &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that reshaped the world, Tirion Fordring retook Hearthglen and set up the base of operation for his soldiers.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; which led to Tirion's death, and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the dungeon is now a training ground for the troops of the Argent Crusade. Lieutenant Myner is the one who holds the keys to the treasures stored in the keep."}

He is young, ill-tempered, lacks discipline, and has on at least one occasion gotten into a bar fight. Mardigan has been accused of murder and after fleeing from &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, Mardigan sought out the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; to prove his innocence but was abducted and forced to become a worgen.\nHistory.\nDark Riders.\nMardigan went to acquire a rage-inducing potion for his father from their local alchemist in the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Pride%20Inn\"&gt;Lion's Pride Inn&lt;/a&gt; when he exchanged heated words with a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; stranger that led to a brawl. Fortunately, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt; broke up the fight before weapons were involved and escorted him home. Having been briefed about the fight from Marshal Dughan, his father, &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt;, scolded him for his hooliganism and ordered him to make amends by acquiring a replacement potion for the one he didn't come back with and apologizing to the stranger he fought with.\nAfter accomplishing his errand, Mardigan returned home at night to find his home desecrated, his dog murdered, and a message in blood taunting him with the phrase \u201cSee you next time\u201d. Mardigan went back to the Lion's Pride Inn to accuse the stranger he fought off his hound\u2019s murder only to find him bleeding to death. The stranger, in his dying words, told Mardigan that he was a member of the Wolf Cult from &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; and on the run after witnessing something heinous. The &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; found him and he dies from his wounds. The innkeeper finds Mardigan and the dead stranger and accused him of murder.\nMardigan traveled to &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the Wolf Cult. He later infiltrated the Wolf Cult and impressed its leader &lt;a href=\"Gervase\"&gt;Gervase&lt;/a&gt;, who considered him a fine candidate for their ranks. Yet he refused to fulfill the final trial. He was transported to Roland's Doom where he was subdued and underwent a worgen ritual. The worgen marked him with the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and then was bitten by the worgen pack's leader. After he was bitten, his father Karlain accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambrose\"&gt;Ambrose&lt;/a&gt; rushed in to defeat the worgen. In the midst of the fight, Mardigan ran towards the woods. Fully transformed, he attacked Karlain and Revil as they were burying their companion. He was subdued and Karlain used a rage-suppressing potion on him allowing him to recognize his father. Though their relationship was still rocky, Karlain assured his son he would do everything in his power to cure him. Mardigan still held a deep resentment for his father which exacerbated the worgen's innate rage. Thus he told his father to keep his distance.\nLater on, they drifted off to sleep but they were awoken by Revil Kost. Revil Kost was taking them to someone who knew of a worgen cure but in reality he was using them as bait for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;. His ploy worked as the Dark Riders attacked them. Fortunately, Revil had prepared an ambush for them and had the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; Militia and &lt;a href=\"Brink\"&gt;Brink&lt;/a&gt;, the rogue gnome, bolster their party. When the battle turned unfavorable for the Dark Riders, one of the Dark Riders teleported the whole party to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Revil Kost wandered off, and Karlain was attacked by more Dark Riders. Mardigan savagely defended his father and Karlain did the same for his son but the floor gave in and they both fell to another floor of the tower. On this floor, Mardigan was shown a false vision of his father murdering his mother in a jealous rage. This vision enraged him to the point where he lost himself to his bestial fury and he turned to attack his father but was subdued by his magic. Revil who had rejoined them, used his &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Cloak of Purity&lt;/a&gt; to ward off the fel magic of the tower and Mardigan was able to see the true vision: Karlain defending his wife from a rapist but accidentally killing her in the process. Having seen his father\u2019s regret and sorrow for his actions, Mardigan was able to calm himself and forgive his father. With the danger passed and their family bond restored, Karlain teleported the party out of the tower. Karlain stated his intention to search for a cure for his son which will require more investigation on the Wolf Cult. Seeing as Revil looked like a man in need of a purpose, the family invites him to journey with them on their quest.\nLegion.\nMardigan could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Parlor\"&gt;Purple Parlor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, speaking to &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Copperworth\"&gt;Alfred Copperworth&lt;/a&gt;. Revil was also nearby."}

He could only restore permanent life to her through other spells such as resurrection."}

He was perhaps most notable for his involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, where he sealed the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s' defeat by corrupting the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt;. Some time thereafter, Marduk retreated to &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, where he served as a tutor until he was finally slain by a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiography.\nMarduk Blackpool was a brutal warlord of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Amongst his many campaigns against the humans of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he cut a swath through their forces at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, causing great death and suffering with his foul, rune laden sword. He corrupted the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt;, transforming him into &lt;a href=\"Redpath%20the%20Corrupted\"&gt;Redpath the Corrupted&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of Redpath's twisted spirit, the Scourge forces overran &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;the town&lt;/a&gt; and killed all of its inhabitants.\nMarduk survived the war, causing great death and suffering with his foul, &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;rune-laden sword&lt;/a&gt;. Although the death knight continued serving the Scourge, his sword was lost in a battle near &lt;a href=\"Corin%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Corin's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; captain shattered the sword on his enchanted shield, forcing Marduk to flee the field and winning the day for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Marduk's sword sank into the earth and corrupted it, eating a gorge into the land, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Infectis%20Scar\"&gt;Infectis Scar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time thereafter, Marduk became a tutor in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;. He was a partner of &lt;a href=\"Vectus\"&gt;Vectus&lt;/a&gt;, who researched corrupted &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; eggs in the hopes of creating a &lt;a href=\"plagued%20dragonflight\"&gt;plagued dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; for their use. He was eventually killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEven though he was removed from Scholomance with \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", a vision of Marduk can still be seen during &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Darrowshire%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Battle of Darrowshire (quest)&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nFighting Marduk.\nMarduk Blackpool and in turn his partner &lt;a href=\"Vectus\"&gt;Vectus&lt;/a&gt; can be fought like any normal boss in Scholomance. Unlike the other bosses, both of them and the students in the room are neutral and allow adventurers to enter and leave freely without incident. There are two ways to kill Marduk, the first way involves killing all the students in the room as they are, before killing him. Unfortunately, the students in their normal form are very tough. They hit hard and have a very large health pool making them annoying to bring down. However if all the students are killed, players can then attack Marduk and Vectus with little difficulty.\nThe second way is by using &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Gambit\"&gt;Dawn's Gambit&lt;/a&gt; which is a powerful, though experimental device provided by a quest or talking to the quest giver after completion and asking for an additional device. This device when used, turns all the students in the room into hostile skeletons with a much smaller health pool, allowing them to be taken down very quickly.\nAttacking Vectus and Marduk without killing the students is NOT recommended, as every student will attack the party. This even at higher levels is not recommended.\nWhen killed both Marduk and Vectus have a chance to drop a blue item, along with a Corruptor's Scourgestone."}

After his decision to destroy all &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s in the universe, Sargeras shattered Mardum to free the demons that would become his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSargeras tasked &lt;a href=\"Brood%20Queen%20Tyranna\"&gt;Brood Queen Tyranna&lt;/a&gt; to safeguard the &lt;a href=\"%3ASargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;:Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;, a device that can open portals to all Legion worlds, even &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, on this world. During the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; siege of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sent his loyal &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari forces&lt;/a&gt; to Mardum in order to retrieve the Keystone for his plans to defeat the Legion.\nDuring the of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Mardum was conquered by the Illidari and the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;\"Fel Hammer\"&lt;/a&gt; became their &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order%20Hall\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt;. The ship's functions were unlocked using &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; imbued with the mark of a Legion lord.\nHistory.\nDuring the war against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the demons he killed kept reappearing. The &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; sent the titan &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to aid Sargeras in his battles which allowed Sargeras to more closely study the Nether, where he realized that the demons he killed would simply reform inside the Nether. He learned that they could only truly be killed inside the Nether itself or in areas saturated with that realm's volatile energies.\nThough he hadn't yet grasped the volatile realm's full scale, Sargeras had learned how to manipulate and shape some of its energies. Thus, he forged a prison within the Nether called Mardum, the Plane of Banishment, acting as an impregnable &lt;a href=\"pocket%20dimension\"&gt;pocket dimension&lt;/a&gt; from which nothing could escape. Demons would no longer be reborn after defeat, instead they would be contained within this prison for all eternity. After countless demons were imprisoned, the planet soon became overflowed with the captured demons' destructive &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies, eventually tearing at the boundaries between the Nether and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. Mardum soon started appearing in the distant reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; as a burning green star. Over the millennia, however, these demons were not idle. The &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh\"&gt;Ulthalesh&lt;/a&gt; ruled the pocket dimension with an iron fist, plotting for the day when he would exact vengeance.\nSargeras would eventually abandon the Pantheon and come to the conclusion that in order to prevent the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; creations from corrupting world-souls, he had to destroy them all. But Sargeras could not watch over the entire universe all by himself, he needed an army. Thus, he returned to Mardum. Over the eons, the prison had become bloated, the presence of countless demons warping the world into a nightmarish realm constantly bombarded by torrents of fel energy and bathing the captive demons in a sea of volatile magic. Sargeras tore the planet asunder, unleashing the demons and causing a cataclysmic explosion of violent energies that warped his very body. Horns and wings grew out of his body, while cracks of fel energy appeared on his chest and fel volcanoes erupted across his skin, fel fire enclosing his visage. He then imbued the howling masses with his power and gave them a simple choice: join his cause or be destroyed. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was born.\nWhile most of the demons accepted Sargeras' offer, a few refused, rallying around &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh\"&gt;Ulthalesh&lt;/a&gt;. In answer to the challenge, Sargeras forged a &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;great felsteel scythe&lt;/a&gt; from the fires of Mardum's destruction, and used it to harvest the souls of the recalcitrant demons, confining them for all eternity in a new prison. Sargeras used the scythe on Ulthalesh last in order to mock him.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Mardum had become a bastion of the Burning Legion ruled by &lt;a href=\"Brood%20Queen%20Tyranna\"&gt;Brood Queen Tyranna&lt;/a&gt;, who Sargeras had entrusted with the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;, a skeleton key capable of opening portals to all Legion worlds. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sent his &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; forces to Mardum to retrieve the Sargerite Keystone in his plan to assault &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, killing Tyranna in the process and taking control of the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" command ship.\nGeography.\nMardum's remains float between the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, much like &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Littered in fel energies, the main island where the \"Fel Hammer\" is situated is dominated by a large area fel volcanoes.\nQuests.\nThe main quests in Mardum are part of the first third of the demon hunter starting experience."}

Recently, however, with the instability that has engulfed the city, Margaux's task has become significantly more difficult. \nHistory.\nBlood and Wine.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Margaux served as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s manager. The vineyards were considered essential as they produced the &lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;Arcwine&lt;/a&gt; which allowed the city's citizens to imbibe the energies of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the unrest caused by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; resistance, security suddenly became extremely rigid, with armed guards patrolling the premises. &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Durant\"&gt;Overseer Durant&lt;/a&gt; was charged with monitoring the vineyards' security and productivity, exercising supreme power, even over Margaux. \nDuring this time, Margaux began to sympathise with the resistance, who aimed to depose Grand Magistrix &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; for her pact with the Legion. Eventually, Margaux met and aided an agent of &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Nightfallen, and exchanged information regarding the vineyards' condition and the status of the resistance. Margaux also helped them to procure &lt;a href=\"mana%20wyrm\"&gt;mana wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s to aid them in their mission.\nSoon after this, however, Margaux was confronted by a company of nightborne led by Durant, who accused her of treason against the Grand Magistrix. After Durant pronounced her sentence, and with a protest from Margaux cut short, she was summarily executed on the spot by the Overseer's &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFollowing Margaux's death, the Nightfallen set out to avenge her, culminating in the assassination of her killer, Overseer Durant."}

A massive &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi%20abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;, Gharmal possessed the power to shape flesh in ways that few other beings could. They had a voracious appetite for power and hoarded anything they believed to be an item of power. In the absence of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, Gharmal and their house allied with &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, but the abomination margrave was slain in their stronghold by a joint assault by the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;Kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiography.\nAt some point, Gharmal obtained the &lt;a href=\"%3AMantle%20of%20Eternal%20Victory\"&gt;:Mantle of Eternal Victory&lt;/a&gt;, one of the armor pieces of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, and stored it in their &lt;a href=\"Gharmal%27s%20Tower\"&gt;private tower&lt;/a&gt;. Gharmal was convinced by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, baron of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;, to send their forces to attack &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt; alongside the House of Rituals. The margrave was also provided with canisters of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; by Kel'Thuzad's &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; allies in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. During the invasion of Bastion, the Construct &lt;a href=\"Surgeon%20Stitchflesh\"&gt;Surgeon Stitchflesh&lt;/a&gt; devised a way to create extremely powerful abominations from &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; flesh, an effort which would later be carried on by the rest of Gharmal's house. Not all members of the House of Constructs agreed with their margrave's actions, and many spoke out against the attack on Bastion. Fearing dissent, Gharmal removed many of these rebellious souls from their constructed bodies and imprisoned them in the &lt;a href=\"Etheric%20Vault\"&gt;Etheric Vault&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them to fade away from a lack of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Construct and Ritualist attack on Bastion was eventually repelled by the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;. When the latter arrived in Maldraxxus, their combat prowess in the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; drew the attention of Gharmal and Sin'dane\u2014who recognized the stranger as having been responsible for thwarting their efforts\u2014as well as &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Krexus\"&gt;Margrave Krexus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, who accused his fellow margraves of treason and ordered them to recall their forces from Bastion. In response, Gharmal mockingly asked if the Chosen had lost their appetite for glory. A vicious battle subsequently broke out between the three houses while the margraves returned to their respective strongholds, with Gharmal sending their vanguard to besiege the Chosen forces at the &lt;a href=\"Spearhead%20%28Maldraxxus%29\"&gt;Spearhead&lt;/a&gt;. After the Maw Walker helped the Chosen push back the assault, &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; (who was secretly in league with the Constructs and Ritualists) ordered the Maw Walker and &lt;a href=\"Secutor%20Mevix\"&gt;Secutor Mevix&lt;/a&gt; to launch a direct assault on the Construct stronghold in the hopes of catching Gharmal unprepared. The attack resulted in most of Mevix's soldiers being killed, and Gharmal themself emerged from their stronghold to tell their forces to hold their ground. Mevix decided on a change of strategy and told the Maw Walker to play dead so the Constructs would collect them for parts, while he created a diversion by rushing at Gharmal and allowing himself to be captured. The secutor's plan was a success, and the hero and Mevix ultimately fought their way out of the stronghold alongside captives from Bastion by taking control of the &lt;a href=\"Soulfused%20Construct\"&gt;Soulfused Construct&lt;/a&gt; and killing one of Gharmal's two barons, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Halis\"&gt;Halis&lt;/a&gt;.\nGharmal later observed the fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; alongside Sin'dane and Vyraz.\nSome time thereafter, the margrave sent reinforcements to Bastion, led by their remaining baroness, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Antolyte\"&gt;Antolyte&lt;/a&gt;. This attack was repelled as well, this time by an alliance between &lt;a href=\"Xandria\"&gt;Xandria&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the Paragon of the ruined temple\u2014and members of the &lt;a href=\"%3ANecrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;:Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. The kyrian and Necrolords subsequently joined forces and used the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt; to launch a combined assault on the House of Constructs in the hopes of ending Gharmal's reign. The margrave gathered their forces at their stronghold, including new, immense &lt;a href=\"Bilebloat%20Juggernaut\"&gt;juggernauts of kyrian flesh&lt;/a&gt;. While kyrian and Necrolord Maw Walkers helped their covenants battle the Construct forces, Gharmal boasted about how they would soon get to craft the flesh of the \"Chosen exiles and their kyrian pets\". The margrave used &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Projector\"&gt;astral projectors&lt;/a&gt; to rally their troops in the &lt;a href=\"Stitchyard\"&gt;Stitchyard&lt;/a&gt; and proclaim that Bastion was only the beginning, that \"all will be bound to our flesh\", and that the kyrian juggernauts would destroy all who opposed the Constructs. Once the Zerekriss was nearly in position, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; helped the Maw Walkers destroy Gharmal's juggernauts with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Blade of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the margrave out of their tower and into the open. At the House of Constructs' central ripening pond, Xandria, Alexandros, and the Maw Walkers began battling Gharmal in order to buy enough time for &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; to focus the Zerekriss' weaponry. During the fight, Gharmal claimed that the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; had held them back and that they should've raided Bastion ages ago, and mockingly asked Draka if she would beg to join the Constructs the way she had joined the House of the Chosen. The battle ended with Draka using the Zerekriss to fire a single massive bolt of energy at the margrave, killing them.\nOn Alexandros' suggestion, Xandria asked kyrian Maw Walkers to take Gharmal's &lt;a href=\"Fleshshaper%27s%20Heart\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which carried their power of shaping flesh\u2014to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; and place it inside the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. Through &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt;' handiwork, the heart's energy was channeled to aid in the kyrian's ascension rituals and help protect the Crest against attack. Meanwhile, the Necrolords investigated Gharmal's Tower and discovered both the canisters of venthyr anima and the Mantle of Eternal Victory, the latter of which they brought with them back to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nGharmal's dual voice and their use of the pronouns \"they\" and \"us\", noted above, suggest that the margrave's personality is made of multiple souls fused together in a single body."}

He was the strongest of the Chosen and, unlike his fellow margraves &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;, remained true to the purpose of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; until he was betrayed and killed by his subordinate, &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nFollowing the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the House of the Chosen to give Krexus a final message from her late lord, &lt;a href=\"Akarek\"&gt;Margrave Akarek&lt;/a&gt;. The message stated \"I offer the key to saving Maldraxxus\". Draka was at first confused by this, telling Krexus that Akarek hadn't given her a key, but Krexus realized that Draka herself\u2014being an unyielding warrior and master spy\u2014was \"a key to many things\". The margrave told Draka that their enemies would strike soon and that they had to be prepared. Draka thus joined the House of the Chosen as one of Krexus' barons, replacing &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, who had been lost to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Maldraxxus, their combat prowess in the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; drew the attention of Krexus and his fellow remaining margraves, &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;, who had betrayed the purpose of Maldraxxus by sending their forces to invade &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Krexus accused Gharmal and Sin'dane of treason and ordered them to recall their forces, but they refused and a vicious battle broke out between the three houses while the margraves returned to their respective strongholds to prepare for war. Draka arrived shortly thereafter and rescued the Maw Walker from the arena before taking them with her to the Chosen's stronghold. Krexus and Draka subsequently retreated to the margrave's &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vortrexxis\"&gt;Vortrexxis&lt;/a&gt; to talk strategy while the Maw Walker was sent to prepare for battle with Krexus' second baron, &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;. Krexus sensed great potential in the Maw Walker and soon commanded them to try reaching the standing stone in the citadel's central magma pool, a trial normally only done by the Chosen's most renowned soldiers. This resulted in the Maw Walker uncovering an &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Blade\"&gt;unfinished blade&lt;/a&gt; hidden in the rock and forging it into a &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;powerful runeblade&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt;. Krexus subsequently summoned the hero to Vortrexxis, concluded that the five runes on the blade were the same as the ones on the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, and sent his two barons and the Maw Walker to the Seat to investigate. The blade was revealed to be a key to the Seat, but Vyraz insisted that unlocking the fortress would do the Chosen no good if they lost the war against the other two houses.\nWhile the Maw Walker and Draka worked on recruiting allies to the Chosen's cause, Vyraz\u2014who had secretly been in league with the House of Constructs and House of Rituals\u2014betrayed Krexus by leading a construct attack on the Chosen and personally killed the margrave. After revealing his betrayal to the Maw Walker and the returned Alexandros Mograine, Vyraz claimed the mantle of margrave for himself."}

In the absence of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, Sin'dane was spurred on by her baron &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; to ally with &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kel'Thuzad ultimately betrayed Sin'dane to take control of the house. She was freed by the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; that she had previously fought against, prompting her to realize the error of her ways and pledge her loyalty to the covenant.\nBiography.\nBefore becoming margrave, Sin'dane was a baron of the House of Rituals. It's implied that she led a rebellion against the previous margrave and usurped him.\nThe baron's schemes.\nAt some point, the lich &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; joined the House of Rituals and became one of Sin'dane's two barons, replacing &lt;a href=\"Balmedar\"&gt;Balmedar&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad subsequently used his position and influence over the margrave to turn the houses of Maldraxxus against one another in order to further the plans of his true master, &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. Sin'dane sent the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi%20necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korrim%20the%20Cunning\"&gt;Korrim the Cunning&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt; and offered to provide them with &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the disaster that destroyed their house. Sin'dane and Kel'Thuzad's servant &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ouix%27Ara\"&gt;Lady Ouix'Ara&lt;/a&gt; began supplying the House of Rituals and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from Kel'Thuzad's &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; allies in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the House of Rituals and House of Constructs invaded &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt;. The invasion leader, the lich &lt;a href=\"Nalthor%20the%20Rimebinder\"&gt;Nalthor the Rimebinder&lt;/a&gt;, stated that his \"master\" had ordered him to destroy Bastion and harvest the corpses of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; for the Maldraxxi armies, but it's not clear if he was referring to Sin'dane or Kel'Thuzad.\nThe Ritualist and Construct attack was eventually repelled by the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s. When the latter arrived in Maldraxxus, their combat prowess in the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; drew the attention of Sin'dane and Gharmal\u2014who recognized the outsider as having been responsible for thwarting their efforts\u2014as well as &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Krexus\"&gt;Margrave Krexus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, who accused his fellow margraves of treason and ordered them to recall their forces from Bastion, an order they refused. A vicious battle subsequently broke out between the three houses while the margraves returned to their respective strongholds.\nSin'dane later observed the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain%20%28instance%29\"&gt;fighting in the Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; alongside Gharmal and &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nFall of Kel'Thuzad.\nAfter being unable to find any evidence that would mar Sin'dane's adoration for Kel'Thuzad, the deposed baron Balmedar allied with the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and helped necrolord Maw Walkers infiltrate the House of Rituals disguised as &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20Nelesis\"&gt;Acolyte Nelesis&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad's acolyte and Sin'dane's favorite consort. In this way, Balmedar and the heroes uncovered and sabotaged a plan by Kel'Thuzad to breach the Jailer's prison in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; but were subsequently imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Vault of Souls&lt;/a&gt;. They managed to escape, but before they had a chance to warn Sin'dane that her baron was toying with forbidden powers, Kel'Thuzad personally confronted the margrave and the house's other baron, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Ninadar\"&gt;Ninadar&lt;/a&gt;, at the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Hall of Sorcery&lt;/a&gt;. Sin'dane told Kel'Thuzad that he could not match her power, but Ninadar suddenly betrayed the margrave by stealing her weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Staff of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, while declaring that she was weak and that it was time to anoint a new margrave. This allowed Kel'Thuzad to incapacitate Sin'dane, bring her as a captive to the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exoramas\"&gt;Exoramas&lt;/a&gt;, and\u2014with Ninadar's backing\u2014seize control of the House of Rituals.\nAfter mustering their forces, the Necrolord Covenant launched an attack on the House of Rituals to remove Kel'Thuzad's influence. Ninadar ended up destroying herself in a battle in the &lt;a href=\"Grimoirium\"&gt;Grimoirium&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Balmedar to retrieve the Staff of the Primus. He stated that the attackers might still stand a chance against Kel'Thuzad if they returned the weapon to Sin'dane. After receiving reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the necrolords reached the Exoramas, where Kel'Thuzad was keeping Sin'dane trapped in a block of ice and drawing power from her. While the others held off Kel'Thuzad's &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Bulwark\"&gt;skeletal minions&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walkers focused on weakening the traitorous baron himself so that Balmedar could free Sin'dane. When he placed the Staff of the Primus in her hand, it allowed her to shatter her icy prison. She declared that Kel'Thuzad would answer for his crimes against both Maldraxxus and her, but before the attackers could detain the baron, he escaped to the Jailer with the help of a group of &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterward, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; asked Sin'dane to join the necrolords' cause as they would need her strength against the Jailer. The margrave agreed, stating that she now saw \"the true threat\" before them, and gave Draka the Staff of the Primus as proof of her good faith. The necrolord and venthyr forces went their separate ways from the Exoramas, but Sin'dane and Balmedar stayed behind. She pointed out that he had colluded with outsiders to defy her, which he replied had only been to expose Kel'Thuzad and restore her rightful rule. The margrave declared that Balmedar would atone for his indiscretions by once again serving as her baron as well as her liaison to Baroness Draka, a mission that he accepted.\nChains of Domination.\nDespite Kel'Thuzad's defeat, a number of Ritualists remained secretly loyal to the baron. Sin'dane (now again wielding the Staff of the Primus) asked for help in purging them, and &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Vashj\"&gt;Baroness Vashj&lt;/a&gt; sent her servant &lt;a href=\"Khaliiq\"&gt;Khaliiq&lt;/a&gt; along with a Maw Walker to do so. Sin'dane informed the necrolords that she believed that the lich &lt;a href=\"Zelmany\"&gt;Zelmany&lt;/a&gt; was trying to gather other Kel'Thuzad loyalists and that the lich &lt;a href=\"Drava%27ora\"&gt;Drava'ora&lt;/a&gt; and several other Ritualists were carrying marks that proved their allegiance to Kel'Thuzad, which they had kept secret even after the baron launched his coup. She had also been keeping a close eye on a lich named &lt;a href=\"Fal%27zinge\"&gt;Fal'zinge&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Kel'Thuzad's plans, and asked for his execution to be brutal. Khaliiq and the hero completed all three tasks and reported their success to Sin'dane aboard the Exoramas before leaving.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign%23Covenant%20assaults\"&gt;covenant assaults&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, Sin'dane joined her fellow Necrolords in assaulting &lt;a href=\"Perdition%20Hold\"&gt;Perdition Hold&lt;/a&gt; and providing aid to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in their assault on the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Crucible of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nEternity's End.\nIn their quest to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; acquired the essence of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; within the ruins and sought to bring it to the plague lords of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Sin'dane found herself approached by &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;. After Sin'dane directed the group to meet with &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Deviser%20Marileth\"&gt;Plague Deviser Marileth&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt;, Calia questioned Sin'dane about the nature of undeath, and revealed how while the Forsaken were raised through necromancy, which provided them a shared origin, and sense of unity, she had been raised by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. She further remarked that this difference made her question if she could ever truly find a place among them. In response, Sin'dane revealed that regardless of any magic, necromancy is necromancy, that Calia perceived a difference when there was none. Calia subsequently thanked the Margrave for her aid before leaving to seek out Marileth."}

She was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt; before their seat was destroyed.\nBiography.\nBefore the fall of her house, Margrave Stradama was kind, talented, and knowledgeable. She was &lt;a href=\"Soulbinding\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Deviser%20Marileth\"&gt;Plague Deviser Marileth&lt;/a&gt; and confided her fears in him after the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;'s disappearance and the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought, the latter of which had caused the House of Plagues' work to stagnate. The &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; offered to provide the House of Plagues with anima and sent the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Korrim%20the%20Cunning\"&gt;Korrim the Cunning&lt;/a&gt; to assist in their experiments. Stradama and Marileth both suspected duplicity, but their house was in no position to refuse. As a last resort, Marileth devised a potion to protect his margrave if the need arose, but before he could craft it, the House of Plagues was annihilated. Stradama herself was driven mad from a mixture of twelve different airborne poxes and was transformed into a monstrous &lt;a href=\"Slime%20giant\"&gt;being of slime and bone&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith help from the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, the now-insane Marileth later managed to complete his potion. Stradama appeared out of the slime below Marileth's laboratory alongside two &lt;a href=\"Plaguefall%20Ward\"&gt;Plaguefall Ward&lt;/a&gt;s, but the potion succeeded in granting her and Marileth a brief moment of lucidity. Marileth was shocked at Stradama's fate, but the margrave told her \"dear Marileth\" that he had to forgive himself and that while she was lost, he had to endure. The margrave disappeared back into the slime and Marileth promised that he would endure for her sake. Moments later, the effects of the potion wore off, but the act of temporarily clearing Stradama and Marileth's minds awakened the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Rune of Insight&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Blade of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; carried by the Maw Walker.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"It was believed that Margrave Stradama was destroyed in the explosion that brought down her house. In truth the explosion transformed her into a monstrous new form, driving her mad, and leaving her at the heart of the fallen &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSpeculation.\nIt is unknown if the baron Stradama mentions at her death is &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nExternal links.\n "}

Near the end of the fight, Horde soldiers and Tirasian marines were captured by the &lt;a href=\"Underworld%20Minions\"&gt;Underworld Minions&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used as sacrifices to the sea witch &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt;. Despite sharing a common foe, the marines continued to attack the Horde. Consequently, their base was destroyed on the orders of the Warchief.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, a sizeable second wave of Kul Tiras sailors and marines, led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Benedict\"&gt;Lieutenant Benedict&lt;/a&gt;, established themselves in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, continuing to fight the Horde as per Admiral Proudmoore's orders. Even though the Horde was unable to expel them for many years, the keep and its marines were finally destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.

Led by &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, these marines and sailors landed in the Blasted Lands and quickly engaged the Iron Horde army on the beach while establishing a command post and artillery positions.

The towering spire raised by &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; is located the heart of the city. It's majestic spires and great halls, roofed by thick slate the color of lapis lazuli, gave the citadel its name. The mighty structure rose above all else in the city. Its basic form is a huge tower with cone-shaped additions flanking its lower sides, while the sharply pointed tip is surrounded by a circular array kept in place by powerful magic spells.\nThe Violet Citadel is the location of the Grand Library. There's a vault below the Violet Citadel where the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; trapped the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; 2,600 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;. The Violet Citadel also contains the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Vault\"&gt;Arcane Vault&lt;/a&gt; which houses Dalaran's most powerful artifacts. It was from there that &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; stole the Eye of Dalaran and killed &lt;a href=\"Sathera\"&gt;Sathera&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; were about to stop the theft when &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Violet Citadel to support the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Creations%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the rebuilt Dalaran seen in \"\", the Violet Citadel is home to &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and his council of advisors \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 who rule Dalaran and lead the Kirin Tor in its war against the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the location of the Kirin Tor quartermaster who is located on an upper platform directly behind the four leaders.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; enveloped &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as well as Dalaran. Utterly cut off from the outside world in a chamber of the citadel, Archmage Modera and the remaining mages of the Kirin Tor still awake were doing all they could to contain the greatest of their kind from joining the Nightmare\u2019s army.\nAfter Rhonin's death, many, if not all mages of the Kirin Tor gathered here to commemorate the fallen archmage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the upper part of the citadel, the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, became available as the class hall for the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tallest spire atop the Violet Citadel is actually a weapon used for the defense of the city and offense against its enemies. However, after the weapon was used against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; it was sabotaged by the Legion.

{"id": "64828", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=64828", "title": "Violet Eye", "text": "The Violet Eye is a secret sect founded by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, they were assigned to keep an eye on &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and to spy on the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and his works. Although Medivh was dead for decades, and Karazhan somehow sealed itself off to the outside world, the Violet Eye remained to study the tower and the effects of its magic disturbances on &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Karazhan is a portal into &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, a beacon shining into other worlds, it's the Violet Eye's mission to ensure that the tower don't fall into the wrong hands, or the possible repercussions would be unthinkable. When the tower reopened and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt; took control of it, the Violet Eye fought to regain control of Karazhan with the help of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Years later, they faced the Legion once more during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Viz%27aduum%20the%20Watcher\"&gt;Viz'aduum the Watcher&lt;/a&gt; was tasked by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to use Karazhan as a conduit to every world consumed during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe heroes who provided aid and service received the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Signet\"&gt;Violet Signet&lt;/a&gt;, a magical ring that grew in power as they continued to prove their worth and loyalty to the Violet Eye. The higher their reputation with the organization, the more &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Leryda\"&gt;Archmage Leryda&lt;/a&gt; released the power contained in the signet to reward them. And for those who exceeded the expectations of the mages, achieving the highest honor available to non-citizens of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the ring became as powerful as those of the archmages of the Kirin Tor and a symbol so that the initiated may recognize their allegiance.\nHistory.\nAmong the agent the Violet Eye sent to infiltrate Karazhan, &lt;a href=\"Koren\"&gt;Koren&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; of the tower was under their pay. Though not a member of the Violet Eye, he pretended to serve Medivh and helped the Violet Eye to keep a close eye on the Guardian. The &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keanna\"&gt;Keanna&lt;/a&gt; was also present in the tower, where she was staying up at the guest chambers. After Medivh was killed, Karazhan sealed itself off to the outside world and the agents remained locked inside, while their allies outside never heard from any of them again. Inside, the agents died for unknown reasons, and the magic of the tower notably prevented Koren's soul from finding eternal rest.\nFor unknown reasons, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; had many disagreements with &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Cedric\"&gt;Archmage Cedric&lt;/a&gt; in the past, but still considers that the work that men like &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Alturus\"&gt;Archmage Alturus&lt;/a&gt; do is important. On the field, Archmage Alturus is a high ranking member of the Violet Eye responsible for gathering information about the state of Karazhan, while his immediate supervisor is Archmage Cedric at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Cedric assigned &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Darius\"&gt;Apprentice Darius&lt;/a&gt; to help Alturus in his tasks and research.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt some point after the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Alturus\"&gt;Archmage Alturus&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Tasserel\"&gt;Apprentice Tasserel&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; to look for assistance. While he was not allowed outside of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;, he nevertheless managed to convince the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, and sent them to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to help the cause of the Violet Eye. In the meantime, he looked for a way to access the rest of the city after hearing the rumor that an &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;old associate&lt;/a&gt; of theirs was present somewhere.\nWhen the adventurer arrived, Archmage Alturus asked for their help to discover the reason for the ghosts around Karazhan, precisely some of their essences to study them. He also sent them with a scrying crystal to obtain an imprint of Karazhan's energy, and discovered that the haunted tower was no longer emanating all manner of arcane currents, but instead, became a huge energy vacuum with a very faint &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic echo. After it was reported to the organization, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Cedric\"&gt;Archmage Cedric&lt;/a&gt; sent the adventurer to meet Khadgar in Shattrath, their \"old associate\", because he was the only one who could reopen Karazhan so that Violet Eye could act.\nWith the help of Khadgar, and somehow of Medivh in the past, the adventurers managed to reform &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%27s%20Key\"&gt;The Master's Key&lt;/a&gt;. Before they left, Khadgar told them to be careful that the Violet Eye didn't try to use them, for they were the ones with the key, but that if their investigations were true, then it would be important to help them. Once Karazhan was reopened, Archmage Alturus sent the adventurer to assess the situation inside and to find &lt;a href=\"Keanna%27s%20Log\"&gt;Keanna's Log&lt;/a&gt;, an encoded log of all her observations, and advised them to seek help from the ghost &lt;a href=\"Koren\"&gt;Koren&lt;/a&gt;. Once in possession of the log, they discovered that &lt;a href=\"Keanna\"&gt;Keanna&lt;/a&gt; had detected the arrival of a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; agent at the top of the tower before her death.\nFor all their help, the adventurer was rewarded by Archmage Alturus, as in his own words, gaining the favor of the archmages of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; is not something one can regret. However, Archmage Cedric later explained that it wasn't over, as it was only a matter of time until the demons renewed their attacks while the Violet Eye stood powerless on the sidelines. The archmage then asked once more for the help of the adventurers to put an end to the plans of the Legion.\nIn the meantime, the Violet Eye sent three agents to track down &lt;a href=\"Medivh%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Medivh's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, but none of them came out and the adventurer was thus sent to accomplish the mission. Inside the tower, the agents &lt;a href=\"Wravien\"&gt;Wravien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gradav\"&gt;Gradav&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kamsis\"&gt;Kamsis&lt;/a&gt;, somehow succumbed to the dark magic of Karazhan during their investigation, dooming their souls to relive their final moments forever. Despite the curse, they still managed to help the adventurer who later brought back the diary to Archmage Alturus.\nWith the information and memories inside, centered on the battle between Medivh and &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt;, Archmage Alturus determined that this was an opportunity for them to retrieve some of the Guardian's magical essence from the blue dragon's remains. Once in possession of one of the bones, he sent the adventurer to meet &lt;a href=\"Kalynna%20Lathred\"&gt;Kalynna Lathred&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the Kirin Tor in pursuit of knowledge forbidden, in order to raise the dragon back from the dead. With her help, the adventurers managed to resurrected Arcanagos as the &lt;a href=\"undead%20dragon\"&gt;undead dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nightbane\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt;, and after they defeated him, they brought the essence to Alturus, who announced that this would reveal vital information about Medivh.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces marched into &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt; saw this as a sign of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s return and killed &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Darius\"&gt;Apprentice Darius&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Alturus\"&gt;Archmage Alturus&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion's arrival was no surprise, as the power they coveted beneath the tower had already existed for a long time. Alturus and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Leryda\"&gt;Archmage Leryda&lt;/a&gt;, alongside a few mages of the Kirin Tor, were later seen holding off the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic reinforcements from reaching the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Cellar\"&gt;Master's Cellar&lt;/a&gt;. When the adventurer arrived, Leryda asked them to push the demons back, because if the Legion forces had continued to grow, the Violet Eye would not have been able to hold their ground.\nAfter his death, Darius became a &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; and was granted the rank of mage posthumously. He then received the new charge of sprucing up the tower, in order for it to be a bit more inviting in case &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; had further need of it. Now able to enter the tower safely, Darius enlisted the help of the adventurers in his tasks to clear Karazhan of the vermin inside, to calm the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Hall\"&gt;Opera Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and to disable &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt; once more.\nWhen the heroes had to defeat &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20%28Return%20to%20Karazhan%20tactics%29\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt; over again, Darius remarked that Archmage Alturus' idea of \u200b\u200braising an &lt;a href=\"undead%20dragon\"&gt;undead dragon&lt;/a&gt; back to life, in order to study the Guardian's powers, hadn't been such a good idea on the long term.\nReputation.\nQuests.\nThere is a large and complex chain that has the player visit several dungeons of Outland in order for them to obtain &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%27s%20Key\"&gt;The Master's Key&lt;/a&gt;, which allows for entrance to Karazhan and beyond.\n\"10275 reputation total\"\nRewards.\nRings.\nAt reputation, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Leryda\"&gt;Archmage Leryda&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; will offer players a quest to receive a ring. The rings are progressively upgraded as the player gains higher reputation.\nEach ring set is received as quest rewards. The quests all follow the same pattern, with the only distinction being the first quest's title.\nVendors.\nDarius is the traditional faction quartermaster.\nInside Karazhan, Koren the blacksmith offers a few recipes to players who are honored with the Violet Eye."}
