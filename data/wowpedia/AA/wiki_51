{"id": "28164", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28164", "title": "Drakefire Amulet", "text": "The Drakefire Amulet was once the &lt;a href=\"key\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, until the attunement requirement was removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair%20Attunement\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair Attunement&lt;/a&gt; for details on the old attunement process.\nBackground.\nThe Drakefire Amulet was once a pendant known as the &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20of%20the%20Dragon%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Dragon's Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Possessed of powerful magic, the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; used it in her guise as &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Though it did not outright control minds, it was capable of bringing one's deepest desires to bear, encouraging them to do things that they wouldn't normally do but, deep down, always wanted to. It also deflected suspicion from her, causing others to simply take her words at face value. She eventually went so far as to physically put it around &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;'s neck to make him more compliant and susceptible to her influence.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Windsor&lt;/a&gt; uncovered her deception, the Dragon's Eye was broken in the ensuing fight. Using the blood of &lt;a href=\"General%20Drakkisath\"&gt;General Drakkisath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt; transformed the broken pendant into the Drakefire Amulet, while the Alliance heroes used it to bypass the powerful wards protecting Onyxia's Lair and slay her. Afterwards, the amulet was locked away in Stormwind Keep to prevent anyone else from using its manipulating magic.\nOver a decade later, the amulet was stolen by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; serving &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt;. The theft was the fulfillment of a long dream of Clessington to use the amulet to enrich himself, get rid of his political enemies, and ultimately put himself on the throne, having been an ally of Onyxia's before her demise. He used first it to convince the Defias to attack &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in order to use it as a staging ground for an assault on Stormwind itself, and then to turn the people of Northshire against each other by inflaming everyone's latent grudges, but the attack was foiled by &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. After Clessington was killed, Shaw wanted to lock the amulet up again in Stormwind, while VanCleef wanted to keep it for herself. The two briefly came to blows before realizing that they were still suffering from the amulet's influence. Refusing to be manipulated again, VanCleef shattered the amulet, causing a &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Onyxia\"&gt;Shade of Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; to emerge and attempt to kill them. It was soon destroyed, putting a final end to her legacy.\nSource.\nThis item is a quest reward from the following quests:"}

He is made up of drakkari &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; fused together.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The trolls' use of &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; magic has long been established, but the fusion of those magics into a golem was a revolutionary breakthrough. Their initial success led to the creation of numerous sentinels all spawned from their original creation: the colossus.\"\nStrategies.\nWhen you pull the boss, he will merge with the Living Mojos that surround him.\nUntil ~50% the fight is more or less tank 'n' spank. He then becomes unattackable and the Living Mojo spawn in a merged and more powerful form. \nThis Living Mojo will be like a normal tank 'n' spank fight, but every .5 of a second he will cast \"pool of Mojo\" on three people in the party doing 1000 damage on contact and 1000 damage per second if you stay in the pool. Be ready to move and hop around during this phase. Your healer is going to need to be on the top of their game in order to do this phase.\nIt will also do a \"surge\" move which is like a warriors charge but has a casting time. it CAN be avoided if you move out of the way.\nWhen the elemental reaches ~50%, the boss merges with it. It's more or less back to tank 'n' spank, only now the boss casts an AoE attack that hits you with a undispellable debuff that ticks for ~900 dmg.\nBring the boss to 1 health and the elemental reappears. Bring the elemental to 0% and the boss dies. \nHeroic: This fight is easiest if the boss in elemental form is kited around the circle, stopping every few seconds to ensure all melee strikes make contact (out of range), since the boss will stop also. When the boss shifts at 50%, repeat this strategy and ensure you kite \"around\" the pools of mojo. \nAny nature resist will help with this fight.\nPaladin Healer.\nPaladin healer may have difficulty healing the tank and moving with the group. To solve this problem, the paladin healer can put beacon of light on himself. When he heals the tank and the dps, the healing done to the raid offsets the damage he took standing in the mojo.\nTrivia.\nDuring the beta, his name was Bloodstone Annihilator. This may have been changed because of the possible future appearance of &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Bloodstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, which shattered the old continent of Kalimdor, would prove disastrous for the Drakkari. Their empire was weakened, with the tribes dispersed to different continents. The Drakkari themselves, now living on &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, would continue to maintain the empire, though it was a shadow of their former glory. In time, it too would eventually fall at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, marking the end of an era.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn ancient &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, around 16,000 years prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes claimed vast portions of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; were one of several who rose to challenge the prominent &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and occupied areas north of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Despite constant rivalries between the Drakkari and the Zandalari, &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; tribes, all-out war was rare. The Drakkari and their neighbors would instead focus mainly on expanding and settling unoccupied lands, of which there were plenty.\nEverything would change when &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; was awakened. Seeking to wipe out the trolls in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; of millennia past, Kith'ix would rally the insectoid &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, sparking the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt;. Directed by the Zandalari, the Drakkari and the other tribes united to form the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat this dire threat. Each tribe would coordinate their own attacks to drive back the aqiri swarms.\nThe Drakkari would be the first to act, pushing into the frozen north and battling a large colony of aqir. These aqir would harness corrupted &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Immune to most physical damage, the tol'vir initially caused many casualties among the Drakkari and almost crushed them. Soon, however, the Drakkari trolls would develop new cunning and brilliant ways to knock over the obsidian destroyers, shattering them in the process. This would subsequently allow them to achieve victory in their theater of the war.\nAs the other tribes gained similar success against the aqir, and after defeating Kith'ix, the Empire of Zul proclaimed victory in the war. Unchallenged in the entirety of the continent, the trolls thrived. The Drakkari and the other tribes would grow distant from one another without the danger of the aqir to unite them. Now, they would each form their own empires, among them the Drakkari Empire, and continue to prosper within their own borders.\nDrakkari Empire.\nThe mighty &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; would head the new Drakkari Empire from the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt; in the north. Though the smallest among the three newly-emerged troll powers (the others being the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;) the Drakkari nonetheless thrived within their northern territories. &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; worship was deeply important to the Drakkari, and many such spirits occupied the empire's pantheon. Structures such as temple cities, shrines, altars, more were constructed to venerate their the loa as well as other gods. In addition, the Drakkari used special &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt;s and high priests to commune with their deities, as well as oversee their worship. The &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20tribe\"&gt;Winterax&lt;/a&gt; were two of the known member tribes of the Drakkari Empire at this time.\nThe empire of the Drakkari would survive relatively undisturbed for many thousands of years, even as troll mastery of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was eventually ceded to the rising &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Though they did not take part in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, they would ultimately suffer its consequences. The resulting &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; violently shattered the continent, forming new and smaller landmasses. Much of Drakkari Empire was now lost, with tribes such as the Winterax and Frostmane completely separated from the Drakkari themselves.\nDespite this, the Drakkari civilization would survive, becoming known as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; on the new continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Drakkari influence was concentrated in the northeast of the continent, stretching from &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt; in the east to &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the west.\nComing of the Scourge.\nThe Drakkari Empire survived seemingly comfortably for over 10,000 years following the Sundering (longer than they had done before so). The &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s maintained large farms, supplied with a vast aqueduct system spanning the region of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. Worship of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; also remained extremely prevalent.\n&lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; would ultimately become home to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; armies of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, based from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. When the Lich King awoke and began a major &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; against the living of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Zul'Drak and the Drakkari found themselves in peril. The legions of undead assaulted the Drakkari kingdom relentlessly, eventually seizing the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; as countless trolls were turned to undeath. The Lich King's forces continued their advance into Zul'Drak, threatening the entire Drakkar civilization.\nDesperate to turn back the undead, the Drakkari tried to force their loa to give them more power, first subduing them and then sacrificing them. Maddened high prophets and their followers sacrificed the animal loa, spilling their blood and harnessing the untapped power. As more parts of the nation fell to the Scourge, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; also arrived to fight both the restless undead and the frenzied trolls. &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zol%27Maz\"&gt;Zol'Maz&lt;/a&gt; was Warlord of the Drakkari tribe at this time, though he too would eventually be killed by Zul'Drak's invaders.\nIn the depths of the capital of &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;, the most sacred shrines were said to be steeped in the mojo of slain gods. Surrounded by this dark energy, twisted Drakkari zealots grew in power, infusing their followers with incredible strength. If left undisturbed, the trolls of Gundrak would unleash their burgeoning might, plunging the entire region into chaos. Mortal &lt;a href=\"champion\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;s would succeed in attacking the temple city, preventing this. Some of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20History%20Tablet\"&gt;histories&lt;/a&gt; of the Drakkari tribe and empire were recovered by a mission of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; based from &lt;a href=\"Zim%27Torga\"&gt;Zim'Torga&lt;/a&gt;, in the hope of preserving the ice trolls' past and heritage.\nRemnants.\nThe fall of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; would spell doom for the Drakkari Empire, though the &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; itself would survive. Future attempts would nonetheless be made to redeem and revive the empire.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; would once more try to unite the troll tribes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and held a meeting of representatives from each. &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s were present at the gathering, alongside &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt;, though the Drakkari did not play a role in the following events, presumably too weak to do so.\nSome time later, the remaining Drakkari would bolster the Zandalari forces that would eventually invade the northern shores of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, along with the Gurubashi, Amani, and &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Farraki&lt;/a&gt; tribes. The tribe would be led in this endeavor by &lt;a href=\"Frost%20King%20Malakk\"&gt;Frost King Malakk&lt;/a&gt;. To mark their suffering at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, they have added &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to their strength. They took part to the fight during the fight of &lt;a href=\"Horridon\"&gt;Horridon&lt;/a&gt; and the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt;, but were ultimately defeated.\nSome years later, &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Malaka%27raz\"&gt;Speaker Malaka'raz&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Tribes\"&gt;House of the Fallen Tribes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; said that the empire was no more, and the Zandalari had left him as little more then a curiosity for others to gawk at. &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and his rebels would learn from the Drakkari's example and attempt to drain the Zandalari loa in the same way the Drakkari had their loa."}

{"id": "33259", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=33259", "title": "Drakkari tribe", "text": "The Drakkari tribe was a &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s that founded the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Empire\"&gt;Drakkari Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, with the city of &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt; as their old capital but it was eventually lost to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. They seemed to be a hardy people, persisting through hostilities from the empire of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; and the Scourge. &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Malaka%27raz\"&gt;Speaker Malaka'raz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; says the tribe eventually fell.\nBackground.\nEarly history.\nThe Drakkari were one the troll tribes that arose to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; for territory and power.\nWhen a group of trolls awakened &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; viewed the troll nations with contempt and thus sought to destroy them with the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;. At the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt;, numerous smaller tribes fell before the aqir. The Drakkari were one of the many troll tribes to join the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Zandalari took on the role of commanding the troll armies. The Empire of Zul forced the aqir to retreat and Kith'ix would be gravely wounded by the trolls and their loa allies.\nSeeking to permanently end the aqir threat, the Zandalari knew that no corner of the continent could be left unguarded, and so the Zandalari convinced the most power-hungry of the troll factions to establish new and permanent strongholds across Kalimdor. At the forefront of these groups were the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and Drakkari tribes. After they had fully vanquished the aqir in their new regions, they could lay uncontested claim to the untouched fertile lands that they now lived in. The ambitious tribes listened to the Zandalari and readily agreed. \nThe Drakkari tribe acted first, pushing into the frigid and snow-covered north against a colony of aqir that had retreated in that direction. While they had expected to find numerous aqir, they were shocked and caught off-guard by the presence of corrupted &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; guardians. A small group of these titan forged had been captured and enthralled from the nearby fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. This particular type of tol'vir, known as &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;Obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, caused havoc among the Drakkari ranks. Their size and stone skin allowed them to shrug off many conventional attacks, rendering them highly resistant to the trolls' normal form of warfare. The Drakkari were almost overpowered by these constructs, but they had evolved to become tenacious and brilliant in their thinking through years of combat. Eventually, the cunning fighters developed clever ways to knock over and shatter their foes, without suffering heavy casualties.\nEventually, the Drakkari were exiled from the other troll nations for their extremely violent ways. In time, the territory claimed by the Drakkari would become known as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; and its capital became &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;, establishing the Drakkari Empire.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; once served the Drakkari trolls as a formidable outpost at the edge of their kingdom, Zul'Drak, but a recent Scourge invasion has delivered the fortress into the Lich King's hands. The keep's fallen defenders are now the Lich King's undead minions, and they are advancing into the heart of Drakkari territory.\nWhen the Scourge invaded &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, the Drakkari didn\u2019t go quietly and even shot down the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kolramas\"&gt;Kolramas&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately for them, and the detachment of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; that was nearby, the crash didn\u2019t kill all the &lt;a href=\"Hath%27ar\"&gt;Hath'ar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nerubians\"&gt;nerubians&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Malas%20the%20Corrupter\"&gt;Malas the Corrupter&lt;/a&gt;, who ordered them to start raising up any dead they could get their nasty claws on.\nDesperate to save their kingdom from collapse, the trolls of Zul'Drak tried to force their &lt;a href=\"Loa%23Drakkari%20Loas\"&gt;their ancient gods&lt;/a&gt; to give them more power, first subduing them and then sacrificing them. The wild deities were then considered a source of untapped power, their potent blood providing the means to repel the Lich King's minions, who have overtaken parts of the troll nation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s journeyed to the beleaguered region to strike at the savage Drakkari and their maddened prophets. Even so, the greatest threat to the region is rumored to lie undisturbed within the capital of the ice trolls' empire, Gundrak. In the depths of the city, the most sacred shrines are said to be steeped in the mojo of slain gods. Surrounded by this dark energy, twisted Drakkari high prophets grow in power, infusing their followers with incredible strength. If left undisturbed, the trolls of Gundrak may soon unleash their burgeoning might, plunging the entire region into chaos.\nThey also tried to summon &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to fight the Scourge, but in doing so inadvertently created &lt;a href=\"Water%20Waveling\"&gt;water waveling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Zandalari of &lt;a href=\"Zim%27Torga\"&gt;Zim'Torga&lt;/a&gt; are particularly interested in the madness that has overtaken the Drakkari tribe of Zul'Drak and seek to try and save some of the Drakkari history before it is wiped out for good.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the meeting of the troll tribes held after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; stated that Zul'Drak had fallen to the Scourge. A few ice trolls were seen in attendance.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe remaining Drakkari were a part of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Invaders\"&gt;Zandalari Invaders&lt;/a&gt;, attacking the northern shores of Pandaria, along with the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Farraki tribe&lt;/a&gt;s. As a mark of their fall against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, a part of their strength are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. They take part in the fight during the fight of &lt;a href=\"Horridon\"&gt;Horridon&lt;/a&gt; and the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20King%20Malakk\"&gt;Frost King Malakk&lt;/a&gt; is slain alongside the rest of the council members. This marks the last time the Drakkari are seen fighting as a unified tribe.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Malaka%27raz\"&gt;Speaker Malaka'raz&lt;/a&gt; could be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Tribes\"&gt;House of the Fallen Tribes&lt;/a&gt;, Malaka'raz said that the Drakkari tribe was no more, leaving him as little more than a curiosity for others to gawk at.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and his rebels would learn from the Drakkari's example and attempt to drain the Zandalari loa in the same way the Drakkari had their loa.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the surviving Drakkari are scattered.\nThey also reported that the main focus of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; Drakkari pouring from &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; is the complete destruction of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nUnlike some other troll tribes, a group of ice trolls still retains a portion of its kingdom: the Drakkari live in Zul'Drak in Northrend. These are larger and stronger than ice trolls elsewhere, and indeed almost all other trolls, averaging 8 feet in height.\nBackground.\nThe Drakkari tribe is one of a few small tribes that were driven out of civilized lands long ago for their extremely violent and cruel behavior. These barbarous trolls settled far in the north of ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, adapted to their snowy environment, and formed the nation of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. After the Sundering, the Drakkari tribe continued to live in what had become the bitterly cold continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, the ruins of the Drakkari civilization are scattered throughout the eastern side of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike Zandalari trolls, the Drakkari average eight feet in height: significantly larger than all other documented trolls. There the resemblance ends. Unlike the peaceful &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, Drakkari trolls are a ruthless and savage people who delight in battle and have no interest in the pursuit of knowledge. Hunting is also a popular pastime for Drakkari trolls because raw meat is the primary staple of their diet. Some Drakkari Trolls, however, such as &lt;a href=\"Gan%27jo\"&gt;Gan'jo&lt;/a&gt;, contest that the tribe once had a more civilized way of life, that they had become a lost people, fierce and savage. For how long this has been the case is anyone's guess.\nRegardless of its combat skills, the Drakkari tribe respects the might of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and does its best to avoid the growing forces of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; has raised a number of ice trolls into undeath and forced them to serve him. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; has also recently taken possession of &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient Drakkari citadel. A war between the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and Drakkari may be inevitable, and the outcome would surely be disastrous for the trolls.\nDrakkari are unpleasant. They epitomize the nastiness and barbarism of trolls everywhere. They\u2019re large, bigger than any other troll (except trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, the first tribe to exist and who are the same size) and crude, and they prefer violence to discussion or negotiation. They are a barbaric people who practice voodoo and worship strange spirit-gods and devour their enemies \u2014 and sometimes their friends \u2014 raw. The only thing a Drakkari respects is strength and the only thing they want from others is fear and flesh.\nSpeculation.\nWhile it is said the tribe is no more, it is entirely possible citizens of the tribe such as non-combatant and &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; survive, but are too small to properly rebuild."}

{"id": "21810", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21810", "title": "Drakonid", "text": "Drakonid (sometimes pluralized as drakonids and also spelled draconid) or drakonaar are a bipedal humanoid &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; fashioned by their masters to be helpful and loyal. They are typically used as guards and frontline &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s within each of the five great &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as within the dragonflights at the service of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDrakonid are soldiers, educated and trained to serve. They begin as &lt;a href=\"cadet\"&gt;cadet&lt;/a&gt;s and eventually graduate out of that rank. One of their topmost missions is to protect the eggs of their flight, and they are to give their life for that mission if necessary. Old drakonid are allowed to retire.\nBackground.\nThe original drakonid were transformed from &lt;a href=\"tarasek\"&gt;tarasek&lt;/a&gt;, a reptilian species native to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, uplifted by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; in the same manner that the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s uplifted &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s into dragons. In the millennia that followed, new methods with varying degrees of success were devised to create drakonid. Drakonid can lay eggs and have children.\nDrakonid are abundant on the Dragon Isles. When dragons left the Dragon Isles after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, they were left behind to care over the isles. The Spellsworn, a group consisting of blue drakonid left in stasis watched over by &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, was sent by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; to guard the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned there.\nDrakonid were integral to the processes that were done to create &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;; with the earliest experimentations that would lead to dracthyr actually being various forms of augmented drakonid, such as &lt;a href=\"Neldris\"&gt;Neldris&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the process, drakonid were still used in what would create the first successful dracthyr.\nModern day.\nIn modern days, some drakonid seem to be created from mortals, empowered by the dragons they serve, via intentional alteration or via \"unintended side effect of hanging out with dragons\". They have thus been described as half-man, half-dragon. The process does not have to be willing. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, each drakonid seems to have a fatal weakness to one magic type, making it suffer enormous damage from that particular school. This weakness can be used to the advantage of any mortal army daring to step into the halls of Blackwing Lair in order to challenge the sinister &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;. A group of black drakonid served &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrakonid of all five &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s guard the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and the sanctums in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. The drakonid of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; patrol and protect the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; tempted many drakonid with promises of power, but most found only servitude and despair. One of the few exceptions is &lt;a href=\"Chrono%20Lord%20Deja\"&gt;Chrono Lord Deja&lt;/a&gt;, who gained influence within the flight through his raw power and cunning. \nNether drakonid can be found in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, in the service of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Ascendant\"&gt;Dragonmaw Ascendant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; himself in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; can turn into drakonid. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, armies of shadow-possessed drakonid fought against the &lt;a href=\"dreamform%20army\"&gt;dreamform army&lt;/a&gt;. \nDrakonid can also be counted among the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. After Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, one massive drakonid was sent by the cultists to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Caverns\"&gt;Blackrock Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corla%2C%20Herald%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Corla&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; is seen blessing fellow human zealots by harnessing &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; essence to transform them into menacing &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight drakonid&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s returned to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and many drakonid rejoiced in their return, joining them in the &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken%20Accord\"&gt;Valdrakken Accord&lt;/a&gt;. However, a number of dragonspawn was discontent with them and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and instead joined the &lt;a href=\"Flightless\"&gt;Flightless&lt;/a&gt; in an open rebellion against &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt;, seeking artifacts and power, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; worked with the &lt;a href=\"Scalesworn\"&gt;Scalesworn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to stop the rebellion in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;. On other fronts, numbers of the Sundered Flame and the Primalists were defeated.\nFlights.\nDrakonid can be found as members of all five major dragonflights, and among the various derivatives of these flights as well. A number of them have also joined with the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;; seeking to remove the rule of the Aspects from their people.\nSpeculation.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dragonkin\"&gt;Dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;\" as a more specific term than the &lt;a href=\"creature%20type\"&gt;creature type&lt;/a&gt; may be a \"race\" that includes both drakonid and dragonspawn.

He makes no claims of rehabilitation and he uses no metaphors. His prisoners are here to be punished, and there is no escape.\"\nStrategies.\nWhen the boss fight begins, Drakos will summon floating bombs that quickly fly around the island players on. These bombs do not detonate on touching, rather Drakos will randomly blow a number up throughout the fight. The bombs move at a fairly quick pace so it may be difficult for groups to avoid them in time to dodge an explosion. However, they only hit for around 2,000 each, so it can be easily healed through.\nDrakos will occasionally use a spell called Magic Pull and cause everyone to be teleported to him. At this time casters and range should head out of melee range. \nIn addition to the pull, Drakos will randomly place a bomb debuff on one target. This person needs to run away from everyone else until they explode, then return to the fight.\nThis fight (as well as every other fight in this instance) becomes increasingly easier if you have a healer with the capability to heal more than one target simultaneously. A druid healer will shine most of all throughout this fight from the use of HoTs.\nDrakos will also use Thundering Stomp, which will launch any melee into the air a small distance and deal some physical damage. This ability is on a 5 second cooldown."}

The jar was in good condition. \nThey found an ancient &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; dialect carved on the shrine that was the same one carved onto the jar. A warning was placed on the shrine stating, \"...sealing them away so that our world might know new life.\"\nHe helped clear away the corpses and the rubble discovering an altar underneath. After the brother and sister mages had completed a ritual, Drann shattered the jar with his fist. \nThey had accidentally unleashed a towering &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; who promised to take them to his home in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; where they would be \"rewarded\".

Behind these, archers of the Horde train for battle, while laborers build machinery and transport goods. The blockade has built around &lt;a href=\"Jaggedswine%20Farm\"&gt;Jaggedswine Farm&lt;/a&gt; and uses the hut there for storage. The hut just to the west of the front gate contains &lt;a href=\"Gor%20the%20Enforcer\"&gt;Gor the Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shin%20Stonepillar\"&gt;Shin Stonepillar&lt;/a&gt;, who have differing views on the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, concerned citizens and the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult gathered near here.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the area was filled with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; loyalists and soldiers. The area was invaded by both, the Horde and Alliance revolutionaries, with the southern area becoming a &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Offensive\"&gt;staging camp&lt;/a&gt; for Vol'jin's forces. Since the fall of Garrosh's reign, the site is filled with &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Laborer\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Laborer&lt;/a&gt;s once again.\nLegion.\nThe Dranosh'ar Blockade was the launching point for the Horde forces sent to attack the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Accepting puts the player into a phased version of the blockade, where the weather is rather rainy and gloomy. Ships, soldiers and siege weapons are being prepared by all the races of the Horde. Several things can be seen there:\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the rumors about &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s demise had already spread, and the area was filled with &lt;a href=\"Concerned%20Citizen\"&gt;concerned citizen&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denizen%20of%20Undercity\"&gt;Undercity denizens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citizen%20of%20Kezan\"&gt;Kezan citizens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Villager\"&gt;Sen'jin villagers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff%20Native\"&gt;Thunder Bluff natives&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Citizen\"&gt;Silvermoon citizens&lt;/a&gt; discussing and crying together.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe area was once again populated by soldiers participating in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bwemba\"&gt;Bwemba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; summoned the &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Spirit of Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; here who proceeded to enter &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in order to try to learn the truth about his final words.\nOver the course of &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde split between &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; loyalists and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries. Saurfang's revolutionaries would ally with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the two armies &lt;a href=\"Battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;marched to assault&lt;/a&gt; and face Sylvanas Windrunner. As the united armies prepared to assault Orgrimmar, they had to contend with Sylvanas's spies and protecting their siege weapons. Knowing that Orgrimmar's greatest weakness was its multiple entrances, Saurfang's strategy relied on attacking all three entrances at once. To that end, he directed for &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;'s forces to attack Orgrimmar from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; to lead their forces to attack the city from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and he, Thrall, and Anduin would strike at Orgrimmar from the Dranosh'ar Blockade itself.\nHowever, before the battle could commence, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of Thrall voicing his concerns that he would die. When Sylvanas questioned why she should accept his challenge, Saurfang merely pointed out that she wanted him to suffer, causing Sylvanas to wordlessly agree. While Sylvanas armed herself, Saurfang was granted an axe by Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; by Anduin. Sylvanas initially had the upper hand against Saurfang, however, when she began to mock him about hope, Saurfang got his second wind by declaring that Sylvanas couldn't kill hope. As Saurfang turned the tide against Sylvanas, he claimed that she failed to kill hope at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, failed in getting the Horde and Alliance to keep killing each other, he further declared that the Horde would endure, that the Horde was strong, and the high overlord was able to slash Sylvanas across her eye. This turn caused an enraged Sylvanas to declare that the Horde was nothing, that they were all nothing. Sylvanas then killed Saurfang quickly with a blast of unknown magic and abandoned the battlefield and the Horde altogether.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Campaign\"&gt;Nazjatar Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neri%20Sharpfin\"&gt;Neri Sharpfin&lt;/a&gt; and several of the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Durotar, emerging on the coast of the Dranosh'ar Blockade."}

As such, he was also the nephew of &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar the Red&lt;/a&gt; and half-cousin to &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;. Dranosh was very much like his father and uncle, a fierce &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; to the end. He was a strong believer in the ideals of honor espoused by his father. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; regarded him as charismatic and wise beyond his years; \"the brightest star in the sky of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; warriors\".\nAs part of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, Dranosh led the Horde's vanguard against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, but he fell to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s sword &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. He was subsequently raised into undeath as Deathbringer Saurfang, the Lich King's most powerful &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;ref name=\"Underdev/Icecrown Citadel: The Frozen Throne\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was tasked with barring the path of any &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; seeking to lay siege to his new master's fortress of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. He was killed for good in the ensuing battle. He was deeply grieved after his death and his fate is considered a great tragedy by members of the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; alike.\n\"Dranosh\" means \"Heart of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBefore Dranosh's mother &lt;a href=\"Remda\"&gt;Remda&lt;/a&gt; died, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok&lt;/a&gt; promised her that their son would remain safe and &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;untainted&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Before Varok crossed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, he had the elders of &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; hide Dranosh away so the orcish &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s would not find him.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDranosh Saurfang first appeared at the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27hari%20Procession\"&gt;Mag'hari Procession&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Though he is not the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, he is classified as a level ?? Boss.\nFollowing a raid by &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20tribe\"&gt;Murkblood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, a group of adolescent orcs from Garadar formed a war party and set out to seek vengeance. Dranosh led the party in an attack on &lt;a href=\"Sunspring%20Post\"&gt;Sunspring Post&lt;/a&gt;, but most of them were killed by the Broken. Dranosh was one of the only survivors\u2014he sustained severe injuries, blacked out, and awoke in the Mag'hari Procession sometime later. He later asked &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;strangers&lt;/a&gt; (sent from Garadar by &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Corhuk\"&gt;Farseer Corhuk&lt;/a&gt;) to help him seek vengeance by killing the Murkbloods. When the task was done, he asked the strangers if there were more heroes like them in the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;place where they came from&lt;/a&gt;. After recovering, Dranosh decided not to return to Garadar, as he believed that his destiny lay elsewhere. Upon hearing this, Farseer Corhuk stated \"The son is the father... May the spirits have mercy on those that stand in his way\".\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDranosh later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and reunited with his father, High Overlord Varok Saurfang. The two of them both joined the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde army that traveled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to battle the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Dranosh was given command over the Horde's vanguard, a task he accepted with great pride. Varok gifted his son with his &lt;a href=\"Saurfang%27s%20Battle%20Armor\"&gt;battle armor&lt;/a&gt; and axe and sent him to command the Horde's forces at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, the southern entrance to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Varok, who worried that the offensive's overlord &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was taking the Horde back to its &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;dark roots&lt;/a&gt;, hoped that the soldiers would emulate Dranosh's courage and tenacity rather than Garrosh's savagery. Dranosh served as his father's \"heart and strength\" in a place where he couldn't be, with Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s serving as his \"eyes and ears\".\nDranosh and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; commander &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; led separate campaigns against the Scourge, pushing into the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; toward Icecrown. Both commanders quickly realized that a victory for one faction was a victory for all against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. They began subtly coordinating their attacks against the Scourge and formed a grudging mutual respect for each other. Dranosh at one point led his forces against the undead &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, blocking off their tunnels into the Dragonblight. Both factions eventually reached the Wrathgate, where Dranosh commanded the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Vanguard\"&gt;Kor'kron Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; and kept a truce with the Alliance until the siege of the citadel began.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, Dranosh led the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; to the front line and fought the Scourge alongside Bolvar until the Lich King himself emerged from the citadel. Dranosh charged him, but the Lich King killed the orc with a single blow from &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, shattering his axe and stealing his soul.\nThe Scourge subsequently recovered Dranosh's corpse and brought it into the citadel. After the battle, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; asked Horde adventurers to bring the orc's shattered armor back to his father. Varok was pained by Dranosh's death but told adventurers not to mourn him, for he had died a hero just like his uncle &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;. He added that the armor would be placed upon the boy's funeral pyre at the &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Grounds\"&gt;Ancestral Grounds&lt;/a&gt; in Nagrand. Shortly after, Varok joined &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, during which the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; urged the spirits of wind to carry the Horde's song of war to Dranosh. At the end of the battle, Thrall told Varok \"I'm sorry about your boy\". During a journey from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and Garrosh stopped at the Wrathgate to pay homage to Dranosh. At Warsong Hold, Thrall once again offered his condolences to Varok. The older Saurfang replied that Dranosh had died honorably defending his people and that his spirit would be avenged when the Lich King was defeated.\nFall of the Lich King.\nIn Icecrown Citadel, the Lich King raised Dranosh into undeath as &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;Deathbringer Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, his most powerful &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. One of the visions in the &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; encounter shows the Lich King torturing an &lt;a href=\"Immolated%20Champion\"&gt;Immolated Champion&lt;/a&gt; in the company of a &lt;a href=\"Turned%20Champion\"&gt;Turned Champion&lt;/a&gt;\u2014visions of Bolvar and Dranosh, respectively.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; assaulted Icecrown Citadel, they encountered Deathbringer Saurfang guarding the entrance to the upper reaches of the citadel. Dranosh was forced to fight against his former allies, and they were forced to vanquish him. Varok was heartbroken when he learned what had become of his son. Even members of the Alliance sympathized with him, so malicious and brutal was the torment inflicted on his beloved boy. Varok claimed his son's body and promised to give him a proper funeral in Nagrand.\nAftermath and legacy.\nAfter dressing Dranosh's body in simple garments from &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the place he had known as a boy\u2014Varok cremated his son on a pyre near the resting places of the boy's &lt;a href=\"Remda\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saurfang\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; in Nagrand. As the funeral was his boy's final honor, Varok made himself watch the flames consume his child until only ash remained. Varok subsequently wore his son's necklace with him as a reminder.\n&lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; later told Varok that his son had died a hero and that what Varok had wrought at &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; honored Dranosh's memory. According to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Dranosh and all the other Horde soldiers lost during the war would have \"&lt;a href=\"lok%27vadnod\"&gt;lok'vadnod&lt;/a&gt;s\" composed in their honor. Shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; prepared to leave for Nagrand in order to learn more about the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;. As such, he was unable to retain his position of &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; and began to consider a temporary successor. Thrall privately bemoaned that Dranosh would have been the perfect candidate for the title, having inherited his father's might and wisdom. In the end, he picked Garrosh for the position instead. Years later, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reflected that Cairne Bloodhoof's subsequent death and many conflicts between the Alliance and Horde might have been avoided if Dranosh had lived and become warchief instead of Garrosh.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, which was constructed outside Orgrimmar after the Cataclysm, was named in honor of the young Saurfang.\nDuring Garrosh's trial at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, the accuser &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; called on Varok as a witness and wanted to show the court a vision of Dranosh's death, stating that she wanted them to fully understand the loss he'd endured, but the defender &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; protested that this would only cause needless pain to Varok. The judge &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; agreed and pointed out that the Lich King was not the one on trial, after which Tyrande withdrew her request.\nThe night before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Varok thought of his son and left Dranosh's necklace in a fireplate as he was prepared to claim his own death. While walking towards the Alliance encampment, he was stopped by &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; who returned him the slightly burned necklace and convinced him to live another day. During the battle, when Varok protested against &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;' use of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; against the Alliance, she mockingly told him that he could die his warrior's death and get the chance to say hello to his son. Varok was ultimately killed in a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;mak'gora against Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. During his funeral, Thrall stated that the High Overlord could now greet his son with honor and glory.\nAs part of a bargain with Zekhan, the death &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; later showed the troll a vision of Varok reunited with Dranosh and Remda in a blissful afterlife where father and son could hunt &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt; together across the grasslands of Draenor. Unbeknownst to Zekhan, the vision was a lie.\nHowever, years later, Varok's soul did in fact manage to find and reunite with his family in the afterlife.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Some believe the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; himself designed it for his most powerful &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, while others feel it is a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; brought to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during one of the great wars and lost by its original owner.

If picked up by a creature that is not evil, it acts as a light steel shield but its powers slowly attempt to convert the bearer to the cause of evil. Each time he slays an enemy in battle, the shield's owner may shift toward evil. The change is so subtle that the owner might not even be aware that anything unusual is happening. Should the owner be evil or convert at last to that alignment, the shield's true nature becomes known. To the owner, it now appears to be covered with skulls that bear demonic horns and sharp canine teeth, and its true powers are unlocked."}

It is the stronghold of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; empire within the area. Besides the wide variety of plant and marine life there are also many mysterious wonders such as &lt;a href=\"Nespirah\"&gt;Nespirah&lt;/a&gt;. This zone is home to the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Ruins of Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. Players will learn about the ruins, and what befell them, as well as interesting factoids about &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;'s mother.\nHistory.\nThe Shimmering Expanse does not have much of a history when it was far below the ocean's surface, at least no known recorded history.\nGetting there.\nPlayers make their way to the Shimmering Expanse as part of the overall Vashj'ir quest progression that begins in the &lt;a href=\"Kelp%27thar%20Forest\"&gt;Kelp'thar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The quest &lt;a href=\"Across%20the%20Great%20Divide\"&gt;Across the Great Divide&lt;/a&gt; has players swim across the abyss into the cave opening that leads into the Shimmering Expanse. The cave mouth is located to the west of the &lt;a href=\"Clutch\"&gt;Clutch&lt;/a&gt; in the Kelp'thar Forest, across the &lt;a href=\"Lightless%20Reaches\"&gt;Lightless Reaches&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Shimmering Expanse is a large piece of southern Vashj'ir. It consists of mainly the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Vashj%27ir\"&gt;ancient city of Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; now in ruins, as well as the demi-god &lt;a href=\"Nespirah\"&gt;Nespirah&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are plenty of caves with air pockets in them that act as quest hubs for players.\nThe wildlife of the Shimmering Expanse is incredibly diverse. A plethora of Coral jut from the walls and floor of the zone with notable species including Brain Coral and Fan Coral. Various species of kelp are also present though not in the numbers or magnificence that they possess in the neighboring Kelp'thar Forest. Starfish dot the floor ranging in color from pale yellow to bright pink. Crabs are perhaps the dominant organism on the sea floor, wandering almost everywhere in the zone with the notable exception of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Grotto\"&gt;Shimmering Grotto&lt;/a&gt;. Giant isopods and snails can also be found on various cliffs and coral ledges though they are in their greatest numbers in the area around the demigod &lt;a href=\"Nespirah\"&gt;Nespirah&lt;/a&gt;.\nTube worms are also present and are most notable in the &lt;a href=\"Glimmerdeep%20Gorge\"&gt;Glimmerdeep Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. Solitary fish and schools of fish are omnipresent, sometimes so thick that they can block the view. &lt;a href=\"Shark\"&gt;Shark&lt;/a&gt;s are also commonly seen swimming around in the more open areas starting a few yards above the sea floor, though some swim mere feet above the floor. &lt;a href=\"Hammerhead%20shark\"&gt;Hammerhead shark&lt;/a&gt;s are only found in the Glimmerdeep Gorge. Eels are also present and mostly reside on various coral and sand cliffs.\nNotable characters.\nIn the Shimmering Expanse, players will encounter visions of the past, revealing necessary information about the great battle that took place at the Ruins of Vashj'ir. This includes information about Queen of the Naga, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. Players also take control of a mysterious naga known as the &lt;a href=\"Naz%27jar%20Battlemaiden\"&gt;Naz'jar Battlemaiden&lt;/a&gt;, in the service of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sira%27kess\"&gt;Lady Sira'kess&lt;/a&gt;. \nPlayers also encounter the Earthen Ring shaman, &lt;a href=\"Erunak%20Stonespeaker\"&gt;Erunak Stonespeaker&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Earthen Ring shaman &lt;a href=\"Earthmender%20Duarn\"&gt;Earthmender Duarn&lt;/a&gt; whom they help to free &lt;a href=\"Nespirah\"&gt;Nespirah&lt;/a&gt; from the naga.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Intelligent and resourceful, they travel across the dunes in caravans and survive by scavenging and trading. Though long hunted and enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless empire&lt;/a&gt;, the vulpera found the strength to fight back after being aided by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in Vol'dun and have now pledged their loyalty to the Horde.\nSome vulpera can also be found across the sea, most notably as members of the &lt;a href=\"Bilge%20Rats\"&gt;Bilge Rats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; crew in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe vulpera have lived in Vol'dun as free traders and merchants for countless generations. For much of that time, they have been oppressed by the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;, who have enslaved countless vulpera over the years and forced them to work and fight for them. The vulpera are mostly a passive people and as such never found the ability to stop the sethrak. At least one caravan tried to fight back, but they met only with defeat.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nNear the start of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the vulpera &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; formed a plan to take the fight to the sethrak. She warned her caravan leader &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; that the sethrak would eventually attack and that the vulpera needed to make a preemptive strike against the snakemen, but Kiro insisted that the vulpera keep their heads down and continue to quietly do business. Not long after, a force of Faithless led by &lt;a href=\"Fangcaller%20Sraka\"&gt;Fangcaller Sraka&lt;/a&gt; attacked the caravan at what is now the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Burrows\"&gt;Abandoned Burrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after, a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt; flew to Vol'dun to search for Kaja's missing superior &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt; and acquire her evidence that &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; was a traitor to the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The group was shot out of the sky by the Faithless' ruler &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Emperor Korthek&lt;/a&gt;, but the vulpera came to their aid: Kaja was found by &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; and brought to the &lt;a href=\"Vulpera%20Hideaway\"&gt;Vulpera Hideaway&lt;/a&gt; while Nisha rescued the adventurer from Faithless captivity in the Abandoned Burrows and brought them to the hideaway as well. After healing Kaja, Kiro agreed to provide the outsiders safe passage through the desert in exchange for the adventurer helping the vulpera with some tasks. Kiro subsequently sent Meerah to retrieve some supplies from the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;Port of Zem'lan&lt;/a&gt; in the south in order to begin putting Nisha's plan into action, with Kaja and the adventurer accompanying Meerah to search for Rakera along the way.\nKaja and the adventurer eventually found Rakera and\u2014after crossing paths with Kiro and Nisha in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt;\u2014joined forces with &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of sethrak opposed to the Faithless. Meanwhile, the vulpera traveled north, took over &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Vorrik's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, and began taking the fight to the Faithless, with Kiro and Nisha liberating vulpera slaves while Meerah organized caravans to carry them to safety. Shortly after, Vorrik and the Horde adventurer embarked on a mission to kill Emperor Korthek and stumbled across the vulpera at the sanctum. Vorrik was initially surprised but concluded that &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;his loa&lt;/a&gt; would approve of helping innocents in need and that the vulpera would be useful allies that could help distract the Faithless. The adventurer subsequently joined Nisha in killing Faithless around the &lt;a href=\"Crater%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Crater of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt; and arming vulpera slaves to help them rise up against their oppressors. While the freed vulpera marched through the trenches, sowing chaos, Vorrik and the hero rode on the back of &lt;a href=\"Rakjan%20the%20Unbroken\"&gt;Rakjan the Unbroken&lt;/a&gt; to rain destruction down on the Faithless before landing in &lt;a href=\"Skycallers%27%20Spire\"&gt;Skycallers' Spire&lt;/a&gt; and joining up with Nisha's forces. They soon forced Korthek to emerge from his &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;underground temple&lt;/a&gt;, and together, Nisha, Vorrik, and the hero killed the emperor. Afterward, Kiro stated that the adventurer had proven themselves a true ally and would always be welcome in the caravan.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Lastwind\"&gt;Camp Lastwind&lt;/a&gt;, a vulpera caravan led by &lt;a href=\"Norah\"&gt;Norah&lt;/a&gt; planned to become the first to successfully steal treasure from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s in the Port of Zem'lan. Adventurers were sent into the port to look for a &lt;a href=\"Meeki\"&gt;missing vulpera scout&lt;/a&gt; but instead ended up helping &lt;a href=\"First%20Mate%20Jamboya\"&gt;First Mate Jamboya&lt;/a&gt; commit mutiny against the port's tyrannical ruler, &lt;a href=\"Pirate-King%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;Pirate-King Zem'lan&lt;/a&gt;. With their arms full of stolen booty, Jamboya and his fellow mutineers then accompanied the adventurer back to Camp Lastwind, where they convinced Norah to let them join the caravan in exchange for helping them ransack the rest of the port's treasure. Similarly, at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Zak%27rajan\"&gt;Court of Zak'rajan&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers helped a scavenging crew consisting of &lt;a href=\"Kenzou\"&gt;Kenzou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Omi\"&gt;Omi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tacha\"&gt;Tacha&lt;/a&gt; defeat &lt;a href=\"Zak%27rajan%20the%20Undying\"&gt;Zak'rajan the Undying&lt;/a&gt; and plunder his treasure trove of powerful artifacts. In the southern parts of Vol'dun, the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; enslaved a number of vulpera and forced them to mine &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Redrock%20Mines\"&gt;Redrock Mines&lt;/a&gt;. The vulpera &lt;a href=\"Keerin\"&gt;Keerin&lt;/a&gt; tasked adventurers with liberating him and his fellow captives.\nThe vulpera's knowledge about mountain routes let the Zandalari Vol'dun expedition get back to Dazar'alor before most sethrak invaders.\nTides of Vengeance.\nThe Horde later hired vulpera caravans to help transport supplies for &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;their war&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. During the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Vol%27dun\"&gt;assault on Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; began incinerating the caravans in the hope of stopping the shipments and dissuading the fox people from doing any more jobs for the Horde. Incensed by these attacks, Nisha asked Horde adventurers to defend her people and fight back against the Alliance invaders.\nAfter the Alliance killed the Zandalari ruler &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, Kiro attended the king's funeral and stated that the vulpera would do what they could to help the Zandalari.\nJoining the Horde.\nWith the Horde having shown them that there is more to life than mere survival, the vulpera eventually decided to join the faction in order to explore the world beyond Vol'dun. Kiro, Meerah, and Nisha traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, but he was forced to decline giving them membership as troubles in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; had stretched the Horde's resouces thin and he could not agree to add new members to their ranks while their current allies were struggling. The vulpera decided to offer their help in order to prove their worth to the Horde: Kiro traveled to the Highlands to quell a &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt; revolt near &lt;a href=\"Crushblow\"&gt;Crushblow&lt;/a&gt;, Nisha headed to Zuldazar to fend off an invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Nazeshi\"&gt;Nazeshi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and Meerah journeyed to Suramar to get the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; production back on track. With the help of the adventurer, the vulpera were able to solve the Horde's problems, impressing Baine's allies. When the three vulpera returned to Orgrimmar, Baine realized that he had been wrong to dismiss them so quickly and offered them a place in the Horde, which they gladly accepted. Thus the vulpera became allies of the Horde, giving them a home beyond the dunes.\nCulture.\nThe vulpera are a keen and intelligent race of nomadic scavengers. They are capable of turning what they find into opportunities to thrive and are skilled at solving problems, no matter their size. Despite their small stature, vulpera are fierce and cunning in battle, bringing down any enemy foolish enough to underestimate them. While they have permanent settlements in burrows, their caravans mostly travel from hideaway to hideaway, scavenging for supplies, trading them where they can, and spreading information they pick up along the way. Their scavenging often takes the form of looting artifacts and treasure from ancient ruins and selling them to the highest bidder. Dwelling in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, the vulpera can't afford to waste resources. Over time, they have learned to take anything that looks even remotely useful and be creative using what they have, and they have learned to recognize value wherever it hides in the desert. When warned that gold from the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;Port of Zem'lan&lt;/a&gt; was cursed, &lt;a href=\"Norah\"&gt;Norah&lt;/a&gt; replied that \"A little curse never kept the vulpera from a worthy treasure\". According to &lt;a href=\"Keerin\"&gt;Keerin&lt;/a&gt;, vulpera generally stay away from &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; due to its volatility. However, at least some of the fox people only see Azerite fragments as \"neat power rocks\" and don't mind pocketing them.\nVulpera show a knack for &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, using potions and elixirs for a variety of effects. &lt;a href=\"%3AVol%27dunshine\"&gt;:Vol'dunshine&lt;/a&gt; is a type of vulpera-made desert hooch brewed during desert travel and stored in dried gourds.\nVulpera use &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;s as mounts, &lt;a href=\"alpaca\"&gt;alpaca&lt;/a&gt;s as draft animals that pull their caravans through the desert, &lt;a href=\"buzzard\"&gt;buzzard&lt;/a&gt;s as &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt; mounts, and &lt;a href=\"ferret\"&gt;ferret&lt;/a&gt;s as common pets.\nVulpera commonly use idioms that refer to the desert, such as \"Hot sands\" (an exclamation) or \"Thank the sands\". Other sayings include \"Home is where the wagon is\", \"One broken wheel stops the caravan\", and \"having a yip of a time\". One vulpera gesture of thanks apparently consists of licking the other person on the cheek.\nVulpera caravans are composed of both families and also individuals with no family, acting as a sort of chosen family. Some vulpera are referred to as \"Elders\" and vulpera reach adulthood upon a certain age. Each caravan has a Wailing Bone, which is a bone of a dead vulpera inscribed with a poem in an ancient script. This bone lead the caravan to the final resting place of a vulpera who has died, allowing the spirit of the bone to help the dead cross the veil.\nSpeculation.\nOne of the various demigods that participated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; was described as \"a tiny red fox with a sly yet &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; visage [scurrying] between the legs of the giants\". It may have been related to the vulpera.\nGiven they were once enslaved by the sethrak, who are based on the Bedouin tribes, and later rebelled, this history is parallel the by the Imazighen against the Arab tribes of North Africa, and other subsequent acts of resistance.\nThe collaboration of the Zandalari in their resistance reflects historical Sub-Saharan African support of Amazigh agency."}

She is hostile to players and flies about 40-100 yards off the ground. In order to tag and kill her, the player must either fly through her and drag her to a nearby ledge on one of the mountains, or attack and use slow fall or use a &lt;a href=\"Snowfall%20Lager\"&gt;Snowfall Lager&lt;/a&gt; to slow fall to the ground. However, take caution, as she will use Frost Breath as the main attack. It is a 30-yard range ability that deals 1500-2100 damage and slows the target for about 3 seconds. Frost Breath is interruptible.\nDeath Knights have it easier; they can land on a nearby ledge or cliff and use Death Grip to pull her over if she is close enough. If not, get as close to the ground as possible with Death Grip in range and pull her down, minimizing damage taken.\nRelation to the Time-Lost Proto Drake.\nVyragosa is said to share spawn points and timers with the &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Proto%20Drake\"&gt;Time-Lost Proto Drake&lt;/a&gt;, another level 80 Rare in the Storm peaks. While Vyragosa and the Time-Lost Proto Drake share spawn timers and points, the Drake is suspected to be a \"Rare spawn\" off of Vyragosa and has a small chance to spawn in Vyragosa's place. The spawn timer is said to be anywhere from 6\u201324 hours, although there are unconfirmed instances of the spawn timer to be less than 6 hours, but never more than 24. The spawn time is randomly chosen.\nVyragosa and the Time-Lost Proto Drake spawn at various points around the Storm Peaks, with 4 confirmed paths around the Temple of Storms, around Frosthold, over Ulduar, the Terrace of the Makers and the Engine of the Makers, and through Brunnhildar and the Foot Steppes.

In truth, he is just a mortal man, albeit one of great power and influence. Vyral maintains his grand facade by destroying all records of his history.\nAccording to a few fragmentary accounts, there was born to a wealthy family of the Eastern Kingdoms a child who was plagued by nightmares. Now this is not unusual for the time, but as the child grew his nightmares became worse. What's more, eventually his nightmares manifested in the real world.\nHis parents consulted priests of the Holy Light and they suspected that the nightmares were of extraplanar origin. Around the same time, the young man was seen with outlanders who dressed in purple. Before the priests could ascertain what afflicted the youth, he disappeared, as did the strangers in purple. It would seem the boy was inducted into the Twilight's Hammer, possibly of his own volition.\nBased on these and other details, it is believed that the boy in question grew up to be Vyral the Vile. Regardless of his origins, it is known that the Vyral is not just the cult leader of the Twilight's Run sect in Silithus, but also the current leader of the entire cult. On one hand Vyral is intelligent and diplomatic, on the other he thoroughly insane and cruel beyond measure \u2014 all traits necessary to gain power in the Twilight's Hammer. Vyral dresses in the manner of a high arcanist; his face is ever concealed beneath a hood, save for his glowing red eyes."}

Along with her brethren, she rejected the gift of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and turned to the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s instead, becoming an incarnation of frost. However, after being freed from imprisonment and realizing that the Primal Incarnates' goals are not as noble as she once believed, Vyranoth defected to siding with Azeroth's defenders, reconciling with her old friend &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza, the Life-Binder&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nWhile the proto-dragons who would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; accepted the gift of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, the proto-dragons who would become the Primal Incarnates rejected it. Tensions rose between the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; who wished to cleanse the world of the titans' \"stain\" and the dragonflights, breaking out into open rebellion about 20,000 years ago when &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; struck first by leading an assault on &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; army on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. In the battle, she destroyed &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, the titan relic which Neltharion was using to control the dracthyr. This caused Neltharion to give in to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time and use their power to seal her away within the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nA cataclysmic conflict ensued between Primalists and dragonflights known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Scaleborn\"&gt;War of the Scaleborn&lt;/a&gt;. Vyranoth and &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; were ever loyal to the Incarnate's ideals, but Iridikron truly embraced the war. At the end, he struck terrible bargains to keep their cause alive. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes the other incarnates never knew the true depths of his depravity. Despite the Primalists' alliance with the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; to end the dragons' reign, the remaining Primal Incarnates were ultimately defeated, but Alexstrasza, having failed to restore peace between the two groups, still couldn't bear to kill them given they had once been as close as clutch-mates, and decided to imprison them instead, within the titanic &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\n20,000 years later, &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth the Storm-Eater&lt;/a&gt; schemed to release her kin from the Vault. Though Raszageth died, she succeeded in her endeavor, and &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;, and Vyranoth were released. Seeing how Raszageth's haste led to her downfall, Alexstrasza speculated that the Incarnates would take their time to gather their strengths first, and that Iridikron's mastery of the earth would harbor them in the meantime.\nFyrakk was eager to take revenge for their sister, but Iridikron did not want to rush in and believed they needed to even the scales with the Aspects first. The Incarnates adventured to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; as the last echoes of Raszageth's storm faded, where they breached an ancient vault belonging to &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and found a device that would give them the location of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, the Earth-Warder's secret underground. They had no interest in the laboratory of &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt; itself, but in the molten fire that could be found below. &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; followed behind them secretly to claim Neltharion's legacy.\nThey found one of the hidden entry points to Zaralek right below &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, where they broke through the ground and sent Fyrakk down, blazing through the earth, to claim the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; power below and wake the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;'s Elders at the &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Caldera\"&gt;Zaqali Caldera&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, Vyranoth met with her old friend &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;. During this Vyranoth reflected on how Alexstrasza spoke to her after her imprisonment, recalling how the Dragon Queen had said that it \"didn't feel like a victory without her.\" However, Vyranoth was enraged, recalling how Alexstrasza promised how to not force the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan's&lt;/a&gt; will upon them and then did nothing when they warped the children, still in the shell of their eggs. In response, Alexstrasza declared that it was an abhorrent act that never should have occurred and that she regretted her part in it every day. She then mentioned that while Vyranoth had always fought for the good of dragonkind, Iridikron did not and simply craved vengeance. However Vyranoth was unmoved, called her na\u00efve, declared that all that remained was vengeance, and departed.\nAfter the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; departed and left the war against the Aspects to Fyrakk and Vyranoth. However, Vyranoth grew weary of Fyrakk as he had become increasingly more and more unhinged; setting his sights on the nascent world tree, &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The two even briefly clashed when Fyrakk tried to burn &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt;, as she was more focused on removing the titans' iron grip on this world over causing harm to their enemies. Some time after this, the two reunited at &lt;a href=\"Lunedane\"&gt;Lunedane&lt;/a&gt;, where she discovered that Fyrakk had struck a bargain with the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, where they agreed to open the way to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; on the condition that Fyrakk ensured that they would become immortal. However, she was displeased and feared that the Primalists were losing sight of their goals, a concern that Fyrakk waved away as he revealed that there was something he wanted her to see. She was subsequently shocked to see that the druids of the flame and Fyrakk using their fire magics and the &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt &lt;a href=\"Larodar\"&gt;Keeper Larodar&lt;/a&gt; and learned that Fyrakk that intended to do the same to Amirdrassil, a notion that disgusted her as she wanted to deny the aspects their prize and not twist it into some vile abomination. Fyrakk was unmoved and declared that they couldn't win the war bound by her ideals. In response, Vyranoth declared that the course was set and the pair departed from Lunedane.\nVyranoth then made her way to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, where upon being stopped by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Drine\"&gt;Captain Drine&lt;/a&gt; demanded to speak with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the Dragon Queen's arrival, Vyranoth revealed that Fyrakk intended to not destroy the World Tree as the Aspects thought, but to claim its power as his own as a reflection of his heart which has become cruel, blazing with insatiable malice, and wreathed in shadow. After denouncing him as her brother, Vyranoth prepared to depart when Alexstrasza implored her to stand by their side. Astonished by such a request, she demanded to know why she should, to which Alexstrasza pointed out that she was a protector of his world while acknowledging her own past failings and asked that she stand with them for all of &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkind&lt;/a&gt;. After a moment, Vyranoth wordlessly followed Alexstrasza silently agreeing to her old friend's request.\nVyranoth was ultimately persuaded to join forces with Alexstrasza and Dream's defenders after realizing that the Primalists have lost their way. To help protect the emerging World Tree from Fyrakk's blazing forces, Vyranoth worked with Wrathion in bringing together more defenders such as the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20drake\"&gt;Storm Drakes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt;. The Netherwing dragons were persuaded to help defend Amirdrassil after Vyranoth offered them a place to live on the Dragon Isles, away from the dangers of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, but the Storm Drakes proved more challenging as the majority of the Thorignir brood refused Alexstrasza's call because &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, whom they swore fealty to, forbid them from leaving his domain. Infuriated that the Prime Designate is denying the Storm Drakes a choice, Vyranoth accompanied Wrathion and an adventurer to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. After proving their strength to enter, Vyranoth nearly came to battle with &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; but the Val'kyr allowed them to pass, convinced that their intentions were noble, leading the Frozenheart to state she had more honor than Odyn. Confronting the Prime Designate, Vyranoth denounces Odyn for his hypocrisy and lies, as the keeper once claimed that dragons were unfit as protectors of the world yet forced dragons to serve him. Odyn still refused to yield but Vyranoth would end their battle quickly by trapping the keeper in ice, humiliating him. Addressing the Storm Drakes, Vyranoth proclaimed they are free to choose their own path and not be bound to an unworthy keeper, offering them a home on the Dragon Isles and a new beginning. The Storm Drakes agreed, following Vyranoth to their ancestral home, leaving Odyn behind, still imprisoned in ice.\nWith their forces gathered and the blooming about to begin, Vyranoth would lend her aid in protecting Amirdrassil from Fyrakk and his minions. However, with the combined strength of Azeroth's heroes and leaders, Fyrakk's forces were routed. In desperation, Fyrakk broke through the temple leading to the World Tree's core himself, leading to a final confrontation between the Primal Incarnate and the dream's protectors. Despite Fyrakk's power, his fiery axe, &lt;a href=\"Fyr%27alath%2C%20the%20Dream%20Render\"&gt;Fyr'alath, the Dream Render&lt;/a&gt;, and being empowered by Shadowflame, he was defeated once and for all, allowing Amirdrassil's blooming to complete, launching a massive surge of power to all present, re-empowering the Aspects. Vyranoth herself was also empowered by the surge, matching the Aspects, but noted that the power she felt was not the titan's Order magic but Azeroth's magic. In this, Alexstrasza understands that for Dragonkind to survive, it was never about reclaiming their aspectral powers, for they weren't theirs to take, but it was about coming together as a family. Acknowledging that while the titans granted them power, it divided dragonkind, Vyranoth adds that by uniting for a cause greater than themselves, Azeroth's gift has made them whole again at last. With these lessons, old and new, Vyranoth stands by Alexstrasza's proclamation that they use their power to protect their world, as Her aspects.\nFollowing the defense of Amirdrassil and Fyrakk's death, Vyranoth would take her place as the sixth Dragon Aspect, giving the primal dragons and other various flights a voice as the Aspect of Storms. However, Vyranoth would inform Azeroth's champions that she had received a message from Iridikron himself, requesting a parlay with her alone. She agreed and meeting with the Stonescaled in the snowy mountains of Valdrakken, Iridikron condemned Vyranoth for abandoning the Primalists' war but Vyranoth countered that Iridikron abandoned the war and Fyrakk to his death for some \"trinket\" that Neltharion left behind. Iridikron clarified that the \"Dark Heart\" is no trinket and it was now in the hands of the Harbinger. Vyranoth voiced her disgust towards Iridikron for his willingness to use the Void, stating that its power cannot be trusted. Iridikron, unmoved, stated that he trusted the Void's hunger to aid him in removing the Titan's \"stain\" from their world before giving Vyranoth one last chance to join his cause. The former Frozenheart answered by proclaiming that she would have no part in his war leaving the Stonescaled disappointed and angered, stating that the bond of the Incarnates are truly at an end. Iridikron took his leave but not before giving Vyranoth a final warning to stay out of his way.\nQuotes.\nFyrakk's assault on the Emerald Dream must be stopped.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Originally known as Baron Vyraz, he served under &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Krexus\"&gt;Margrave Krexus&lt;/a&gt; as one of the house's two barons, but later revealed himself to be a traitor working with the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; and their allies, killed Krexus, and took control of the house. He subsequently stationed himself with &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, but was slain by &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; and her allies during the &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s' attack on &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAgainst the Constructs.\nAs a baron of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, Vyraz earned countless victories for Maldraxxus, but he was long secretly in league with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;. At some point he betrayed his fellow baron &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and trapped him in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, but he kept up appearances with the Chosen and continued to serve alongside Mograine's replacement, &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, Draka sent them to report to Vyraz and prepare for war with the rival houses. Vyraz tasked the Maw Walker with rooting out spies among the Chosen ranks and deliver orders to &lt;a href=\"Head%20Summoner%20Perex\"&gt;Head Summoner Perex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drill%20Sergeant%20Telice\"&gt;Drill Sergeant Telice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Secutor%20Mevix\"&gt;Secutor Mevix&lt;/a&gt;. After the Maw Walker obtained &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;a runeblade&lt;/a&gt; with runes corresponding to those on the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Krexus\"&gt;Margrave Krexus&lt;/a&gt; sent the outsider, Draka, and Vyraz to investigate the Seat. The blade proved to be a key to the fortress, but Vyraz insisted that unlocking the Seat wouldn't do the Chosen any good if they lost the war against the other houses. He told the Maw Walker to report to him at the &lt;a href=\"Spearhead%20%28Maldraxxus%29\"&gt;Spearhead&lt;/a&gt;, where the Chosen were mounting a defense against the House of Constructs' vanguard. Vyraz advocated for a reckless full-scale assault on the Constructs, claiming that the sacrifice of Chosen soldiers was the price of victory. The Maw Walker and Secutor Mevix managed to push back the constructs and secure a forward position, after which Vyraz ordered them to launch a direct attack on the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Constructs' stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring Mevix's protests that they needed more reinforcements. The subsequent attack resulted in most of the Chosen forces being killed and Mevix and the Maw Walker getting captured, but they later managed to fight their way out and return to the Seat of the Primus.\nBetraying Krexus.\nWhile Draka and the Maw Walker were away, Vyraz worked with the House of Constructs to launch a fierce attack on the House of the Chosen and kill Margrave Krexus. When Draka and the hero returned, he blamed the attack on the Constructs. Draka argued that the Chosen now had to open the Seat of the Primus if they were to have any hope of victory, but Vyraz insisted that the Seat was a fool's errand and that the Chosen instead had to gather their mightiest soldiers. He sent the Maw Walker to rescue the missing Alexandros Mograine from the Maw, believing that the hero wouldn't survive the journey. The Maw Walker defied the baron's expectations by successfully rescuing Mograine, who revealed that Vyraz was a traitor.\nWhile Draka returned to the Seat of the Primus to warn their allies, Alexandros and the hero returned to the House of the Chosen to confront Vyraz, an act which ignited the final rune on the Maw Walker's blade. When Vyraz emerged, he declared that he claimed the mantle of margrave and that he would take the runeblade from the hero's corpse. Vyraz and his guards began overpowering Alexandros and the hero, but Draka interrupted the battle to bring her two allies to defend the Seat of the Primus from the Constructs and Vyraz's Chosen. The Maw Walker used the completed runeblade to open the door into the Seat and cause the Primus' power to cut a swath of destruction through Vyraz's forces, forcing them to retreat.\nHowever, although the Maw Walker's allies won the battle, Vyraz remained in control of most of the Chosen, whom he enticed with promises of chaos and power. Now known as Margrave Vyraz, he later observed the fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt;. After the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the original instigator of Maldraxxus' unrest\u2014Alexandros reminded his &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt; allies that Vyraz still had to answer for his treachery.\nChains of Domination.\nVyraz and his loyalists openly sided with &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and moved to &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the Maw, a fortress held by the Jailer's servant &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;. Some of Vyraz's soldiers were unhappy with this move, but those who questioned him too openly were punished by being \"reassigned\". Vyraz himself spent most of his time with Helya in &lt;a href=\"Helgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Helgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the upper part of the fortress. During these events, he is once again called \"Baron\" Vyraz rather than \"Margrave\". No explanation is given for this change in title.\nAfter the return of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, he declared that the covenants had to deal with Helya and Vyraz in order to continue holding their position in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;. He observed that the Jailer's lieutenants had grown lax in their sense of safety and sent Draka, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and a Maw Walker to carry out a quick surprise attack and \"cut the heads off [the] snakes\". While the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt; and the four covenants attacked lower Desmotaeron, Draka, Thrall, and the Maw Walker slipped into Helgarde Keep, where Vyraz was trying to convince Helya that they needed reinforcements.

He is one of the few non-dual-wielding Wrathguards. A battle with him can also be done after &lt;a href=\"Dalliah%20the%20Doomsayer\"&gt;Dalliah the Doomsayer&lt;/a&gt;, which is advisable because if you are very, very unlucky you might get kicked into her.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Millennia ago, Soccothrates held a position of honor among the Wrathguards, standing at the side of the Burning Legion's top commanders. Confinement did not suit his considerable ego. Neither did his cellmate.\"\nTanking Wrath-Scryer Soccothrates.\nWhen your party is ready, head in and immediately use Demoralizing Shout and Thunderclap. He is immune to Disarm, as most bosses are at this level. Start the Sunder spam and be sure to use Heroic Strike and Revenge whenever you can (remember: Heroic Strike is next attack, while Sunder is almost instant, so if you have enough rage, you can do both at the same time). Paladin tanks will want to lead off with Avengers Shield then Exorcism instantly, then be sure dump plenty of Consecrations while keeping Holy Shield up constantly. Repeat Exorcism every time it is available. This should generate plenty of aggro.\nWhen you engage him, you will want to put your back against a wall, and run right up against it. This will prevent you from being thrown far away on the \"Knock Away\" affect. When he does throw you, you will fly up, and fall down. After your character stands up, run up to him, and Taunt him. This will focus his attacks on you, namely his charge. The charge won't do much damage, and since no one should be standing there anyway, it will be perfectly safe. If you do have at least one melee class in your group, be sure to tell them to run when you're thrown in the air. After he charges, simple pull him to the other side of the room, and repeat the above steps.\nThis is a very easy fight if you use this technique, and it will save your party a lot of hassle, especially the runs between you and them in order for you to pick up the boss. Also note that this is extremely easy to do without fire resistance gear.\nComment: There is nothing special about sunder spam and this boss. Just use your normal tanking cycle with shield slam, revenge, sunder, devastate and heroic strike. Also, if you aren't tanking him back to a wall, you can use intervene to quickly close the gap between you and the boss. Remember your intervene! Paladins: Your Righteous Defense will work and pull him to you in almost every case. After he Charges, you can use Avengers Shield then Righteous Defense. Avengers Shield will snare him allowing your healer (possibly the target of a charge)time to get back in range while he come back to you."}

Knowing they could not possibly fight their way out, Maiev instead sent a &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf%20Runner\"&gt;Runner&lt;/a&gt; to get to the coast and then to the Night Elf forests, to summon reinforcements in the shape of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, whilst she and her remaining warriors held out against the snake-people's assault.

Without Maiev's aid, the Naga were eventually able to break the Night Elf defenses and force them to a final redoubt with no resources, where Maiev joined them for a &lt;a href=\"Balancing%20the%20Scales%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;last stand&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nThe Runner's Transport.\n\"The pressure of Illidan's Naga forces bears down heavily on Maiev's base. You must get to the Night Elf Transports quickly so that you can bring the Runner through the next leg of the journey out to sea. Protect the Runner at all costs; she is your only hope.\"\nEscape to the Sea.\n\"Only a few Naga defenses lie between the Runner and the open sea. Protect the Transport vessels as they pass through the dilapidated ruins, and get the Runner through the Pillars of Aszune. Once she has reached the safety of the ocean, Elune will see that she reaches Malfurion in time.\"\nOptional Quests.\nNaga Excavators.\n\"Your Watcher scouts have spotted several Naga excavation crews working on strange caves in the surrounding ruins. Kill the Excavators to deny Illidan the use of any powerful artifacts that they might hold.\"\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; was successful in capturing the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and in defeating Maiev's Sentinels. However, they failed to destroy them entirely, and were unable to stop the Warden's Runner reaching Kalimdor and informing Malfurion of his brother's actions, a development which would ultimately foil Illidan's plans against the Lich King and destroy the Eye of Sargeras for good.

This page contains a few of the many new monsters players will encounter as they venture deep into the forgotten lands and desolate wastes of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s domain.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20vizier\"&gt;Nerubian Vizier&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe half-&lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;, half-&lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vizier\"&gt;vizier&lt;/a&gt;s once served as advisors, &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt;s to the mighty &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spiderlord\"&gt;spiderlord&lt;/a&gt;s. But in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;, the tables turned, and in the vacuum of their collapsed society, the cunning viziers rose to power. Utilizing their sorcery and high intelligence, the viziers have emerged as the rulers of the nerubians' underground kingdom. \nIt is rumored that the viziers themselves may serve an unseen emperor, one who is destined to lead the ancient spider-people to a final victory over the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. While many can only speculate as to the existence of this nerubian emperor, some continue to investigate the link believed to exist between the nerubians and the vicious &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Plague%20eruptor\"&gt;Plague Eruptor&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlague eruptors are the latest experiment of the Lich King, designed to spread horror and chaos across the world of the living. These walking corpses have quickly earned a reputation as the most destructive of the Scourge army: hyper-violent, incredibly strong, and deceptively fast. The most terrifying weapons in the eruptors' arsenal are the myriad pulsing nodules that dominate their rotting skin. It is from these nodules that the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"plague\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; festers and bursts, insuring that wherever the eruptors go, they quickly spread the Lich King's apocalyptic contagion.\n&lt;a href=\"Shoveltusk\"&gt;Shoveltusk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe powerful and ferocious shoveltusk are easily identified by the massive curved antler which protrudes from their heads and the twin sloping tusks that extend from their jaw. The &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s use their tusks primarily to dig for food, whereas the antler makes for a fearsome ramming weapon in contests to establish dominance over other males. \nThe shoveltusk are territorial and will protect their feeding grounds with deadly force. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s traveling in Northrend would be wise to avoid these cantankerous and unpredictable beasts.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Iron Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; has scoured the far corners of the world, seeking to uncover the truth behind the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Now it seems they may be one step closer to unlocking the secrets of the past. \nThe latest clues come from ancient &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s within the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, where the iron dwarves were first encountered. Etched with &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s of power - and with lightning pulsing beneath their thick, metallic skin - they may represent the missing link between the dwarves and the legendary &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s of myth. Unfortunately the malevolent iron dwarves have openly defied the Explorers' League and seem intent on destroying any and all artifacts connecting them to the shadowed recesses of history.\n&lt;a href=\"Tuskarr\"&gt;Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the absence of any records documenting the tuskarr's past, many significant facts have recently come to light. The tuskarr are a kind-natured nomadic race that roams the southern coastlines of Northrend, guided by the carved cyclopean statues that mark their seasonal &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; routes. The tuskarr's tribal affiliation is evidenced by the sigils inscribed on their tusks, and although they are a peaceful race, they are constantly beset by the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; and an arctic race of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;-like creatures known as the &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt;. \nYet even their enemies marvel at the tuskarr's prowess and fearlessness in catching some of the most dangerous creatures in Northrend's frigid waters, including &lt;a href=\"whale\"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"giant%20squid\"&gt;giant squid&lt;/a&gt;. Not even the unnamed &lt;a href=\"leviathan\"&gt;leviathan&lt;/a&gt;s that lurk in the ocean's depths are beyond the tuskarr's reach. \nThe tuskarr have seen their share of difficult times, but with the recent arrivals of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, they have found new allies in the ongoing struggle against the hostile forces of Northrend.\n&lt;a href=\"Taunka\"&gt;Taunka&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis tenacious, stoic race knows all too well the rigors of living in the harsh and often deadly wastes of Northrend. Over time, the taunka - whom many believe to be ancestral cousins of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; - have adapted, but only by forcing the land and the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s to yield to their will. The taunka's relationship with &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;, unlike that of their tauren brethren, has been one of constant struggle and grim perseverance. \nAlthough the taunka may seem dour or even cold to outsiders, those who come to know them will soon recognize an embattled race of survivors characterized by colossal hearts and unshakable resolve.\n&lt;a href=\"Magnataur\"&gt;Magnataur&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagnataur have the torso of a &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; attached to the body of a &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;. This peculiar appearance has sparked speculation that their race might be related to &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"keepers%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt;. Many wonder if these races share a common ancestor, and some have even suggested &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; himself. \nThe notoriously long-lived magnataur are rumored to engage in cannibalism during times when food is scarce. Single males are known to control giant herds and produce sizable litters, but in the frigid, perilous wastes at the roof of the world, only the strongest and meanest survive. \nDespite their hostility to most races, the magnataur have become tolerant of the arctic &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, who follow the herds for safety and mutual benefit during long hunts. Although the redoubtable magnataur lead solitary lives, adventurers who cross paths with them quickly learn that it would have been wiser to stay at a safe distance.\n&lt;a href=\"Jormungar\"&gt;Jormungar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fiercely aggressive jormungar are a marvel of evolution, possessing rows of chisel-like teeth capable of boring through solid rock, as well as muscular, flattened bodies well adapted to rapid underground navigation. \nLegends tell of the nerubians' using the jormungar as creatures of labor, forcing them to carve massive tunnels through Northrend's subterranean ice and lay the groundwork for the nerubians' ancient civilization. With the fall of the nerubian empire, swarms of rogue jormungar ran amok, drilling through the region's permafrost, attacking surface dwellers, and devouring everything in their path.\n&lt;a href=\"Flesh%20giant\"&gt;Flesh Giant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe same dark sorcery used to command the Scourge's powerful &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s is utilized to even greater effect in the harsh and distant realm of Northrend. Here the Lich King has focused his malefic powers on flesh giants: nightmarish creatures that make abominations look tame by comparison. Scourge minions assemble flesh giants and abominations in a similar manner, piecing them together out of body parts from numerous corpses. Unlike abominations, though, the \"spare parts\" used to create flesh giants are harvested from multiple types of fearsome Northrend giants. \nThese living battering rams employ tremendous brute strength in carrying out the inexorable will of their loathsome master. Those who oppose the flesh giants take their lives into their own hands... and risk a fate even worse than death.\n&lt;a href=\"Wendigo\"&gt;Wendigo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough rarely seen, the wendigo's existence is evidenced by the fierce, primal roars that echo across Northrend's mist-shrouded peaks. Many believe these reclusive, cannibalistic creatures are the primordial cousins of the wendigo that populate the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe wendigo of Northrend dwell in bone-littered caves and venture out only to hunt. They are ferocious and aggressively defend their lairs, food supply, and young from any perceived threat. Adventurers who do not wish to be added to the wendigo's bone-mounds would be wise to run at the sound of their savage bellows.\n&lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;although a part of the list, info was never implemented&gt;\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Ice Troll&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;although a part of the list, info was never implemented&gt;\"\n&lt;a href=\"Proto-dragon\"&gt;Proto-Dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;although a part of the list, info was never implemented&gt;\"\n=Sources=\nThe bestiary can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20080828111415/http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/wrath/features/bestiary/index.xml\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;http://web.archive.org/&lt;/a&gt;.

It answered questions about the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; class prior to . \nArticle.\nDesign Team: Q&amp;A.\nWorld of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King will add a new option to the game's class roster with the introduction of the first hero class, the necromantic death knight. During the Second and Third Wars, the people of Azeroth learned to fear these merciless, unholy opponents and their terrifying powers. Leading legions of the undead into battle during the Third War, the Lich King's death knights proved both their strength and their cunning on several occasions, making them an invaluable part of the Scourge army.\nIn Wrath of the Lich King, you will be able to pick up a runeblade, don some plate armor, and wreak serious havoc using both melee abilities and offensive magic. To give you an early glimpse at the design philosophy behind the new class, we sat down with the World of Warcraft design team to talk about the role the death knight will play in the expansion's story as well as in its gameplay, and to get their thoughts about goals and ideas for the new class.\nThe biggest news at this year's BlizzCon was the announcement of World of Warcraft's next expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, which will introduce the game's first hero class, the death knight. What made you choose this particular class?\n\"The death knights you will be able to play are no longer allied with the Lich King; instead, they have joined forces with the Horde or the Alliance to fight against Arthas.\"\nOne of the things we knew very early on during development of Wrath of the Lich King was that we wanted to add an entirely new class to the existing ones. We actually considered several other class candidates before we decided on the death knight, but we felt that this was the perfect fit for the theme of Wrath of the Lich King for a lot of reasons.\nSince the expansion is set in Northrend and you'll be fighting the Lich King, it makes sense to add a class that is directly connected to the coming conflict. The death knights you will be able to play are no longer allied with the Lich King; instead, they have joined forces with the Horde or the Alliance to fight against Arthas. So by playing a death knight, you're engaged in the story of Wrath of the Lich King right from the start, which makes the death knight a logical class choice for the expansion from a lore point of view. And since we're designing this class to be able to fill a tanking role in groups, death knights will also be a viable and interesting choice for them, since the tank is one of those absolutely vital group roles.\nOne of our main goals for the death knights is to make them mesh well with the game both in terms of the expansion's lore context and also in terms of being a valuable addition to the current class lineup, and so far we're really happy with how the class is coming along.\nHow do you think adding another tanking class to the existing class lineup will affect the classes that are currently filling tanking spots in groups and raids?\nWhen deciding which type of class we would add to World of Warcraft, we also took a very careful look at the current state of the game. The questions we asked ourselves were which kind of class roles are seeing the most use, which class roles are most desirable in groups right now, and what can we do to best meet this demand? Tanks play a critical role in any group, such that without a tank, you really don't have a group. We think that adding another tanking class will make it easier for players to form viable groups for dungeons and raids, but that won't be at the expense of existing tanks.\nThe design balance we're aiming for is one where all the tank classes are equally good at tanking in general so that you can use whatever tank you happen to have for five-player content, but at the same time we want tanks to be clearly distinct so they excel in different ways in various raid encounters. So our goal is to make the death knight a viable, fun tank that coexists with the current tanking classes without replacing them. It's also important to keep in mind that even though the death knight is a hero class, that doesn't mean it is more powerful than the other classes, just that it will offer a very different playing experience.\nThe existing nine classes can be described as healers, tanks, damage dealers, or a mix of these types, but each one with a unique twist that makes them feel clearly distinct, and sets them apart from one another. How do you think the death knight will feel different from other tanks?\n\"The \u201cmodern\u201d death knights resemble both the ones you saw in Warcraft III and the ones from Warcraft II, so they will combine powerful melee attacks with rune-based spellcasting to lay waste to whatever gets in their way.\"\nOne interesting difference between the death knight and other tanks is that death knights don't use shields. This is also a good example of how our design concepts for the class are closely reflected in actual gameplay. If you think of a death knight, you think of this terrifyingly powerful warrior in heavy plate armor carrying around an enormous rune weapon, very much like Arthas does in the cinematics of Warcraft III. You don't really see death knights hiding behind a shield \u2013 that's just not their style. We take this design concept and then turn it into gameplay that is both fun and fitting for the class.\nSo when you see a death knight tanking, you'll probably see a lot of things you wouldn't see with any other class. The \u201cmodern\u201d death knights resemble both the ones you saw in Warcraft III and the ones from Warcraft II, so they will combine powerful melee attacks with rune-based spellcasting to lay waste to whatever gets in their way. This mix of devastating melee abilities and magic attacks will be one of the many characteristics that set the death knight apart from other tanks.\nBut aside from just making them \u201cdifferent,\u201d we're also trying to make sure that death knights have the tools they need to fulfill their tanking role in groups \u2013 abilities that allow them to hold aggro and mitigate damage -- but also have a few twists to ensure that they're distinct and valued contributors to the group.\nWhile death knights are new to World of Warcraft, they are already a pretty well-established part of the Warcraft universe. Can players expect to see the return of some classic death knight spells and abilities?\n\"...the way we introduce this class gives us an opportunity to add some awesome new stuff to the \u201cmodern\u201d death knight's bag of tricks\"\nAbsolutely. One thing that is very exciting about the death knight character class is that we have a ton of really cool material to work with. Just looking at the many manifestations of death knights in previous games and in Warcraft lore provides a lot of ideas for spells and abilities that will give players a feeling of familiarity with what the class is about. At the same time, the way we introduce this class gives us an opportunity to add some awesome new stuff to the \u201cmodern\u201d death knight's bag of tricks.\nWhat we want to accomplish with the new class is to make players who are familiar with Warcraft lore feel right at home with the death knight, while at the same time creating a truly unique, interesting, and fun set of completely new spells and abilities. For example, the death knight's spells and abilities will be fueled by a new type of resource mechanic \u2013 the rune system \u2013 which will be different from mana, energy, and rage. This rune system is highly original and unlike any other class in World of Warcraft, but at the same time it is very consistent with the lore and core abilities of earlier incarnations of the death knight in previous games. It's still a bit too early to talk in detail about it, but hopefully we'll be able to reveal more about the rune system in the not-so-distant future."}

He grudgingly spared the council's former master, Gul'dan, in exchange for the warlock's servitude; in turn Gul'dan promised to create a host of powerful new warriors to serve the Horde. After experimenting at length with the souls of the recently slain council members, Gul'dan successfully instilled the spirit of the necrolyte Teron Gorefiend into the corpse of a fallen knight of Stormwind. Thus, the first terrifying death knight was born. Gul'dan transformed other council members as well, creating unholy warriors who sowed chaos and fear throughout the land of Azeroth during the Second War.\nFollowing Gul'dan's desertion and death, part of the Horde, including the death knights, retreated through the Dark Portal to Draenor. Most of the surviving death knights disappeared after Draenor's destruction, with the exception of Teron Gorefiend, whose restless and embittered form resides now in the Black Temple of Outland.\nChampions of the Lich King.\nYears after the destruction of Draenor, the immensely powerful Lich King created a new breed of death knights: malevolent, rune-wielding warriors\nof the Scourge. The first and greatest of these was Prince Arthas Menethil, once a mighty paladin of the Silver Hand, who sacrificed his soul to claim the runeblade Frostmourne in a desperate bid to save his people.\nUnlike Gul'dan's death knights, modern death knights consist mainly of paladins who lost their faith and pledged their souls to the Lich King in exchange for the promise of immortality. Death knights who fall in battle are soon raised again to continue in their master's service.\nIn the years since Arthas shattered the Frozen Throne and merged with the Lich King, the power and fury of the death knights has only grown.

It overviewed the story of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; prior to . \nArticle.\nChapter 1 - The Curse of Ner'zhul.\nThe elder shaman Ner'zhul was once among the greatest spiritual leaders of the orcs. Deceived by the demon Kil'jaeden, he set in motion the events that led to the orcs' corruption and the creation of the bloodthirsty Horde. Yet ultimately Ner'zhul refused to give his people fully to the demonic ranks of the Burning Legion.\nThe demon lord Kil'jaeden punished Ner'zhul for his defiance, destroying his aging body and torturing his spirit. The demon then offered Ner'zhul a final ultimatum: serve the Legion unconditionally or suffer eternal agony. With little other choice, Ner'zhul pledged to obey Kil'jaeden and was reborn as a terrifying and vastly powerful agent of the Legion \u2013 the Lich King.\nNer'zhul's spirit was magically shackled to a suit of ancient armor and bound to the mighty runeblade Frostmourne. To ensure Ner'zhul's obedience, Kil'jaeden sealed the armor and blade within a specially crafted block of ice collected from the far reaches of the Twisting Nether. This frozen crystal was then cast into the ripe and unsuspecting world of Azeroth, settling in the desolate, snowy wastes of Northrend.\nAmong the abilities bestowed upon the Lich King was lordship over death itself. From within his Frozen Throne, Ner'zhul summoned a number of undead to serve him and tested his army against the nerubians of Azjol-Nerub and their mighty spiderlord, Anub'arak. Although the War of the Spider raged for years, many nerubians who fell in battle quickly became bound to the Lich King's iron will. Anub'arak himself was eventually ambushed and slain, rising again to join Ner'zhul's ranks as a fearsome crypt lord.\nThe Lich King appeared to be faithfully serving his master, but he had in fact hatched a cunning and subversive plan. To that end, he created a small fissure in his prison, pushed Frostmourne through it, and directed his minions to carry the runeblade away from the Frozen Throne. Ner'zhul intended to use the sword as bait for a mighty champion: a loyal subject who would free him and serve as a vessel for his restless spirit. While Frostmourne was positioned to serve its future purpose, the Lich King dutifully proceeded with his demon master's true agenda...\nSince arriving on Azeroth, the Lich King had been formulating an insidious plague of undeath, a terrifying disease meant to annihilate humanity and create an army faithful to the Burning Legion. To expedite the spread of this contagion, the Lich King recruited a powerful ally in the ambitious mage Kel'Thuzad, a senior member of Dalaran's ruling council.\nUnder the Lich King's watchful gaze, Kel'Thuzad created the Cult of the Damned, a group of humans to whom he promised social equality and eternal life on Azeroth. The cultists spread the plague throughout Lordaeron's northern villages, amassing a host of mindless undead. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the growing army and named it the Scourge, for at the Lich King's whim it would surely scour humanity from the face of the world.\nChapter 2 - The Claiming of Frostmourne.\nThe archmage Antonidas suspected that the undead plague was magical in origin, and so he sent the sorceress Jaina Proudmoore to the northlands to investigate. With her went Prince Arthas Menethil, only son of King Terenas. Jaina and Arthas tracked down and killed the Lich King's servant, Kel'Thuzad, but the necromancer's death failed to halt the rise of the Scourge. As the battle against the undead wore on, the prince's faith and patience began to wane.\nJoined by the legendary paladin Uther the Lightbringer, Arthas and Jaina nevertheless arrived at the gates of Stratholme too late to stop the distribution of plague-ridden grain. Arthas realized that the innocent villagers would inevitably join the growing ranks of undead. He ordered Uther to purge the town and slaughter the civilians before they could become minions of the Scourge. When Uther refused, Arthas accused the veteran knight of treason and disbanded the Order of the Silver Hand. Uther and most of his remaining cavalry left the village in disgust, and Jaina, horrified by Arthas' decision, abandoned the prince as well.\nDespite the loss of his supporting forces, Arthas carried out his plan, putting the city's innocents to the blade and burning every remaining structure to the ground. Something in Arthas snapped that day, and as he walked away from Stratholme, he left much of his humanity in the flaming ruins.\nThe prince then dedicated himself to stopping the Scourge at all costs. In time he traced the source of the plague to Northrend. With a heavy heart and steadfast determination, the prince set out for the snowy roof of the world. In Northrend Arthas was surprised to find an old friend, the dwarf Muradin Bronzebeard. Muradin had been searching for a blade renowned to have legendary powers: the blade called Frostmourne. Arthas resolved to seek out the enchanted blade and wield it against the Scourge. However, at Uther's urging, King Terenas soon recalled Arthas and his troops. Before the expedition could set sail for home, Arthas secretly hired indigenous mercenaries to burn the ships. Leading his troops to the ships, Arthas feigned surprise and ordered his bitterly disappointed soldiers to hunt down and kill the mercenaries.\nArthas then scoured the desolate wastes for what he believed was the key to his people's salvation. In time Muradin and Arthas discovered Frostmourne and read the foreboding inscription on its pedestal. The inscription warned that Frostmourne's wielder would indeed gain power eternal, but at a cost: \"Just as the blade rends flesh, so must power scar the spirit.\" Despite the warning and Muradin's protests, Arthas swore that he would pay any price to possess the blade.\nAt the prince's reckless urging, Frostmourne freed itself from the ice in which it was encased, in the process taking Muradin's life. Arthas seized the blade, which destroyed what little remained of his humanity. The prince could not have guessed that the Lich King was the blade's true master, nor could he have known that in addition to Kil'jaeden's enchantments, Frostmourne possessed an ability that had been bestowed by Ner'zhul: the ability to steal the souls of the living.\nWith Frostmourne in hand and a growing darkness in his heart, Arthas wandered into the frozen wastes to answer the call of his new master...\nChapter 3 - Shattering the Frozen Throne.\nAll of Lordaeron rejoiced at Prince Arthas' triumphant return from Northrend, but their elation was not to last. Not long after Arthas knelt before King Terenas, the former paladin thrust Frostmourne into his father's heart. At the Lich King's command, the fallen prince went on to murder his mentor, Uther the Lightbringer, and claim Kel'Thuzad's remains. When Arthas had finished, Capital City, formerly one of humanity's crown jewels, had been reduced to a silent wasteland of death and despair.\nThe death knight Arthas then marched his ever-growing army of the undead into the forests of Quel'Thalas, slaughtering the elves in his path as he smashed through the gates of Silvermoon. Arthas laid claim to the legendary Sunwell, using its powers to raise Kel'Thuzad as a lich and leaving the high elven lands utterly devastated in his wake.\nKel'Thuzad in turn opened a gateway to usher in Archimonde, a powerful demon lord of the Burning Legion. Upon his arrival Archimonde declared that the Lich King's usefulness had reached an end. While Archimonde pursued the Legion's goals, Arthas traveled to the continent of Kalimdor. There he met and advised Illidan Stormrage, a powerful demon hunter whose interests aligned with those of the Lich King.\nThe Third War ended with Archimonde's demise, and Legion forces on Azeroth were scattered in the wake of his death. Arthas returned to Lordaeron, where he was assailed by painful visions that he learned were a sign of the Lich King's weakening power. The death knight journeyed back to Northrend and was confronted by an army of elves: survivors of the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas. The elves had joined forces with Illidan Stormrage in order to march on the Frozen Throne. The crypt lord Anub'arak arrived and guided Arthas into a series of ancient tunnels that allowed the pair to reach the Lich King quickly.\nArthas emerged from the subterranean caverns to face one final challenger barring his path: Illidan Stormrage, who had become a demon. Illidan engaged the death knight in single combat, Frostmourne clashing against Illidan's Twin Blades of Azzinoth. Ultimately the demon was left bloodied in the snow as Arthas advanced, undeterred by the voices of the past echoing in his head, warning him against the action he was about to take.\nSome say that Arthas was still in control of his own actions when he ascended the steps of the Frozen Throne; others claim that he had been the Lich King's creature ever since taking up Frostmourne. Whatever the case, a single voice stood out in the death knight's mind as he reached the runic armor encased in ice. \"Return the blade,\" commanded the Lich King. \"Complete the circle. Release me from this prison!\" With a roar, Arthas brought Frostmourne down, shattering the Frozen Throne. He then donned Ner'zhul's helm, sealing his union with the Lich King.\nThe Lich King waits now, scheming to lure adventurers down the same dark path that Arthas tread. Frostmourne hungers for the souls of both the brave and the foolish, and somewhere Ner'zhul's voice still echoes within the helm of the Lich King.\n\"Now, we are one.\""}

More than ten millennia ago, he watched in horror as &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; all but wiped out the blue flight. Maddened by grief, Malygos withdrew to his lair and paid little heed to the rest of the world, emerging only when it finally seemed possible to avenge Deathwing's terrible crime.\nOnly in recent times did Malygos fully return to his senses. Upon reviving, he quickly assessed the state of magical affairs in Azeroth and reached the grim conclusion that magic was running amok throughout the world. He blamed this dangerous development on the mortal races and their reckless pursuit of magical power.\n[\"Flash Movie\"]\nDetermined to forestall a catastrophe, Malygos decreed that the world's unbridled magic must be reined in by any means necessary. And so the great Aspect turned to the &lt;a href=\"Arcanomicon\"&gt;Arcanomicon&lt;/a&gt;, a map of the world's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s. Gifted to Malygos ages ago by the titan &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, the Arcanomicon has been continuously updated and revised by the blue dragons over the long years of Malygos's seclusion.\nNow Malygos uses the Arcanomicon to locate and tap into the ley lines, diverting the magical powers that course beneath the earth to his home base in Northrend, the Nexus. Once harnessed, the energies are focused through the Nexus' ascending rings and blasted into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos's redirection of the ley lines has carried disastrous consequences, however, splintering the world's crust and opening unstable rifts: tears in the very fabric of the magical dimension.\nMalygos' siphoning of the world's magic has not gone unnoticed by the mortal races. The weakening members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the elite magi of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, have sworn to fight Malygos to the bitter end. In fact, the magi have used their waning powers to transfer the entire city of Dalaran to float above Northrend. From this vantage point, the magi prepare for the next step in their battle against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and for the inevitable confrontation with Malygos.\nHowever, not all of the Kirin Tor stand united. Several members have opted to side with the blue dragonflight in the hopes of retaining power. Transformed and bolstered by Malygos, these &lt;a href=\"mage%20hunter\"&gt;mage hunter&lt;/a&gt;s are tasked with rooting out and, if necessary, destroying magical artifacts; killing or imprisoning individuals who practice magic without Malygos' permission; and aiding in the redirection of ley lines using massive constructs called &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe blue dragonflight's increasingly militaristic methods have been condemned by the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Charged with the preservation of life, the red dragonflight has vowed to neutralize Malygos at all costs. To this end, they have formed a council with the Kirin Tor, and the two groups have begun actively subverting Malygos's devastating campaign.\nThe sides have been chosen; the battle lines have been drawn.

Brave adventurers are needed to battle the massing Scourge in Northrend. The serene trip by boat into Daggercap Bay stands in sharp contrast to the scene at your final destination, the besieged town of &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt;. As the boat comes to a stop at last, you find yourself in a town under siege. Enraged vrykul charge the town's defenders, overwhelming them with their sheer size and savagery. Buildings catch fire and burn before your eyes, and the cries of battle mingle with the shrieks of the proto-dragons flying low overhead. Despite the chaos, your eyes are drawn to the massive stone edifice dominating your view -- Utgarde. As you gaze upon the twin skull visages on the fa\u00e7ade that leer out upon Daggercap Bay, you feel a shiver run down your spine that has nothing to do with the frosty air...\nThe towering, ominous Utgarde Keep is a sight impossible to miss for players arriving in Howling Fjord, and likely the first dungeon experienced in Northrend. The design process behind Utgarde Keep, and the other dungeons of , has evolved from years of experience developing for &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. In this article, the World of Warcraft design team explores the goals and overall philosophies at the foundations of the five-person dungeons of Northrend, and gives us a behind-the-scenes look at Utgarde Keep itself. Let's start the tour.\nWelcome to Northrend. Now feel our wrath!\nHow exactly do you dream up a dungeon? When we started working on Utgarde Keep, we knew from the start that we wanted some sort of \"impenetrable fortress in the side of a mountain.\" In considering the continent of Northrend's history and geography, we pretty quickly found a source of inspiration for Utgarde Keep, and to an extent the entire region of Howling Fjord, in a combination of elements from Norse mythology. One of our goals was to make the starting areas feel more \"human.\" The presence of the Vrykul, the imposing half-giant warrior race native to the region, and the architecture connected to them helped achieve exactly that.\nUtgarde's design ties closely into the creation of Howling Fjord as a whole. Less high-concept than the otherworldly and wildly diverse regions of Outland, we want the zones in Northrend to follow a geographic theme that's more consistent with the familiar geography of Azeroth. Many of Northrend's regions originally appeared in -- such as Howling Fjord, one of the two starting areas and also where Utgarde Keep is prominently located. Howling Fjord's Azerothian feel stands in sharp contrast to the stark, alien beauty of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, and this should help players establish an immediate connection to the expansion's new environments.\nHowever, the residents of Utgarde Keep are more than happy to make them feel less at home. The Vrykul (think Vikings, only bigger, fiercer, and extremely inhospitable) have made Utgarde Keep their staging ground for attacks against nearby Horde and Alliance settlements, including Valgarde, and they aren't exactly thrilled to see new heroes coming in to reinforce the town. When you arrive in Daggercap Bay, you will experience regular Vrykul attacks firsthand as the raging giants assault Valgarde and rain fire down on the buildings from the backs of their proto-dragon mounts. The intent here is to make you feel deeply involved in the expansion's overall plot from the moment you step off the boat, and we felt there's really no better way to achieve this than to have a Vrykul giant chase you around with an axe that's easily twice your own size.\nYou'll catch a glimpse of the Vrykul's sinister plans through the quests in Valgarde's vicinity, which will eventually lead you into Utgarde Keep itself to strike a blow at the heart of the Vrykul war effort (and perhaps gain some insights into the motivations behind the attacks themselves). When you finally do enter Utgarde Keep, we want you to feel as if that assault is the logical conclusion to the events that led you there. You and your fellow adventurers will venture in with steely resolve, there to make things right -- armed with sword, spell, and most importantly, a sense of purpose.\nThe design of a starter dungeon.\nWe expect most players to battle through this dungeon at a brisk pace. You will find that you will probably be able to play through Utgarde Keep much more quickly than its high-level counterparts, similar to equivalents such as &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt;. Accessibility is a high priority, especially with the early dungeons, both in terms of location -- the entrance portal is extremely close to the outskirts of the town -- and in terms of how much time players need to invest in the dungeon. Along these lines, the overall difficulty of the dungeon is comparable to a first attempt at Ramparts in Outland.\nThe guiding principle behind this kind of \"starter\" dungeon is that you and your party can have a solid, memorable experience with plenty of story payoffs and some nice rewards to boot -- all in a single run. What should make the experience of playing through Utgarde Keep even more engaging is a sense of purpose for the players, and even greater connection to the story than before. This is one of the key goals of Wrath of the Lich King's dungeon design.\nUtgarde's Eye Candy.\nUtgarde Keep is one of the most visually impressive edifices in all of World of Warcraft. When you pass these notable areas, you might want to pause a moment and look around:\nThe Forge.\nThe very first room in Utgarde is a forge. The fire blasting from the forge is a brand new graphic effect used here to increase the keep's dramatic visuals. You must defeat each successive group of enemies to extinguish the walls of flame, allowing your group to continue.\nThe Dragon Pens.\nThis stable, housing the proto-dragon mounts of the Vrykul, is a showcase for the art and textures used throughout Utgarde. Its most interesting architectural feature is the open ceiling; look up to see the sky with dragons flying overhead. The amount of light coming through the ceiling depends on the time of day in-game.\nThe Balcony.\nThe area leading up to and including the final boss fight takes place on an outdoor balcony high atop the keep. If only the keep's denizens would give you a moment to simply enjoy the breathtaking view from this lofty perch overlooking Daggercap Bay, Valgarde, and the nearby waterfall. You can even see drakes flying overhead, embarking on sorties to attack targets below\nLooking for lore (in all the right places).\nOne of the most important lessons of dungeon design is to establish easily identifiable goals. When you feel like you're there for a clear reason, that sense of purpose makes a dungeon far more engaging. To help facilitate this goal-oriented philosophy, one technique we're using in Wrath of the Lich King is to build more mission-based instances along the lines of &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe're also leaning heavily on the rich history and backstory expressed through the lore of World of Warcraft. After designing dozens of memorable dungeons, at times it can be challenging to keep things fresh. This is one way the lore is extremely helpful. It's an invaluable resource for brainstorming new design ideas and interesting dungeon encounters. The look of the dungeon, the level design, the enemies, the bosses -- all of these elements are simply creative manifestations of the underlying lore.\nYou will experience this philosophy put into practice in Utgarde. For example, the backstory states that the Vrykul are, among other things, digging an underground tunnel between the keep and &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt; (another region in Northrend). We decided to put tunnels in the keep that players use to move between rooms. However, when the tunnels were built in the game, we realized that the Vrykul would frown on manual labor (given their backstory). They would consider digging tunnels beneath them. So the suggestion was made: why not have mindless undead dig the tunnels for them? This ultimately influenced our decision to make the first boss, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Keleseth\"&gt;Prince Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge ambassador to the Vrykul. This is just one example of the creative back-and-forth between lore and game design.\nThis approach also gives us an opportunity to portray enemies with their own motivations: of doing something -- in this case tunneling -- instead of just waiting to be killed by players. And when they are standing around, they are doing so for a reason. For example, the enemies in Utgarde Keep's forge are there to craft weapons and armor for the Vrykul to use in their war effort. Small details like this help us in our efforts to make every room of every dungeon, particularly the boss rooms, which receive special attention, unique and memorable.\nAnother example of the deepening connection between story and gameplay is how enemy bosses are treated in Wrath of the Lich King. Giving the player more interaction with these villains prior to battling them increases the immersion. For example, you will first catch a glimpse of Utgarde Keep's commander on a balcony overlooking Daggercap Bay and Valgarde, surrounded by dragon-mounted Vrykul. As you approach, Ingvar the Plunderer can be seen motioning to his troops, directing them to attack targets below. Remember the lumbering, dangerous Vrykul with their huge axes who've been chasing you around ever since you set foot in Northrend? Ingvar is the one who's been giving them orders all along. Once the commander is felled, you will learn more about the mystery of the Vrykul, and what needs to be done to free Northrend of the darkness that shrouds this frozen wasteland. \nA story-driven approach is a key element to the designs of all the new dungeons in Wrath of the Lich King. Another excellent example of this is &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Caverns of Time: Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, where you will witness a pivotal moment in Arthas' story -- the &lt;a href=\"culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; -- while standing right next to him.\nLessons from the past.\nWe learned some important lessons from The Burning Crusade's starting area and dungeons, in terms of both what worked and what didn't, and these lessons are reflected in Northrend. For example, there are two starting areas, each with its own dungeon, as opposed to The Burning Crusade's single Hellfire Peninsula / Hellfire Citadel combo. The reasoning behind this is to provide a choice to the player -- the area you decide to start in is where you will spend your early levels in Northrend. You can also decide to travel to the other starting area at any time, thanks to a free travel system between the zones of Borean Tundra and Howling Fjord, but most players will likely gravitate toward one area in order to complete the various quests there. Having two starting areas also adds to Wrath of the Lich King's replayability -- when it's time to pick a starting area for an alt, you can pick the one that you didn't play through the first time around.\nAnother idea that we are bringing back from Burning Crusade is the heroic difficulty mode for dungeons. We learned some things from this feature in The Burning Crusade in terms of balancing and tuning these dungeons for difficulty, which should result in more consistent difficulty both within a given Heroic dungeon as well as between one Heroic dungeon and the next. This time around, some Heroic dungeons will offer bonus content such as new bosses and hidden areas of the dungeon that will only be accessible in Heroic mode.\nVisions of the future.\nDespite the chaos, your eyes are drawn to the massive stone edifice dominating your view -- Utgarde.\nAs you gaze upon the twin skull visages on the fa\u00e7ade that leer out upon Daggercap Bay, you feel a shiver run down your spine that has nothing to do with the frosty air... However, you quickly shake off the feeling of unease and focus on the battle at hand, knowing that your skills are needed here and now. As the vrykul attackers fall before you one by one, you can't help but wonder what other monstrosities await you beyond the darkened walls of Utgarde Keep. You get the feeling you'll find out soon enough.\nWe hope you enjoyed this preview of Utgarde Keep and dungeon design in Wrath of the Lich King and look forward to seeing you in Northrend."}

Seated atop a high plateau, Wintergrasp has remained undisturbed for ages, its icy winds howling unheard amongst the ancient titan fortifications that dot the landscape. However, the recent arrival of Horde and Alliance forces in Northrend signals the end of Wintergrasp's long and peaceful slumber, for the clash of iron and the sound of battle will soon drown out the ruins' silent song of solitude.\nAn abundance of elemental materials and its strategically important titan fortifications are making Wintergrasp the focus of a vicious tug-of-war between the Horde and the Alliance. Much is at stake, and both sides are beginning once again to field various kinds of war machines ranging from catapults to steam-powered siege engines.

It overviewed four of the &lt;a href=\"zones\"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt; releasing in . \nArticles.\nDragonblight.\nFor millennia the Great Dragonblight has served as the enduring heart of Northrend.\nHere dense forests surround a vast arctic wasteland littered with the massive, gleaming bones of perished dragons. In the center of this frozen expanse lies Wyrmrest Temple, a structure believed to be built by the world-shaping titans shortly after they reshaped Azeroth. Many legends hold that the five great Dragon Aspects were blessed here within the Chamber of the Aspects and given their charge to watch over the budding world. Perhaps it is for this reason that dragons nearing the end of their lives come to the Dragonblight to enrich the land with their passing.\nSurrounding Wyrmrest Temple are five majestic dragon shrines: red, bronze, green, blue, and black, each blessed with the powers of its respective flight. In recent times the undead Scourge has laid siege to these shrines in an effort to further its attempts at raising terrifying new variations of undead dragons to serve the Lich King. In an attempt to arrest these invasions, the red Dragon Aspect, Alexstrasza, has begun recruiting heroes to aid in the fight against the Scourge.\nBoth the Alliance and the Horde have established a presence in the Dragonblight, taking a particular interest in the barred entrance to Icecrown, Angrathar the Wrath Gate. There both factions wage bloody battles to push the hosts of undead back into Icecrown in the hopes of opening the gate to the Lich King\u2019s base of operations.\nIn the east the dreaded necropolis Naxxramas has reappeared, and from it the reborn lich Kel'Thuzad commands armies of undead to face off against the Alliance at the Wrath Gate.\nIn the west, ruinous developments have driven the taunka to call upon the aid of the Horde. A massive sinkhole recently swallowed the taunka capital, Icemist Village. A host of undead nerubians, called Anub\u2019ar, have poured from the pit and the Horde has stepped in to address this new threat and rescue the fleeing taunka.\nAmid the chaos, the one-time Scarlet Crusade, now the Scarlet Onslaught, has arrived to pursue its fanatical campaign against the Lich King and his minions.\nBeyond the immediate dangers of the undead, however, are those posed by the blue dragonflight...\nDetermined to manipulate all existing magic to serve his own purposes, the blue Dragon Aspect, Malygos, has ordered his flight to maneuver colossal machines into key positions over magical ley line clusters. Many believe that these dire constructs are intended to realign the paths of magical energy that course beneath the earth. If successful, Malygos's tampering could result in an ecological and magical catastrophe that would threaten not only the stability of Northrend, but ultimately the equilibrium of the entire world.\nGrizzly Hills.\nThe lush, primordial mountains of the Grizzly Hills are a stark contrast to the snowy peaks that separate it from the Howling Fjord to the south.\nIn the heart of this wild frontier lies the ancestral home of the furbolgs, Grizzlemaw. For generations the tribal furbolgs have worshipped a colossal prehistoric bear that roams the surrounding wilderness.\nAlthough the gentle furbolgs have grown accustomed to living in relative peace, recent incursions have forced the ancient tribes to engage in battle. Trappers are encroaching upon furbolg hunting grounds, and the goblin Venture Company has begun large-scale deforesting operations throughout the region.\nDespite the trappers and goblins, the most imminent threat comes from the north, where throngs of undead Drakkari ice trolls have begun pouring from their stronghold of Drak\u2019Tharon Keep.\nThe cause of the Drakkari\u2019s sudden invasion remains a mystery. The two races survived for centuries without conflict, but the furbolgs now find themselves in a desperate struggle to hold their land against the steadily increasing numbers of undead trolls.\nThe Alliance and Horde have recently begun efforts to establish a presence in the Grizzly Hills, yet this untamed frontier remains a vast and dangerous wilderness that until recently, time had forgotten.\nBorean Tundra.\nThe sprawling Borean Tundra lies at the far southwestern tip of Northrend, the icy continent also known as the roof of the world. In recent months the Horde has established a dominant presence here as the young and daringly aggressive Garrosh Hellscream has founded the rugged orc fortress of Warsong Hold.\nShortly upon arriving, the Horde met the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fishermen. The two groups have since formed a bond, and the Horde has sworn to aid their new allies in any way possible. Garrosh and his orc forces have also discovered the enigmatic taunka, an ancient offshoot of the tauren race that up until now had been thought lost forever.\nBeyond the Westrift Valley, which separates the tundra from the mountainous region of Coldarra, explorers have recently witnessed increased activity at a magical site known as the Nexus. Nestled within the valley of Coldarra, the Nexus is a column of magical energy surrounded by levitating earth-covered rings. This ancient site was created by the blue dragonflight, and many adventurers attribute the increased activity here to the reemergence of the blue Dragon Aspect, Malygos. Inhabitants of the region have also noted an increased tension among members of the blue dragonflight, especially regarding the use of magic.\nThe Alliance has established a smaller presence here as well, and as both factions prepare to launch an offensive against the Lich King and his undead armies, they must first address the more immediate threat: the naga. The sinister serpentine race is using massive generators to melt the surrounding glaciers and ice caps, threatening to flood the entire region.\nThe Alliance and Horde have journeyed from far and wide to reach Northrend. Yet for these intrepid pioneers, the true challenges still lie ahead.\nHowling Fjord.\nThe Howling Fjord sits high above the Great Sea on the southeastern tip of Northrend. It is said that in ancient times the vrykul, a race of half-giant warriors, inhabited the land, founding a vast and prosperous civilization.\nThen one day, without warning or explanation, the vrykul vanished, leaving behind only deserted villages and abandoned temples.\nNow the Alliance and Horde have come to confront the malefic Lich King and put an end to the Scourge. The Alliance has established a staging area in the settlement of Valgarde, but their presence seems to have sparked off an unforeseen event: the return of the vrykul.\nThese formidable warriors have begun attacking Horde and Alliance settlements, and many of the vrykul are pouring out of the fortress of Utgarde Keep, not far from Valgarde. The vrykul's motives and their whereabouts for the past several thousand years remain a mystery. Regardless, there is no doubt that the vrykul's sudden resurgence has touched off an ongoing battle for control of the region.\nDwarven prospectors, in the meantime, have uncovered mysterious relatives whose skin is etched in strange runes. These iron dwarves may provide the missing link needed for the dwarves to piece together the mystery of their creation.\nOn the eastern shore, the Forsaken have arrived, carrying a plague of their own to unleash upon the Lich King. Queen Sylvanas has been methodically and patiently overseeing the formulation of this contagion for several years, and the time has come at last to test its effectiveness against the Scourge.\nBefore bringing the battle to the Lich King, both the Horde and Alliance must overcome the immediate threat of the vrykul and answer the questions that the warriors\u2019 reemergence has posed. Where have the vrykul been? What do they want? Most disturbing of all, what if they aligned with the Lich King?\nPerhaps only time will tell. For now, the battle has just begun."}

It was created using mainly the graphics of the &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" (taking place within World of Warcraft's fictional world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;) with embellishments. The comics themselves are themed mostly around parodies and references of the game itself. It originally started as a PlanetFargo column written by &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave \"Fargo\" Kosak&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a fictitious interview between Fargo and Flintlocke, a self-styled master hunter who took Fargo along for a bear hunt with disastrous results. He then lowered his objectives, instead taking Fargo along to hunt \"a monstrous beast\" that was no more than a tiny squirrel, with an equally tragic end.\nThe first few installments of Flintlocke's adventures followed the PlanetFargo style, namely a written column with a few pictures to go along. It eventually took the form of a webcomic starting from January 10, 2005 . The comic is done with humor relying heavily on meta-reference, the characters all being perfectly aware of being players of the MMORPG \"World of Warcraft\", interacting in a virtual environment.\nSeries One ended its run on January 12, 2007. Series Two featured an added new artist, Rhys Yorke, and a new format using drawn artwork rather than posed game models. The new series only ran for two strips before the comic ceased to be updated. It was announced on April 12, 2007, in the \"Daily Warrior\" feature that the strip would be canceled due to a \"lack of an artist and a move to FilePlanet.\" The main page now lists the comic's archives, along with a message saying \"Flintlocke's Guide to Azeroth has ended its run after more than two years on GameSpy.com\". The couple of comics that had been published in the new art style have been removed from the archive listing, but can still be found via direct links and by going through the archives manually.\nOn August 26, 2008, Flintlocke returned in &lt;a href=\"Flintlocke%20vs.%20The%20Horde\"&gt;Flintlocke vs. The Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The story was told from the point of view of a role-playing Orc Hunter. This comic strip ended on July 17, 2009, and fully concluded the Flintlocke storyline.\nAll the major characters eventually ended up canonized in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" after Dave Kosak was hired by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;.\nMain characters.\nFlintlocke.\nThe main character of the comic, a &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; who- bizarrely- sees himself as a powerful Hunter instead. Flintlocke takes this to its fullest extent by using guns for most of his more powerful attacks. He also has a propensity to use hammers, maces, and other blunt weapons; he has also wielded a question mark (taken from a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Non-player%20character\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;'s head) as his main weapon, and possibly took the dual exclamation points a second goblin was wielding as a prize after defeating him. He wears goggles because he shot his eye out when he got his first gun and his uncle taught him the \"chuck shot\"\nFlintlocke is also a brilliantly insane- or insanely brilliant- engineer. His deranged creations are right on par with goblin engineering, and usually involve some sort of dead (or soon to be) rodent propelled out of a cannon by ridiculous amounts of &lt;a href=\"blasting%20powder\"&gt;blasting powder&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever else is available. He has a surprising success rate with these tactics, generally killing his target outright. In fact, all of Flintlocke's bizarre \"shot\" techniques have turned out to be 100% successful so far (with the exception of the Goblin Bazooka), even leading Kathrena to quip \"That's the deadest corpse I've ever seen\" upon witnessing a victim of his \"Chuck-Shot\".\nFlintlocke also has a rather unusual problem: despite being a dwarf, his reputation among &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; is less than stellar, due to his experimentation with an \"exploding chicken\" weapon against a group of orcs having severely damaged his standing with the dwarves (as well as most of Ironforge's Hall of Heroes). He has an incredible obsession with powerful weapons, having once added an aiming scope to a mace and purchased six copies of an experimental spinning head mace created by a less than reputable gnome engineer, simply because he thought they were powerful. He also attempted to create a \"silenced\" hammer by adding a sponge to one end of it, for \"stealth\" hits.\nHe is also one of the worst shoppers in the game, never coming out ahead when he tries to buy or sell; yet is the first among them to suggest \"going to the auction house\". He is constantly gaining ridiculous and useless items, like an incredibly ugly but powerful helm, various brands of new armor or even 6 1 handed maces because a gnome was telling all the details about it.\nHe has a dead ram as his mount, resurrected by Schweitzer. Flintlocke has a recurring problem with trying to convince others that his ram isn't dead (claiming that \"he's got a cold\"), and his excuses generally don't work out too well for him.\nFlintlocke always talks in what seems to be a Scottish accent (an accent that is normally used by Dwarves), never using normal prose if he can help it, though at times when he is talking to himself (such as in \"Six Stages\") he reverts to a more normal style of prose.\nKathrena.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;, and the unofficial girlfriend of Flintlocke. Their relationship is a tumultuous one at best, considering her high respect of nature versus his propensity to use small furry mammals as ammunition. \nKathrena once killed Flintlocke after he gave her an empty chocolate box for Valentine's day, claiming he needed to throw those to distract a charging boar, and that besides she was \"a wee bit thick inna bum.\" (This prompted the Spirit Healer itself to call him a \"dumbass\".) She's never actually stopped going out with him, however, despite him twice sending her into comas (once when demonstrating how to \"plant\" a tree, and once when he was wielding a pair of \"beaverchucks\").\nShe is a highly skilled archer who can take down most opponents with a single arrow to the throat or chest, leading her to admit that maybe hunters need to be &lt;a href=\"nerf\"&gt;nerf&lt;/a&gt;ed. She used to have a pet spider named Ittsy Bittsy who tried eating Flintlocke's face on their first meeting. The spider only showed up in that comic (though it was referenced once more, when Bloodrose was talking strategy). It appears that Kathrena has since ditched Ittsy Bittsy and gotten an enormous purple pet raptor, named \"Parappa the Raptor\". \nIn keeping with the nonsensical tone of the strip, Kathrena may be pregnant with a tree, due to the happenings during the party's split in Ashenvale. She denies this, prompting Flintlocke to claim \" Tha's not wot sez!\" . (This hotlinked directly to this page.) She later tells a friend \"So I says to him, \"No, I don't want full custody. I just think the baby tree should go to Night Elf schools\".\"\nDespite her possible \"relationship\" with the tree, it is nonetheless hinted that Flintlocke and Kathrena have a romantic, steady relationship- the fact that they are total opposites notwithstanding.\nSchweitzer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; of the group, though his position as a healer is highly debatable. \"Doc\" never attacks, instead favoring a tactic of hiding behind trees and columns or running away, only coming out of hiding when there is something for him to loot. When no other option is available, he has been known to pee his pants as a direct response. While it may seem like cowardice to the untrained eye, Doc has come to rationalize this behavior with a complicated explanation. He has cast spells only three times in the entire comic so far. Once he cast Inner Fire (an armor class &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;) while he was all alone and thought himself discovered by a tauren scout (it's not known exactly what the spell did, if anything at all). The second time he, again, cast Inner Fire on himself.And the last time, he resurrected Flinlocke's dead Ram, rendering it undead. He doesn't even draw his weapon, claiming he needs \"both hands free for looting.\" He will stop pilfering the trail of dead bodies just long enough to make love to pretty females he meets along the way, true to the vow of unpiety he swore in a desperate plea to save his own cowardly life (just before casting the aforementioned useless spell). He joined a Horde guild while in the middle of a drug high in the streets of Gadgetzan, and has an anarchy emblem permanently spray painted to his tabard.. In the end of the series, Schweitzer manages to survive the detonation of the Ultimate Goblin Engineered Weapon due to a parachute cloak, which he declares as \"awesome\".\nWhile captured by the Horde group, Schweitzer mistakenly thinks that Cheri wants have a relationship with him, and shows her \"his thing\". She later asks him if he wants to see some \"risqu\u00e9\" pictures of her modeling in real life, and if they should meet out-of-game. He doesn't understand, and kills her with the \"Murder\" macro described below.\nAfter being specced by The Wuuf, the \"Doc\" realises that he has a \"Murder\" macro, which he uses to a devastating effect. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//pc.gamespy.com/flintlocke-vs-the-horde/episode-14-the-showdown/1000392p1.html%7Cframe\"&gt;The results of said spell on Dr. Bubbles&lt;/a&gt;\nHe also bears an uncanny resemblance to the (EMH) from , who in one episode decided that his name would be Schweitzer.\nBloodrose.\nA female &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; with almost full &lt;a href=\"Arcanist\"&gt;Arcanist&lt;/a&gt; gear who usually ends up doing all the real work herself . \nShe is the consummate who \"plays this game to win\". Flintlocke often calls her a \"\". She is such a powergamer that she once gained a level just by talking at length about battle strategy . \nHer focus is best demonstrated by how she obtained level 60: when the group split up for a short time, she took advantage of this break to gain enough experience to reach level 60 in just under 4 hours . She has obtained enough power and resources to actually discard an epic mace rather than sell it at the auction house. \nMuch like \"Doc\" and Flintlocke himself, she is not above looting dead bodies herself, having no shame in going through the pockets of corpses long buried at the Scarlet Monastery. She has a problem with those who would actually read anything - books, letters, the like - in game, once telling Flintlocke \"this is why you're not level 60 yet.\"\nDespite this, there is some heart to Bloodrose. Upon meeting Lowping's real player, an intellectual and gentleman, she promptly fell in love; his use of complete sentences and large words - \"rigid superstructure\" in particular - was a \"turn-on\". She does, however, utterly hate and despise the macro \"script-kiddy\" Lowping, whom she despises for both stealing the Hat of the Archmage from her - twice - and for being a Rogue, a class she detests (mostly because she thinks they are overpowered).\nBloodrose also hates the Winter Veil (in-game Christmas) holiday, mostly because it brings back bad memories. She told the story to Flintlocke and crew at their second Winter's Veil together. She goes on to explain that she was the actual reason Gnomeregan is irradiated, as it resulted from her attempting to get an edge over her siblings during the family's Winter Veil game.\nLowping.\nA gnome &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;. He is played by a man who had not been at his keyboard in over a year before returning, leaving his character to be handled by &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20API\"&gt;scripts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s that have Flintlocke set on /follow and /assist. The macros were downloaded from a Chinese fileserver. He has several bizarre automatic commands built into his scripts, such as molesting barmaids, requesting cybersex from female players, climbing into Flintlocke's dead ram and automatically running to the Stockades to loot the first chest he finds whenever entering Stormwind. \nHis scripts will always have him attacking dangerous opponents at the worst possible times, though his backstabs have been known to take down incredibly powerful enemies in just seconds. Bizarrely, despite being run entirely on macro, he is easily one of the deadliest members the party has, often killing enemies before even Bloodrose can get to them. He also has a quirky love of hats, which is always the first thing he will loot on fallen mobs. His speech is limited to short lines such as the &lt;a href=\"leet\"&gt;leet&lt;/a&gt;speak \"I lewt teh hat\" and \"Ebay! Ebay!\". He was thought to be an Asian &lt;a href=\"Gold%20farming\"&gt;gold farmer&lt;/a&gt;, however it was revealed that he is actually an affluent English-speaking patent attorney/world traveler, and used Chinese scripts to make money in his absence from his keys.. He is incredibly skilled at making off-the-cuff calculations for weaponry, and this is not his first time on the quest to steal the Ultimate Goblin-Engineered Weapon; it is actually his fifth, though he has ominously remarked that, while not able to see what happened due to his absence from the keyboard, his macro logs indicate that a short time after finding it each time, all his party members died horribly.\nBloodrose, who utterly hates Lowping both for being a macro script-kiddy and for looting - twice - the Hat of the Archmage that she wants so very badly, once after outrolling her by one point, has been charmed almost instantly by the \"real\" Lowping, who wrongly deduced that the Hat of the Archmage he was wearing was a gift from Bloodrose - complimenting her on denying the trend of powergaming and letting a comrade, one who was run by scripts to boot, acquire such a valuable article. Due to this, Lowping incorrectly believes the munchkin Bloodrose to be a very honorable player, and she has fallen in love with his ability to speak in complete sentences. They even performed a mimicry of a scene from the movie together. Just before Bloodrose could tell Lowping her feelings for him, he told her he had to take a conference call and would be going &lt;a href=\"AFK\"&gt;AFK&lt;/a&gt; \"for a bit.\" Lowping then reverted to his previous scripted behavior at the same moment she shouted \"I love you!\", prompting him to become excessively amorous with her on the spot, much to her vexation. The last time he logged in, \"real\" Lowping found himself riding a the Ultimate Goblin Engineered Weapon, like a pony... again, before the weapon detonated and destroyed most of Stormwind.\nOne of Lowping's alts is \"the richest mage on the server\", an undead mage. He later helps the Horde characters in \"Flintlocke vs The Horde\" get better gear, in order to overpower his own team. While he is logged out, Flintlocke drops him into a toilet.\nSecondary characters.\nPSI Investigators: A duo of detectives, who are part of the PSI \"&lt;a href=\"pwn\"&gt;pween&lt;/a&gt; scene investigation\" group. In their debut episode, the subordinate detective is referred to as \"McKenzie\", while the head detective remains unnamed throughout the series (although is named \"Inspektor\" by the author). They are both &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and follow the trail of dead cameo characters left behind by Flintlocke and his crew. While McKenzie always seems to pin down the exact cause of death and deduce Flintlocke's unorthodox methods, his leader will inevitably dismiss his conclusion offhand and instead claim that the victim instead died by some bizarre suicide ritual or other farfetched method. As time goes by and Flintlocke's gang leaves more and more corpses, their theories get stranger and stranger. For all their unusual working methods, they are quite devoted to their duties and will run in-depth tests to arrive at their ultimate conclusions.\nBayne: The ordnance officer who holds the secret to the Ultimate Goblin Engineered Weapon which Flintlocke seeks ever since he found an \"ancient map drawn in ancient crayon.\" He has been dead for quite some time, resting in the Scarlet Monastery graveyard until he was dug up and his body looted by Flintlocke and Bloodrose (Flintlocke vandalized his grave afterwards). This prompted him to return as an undead for revenge, though this was not such a bright idea as he came back to life surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;rs, who proceeded to kill him 12 more times before he could crawl back out of the monastery with a renewed hatred of all living things. He later joined the Horde raiding party and now plans to use the ultimate weapon to achieve his goal. He began telling his story to the Horde people but they got bored before he could finish and cut him off to go and raid Stormwind.\nThe Tauren Scout: A Tauren who was tracking Schweitzer in Ashenvale and then gained a level by going to the toilet. After being killed by Flintlocke and his party, he caused Orgrimmar to believe Flintlocke was gong to Raid Ashenvale through a little Spreading-of-the-word misunderstanding.He is the Guildmaster of Desk Chair Lamp (based on a now defunct guild on the Bloodscalp server) which apparently sounds very intimidating in Common. He later shows up laying siege to Gadgetzan trying to find Flintlocke and even later massing a Raid to Stormwind\nSchweitzer's father: A drunken man, legally blind from syphilis, whose only bright spot in life is thinking that his son is upstanding, honorable, devout and pious. Clearly, the syphilis has affected a lot more than just his eyesight. Has an unusually deep outlook on life and seems to be the only character seen so far to be able to grasp the concept that the world is not black and white, but multiple shades of grey. Cannot feel his own crotch, but can feel other peoples' .\nThe Wuuf: The most renowned player there is, his skill is legendary, even Bloodrose considers that he is hardcore and that he makes her look like Doc. He terrorizes game designers who fear what he may post negatively on their forums about their new games, and has been a level 60 priest since the very first day that the World of Warcraft servers went up. His reputation is such that he always shows up saying \"BEHOLD!\" and gets away with making up new words that everyone else start using right away. He only made a four word comment during the beta test: \"too easy, nerf everything.\" The Wuuf helped Schweitzer re-allocate his priest talents following the 1.10 patch as a favour in return for an undisclosed service Bloodrose did for him, though he hinted it somehow involved his love of gnome feet. Oddly enough, The Wuuf ended up having fear flash in his eyes, crapping his pants and running off when he learned that Flintlocke's guild is seeking the Ultimate Goblin Engineered Weapon.\nMoomoo, the Random Tell Guy: His sole purpose in life seems to be to send whispers (messages) to other players filled with acronyms, abbreviations, non-sequiturs and general nonsense, all the while performing unrelated animated emotes like /dance and /wave. Examples of this include \"wii? wtf!?\" and \"roast beef tag?1\" He also makes an allusion to the DCFX mod for Battlefield 1942 with the statement \"roflcopter.\" No one can understand anything he says, not even Bloodrose.\nThe Unnamed Apprentice: This tauren character was only seen for a few episodes, in which he helped formulate the horde's plan to surround Gadgetzan. His appearance was short, for after having watched Lowping being \"born\" from a ram , he concluded that there were some sickass pervert gnomes around, and subsequently quit the game upon seeing the ram speak as Flintlocke saved his gnomish pal by dragging him into its backside.\nFlintlocke's Arsenal.\n\"The Pweenhammer 360 Mace\" is (according to its less than reputable gnome creator/seller) the most powerful, state-of-the-art single-handed weapon ever forged by mortal hands. It is a mace, a product of both Gnomish Engineering and Dwarven metallurgy, and it is the only weapon that \"Offers a full 360-Degree damage circumference ensured by stainless mithril-plated flanges anchored to a solid truesilver head in a distributed pattern ensuring even wind resistance for a more accurate swing.\" Also noted is \"The solid Darnassian Oak shaft with woven Crocolisk-hide leather grips for added comfort and support, ensuring a hand-hold that will never grow slick with blood.\" But most unusual of all is \"Our circumdynamic weight distribution module built into the tungsten-alloy collar at the end of the shaft. A greased truesilver bearing will shift weight toward the head at the conclusion of every swing, increasing the velocity and striking power by as much as 20% before snapping back to allow an easy follow-through.\" Flintlocke is so impressed by this endless rambling that he buys 6 of the maces, eliminating any possibility of getting a mount, but the relatively cheap price (7 gold), and the fact that the mace has never been actually used in the series and does not seem to be unique or powerful in any visual or verifiable way implies that the mace is actually not so great at all, and hardly worth it.\n\"Tha Chuck-shot\" which made its first appearance upon the party finding a furbolg camp, and consisted of two charges of heavy blasting powder (pushed in with a ramrod), one juvenile woodchuck (angry) (also pushed in with a ramrod), and plenty of dwarven genius. Flintlocke claims his Great-Great-Uncle Triggerfinger Ironstone created tha chuck-shot . His nickname, Triggerfinger, came from the fact that he only had the one finger left... after masterin' tha chuck-shot!\n\"Tha Remote Backstab\" which appeared when the party attempted to pass to the Great Lift (in Thousand Needles) when they came across a tauren . Flintlocke himself invented this manouvere in a bar bet, by using six charges of heavy blasting powder, and then attaching a gnomish rogue (Lowping) to a plunger. The outcome of such an attack was surprising to the group as a whole, especially effecting the Doc, as it bored a hole clean through the unfortunate tauren. (One of the Pween Scene Investigators mentions that bits of the tauren's ribcage were found in Un'goro Crater, three zones away.)\n\"Gnomish Bazooker\" consists of a one-ton bomb stuffed in a hollow log and a grenade as a projectile. It is the only weapon Flintlocke used that did not work.\n\"Beaverstick\" and \"Beaverchucks\" are animal-based weapons. The Beaverstick is basically a dead Beaver stuck to the end of a pike, while the Beaverchucks are a pair of beavers tied together at the tails and swung around like a nunchaku. The Beaverstick was used to fell one of the Everblooming, a tree of mythical proportions.\n\"Ultimate Goblin Engineered Weapon\", though not technically a weapon of Flintlocke himself, is a contraption sought by the party and eventually acquired. It is, in reality, a bunch of guns (and some landmines) strapped to a bomb. \nThe opportunity to use it has come up twice. Against the Everblooming, Flintlocke argued against using it, claiming it'd be a waste of time to use it on one tree, as opposed to the whole forest. It was finally used - with Lowping riding on it - to assault the Horde raid attacking Stormwind. Given the bomb's range, however, it is just as likely to destroy Stormwind along with the Horde raid.\nPlot.\nThough the comics originally began as a series of plotless, non-interconnected sketches which detailed random adventures of Flintlocke the Dwarf, over the years an actual plot has steadily formed. Though it is impossible to outline everything that has happened here, the overall gist is of Flintlocke, Kathrena, Schweitzer, Bloodrose and Lowping searching for the \"Ultimate Goblin Engineered Weapon\", a mysterious device the existence of which is (debatably) verified by a note scrawled in crayon which the five companions found on the body of the ogre Chok'sul. During the endless trek to find the weapon, Flintlocke has ended up angering the Horde due to the killing of several members of it in the Ashenvale forest, and they have since declared full war upon the Alliance. By the time the friends actually find the weapon, buried in the Arathi Basin, the Horde is attacking Stormwind city. The weapon, when finally discovered, isn't what anybody expected. The series seemed to be coming to an actual plot ending, in which the group hijacks a \"diridgerdablerable,\" flies to Stormwind, and drops the weapon on the city, with Lowping riding it in parody of . The man who controls Lowping returns from being AFK at this moment, having just enough time before impact to note that he's riding a falling bomb \"again.\" \nThe series was thought to have ended with the weapon detonating and a giant explosion consuming Stormwind, as the comic was not updated for several weeks after this point. However, on February 6 an update was released showing a drawn comic of Flintlocke standing in a flooded and destroyed Stormwind asking about what the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; is with a message that the comic would continue with the new art style February 27. On February 27, the preview comic was replaced with what seems to be the first strip of a new series of Flintlocke's Guide showing the aftermath of the detonation with Sweitzer falling from the sky safely thanks to a Parachute Cloak.\nOn April 12, 2007, Gamespy posted a notice on the comic's page stating that the series has been ended. This was apparently due to a lack of an artist for the new art style the comic was trying to move to instead of using World of Warcraft's in-game models."}

While the characters from the original strip make some appearances, most of the story focuses on a party of Horde characters. Flintlocke makes occasional appearances while following what appears to be the worst leveling guide ever made.\nMain characters.\nRok'tar.\nAn &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; who starts in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt; and at first levels up quicker than anybody in the history of the game. Rok'tar &lt;a href=\"roleplays\"&gt;roleplays&lt;/a&gt; and tries to stay &lt;a href=\"in%20character\"&gt;in character&lt;/a&gt; most of the time, but sometimes lapses out of character because of frustration (such as when he first encounters &lt;a href=\"Barrens%20Chat\"&gt;Barrens Chat&lt;/a&gt;). Rok'tar's in-character father is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; who is soon killed by Flintlocke's party, enraging him and motivating him to level up quickly so he can get revenge. Unfortunately, he first tries to get the help of PSI: Pween Scene Investigations, a group of Forsaken who may actually intend to &lt;a href=\"Cannibalize\"&gt;Cannibalize&lt;/a&gt; his father's corpse. Rok'tar's first attempts to tame a &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; did not go well and he finally settled for a &lt;a href=\"bunny\"&gt;bunny&lt;/a&gt;, which he named \"Bun'kar\" and insists is quite fierce. After a visit to &lt;a href=\"Malaka%27Jin\"&gt;Malaka'Jin&lt;/a&gt; in which Flintlocke \"decappacappitated\" high chief \"Malakkalakkaboom\", preventing him from getting his new bow, his need for revenge intensified to the point of asking The Shadow Priest how to &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, and was also allowed to spend some of The Shadow Priest's money on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; to buy better gear. Rok'tar killed Flintlocke, and Bun'kar killed Lowping, when Rok'tar and his party ambushed Flintlocke's party in Outland.\nGravy.\nA &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; Rok'tar meets in Durotar, Gravy is played by a stoner and is perpetually high. This means he doesn't roleplay very much, although sometimes he will talk with a troll accent. In their first encounter he tells Rok'tar that he made the character so he could get to put &lt;a href=\"totems\"&gt;funny heads in the ground&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes he hallucinates. In a &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; match he was revealed to have trained his &lt;a href=\"Cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; to a point where he can provide a full-on banquet, where he served up Rok'tar's &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;. While preparing an ambush for Flintlocke's party, Gravy becomes so high that he imagines that he is President Lincoln, and his totems help him kill Kathrena. He is later killed by Flintlocke and Lowping.\nThe Shadow Priest.\nThis undead character's name hasn't been revealed yet, although he is known in the comments board of gamespy.com as \"Bubbles\". Rok'tar and Gravy met this character while questing. The priest is an experienced gamer, in this respect partly similar to Bloodrose from the Flintlocke comic, although he does not seem to be as obsessed with leveling up and getting the best gear as Bloodrose is. He serves as the guide for the rest of the party. After Rok'tar's \"father\" gets killed and the priest's observation that he is just an NPC fall on deaf ears, the priest commits to &lt;a href=\"powerleveling\"&gt;powerleveling&lt;/a&gt; Rok'tar and the others as fast as possible. He advised Rok'tar to tame an &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;; since Rok'tar is only level 30 the only owls he can tame are in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, thus Rok'tar is making a long journey there from &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; and is doing so almost completely naked on the priest's advice so his gear won't get damaged when he dies. He recently cashed in a favor owed to him by a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; Auction House guru named Rigley, who is implied to be an alt of Lowping, who gave him a 5000&lt;a href=\"g\"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt; tip, a part of which was used to buy newer gear from the Auction House. Shadow Priest was reduced to a skeleton, kept standing only \"By shame.\", when Schweitzer unleashed his \"MURDER\" macro on the priest in Outland.\nThe priest also has a booth similar to psychiatric booth from , for \"Shadow Priest Consultations.\", although these almost always result in the customer being &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Face Melted&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe priest says that his arch-nemesis is The Wuuf, another powerleveler. Ironically, one of The Wuuf's custom macros results in the demise of The Shadow Priest\nCheri.\nA &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, and a fairly ditzy one. The Shadow Priest immediately starts hitting on her and immediately denies that is what he is doing. Cheri seems to have less than sophisticated computer skills and doesn't appear to know what \"&lt;a href=\"IRL\"&gt;IRL&lt;/a&gt;\" means, so uses it inappropriately. She really likes Rok'tar's pet bunny, Bun'kar.\nWhile in Teldrassil, Cheri takes out her frustration on lower level Alliance \"nooobs\".\nWhile in Warsong Gulch, it is revealed that Cheri has a history major.\nCheri is last seen as The Doc melts her face, but presumably resurrects later.\nSecondary Characters.\nPSI Investigators: The duo of detectives return, this time with new cases to solve. Although appear more rarely compared to the first series, they still make it up with more silly solving of murders.\nThe Wuuf: The most renowned player in all of WoW reappears, although in a flashback. It is mentioned in a page, that he custom scripted a macro that Schweitzer has (but not using it), called \"MURDER\", which kills Cheri and The Shadow Priest when it was used. (Schweitzer hestiates using it, because he fears the MURDER icon)\nRok'Tar's father: Rok'Tar's father that trained the young hunter everything a hunter needs to know, only problem is, that Flintlocke keeps coming to kill him, thinking that he is a powerful raid boss (because he bought some untrue ebay maps).\nMalakkaboom: Appears briefly. Rok'Tar misnames him \"Malakkalakkaboom\". Malakkaboom said that there is only one \"lakka\" but Rok'Tar still misnames him, forgeting the \"Ma\" or the \"boom\". Malakkaboom is the one that would give Rok'Tar a blue bow upon quest completion. Finally, before giving the bow, Flintlocke comes and kills him, thinking him for Illidan. The dwarf beheads the troll and grabs the bow. Because he cannot use it, he broke it yelling: \"USELESS!\"... but they have a hunter in the group. Before Malakka boom respawns, Gravy grabs his head and uses it as a smoke bowl."}

Welcome to my greenhouse! You mustn\u2019t tarry long though, ha ha. I doubt that the humidity will agree with your delicate innards. I don\u2019t suppose you brought another MLCH-MNCHR unit with you?\nAh, too bad. I expect Boom wants another progress report, then?\nFloopulous! As you can see, it\u2019s a jungle in here. In fact, this is the fourth time we\u2019ve had to move to a larger facility to accommodate the growth of my experiments. The glorious greenery that surrounds you is just the beginning! Soon we\u2019ll be growing super-sized versions of all sorts of vegetation. Hunger will be a thing of the past\u2014not to mention the possibilities involved with the creation of entirely new, never-before-seen plant species!\nThat research has already borne fruit, if you\u2019ll pardon the pun. I\u2019m working on something I call a psychmelon. Not only will you think it\u2019s delicious, it helps you use your melon! Ha!\nThe seeds of all sorts of ideas are germinating in my lab. The secret is my glorious gloop! Yes, gloop makes it all possible. Allow me to demonstrate with the help of Intern Kevin here. Alright, Kevin, if you\u2019ll just fetch that vat of gloop for me. . .\nGreat gloopily floopily, Kevin, be careful not to trip over those roots\u2014you\u2019ll get precious gloop everywhere!\nWhy, Kevin! You\u2019ve been glooped! Quickly, if you just rinse off in the emergency show\u2014ah, nope. It\u2019s too late. He\u2019s dissolved. I\u2019m so terribly, terribly sorry. What an unfortunate incident! Poor Kevin. If only he was an advanced, ooze-based lifeform like myself, he might have avoided the gloop\u2019s effects. We\u2019d all be so much safer if we were all ooze-based. . . . Hm.\nBut look! My glorious gloop is glowing! Fascinating! In addition to its incredible properties as an ultra-fertilizer, I hypothesize that the gloop stores the potential energy of the matter it dissolves. A most curious side-effect, but doubtless of no interest to Dr. Boom. We\u2019re here to solve real problems, after all.\nAh, speaking of which, you\u2019ll prune that bit involving poor Kevin from the final recording, won\u2019t you? And would you please let Dr. Boom know that there\u2019s an opening for a new assistant in my lab?"}

While a small batch of flying machines is unimpressive, they are particularly effective against medium aerial units such as &lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dragonhawk Riders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gryphon Riders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wind Riders&lt;/a&gt; when sufficiently massed.\nThe Flying Machine can automatically detect invisible units, such as &lt;a href=\"Shade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shades&lt;/a&gt; and mines.\nFlying Machines possess the ability to attack ground units when Flying Machine Bombs are researched, although its extremely weak and only effective against buildings; even then, it requires numerous Flying Machines just to destroy a town hall, though it does make them ideal for harassment due to being aerial units and possessing already high movement compared to Siege Engines.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll%20Batrider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Batrider&lt;/a&gt;s can use Unstable Concoction to suicide themselves onto the Flying Machines, essentially killing them in a single hit.

Gargoyles and Hippogryphs possess a powerful and rapid aerial attack that easily overwhelms the Flying Machine, while the Frost Wyrm's high health and damage can take down Flying Machines with ease due to their magic-type attack being highly effective against Heavy armor.\nSpells and abilities.\nFlying Machine ombs (Passive).\nThe Flying Machine gains a weak siege \"melee\" range attack allowing them to attack ground units and buildings. Avoid getting this research to ensure the Flying Machines don't target ground units (and then proceed to get destroyed by other aerial units they should be destroyed in the first place). Only research if the machines are designated for base bombing runs.\nFlak annons (Passive).\nThe damage dealt by Flak Cannons is affected by both &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20armor%20and%20attack%20types%23The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Armor type&lt;/a&gt; and value.\nSo the damage values listed above will actually be double against Light armor,\nand 50% more against Unarmored.\nBattle.net description.\nMechanical &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; flown by a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; pilot."}

There are two types of creatures called chimaera in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt;, one located in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the other in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Outland chimera are mutated &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAzeroth chimaera.\nThe mysterious chimaera are deadly, territorial beasts. These fearsome, two-headed creatures fly above the dark forests of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, spewing forth their terrible corrosive breath upon all who would defy the sanctity of the ancient woodlands. Just the sight of these dark, massive beasts is enough to drive most enemies to retreat. Both heads are equally fearsome on the terrifying chimaera, each capable of its own unique breath attack.\nThe chimaera have developed an empathic bond with the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; race, who train them at &lt;a href=\"Chimaera%20Roost%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;chimaera roosts&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; chimaeras were used frequently by the kaldorei to decimate structures in battles against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, the kaldorei once again used these creatures in battle, this time as mounts for &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Chimaera%20Rider\"&gt;chimaera riders&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, chimaera are not part of the actual military hierarchy of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, as they are simply somewhat intelligent animals with ties to &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, the chimaera assisted the night elves during the Third War not due to a desire to help them in particular, but because the night elves were the largest local force who opposed the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Short of a planetary threat, it is rare to see mountain giants, faerie dragons or chimaera fighting with a mortal army.\nChimaera meat is suitable for consuming. Chimaeras lay eggs that are hard like rocks. According to &lt;a href=\"Jez%20Goodgrub\"&gt;Jez Goodgrub&lt;/a&gt;, they are \"the richest, most buttery eggs you'll find this side of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Way better than boring &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt; eggs, and not as sulfurous as those weird &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; eggs.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Frostwing%20Chimaera\"&gt;frostwing chimaera&lt;/a&gt; that dwell on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Spears\"&gt;Isle of Spears&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; have sharp horns that are easily crafted into spear tips.\nMost chimaeras in the game are found in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, but some larger specimens known as &lt;a href=\"Chimaerok\"&gt;Chimaerok&lt;/a&gt; previously inhabited &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Dread\"&gt;an island&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. A few chimaeras have been found to live in Northrend, on the chilly Isle of Spears in the Howling Fjord. They are identical to the chimaeras found in Winterspring but fly much higher. The &lt;a href=\"Kalu%27ak\"&gt;Kalu'ak&lt;/a&gt; use their horns for rituals.\nOutland chimaera.\nOnce known as &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s, these chimaera in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; have been warped by the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. They have smooth, vibrant skin and alien, bony features. Wherever they are found, they are typically considered a pest. They live in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nuramoc\"&gt;One notable&lt;/a&gt; chimaera also lives in the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, their bodies are very similar to the Outland-version of a &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a hunter pet.\nChimeras are cunning pets and can use their &lt;a href=\"Froststorm%20Breath\"&gt;Froststorm Breath&lt;/a&gt; to attack from a distance. Chimaeras, through use of their &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt; ability, can also slow targets' movement down. Only &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s with the 51 talent point &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; will be able to tame these exotic beasts.\nThere are eight different skins available for chimaera pets. Most unique of mention are two &lt;a href=\"rare%20spawn\"&gt;rare spawn&lt;/a&gt;s: found in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; and the bright in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a mount.\n&lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Chimaera\"&gt;Ashenvale Chimaera&lt;/a&gt; drops from &lt;a href=\"Alash%27anir\"&gt;Alash'anir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a companion pet.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Albino%20Chimaeraling\"&gt;Albino Chimaeraling&lt;/a&gt; has a chance to drop from the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bag%20of%20Pet%20Supplies\"&gt;Big Bag of Pet Supplies&lt;/a&gt;, the reward for completing the daily &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Menagerie\"&gt;Pet Menagerie&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"Mastering%20the%20Menagerie\"&gt;Mastering the Menagerie&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nChimaera are typically strong allies of the night elves, protecting the forests and the great tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; from danger. They are highly reclusive, sentient creatures, but do not possess the ability to speak. They strive foremost to protect the balance of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;. Chimaera hate seeing any natural races or creatures being harmed or oppressed. Those who victimize such creatures under the chimaera's protection will quickly find a chimaera's wrath to be very formidable."}

The fearsome, two-headed Chimaera fly above the dark forestlands spewing forth their terrible breath weapons upon all who would defy the sanctity of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nInformation.\nChimaeras are one of the ultimate Night Elf units. Like &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s, Chimaeras deal massive damage against enemy ground units with an impressive area of effect, though they move rather slowly. Though unlike these undead dragons, the Chimaeras cannot damage enemy aerial units. Until Corrosive Breath is researched, Chimaeras use a short-ranged, magic attack against buildings. Upon completion of this research, the Chimaera gains a second attack that only targets buildings.\nChimaeras are feared if well protected, because a group of six or more can easily destroy any ground unit with ease, including ranged combatants. In the event, they are relegated to base destroyers, try to target Town Halls and immediately run away as soon as someone tries to teleport to defend. Chimaeras can also be used to sabotage the enemy by killing their workers.\nNight Elf players generally build three or four Chimaera Roosts to speed up the production of the Chimaeras. Generally, if the player trains Chimaeras, they are also accompanied by Hippogryphs, and never any ground units. Chimaeras are notorious for killing allied units due to the high splash damage incurred from their AoE, compared to Frost Wyrms. Their high cost and requirement of additional protection mean the player needs to have one or two expansions to properly maintain a force of Chimaeras. It's also important to have your Heroes carry a Staff of Returning to make sure the Chimaeras don't die if they get focused on.\nBeing the only heavy air unit that is only limited to targeting ground enemies, any aerial unit easily counters a Chimaera. Some players may try to use Chimaeras to target town halls due to their longer range, so defensive towers will typically not work against them. \nSpell-immune units like &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s can also work due to their spell immunity protecting them from magic attacks. Alternatively, due to their slow speed, one could grab an ensnare unit (&lt;a href=\"Raider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Raider&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Fiend%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Crypt Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s) to snag the beasts before they get away, or use their own aerial units to pursue them."}

Ugly. Evil. Kill it.\"\nAbilities.\nChimaeron.\nStage One: Truly Something to Behold.\nChimaeron attacks his current target with Break and Double Attack, while continually spraying Caustic Slime at the raid. He periodically casts Massacre on the raid, and his heads sometimes Feud following a Massacre.\nStage Two: A Horrific Creation.\nAt 20% health Chimaeron goes into a rage. This renders him immune to Taunt effects and greatly decreases healing done by players.\nStrategy.\nSimple in concept but more difficult in execution, Chimaeron is a gear check boss.\nThere are three basic phases to the fight.\nChimaeron will wake up after a certain amount of time has passed from the activation of the Bile-o-Tron, although most groups will attack him before he wakes on his own. \nWhen the Bile-o-Tron is online the raid will spread out. The buff will protect players from being one shot by Caustic Slime and Massacre. Healers need only heal people above 10,000 HP. Tanks will have to taunt off of each other after 2-3 stacks of Break.\nWhen the Bile-o-Tron is knocked offline by Massacre, Chimaeron's heads will begin fighting each other but will still cast Caustic Slime. Thus the raid will stack up on top of eachother and will need to be healed as much as possible. AoE heals such as &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Rain\"&gt;Healing Rain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; help. Especially if they are stacked. When the Bile-o-Tron comes back online the raid should spread out again. It should be noted that the Bile-o-Tron is not guaranteed to be knocked out with each Massacre, although the chance increases with each Massacre the Bile-o-Tron \"survives\".\nAt 20% HP Chimaeron will become untauntable, take extra damage and apply a debuff to the raid reducing healing done by 99%. At this point it's a \"simple\" burn. He won't cast Caustic Slime or Massacre anymore, and you will still have the Bile-o-Tron. Save all cooldowns for this phase. Everybody attacks the boss, healers included. Throw everything you have at him to bring him down.\nTanking Tactics.\nChimaeron regularly performs a Double Attack. This is designed to destroy any one-tank strategy. With enough stacks of Break the first attack knocks the tank below 10K health, and the second attack kills the tank. Avoidance can prevent this in some cases, but luck will eventually turn and kill the tank.\nTo work around this you can employ a Break tank and an off-tank. One tank takes Chimaeron most of the time, but immediately before a Double Attack (which happens after a Break application) the off tank taunts Chimaeron and absorbs the Double Attack. The off-tank will often be knocked down to 1 health by the Double Attack. Healers must be ready to rescue him. The Break tank taunts it back after a few seconds. The off-tank should be restored to full health before he taunts. If the off-tank is not at full health cooldowns can be used to improve survivability during the Double Attack.\nThe above strategy causes the Break tank to build to 4 stacks of Break and thus take +100% damage for much of the fight. Another tactic that is suitable for better geared tanks is to swap tanks whenever there is a Break and the off-tank has lost his Break stacks. This prevents Break from stacking to 4, but requires the tanks to absorb some Double Attacks while under the effect of Break.\nOffline phase details.\nEvery few massacres, the Bile-O-Tron gets knocked offline and Chimaeron stats casting \"Feud\". This is the timing of the events:\nQuotes.\nLeaping Leper Gnomes! You're a sight for sore eyes. I was worried the &lt;a href=\"Magmaw\"&gt;giant magma worm&lt;/a&gt; out front would deter visitors.

Cho'gall and remnants of his clan managed to survive after &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was torn to shreds by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s during his quest to find the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; toward the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Fleeing to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and taking refuge within the ruined city of , Cho'gall became a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith the return of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; that followed in his wake, Cho'gall aligned himself and the Twilight's Hammer with the corrupted Aspect and his allies, the powerful &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, to help usher in the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. He oversaw the cult's efforts from his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Citadel\"&gt;Twilight Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, until he was struck down by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nCho'gall serves as a supporting antagonist in \"\".\nBiography.\nDraenor.\nCho'gall was born in &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. As a rare two-headed ogre, he was treated as an omen of good fortune. He lived a life of privilege in Highmaul and was tutored by the most talented ogre sorcerers. He had a natural affinity to the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; arts and gained an immense following among the city's commoners, but not the aristocracy. Cho'gall's arrogance and lust for power put him at odds with the ruling elite, who feared that his growing popularity would allow him to seize control of the city. They attempted to assassinate him and he barely escaped, but was forced to flee from Highmaul. Cho'gall knew he would need more power to exact his vengeance, and as he searched the world for knowledge and weapons he came across &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; was creating a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; to rule the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; behind the scenes, and was intrigued by Cho'gall's confidence and lust for power. He made Cho'gall his foremost apprentice, teaching him &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. But Cho'gall was prepared to break his loyalty to Gul'dan. He only wanted power and was not interested in Gul'dan's ideologies concerning &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and the Legion. The moment Gul'dan and the Shadow Council ceased being useful, Cho'gall was prepared to turn his back on them.\nBeneath the land of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, a society of exiled &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt; lived in catacombs under &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;. They reveled in the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; that leaked from the injured &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;, and through the Void they communed with the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s that sought to bring about an end to all existence. The Pale orcs' dark power rivaled even &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic in potency, and rumors of the Pale and their otherworldly abilities eventually reached Gul'dan. Though he paid little heed to the stories, his master, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, was intrigued. Because Kil'jaeden pressed Gul'dan to ensure victory over the draenei at any cost, that meant investigating the Pale to determine if their magic could strengthen the Horde. Gul'dan sent Cho'gall to investigate the Pale, and if they proved as mighty as the rumors claimed, to bring them into the Horde.\nCho'gall stormed into the &lt;a href=\"Underpale\"&gt;Underpale&lt;/a&gt; expecting a fight, but found none. The Pale did not resist his intrusion for they were eager to share their prophecy of doom: the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, a time when the shadow would envelop the universe and snuff out all life in existence. Cho'gall had little interest in their prophecy but was very interested in their unfamiliar shadow magic. To win the Pale over, Cho'gall used their beliefs to his advantage and claimed that Horde was a weapon by which they could bring about the Hour of Twilight. The Pale reveled in the opportunity to serve as agents of the apocalypse. They committed themselves to the Horde and formed a new clan: the Twilight's Hammer clan.\nAs he too learned to master shadow magic, Cho'gall would see the truth in the Pale's prophecy. It would take him many years, but he would eventually devote himself to their quest.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, the Twilight's Hammer and &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; were sent to deal with the last holdout of non-Horde ogres: Highmaul. Cho'gall was all too eager to exact vengeance for what Highmaul had done to him and personally confronted &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt;, the emperor. With the powers of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, he bound Mar'gok to his throne and burned him alive.\nFirst War.\nIn time, Cho'gall became one of the most feared and respected members of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the First and Second Wars against the humans. Doomhammer considered him dangerous as he was as fanatical as the orcs who followed him. After entering into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, Cho'gall led the failed first siege of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the war raged, the Twilight's Hammer became a problem for &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;. The Pale were prone to disobey orders and too many wandered off, never to be seen again. Blackhand considered making an example of them and wiping the entire clan out, but Cho'gall intervened; so far, he had only been the Twilight's Hammer's de facto leader, and he offered to become their official chieftain to keep them in line. Blackhand let him try, and was pleasantly surprised when Cho'gall was able to keep the Pale obedient, effective soldiers almost overnight.\nCho'gall's success was in his understanding of &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt; and their beliefs. They worshiped the powers of the Void, and the moment they had arrived on Azeroth they felt the Void call out louder and clearer than they ever had before. The Twilight's Hammer had been hearing the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, ancient evils imprisoned deep within the earth that served the void lords. Discovering them had overwhelmed the Pale, driving them into a state of pure ecstasy. It was seen by the clan as a sign of destiny, that they had found the place where they belonged: the place where they would bring about the Hour of Twilight. As for Cho'gall, while he had believed the Void was a force, he had cared little at first for his clan's mad ravings about dark gods. But now, he had proof they existed. He agreed to help the Pale and brought them under control with a simple notion: the Hour of Twilight was not far off, and the Horde's success was the best way to bring it to fruition. Until then, they had to keep up appearances to Blackhand and obey their true masters in secret. The Pale agreed, and the Old Gods seemed please with the Horde's lust for war and destruction, so it was no great sacrifice to proceed with the conquest of the world.\nAs the weeks passed and Cho'gall attuned himself to the Old Gods, he branded the Twilight's Hammer's prophecies onto the skin of the Pale orcs. He then cut off their flesh to form pages, making a book that codified teachings of the Void: the \"&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Canticle\"&gt;Twilight Canticle&lt;/a&gt;\". The book would become a source of power and motivation for the followers of the Old Gods for decades.\nWhen the Shadow Council moved into &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, they were confronted by the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; minions of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. Cho'gall used his fledgling connection to the Old Gods to convince the dwarves and Ragnaros's lieutenants, who also served the Old Gods, to let the Shadow Council stay in the upper reaches of the mountain, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. If the warlocks remained there, they would not be disturbed by Ragnaros or his followers. Gul'dan was angered that he could not have the whole mountain, but was pleased by Cho'gall's effective diplomacy. However, he was unaware of the true reason it had worked.\nFollowing the ascension of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, he scoured the Shadow Council, with Cho'gall being one of the few Shadow Council members left alive. The ogre-mage was able to convince Doomhammer that without him, the Twilight's Hammer would fall into madness again and questioned if the Warchief could afford to lose such a capable fighting force. Cho'gall then swore allegiance to Doomhammer, claiming that he had been manipulated into Gul'dan's service. Doomhammer reluctantly accepted his surrender, as he was unsure if the ogre-mage was telling the truth, however he didn't particularly care as he needed the fighting power to protect the Horde's new lands. Cho'gall also proved his usefulness by introducing Orgrim to the Dark Iron Dwarves, who at Ragnaros' secret command, allowed the Horde to claim Blackrock Spire as their new headquarters.\nSecond War.\nThough Cho'gall was extremely powerful, he was also dangerously insane. The clan, less of a tribe and more of a religious cult, was devoted to bringing about the apocalypse. In his capacity as a chieftain and as the right hand of Gul'dan, Cho'gall aided his master in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, and in the transformation of normal ogres into ogre magi.\nAt some point, Cho'gall personally went to inspect the &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;refineries&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Cho'gall and his convoy were traveling through the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and an ambush by &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; warriors was expected. Doomhammer sent additional warriors to protect the ogre mage. The mission was a success and Cho'gall reported that the Khaz Modan refineries were well maintained and fulfilling their quotas.\nCho'gall and the Twilight's Hammer followed Gul'dan and the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; when the warlock went to discover the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Though he did not enter the tomb himself, Cho'gall was assaulted while defending Gul'dan from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, the sons of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, who had been sent by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the traitor clans that had abandoned the war on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; just before the final push on &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. While many perished on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, some members of the Twilight's Hammer clan were able to survive, including Cho'gall, who had long been presumed dead at the hands of the sons of Blackhand and their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;. While Cho'gall survived, he would then forever have a cross-shaped scar on the chest where one of the strongest Black Tooth Grins warrior had buried his two axes in his chest.\nAfter their defeat on the Broken Isles, Cho'gall and his surviving minions sailed west to the mysterious continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, drawn in by the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. They were followed by &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, who was eager to hunt out the last members of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after the battle at the Broken Isles Cho'gall made his way to southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where he took shelter with his Twilight cult within the chamber of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; deep inside the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stasia\"&gt;Stasia&lt;/a&gt; eventually brought &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; back to meet him. Cho'gall was terribly pleased to see Garona, and even more pleased to see that the control words Gul'dan used on her were still effective. Garona would be a useful tool for him and make it that much easier to get to her son &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, the subject of a prophecy.\nCho'gall had also caught wind of the peace summit to be held in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and came up with a plan that would use Garona to her full potential. Using the control words to bend her to his will, he ordered her to seek out and murder King Varian Wrynn, followed by his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and then the Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. If Garona failed to kill Varian, each side would still be more likely to blame the other, declaring open war on the spot and completely ignoring the Twilight's Hammer and whatever they happened to be up to in the south. And if for some reason Garona failed and got herself killed, it'd be that much easier to get her son, Med'an. He then ordered Garona to forget all about both him and Ahn'Qiraj the moment she stepped out of the city - to her, it would be as if she were working under her own volition.\nCho'gall's plan succeeded in making all hell break loose as Garona and the Twilight's Hammer began their attack. Med'an managed to show up in time to save Anduin and try to rescue his mother - and for his efforts, Stasia caught him, knocking him unconscious and carrying him away. Med'an woke up in Ahn'Qiraj to the dulcet tones of Cho'gall, who was berating Stasia for her failure in bringing Garona back, to Stasia's protests. After Stasia admitted she was just trying to get Garona killed, Med'an tried to attack them both and got himself flung across the room for his troubles - landing right on top of the corpse of C'thun. Despite being a corpse, the thing immediately starting whispering sweet nothings of chaos and destruction in Med'an's horrified ears. &lt;a href=\"Meryl\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; teleported himself and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; into Ahn'Qiraj right into the middle of a very surprised and very angry group of Twilight's Hammer, who were none too happy to see the two of them. After a long battle in which Med'an was rescued they got out. \nMeanwhile Garona decided to kill Cho'gall. After she reached Ahn'Qiraj Garona witnessed the terrifying transformation of Cho'gall as he was twisted into a monstrous mockery of the ogre he'd once been by his \"master.\" Said master demanded Med'an's immediate recapture and gave Cho'gall the power to summon something to help him - a &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20One\"&gt;Faceless One&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone in Theramore tried to fight the Faceless One back, but it was Med'an who managed to kill it with an impressive blast of arcane and shamanic magic woven together. In Ahn'Qiraj, Chogall's \"master\" showed his displeasure at Cho'gall's failure by warping his body even further. Cho'gall decided since the boy couldn't be captured and bent, he would simply have to be sacrificed - and with proper engineering, his death would accomplish what Cho'gall had wanted all along. The energy discharged upon Med'an's death would break the bonds that imprisoned his master and free him to unleash chaos onto Azeroth. Cho'gall's plan all along was to release the Old God.\nCho'gall sought to bring forth the chaos foretold in a prophecy, to weaken the barrier between Azeroth and the elemental plane and allow his master to reclaim its former elemental servants and send them to rampage across the world. Cho'gall unleashed four elementals to attack Theramore, to bring Med'an to him. However Med'an gained enough power to cast a blast that weakened the elements considerably. Later the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; gave their powers to Med'an, and he teleported to Ahn'Qiraj, to defeat Cho'gall once and for all. \nGarona found the &lt;a href=\"Base%20of%20Atiesh\"&gt;Base of Atiesh&lt;/a&gt; within the corpse of C'thun and brought it back to the surface. While Med'an's powers were truly phenomenal, it looked as though they would not be enough to defeat Cho'gall - now a horrifyingly deformed avatar for the Old God - and desperation set in. Cho'gall began the spell that would summon the Old God to Azeroth and signal the world's destruction. In a desperate gambit, Meryl channeled the fel energy that tainted Atiesh's base to Med'an, who used his powers to cleanse it and strengthened himself further. Furthermore &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;'s power fueled Med'an even further, and when he touched the base of Atiesh, it reformed. With the combined powers of the Council, Meryl, Aegwynn and the staff of Atiesh, Med'an defeated Cho'gall, burying him beneath the rubble of Ahn'Qiraj.\nElemental Unrest.\nCho'gall apparently survived his encounter with &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; and reappeared around the time of \"\". His &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Cho%27Gall\"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; appeared around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; speaking with the cultists of his Doomsday cult.\nDuring the fourth phase of pre-Cataclysm &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; event, he commanded four of his elemental lieutenants to attack &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; capital cities. In addition players witnessed his personal conversation with &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Crown Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, who was put in charge of Earth Elementals assigned to invade Orgrimmar and Ironforge. He also praised &lt;a href=\"Hydromancer%20Kulratha\"&gt;Hydromancer Kulratha&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20troll\"&gt;Sandfury Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, sister to the late &lt;a href=\"Hydromancer%20Velratha\"&gt;Hydromancer Velratha&lt;/a&gt;, for strengthening &lt;a href=\"Kai%27ju%20Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt;, a favored pet of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; Cho'gall gave the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; Ogres power as a reward for their loyalty and work for the Twilight's Hammer clan. Despite his attempts though, Cho'gall was pushed out of Dire Maul by adventurers of the Horde and Alliance.\nAt the same time Cho'gall and the Twilight's Hammer were in the process of conquering the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed had already claimed most of it. Leading the clan, Cho'gall also had its members attack various people including &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to buy time for the clan. The ogre-mage, at the bidding of Deathwing and the Old Gods, was seeking to forge the Twilight's Hammer into a powerful army with the Highlands as their capital. To this end Cho'gall and the Twilight's Hammer systematically enslaved hundreds of elementals, spread twilight corruption across the region, and summoned corrupted elementium tendrils from the ground to shape into buildings and walls. They even summoned a massive maw (presumed to be a &lt;a href=\"forgotten%20one\"&gt;forgotten one&lt;/a&gt;) named &lt;a href=\"Iso%27rath\"&gt;Iso'rath&lt;/a&gt; to the surface.\nEventually, as the Alliance and Horde proved themselves to be a very real threat to the plans of his masters, Cho'gall personally sent assassins to Stormwind and Orgrimmar to kill &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. These attempts on the two leader's lives pushed both factions into open war with the Twilight's Hammer alongside the dragonflights, Earthen Ring and Cenarion Circle. The adventurers enlisted by the Alliance and Horde slowly work their way through the Highlands and dismantle Twilight's Hammer operations, before ultimately moving to try and destroy &lt;a href=\"the%20Hammer%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;the Hammer of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis final move is met with failure, however, as Cho'gall appears to claim his new weapon and direct his forces against the adventurers. He himself retreats to the Bastion of Twilight. \nSome time later the adventurers of the Alliance and Horde storm the towering Bastion of Twilight and fight their way through Cho'gall's defenses and the strongest commanders that the Twilight's Hammer has to offer. In the end none of them possess the might to stop the invaders and the adventurers confront Cho'gall himself. Despite his Hammer, his powerful command of twilight magic, and summoning faceless ones to aid him, Cho'gall is killed in the ensuing battle. With his dying breath, however, he sends the adventurers plummeting into the depths of the Bastion where they confront the &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;dark secret at its heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nFollowing Cho'gall's demise, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Cult\"&gt;Twilight Cult&lt;/a&gt; became disorganized until the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt; took over the role of overseeing what remains of the cult. The Twilight Father's legacy would continue, for &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Farthing\"&gt;Bishop Farthing&lt;/a&gt; would succeed Benedictus as leader of the Twilight's Hammer some time later, known now as Twilight Deacon Farthing. He too would eventually die at the hands of a shadow priest adventurer, betrayed by the blade Xal'atath.\nCho'gall's death also marked the end of Deathwing's plan to turn the Twilight Cult into a formidable, large-scale army from within the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nAs with a number of ogres of his type, he actually had two names, one for each head \u2014 Cho and Gall.\nCho'gall became the Chieftain of an orc clan after the previous one was executed for disobeying the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.

The chaotic forces that make up this enchantment can not discern between ally or enemy and will kill a friend as surely as a foe.

He is the final boss on normal mode and the penultimate on heroic, with the final, optional boss being &lt;a href=\"Sinestra%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lady Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;. He is surrounded by minions who must be dealt with before engaging the actual boss.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Under Cho'gall's control, the orcish Twilight's Hammer clan was transformed into a murderous cult obsessed with the Old Gods and their herald, Deathwing. Extended contact with his dark master has hideously warped both Cho'gall's mind and body.\"\nAbilities.\nCho'gall has a 10 minute enrage timer in all difficulty modes.\nMany abilities in the encounter will cause Corrupted Blood.\n\"Corruption causes and amounts:\"\nStrategy.\nPhase One.\nTake Cho'gall to a corner and have the ranged group up in the center. When Cho'gall casts conversion you will need to stun, interrupt, disorient or CC the players affected and this will be much easier in a tight group. The tanks will need to switch off for Fury of Cho'gall. \nWhen a Corrupting Adherent spawns all DPS must switch to it. You must be careful to interrupt Depravity and move out of the way of Corrupting Crash. If you gain corruption in this phase phase two will be much harder. Make certain the Corrupting Adherent dies in a corner and that the tank and melee run out as it is dying to avoid corruption from spilled blood of the old god. The add must die before Cho'gall casts Fester Blood. If you kill it in time you will then need to snare and AoE down the Congealed Blood of the Old God. Avoid being melee'd by these as they cause corruption.\nRepeat the process with the next Corrupting Adherent and make certain it dies very close to the first Adherent. This time you will have twice as much blood of the old god. The third adherent will have thrice as much blood of the old god, acting as a soft enrage. \nIf you are close to phasing and have an adherent spawn continue damaging Cho'gall. The adherent will despawn at 25%.\nPhase Two.\nThis phase is relatively simple, you will take more damage from the AoE pulse depending on how much Corruption you gained in the first phase. If you hit 100 Corruption you cannot be healed and will die. You will still need to swap tanks for Fury of Cho'gall.\nCho'gall will spawn Darkened Creations in this phase. It is very important to interrupt and stun these so that they do not cast Debilitating Beam, which causes corruption and effectively removes a player from the fight. The first two or three waves should be killed, after that burn Cho'gall.\nTip: Cho'gall tank should move the boss to a wall when nearing phase 2. This causes the Eyes that pop up to appear in a semi-circle as oppose to all around. This lets the DPS focus fire on each eye with interrupts and killing them.\nHeroic Mode.\nOn 25-player Heroic Mode, two Corrupting Adherents will spawn at a time, which must both be killed. In addition, double the normal amount of blood will spawn during Fester Blood.\nShadow Lords and Fire Elementals will appear on Flame and Shadow's Orders that must be damaged to reduce Cho'gall's stacks of their buff.\nIn Phase 2, Spiked Tentacles will appear in addition to darkened creations. The raid should move away from them (as they will knock players back) and simply ignore them, as they have too much HP to efficiently kill.\nSolo strategy.\nPop CDs and blow him up. Don't use any abilities that summon guardians, like &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, or Conversion casts will charm the player, resetting the encounter. Just focus on the boss and burn down his health as quickly as possible.\nQuotes.\nA () denotes Gall speaking, while regular text is Cho speaking. In addition to the quotes during his fight, he will say things at various points throughout the instance, such as when &lt;a href=\"Halfus%20Wyrmbreaker\"&gt;Halfus Wyrmbreaker&lt;/a&gt; dies.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "20527", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20527", "title": "Winter's Chill (Classic)", "text": "Winter's Chill is a &lt;a href=\"mage%20talents\"&gt;mage talent&lt;/a&gt; that gives the mage's frost spells a chance to apply the \"Winter's Chill\" effect. Each application of the debuff increases the critical strike chance of all spells cast against the target by 1%. The debuff stacks up to 5 times.\nThe talent also increases the mage's chance to critically hit with &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis talent is most useful when it is maxed out. Any lower makes it likely that the 'Winter's Chill' will not stack, as not all your spells will be applying it; maxing out the talent means that \"every\" frost spell you cast will apply this debuff. Because the effect expires after 15 seconds, a new Winter's Chill must land every 15 seconds to maintain the stack, otherwise it will expire and must be re-stacked.\nNotes.\nThe debuff has a separate resist from the spell; a frost spell that hits the target for full damage may still have the debuff resisted. Also note that \"any\" damaging frost spell will attempt to apply the debuff, including Frost Nova. This talent is highly recommended for frost mages seeking to raid, and is still very useful for frost soloing.\nWinter's Chill versus Improved Scorch.\nThis effect does NOT stack with &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Scorch%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Improved Scorch (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; which provides the exact same bonus. As such, a single charge of either will not allow the other to be applied to the mob, making mistaken Winter's Chill or &lt;a href=\"Scorch\"&gt;Scorch&lt;/a&gt; applications costly in terms of raid DPS and time.\nA mage must decide which to use in his or her spell rotation. While this would naturally follow one's chosen spec (either &lt;a href=\"Mage%23Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mage%23Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;), careful consideration of either Winter's Chill or Improved Scorch may prove very beneficial to one's build and strategy.\nCurrently, Improved Scorch is preferable to Winter's Chill. That's because Improved Scorch applies the full 5% buff with one hit. On the other hand Winter's Chill can be applied by any &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools\"&gt;Frost damage&lt;/a&gt; spell, including &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Bolt\"&gt;Frostfire Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, whereas only Scorch applies Improved Scorch.\nWhen it comes to speed of application, Improved Scorch is fully applied with one hit. Blizzard is the fastest way a Frost mage can apply Winter's Chill. Blizzard gives a debuff \"per damage tick\" - with its 8 ticks of damage, a single Blizzard is enough to stack all 5 applications for the maximum critical strike bonus.\nIn terms of debuff duration, Improved Scorch has the advantage. It lasts 30 seconds compared to Winter's Chill's 15 seconds. This means a Fire mage does not have to Scorch often to maintain the debuff or lower his DPS. However, Winter's Chill is refreshed by any Frost spell from a mage with the Winter's Chill talent, making it the easier to maintain of the two debuffs. Because even high-powered, damaging Frost spells can be used to maintain Winter's Chill, a Frost mage will not lose as much DPS as a Fire mage who has to switch to Scorch to refresh Improved Scorch on a target.\nThat is not to say Scorch and Improved Scorch are completely without advantages. Scorch has excellent &lt;a href=\"DPM\"&gt;DPM&lt;/a&gt; and is good for non-solo &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; as it attracts little &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;, at the cost of high damage.\nWinter's Chill is naturally tied to the other debuffs and advantages of the Frost magic school, namely &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;s. Spells like Blizzard and &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt; both also have &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;s, with the former being a channeled spell and the latter cast at instant speed.\nFor parties and raids, in the event another mage is present who uses the talent opposing one's own, communication must be made so that either applications of Winter's Chill or Scorch do not cancel each other out or that the stronger debuff is used."}

{"id": "653218", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=653218", "title": "Winter Queen", "text": "The Winter Queen is an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt; who rules the realm of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; and its inhabitants, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;night fae&lt;/a&gt;, who defend the spirits of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;. She is charged with the sacred task of maintaining the cycle of rebirth: restoring perished &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, and other nature spirits and returning them to the mortal plane. She and the land are one; when the land thrives, so does she. Her sister and counterpart is &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, who resides in the realms of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they embody the balance of the great cycle of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; and Life.\nArdenweald has suffered more keenly from the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought than any other realm in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, and this has taken a bitter toll on the queen. For the first time in endless ages, she has been forced to choose which of the land's lush groves\u2014and which souls\u2014will be fed the last precious drops of anima and which will fade away forever, a task enacted by the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLike her fellow &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;, the Winter Queen was forged by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; in their realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20of%20Renewal\"&gt;Prototype of Renewal&lt;/a&gt; is an incomplete prototype of her.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Marasmius\"&gt;Marasmius&lt;/a&gt;, in the early days of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, it was just him and the Winter Queen. During this time she was awfully busy and was noted to be a real hard worker. As Ardenweald and its link to the plane of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; was observed by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; apparently before &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was corrupted, the Queen has existed as long as the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; was previously active in the cosmos.\nThe Winter Queen joined with her fellow Eternal Ones in imprisoning &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt; within the inescapable &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to be forevermore its Jailer in response to him attempting to steal their sigils to gain access to forbidden knowledge. In order to keep him bound, she channeled the magics of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that the Maw would be inescapable, and that the Banish One would remain forever bound.\nYears later, following the machine of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; breaking down and the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought which hit Ardenweald, the Winter Queen turned to her sister &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; for aid. Having heard her sister's cries and felt her pain Elune, in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, thus sent the slain &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s to sustain her. However, unbeknownst to Elune, the breaking down of the machine of death meant every soul was being funneled directly into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Thus ignorant that her sister sought to help her, the Winter Queen became bitter towards her for the presumed silence.\nThe Winter Queen personally accompanied the Wild Hunt when they sacrificed the &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s in the grove of &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Noch\"&gt;Tirna Noch&lt;/a&gt;, among which was the soul of the Wild God &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;. The grove's keeper, &lt;a href=\"Ara%27lon\"&gt;Ara'lon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who had previously sworn an oath to the queen to protect the wildseeds\u2014initially lashed out against this effort by attacking the hunters. When the queen herself appeared, Ara'lon told her that he had kept faith that she would save them from the anima drought, and he didn't understand why she would send scavengers to his grove. In response, the queen showed Ara'lon a vision of Ardenweald's future, in which the &lt;a href=\"dream%20tree\"&gt;dream tree&lt;/a&gt;s would topple and the whole forest would perish in the drought. Ara'lon was faced with the choice of honoring his oath or sacrificing Ursoc's soul to preserve the forest. Now tearful, the queen told Ara'lon that his heart was pure and that she would honor his choice. Ara'lon sorrowfully decided to drain the anima from Ursoc's wildseed and subsequently joined the forces of the Wild Hunt.\nBy the time mortals entered the Shadowlands, the Winter Queen was &lt;a href=\"Soulbinding\"&gt;soulbonded&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Droman%20Aliothe\"&gt;Droman Aliothe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Herne\"&gt;Lord Herne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zayhad%2C%20The%20Builder\"&gt;Zayhad, The Builder&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s were assigned with delivering the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;'s warning to the Winter Queen by &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt;. However with her focus on the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought threatening the forests of Ardenweald, the Winter Queen couldn't grant them an audience. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt; was quick to offer them a deal, if they could carry out some her duties, she would seek out and deliver their rescue to the Winter Queen. While the Maw Walker would fulfill the end of the bargain, Lady Moonberry was unable to do the same.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Vaal\"&gt;Tirna Vaal&lt;/a&gt; was prepared for her arrival, the Winter Queen briefly visited the town. After casting a spell at the tree, she left, not even noticing the Maw Walker walking towards her. As a result of this, Lady Moonberry deduced that despite the Maw Walker's aid, the Queen's focus was still divided across the forest. Thus, she and the mortals united with the goal of lessening her burden, and ensuring that she gave them an audience.\nIn the midst of her focusing on the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, the Winter Queen was approached by a group of followers escorting the dying &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen matriarch of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing of Lady Moonberry's request to save her, she questioned why she should save her sister's pet. In response, Lady Moonberry spoke of how those who dreamed by Ysera's side, awake with joy and peace that whispers of wonder, and how if Ysera dies, all that is emerald will die with her. &lt;a href=\"Ara%27lon\"&gt;Ara'lon&lt;/a&gt; backed her up mentioned that while some must be sacrificed, others must be saved, and should they forget then all that will remain will be empty shells and sorrow. Agreeing to their requests, the Winter Queen channeled some of her anima and resurrected Ysera, while declaring that she was bound to Ardenweald, and she will share its fate.\nAfter hearing the Primus' warning, she remarked that &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; stirring was a greater threat than the anima drought. She then remarked to the Maw Walker that the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; was not only vital to Ardenweald but to the protection of the realms beyond. She then revealed that the magics of the heart were used to ensure that the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; would be inescapable. That the Banished One would remain forever bound. However, the drought has caused the Heart to wither, and that its strength must be bolstered. However in light of the lack of anima in her realm, she implored her newfound allies with heading to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; and seeking out &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe, along with &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia the Firstborne&lt;/a&gt;, were stunned at learning from &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; that Denathrius betrayed them by causing the anima drought and sending it into the Maw itself, revealing his allegiance to the Jailer. Though disheartened by this, she joined Renathal in declaring that the Maw Walker could turn the tide in their favor. After Kyrestia agreed to their reasoning and declared that each mortal must join a &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the Winter Queen promised that when their realms regained their strength, they shall stand together against the darkness.\nShe then attended a play showcasing the great deeds of those who joined the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt;. Following the play's completion, she judged it \"an excellent performance.\" After the mortals personally swore their oaths to her, she declared that they were fortunate to call them an ally and declared them &lt;huntsman/huntress&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, champion of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Night\"&gt;Court of Night&lt;/a&gt;, and protector of Ardenweald. She then directed them with seeking out &lt;a href=\"Laurel\"&gt;Laurel&lt;/a&gt;, the keeper of &lt;a href=\"%3ARenown\"&gt;:Renown&lt;/a&gt;, in order to get acquainted with the magic that they bestow upon their huntsmen and huntresses.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the Winter Queen is too prideful to deal with him. Thus he turned to the mortals in her court to aid in discovering who was responsible for the missing &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; wildseeds. After discovering that &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; was behind the theft, the pair rushed to inform the Winter Queen, who initially believed it to be a mere squabble between loa, before learning of the true scope of Mueh'zala's plans. Though loathed to do Bwonsamdi any favors, she declared that Mueh'zala's must answer for his crimes. Thus she called upon the Wild Hunt for battle. She was later informed of their victory of Mueh'zala's forces, news she welcomed, while promising Mueh'zala will pay for his transgression. She then declared that she must attend to Ardenweald, while revealing that Bwonsamdi's fate was not her concern, leaving it up to the mortals. Said mortals then headed off the &lt;a href=\"De%20Other%20Side\"&gt;De Other Side&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid Bwonsamdi against Mueh'zala.\nAfter receiving &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Herne%27s%20Report\"&gt;Lord Herne's Report&lt;/a&gt;, detailing how there was no way to liberate those possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, she vowed that &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt; will pay dearly for the wound inflicted upon her realm. Sometime later, she was approached by &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;Kyrian Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, who requested the aid of Ardenweald's magic to forge a new &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, the previous one having been destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the Winter Queen revealed that while the groves teemed with the magic they sought, only a vessel of Ardenweald could contain such power, and they were precious to her. It was then that the &lt;a href=\"faerie\"&gt;faerie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Willowblossom\"&gt;Willowblossom&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward and offered to help the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;'s prepare a vessel. The Winter Queen warned that her choice must not be made lightly, to which Willowblossom declared her understanding of what was being asked of her, and she swore to see it through. The queen acknowledged her words and subsequently ordered her to prepare the vessel for the ritual.\nAfter Willowblossom completed her preparations, the Winter Queen and her court gathered to enact the final ritual. To the kyrian's shock, they learned that Willowblossom had willingly become the vessel for Ardenweald's magic. After being informed that Willowblossom was ready, the Queen and her court successfully completed the ritual. With the last item needed to forge the Crest of Ascension anew, the kyrians departed, with Pelagos promising to honor Willowblossom's sacrifice. Soon after this, she was approached by Bwonsamdi, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;. After taking the spirits and Vol'jin, due to being intrigued by his spirit being entwined with that of fallen loa &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, under care. After Bwonsamdi then attempted to request something in exchange for Vol'jin's soul, she told him to depart, to which the loa complied.\nAfter Drust invasion force was beaten back from reaching the Heart of the Forest, the Winter Queen was informed of Ara'lon being bent to their will, how the Wild Hunt was subsequently deceived into killing him, and how the Drust now marched upon the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, while conscripting her own subjects into their ranks. The Winter Queen mourned Ara'lon, and declared that their sacrifices will not be in vain. She then called all of Ardenweald for war and called upon the Maw Walker to lead the charge. After reaching the Grove of Awakening, she remarked that while the Drust believed seizing the grove would bring them victory, in reality the grove shall be their downfall. She then sent &lt;a href=\"Droman%20Aliothe\"&gt;Droman Aliothe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Herne\"&gt;Lord Herne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zayhad%2C%20The%20Builder\"&gt;Zayhad, The Builder&lt;/a&gt; to win back the grove's anchors, while instructing the Maw Walker to be the instrument of her wrath. However, despite her fury, the Winter Queen noted that the Drust could have been protectors of nature and thus almost pitied them for choosing to steal and destroy. In response, Gorak Zhar rejected this pity and taunted her about the Heart of the Forest being destroyed. Unmoved by this taunt, the Winter Queen and the Maw Walker reclaimed the grove's magic and disposed of Gorak Zhar. With the Drust beaten back, the Winter Queen and her court celebrated their victory. In the midst of this she remarked that the Jailer's powers grow and with the Shadowlands facing unrelenting peril, the Maw Walker must stand ready.\nThe Winter Queen later fully restored the Heart of the Forest, after learning from Lady Moonberry that they had the anima resources for it.\nChains of Domination.\nFollowing the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt; and the theft of her sigil, the Winter Queen convened with her, &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;the Arbiter's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;chambers&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting Bolvar and the other leaders vowed to stand as one and defend the Jailer's next target: &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;Battle of Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, the Winter Queen was able to deceive Sylvanas into thinking that she had her sigil upon her person, when in reality she had placed it within the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. As the Winter Queen focused on protecting recovered &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, she instructed the Maw Walker to join with Bolvar and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; in checking on her sigil. The three subsequently discovered the mind-controlled &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had already claimed the sigil, and after being informed the Winter Queen declared that their enemy's plan edged closer to fruition. The Winter Queen then ordered for the Maw Walker to return to Oribos and that they must answer for this loss, and action must be taken.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; power was being drained from &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; took control of her, prompted the Winter Queen to arrive, and demand what her sister was doing coming to Ardenweald after denying their cries for aid. The Winter Queen subsequently learned that Elune did attempt to help, and Elune was devastated to learn that the souls of her favored were condemned to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Letting go of her former bitterness, the Winter Queen was quick to reassure her that by their hand they may yet guide those souls unto their spring, starting with Tyrande herself. In response, Elune noted that Tyrande had invoked her and it was ultimately Tyrande's choice to choose vengeance or renewal.\nIn the end, Tyrande chose renewal and released the Night Warrior power, ending Elune's hold on her, and left &lt;a href=\"the%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;the Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt; behind that the Winter Queen used to restore her &lt;a href=\"Sigil\"&gt;Sigil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, she listened as Tyrande spoke with &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii Starseeker&lt;/a&gt; about renewing their people.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, in which Zovaal successfully absorbed the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; into his being and left afterwards through a portal, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; called for the covenants to deliver their sigils to him, so that they may follow and stop the Jailer before he could claim the secrets within the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The Winter Queen answered the call by sending &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the sigil and the steadfastness of Ardenweald to the cause.\nEternity's End.\nFollowing Zovaal's death, the Winter Queen, through a projection, was amongst those who attended the judgment of Sylvanas Windrunner. After the Banshee Queen submitted to the judgment of Tyrande Whisperwind, the night elf matriarch ordered that her penance was to scour the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; for every soul lost in its depths, betrayed or condemned and to send them forth to the &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime later, she called for &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; to meet her within the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, where she questioned if Tyrande had found the justice she sought. However, Tyrande corrected her that she had come seeking vengeance, but within these groves, and by the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, she had found hope, to which The Winter Queen declared that choice had mended a broken bond between sisters. She then displayed the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt; and spoke of how though it was born in sorrow, it would become a vessel of renewal, and that the night elven souls who had been saved from the Maw rejected the eternal tranquility in the boughs of Ardenweald by becoming a new beginning for their kin, with the seed thus embodying the cycle of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. Thus she offered the seed to Tyrande, who accepted it on behalf of her people.\nDragonflight.\nWhile carrying out her duty in the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, the Winter Queen was approached by &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who requested that she allow Ysera to return to the mortal world in exchange for Malfurion remaining behind. Though initially hesitant, the Winter Queen ultimately agreed and switched her bounding from Ysera to Malfurion. As Ysera took flight and headed into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, the Winter Queen declared that the cycle was renewed, that Death and Life were in harmony once more.\nSpeculation.\nSince it has been confirmed that the Winter Queen is bound to her sister and counterpart in the realms of Life, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the Winter Queen may be &lt;a href=\"Lo%27sho\"&gt;Lo'sho&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; continued to live in what had become the bitterly cold continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The Winterax and &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt;s, however, later settled in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the ice trolls' unrelenting hostility toward outsiders, historians have yet to learn how these two tribes were separated from the Drakkari and came to live so far from the ancient site of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Winterax trolls have been invading the valleys of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; and have been fighting the dwarves of the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;. During their battles in Alterac Valley, Korrak was slain and resurrected by his people multiple times.\nOne day, Korrak and his people simply disappeared, along with most of their belongings and supplies. The mystified orcs and dwarves concluded that the trolls had at last given up their home, which, after all, had devolved into little more than a bloody battlefield, and left in search of greener pastures. It was said that Korrak's death would have brought the death of the Winterax.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThey eventually left Alterac Valley and traveled across sea to Zul'Drak. Some of the Winterax trolls were among the &lt;a href=\"Quetz%27lun%20Worshipper\"&gt;Quetz'lun Worshipper&lt;/a&gt;s who tried to sacrifice their god, &lt;a href=\"Quetz%27lun\"&gt;Quetz'lun&lt;/a&gt;, for power. Quetz'lun took her revenge on her traitorous worshipers; however, condemning them to suffer an eternity of suffering and death within a pocket dimension of her own making.\nKorrak the Bloodranger, meanwhile, was empowered by the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; and sent to battle in the &lt;a href=\"Amphitheater%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Amphitheater of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; by the Drakkari, who considered this to be a 'power move. Many of the Winterax were among the &lt;a href=\"Amphitheater%20Spectator\"&gt;Amphitheater Spectator&lt;/a&gt;s watching as their chieftain fought within the ring. In battle, Korrak declared the Ampitheater belonged to the Winterax. He was ultimately slain in the arena, though it is unknown if his death was permanent as the Winterax have resurrected Korrak numerous times in the past.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Winterax%20Speaker\"&gt;Winterax Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike their parent tribe, the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;, the Winterax remain outside of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Tribes\"&gt;House of the Fallen Tribes&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the tribe has survived, despite Korrak's defeat and the fall of Zul'Drak. It is unknown where the tribe lives now; as they were last seen in Zul'Drak. Whether they have somehow managed to make a home for themselves in Northrend or if the tribe as a whole has found refuge in Zandalar is unknown. As with most tribes, they are displeased with the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite this, many &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20Mourner\"&gt;Winterax&lt;/a&gt; make up the procession for &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, mourning his death. They are neutral to the Horde, only fighting back if attacked first."}
