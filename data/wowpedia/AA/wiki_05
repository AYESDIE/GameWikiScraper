In Varian's absence, Anduin was named King of Stormwind under the regency of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and the advise of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. In truth, however, Katrana Prestor was a disguise for the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, who had used her dark magic to split Varian in two. When one half of Varian returned to the throne of Stormwind, Anduin was the first to sense something amiss with the man claiming to be his father. Before long, the other half of Varian returned to Stormwind and unmasked Lady Prestor for what she truly was, but in response, Onyxia kidnapped Anduin and brought him to &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;her lair&lt;/a&gt; across the sea. Despite the two Varians' differences, their shared love for Anduin allowed them to work together to slay Onyxia and save their son from the dragon's clutches; in the process, Onyxia inadvertently fused Varian's two halves back into a single man.\nYears later, in the wake of the Alliance's renewed tensions with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;elemental unrest&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin traveled to the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; as a diplomat and formed close ties with the dwarven ruler &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and his assigned bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Aerin%20Stonehand\"&gt;Aerin Stonehand&lt;/a&gt;. After Aerin and many other citizens were killed in one of many earthquakes that began plaguing &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin witnessed how Magni was transformed into a diamond statue in an earthen ritual gone awry and was later forced to remain in Ironforge after Magni's estranged daughter &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; took control of the city. Varian infiltrated Ironforge to end Moira's rule, but Anduin convinced him to spare her life and instead install a &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; to govern the dwarf clans. Throughout these events, Anduin repeatedly visited his surrogate aunt &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; in her city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and, through a chance encounter, forged a close friendship with the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn contrast to his decisive warrior father, Anduin is contemplative and diplomatic, and around the time of the Cataclysm decided to pursue the path of a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, later beseeching the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; to accept him as a pupil. Similar in ways to Jaina Proudmoore prior to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin sought a peaceful way to end the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; between the Alliance and Horde.\nMonths later, Anduin was shipwrecked on the long-forgotten, mysterious continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. King Varian immediately dispatched agents of the to bring his son home, but Anduin refused to be rescued while there were opportunities to help the inhabitants of Pandaria. Anduin ventured throughout the continent, studying under the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt; and helping to combat the ancient threat of the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;, dark spirits who feed on negative energy. Anduin played a leading role in preventing the Horde's ruthless &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;utilizing the sha as a weapon&lt;/a&gt;, though he nearly lost his life in the process. While recovering, Anduin made an acquaintance in the form of the eccentric Black Prince &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Garrosh was overthrown and put on trial in Pandaria. Anduin often visited the captive Hellscream in his cell, and later saved his life after &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Garrosh's food was poisoned.\nYears later, Stormwind tragically lost its king in battle against the invading &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Following Varian's death, Anduin permanently assumed the throne of Stormwind. In the face of the Legion's onslaught, Anduin grew certain that lasting peace would not be achieved without bloodshed, and as he worked to save lives and fend off the demons' advance, Anduin was forced to reconcile his yearning for peace with the necessity for war. In the wake of the Burning Legion's defeat, a &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;global war&lt;/a&gt; with the Horde \u2014 now led by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 threatened everything that Anduin held dear. Though he led the armies of the Alliance across Azeroth, he remained dedicated to putting an end to the bloodshed, even if meant getting his hands dirty. The war ended with Sylvanas abandoning the Horde, but she subsequently tore open a gateway into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of death, and her allies brought Anduin and other leaders of Azeroth into captivity in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Though the other captives were freed, Anduin remained a prisoner of Sylvanas and her ally, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, and was ultimately subjugated by the latter's &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic and turned into a vessel forced to carry out the Jailer's will. Zovaal used Anduin to devastating effect in order to come closer to achieving his goals, but with the help of Azeroth's heroes Anduin eventually managed to free himself from the Jailer's control. Afterward, he decided that he would not yet return to Azeroth as he needed more time to recover from his traumatic experiences.\nAnduin was named after two venerated figures of Stormwind history: his grandfather &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the legendary &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Sir Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. As of \"\", Anduin is 25 years old.\nAnduin serves as one of the main protagonists in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" franchise.\nBiography.\nYouth.\nDuring the time of renewed tranquility after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was wed to a young, beautiful woman named &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin Ellerian&lt;/a&gt; in a pre-arranged marriage and in year 15 conceived a son, Anduin Llane Wrynn, named for &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and his grandfather &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; visited Stormwind, he also met the recently born Anduin. Anduin gripped his finger. When he was a small boy, Anduin would sneak into the &lt;a href=\"War%20Room\"&gt;map room&lt;/a&gt; and play with figures representing soldiers. When he was three years old, he fell from a pony and nearly broke his arm. At one point, the young prince was nearly stabbed by an assassin who had snuck into &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but he was saved by Varian. Anduin was taught to read by his servant &lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll Benton&lt;/a&gt;, who had served his father and grandfather before him. Having inherited Tiffin's blonde hair, Wyll remarked to his wife &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Elsie&lt;/a&gt; that Anduin was \u2018a boy of sunshine.\u2019\nAfter the dust had settled from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Varian was asked to cooperate with &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. He hesitated but Anduin convinced him at least to go and hear the orc leader out despite Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;'s objections. Varian journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; regarding &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; relations.\nAfter King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; went missing under suspicious circumstances while en route to a diplomatic summit to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind was believed to be going through a state of disarray. At the behest of the royal councilor, Lady Prestor, young Anduin was given the crown so that order could be preserved within the kingdom of Stormwind. As wise a ruler as any ten-year-old has a right to be, few citizens were aware that their true king had been missing for so long, and Anduin did the best he could to allay their fears. It was widely held that the boy would grow to become a shrewd leader one day. &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; acted as the Regent of Stormwind and the Supreme Commander of Stormwind's forces on behalf of King Anduin, with Lady Prestor advising Bolvar on the proper use of Stormwind's resources. The young king placed great importance on learning, and thus provided funds for making copies of various tomes and writings available to the public, an effort overseen by &lt;a href=\"Donyal%20Tovald\"&gt;Donyal Tovald&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn of the king.\nWhen Varian returned, a massive ceremony was held in Stormwind to welcome him home. However, the Varian that returned was arrogant, frivolous, and markedly interested in Katrana Prestor. The people of Stormwind had only been informed that the Defias had ransomed the king, a ransom paid with a painful new tax imposed by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his return, however, Varian seemed concerned only with spending more of his people's money, leaving affairs of state by the wayside. Anduin Wrynn was distressed by his father's change. \nA few days later in Stormwind City, &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was on a visit and was discussing war plans against the orcs and Dark Iron dwarves with King \"Varian\" and Bolvar Fordragon. However, Varian Wrynn was counseled by Lady Katrana Prestor to not send troops to help the dwarves fight against the dark irons. King Magni left disappointed in Varian's subservience to Lady Prestor's wishes and his dishonorable demeanor. While going to the Deeprun Tram, Magni was met by the young Prince Anduin Wrynn who told the dwarven king that he too suspected something was amiss about his \"father\".\nSome time later, Anduin was practicing his archery with his \"father\" and asked Varian how he was kidnapped by the Defias. Anduin further questioned him how he later came into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; for ransom, in reply to which his father told him that his past was a blank and he could not recall any events before his rescue. For Anduin's improvement in his archery, Varian granted him one reward. Anduin requested that the details of Varian's disappearance be further investigated.\nLater Anduin, Varian, Bolvar, and Lady Prestor were riding horseback through the countryside outside Stormwind, with Anduin imploring his father to listen to Stormwind's problems. However, before Anduin could elaborate, his horse was purposely roused by an unknown assailant, causing Anduin to lose control and tumble over a ledge. Varian swiftly caught Anduin, but upon making physical contact, his mind was enveloped with a flashback of past events. Anduin, embracing his father, lost any doubts about him being an impostor. Varian started to tell Bolvar, Anduin, and Lady Prestor about his visions, until Lady Prestor touched him and remarked how astonished she was by his nobility. Bolvar surmised that Varian became befuddled when around her, losing his honor and respect for others. Bolvar became more anxious to discover the secrets of Varian's abduction and sudden return, knowing this would lead to trouble.\nOne day, a second Varian and his allies marched through the gates of Stormwind. Katrana Prestor hastily gathered soldiers only to have the first Varian tell her that she was disobeying the chain of command and was not in charge of Stormwind. Entering Stormwind Keep, the second Varian - known by the nickname Lo'Gosh - declared Katrana's masquerade was over and called her by her true name: &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Onyxia revealed her dragon form and transformed multiple guards into &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, Lo'Gosh and his allies began battle in the great hall of Stormwind Keep. The arrival of Highlord Bolvar Fordragon along with Anduin greatly aided them in securing the keep but &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; was killed moments later by Onyxia. Anduin, surprised by seeing two Varians, urged them to stop fighting each other and face the true threat, the brood mother Onyxia. The great dragon snatched Anduin and teleported them to her lair; daring Varian to follow suit. Regrouping with their friends, the two Varians were left to grieve the loss of their son. Lo'Gosh told their friends and allies that the final battle would end in &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough imprisoned by Onyxia in her lair, Anduin was able to cut through his rope restraints and evade Onyxia's dragonkin guards. Using his wits, he bunkered down in a small crevice where Onyxia's pursuing &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;dragon whelp&lt;/a&gt;s wouldn't be able to reach him. He was able to evade capture until Varian and his reinforcements arrived. Onyxia held Anduin hostage, threatening to kill him if Varian didn't surrender Stormwind over to her. Anduin urged his father not to give in to her threats and Lo'Gosh agreed to fight and die with Anduin if need be. Lo'Gosh threw a knife at the dragon's claw to loosen her hold over Anduin. Anduin fell from a great height but was caught and saved by &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, who had assumed his raven form to catch Anduin mid air. With Anduin's safety secured, the Stormwind army continued the battle.\nLeading an assault against Onyxia, both Varians engaged her in battle. Weapons and magic clashed with her numerous dragonkin, with both sides determined to win. Becoming desperate to end the fight, Onyxia began casting the spell she was going to use on Alcaz Island to kill Lo'Gosh, but Lo'Gosh's double responded by stepping in front of the blast, saying he should die because Lo'Gosh was the embodiment of the true Varian. Not willing to sacrifice his double, Lo'Gosh leapt alongside his other self hoping to save him. The magic spell became disrupted by having the two Varians in the spell, and after a moment of silence Varian emerged, his two halves fused back together. Onyxia tried desperately to incinerate him, but Varian swiftly reached Onyxia's head and impaled her. With Onyxia dead, Varian reunited with his son and friends, telling them that their long and noble deeds would be rewarded and that Stormwind had been reborn with a new hope for the future.\nTheramore peace summit.\nWhile returning to Theramore, Varian was asked by Jaina Proudmoore to meet with the orc Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; so that they may discuss plans to ease tensions between the Horde and Alliance. Varian, however, was still wary of orcs for their role in Stormwind's destruction during the First War and didn't trust them to be true allies. Though he was content with just Stormwind and the Horde no longer being in a state of open war and reluctant to enforce such a peace, he was convinced by Anduin and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; to attend citing that a human-orc alliance may benefit Stormwind's prosperity. Anduin participated in the summit and was thus present when the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; attacked the city. He encountered and was saved by &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;.\nScourge Invasion.\nWhen the Scourge attacked Stormwind Varian and Bolvar went to defend the city. At first, Varian wanted to get Anduin to the safety, but moments later, a Scourge soldier almost attacked Varian from behind and Anduin threw a dagger into him saving Varian's life. Bolvar then commanded Anduin to get atop a city tower and shoot the undead with his bow. Stormwind won the battle and Varian pronounced that Alliance forces led by Bolvar will strike into Northrend. Anduin was saddened by Bolvar's leaving and by the upcoming war. Varian then calmed Anduin by telling him that after the death of Lich King, there will be a world of peace.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAnduin now stood by his father's side in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"throne%20room\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeeks after the Lich King was killed, Anduin became a victim of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, suffering from his nightmares.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nFor a long time, Anduin has longed for peace. He longs for a reprieve from the countless deaths and casualties taken from war and natural disasters. Unfortunately, this sometimes puts him at odds with his father's aggressive nature, which threatens to throw their kingdom into more conflict and war. Though Anduin is wary of Varian's violent outbursts, he understands that his father is a just man who wants to protect the Alliance's interests and that he needs compassion for the burdens he has to undertake to make the decisions of a leader. Burdens he realizes that he too will inherit some day. He took Bolvar's death very hard.\nAlthough his archery and dagger throwing skills are superb, Anduin has no talent for martial training or handling heavy weapons, unlike his father. Despite this, Varian wants for him to become a warrior. Anduin follows a pacifist philosophy and is more compassionate and understanding; concerned more with the preservation of life. Though not considered weak by his father, he is considered soft. King Varian allows him to spend more time in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; while Varian tries to figure out how to deal with the aggressive outbursts evoked from his Lo'Gosh personality. Jaina gives Anduin a &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; she had already arranged to be created for him, which is set to her living room in Theramore and links it to him so that he can easily teleport over for a visit anytime he likes.\nHe later spends time in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; as a Stormwind diplomat. Though he believed that he was sent there to aid the dwarves in such troubling times, to his chagrin, he quickly figures out that Varian hopes training with the dwarves would toughen him up (much like &lt;a href=\"Hjalmar%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Hjalmar Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;'s training had improved Varian's own martial skills). During his time in Ironforge, Anduin also discovered his true calling in life: to be a priest devoted to the tenets of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. For those who know Anduin well, this discipline is a perfect fit for the prince, who has consistently proven himself to be compassionate and thoughtful. While there, Anduin also witnesses first hand the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; as earthquakes wreaked havoc in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the death of one of his friends, &lt;a href=\"Aerin\"&gt;Aerin&lt;/a&gt;. In order to stop the earthquakes, King Magni led a small procession down into a secret place in the city, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, where he used the &lt;a href=\"Tablets%20of%20the%20Earth\"&gt;Ulduar tablets&lt;/a&gt; and was cursed with petrification. Anduin was present to represent Stormwind, and among the gathering of dwarves and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s was the only human to be invited. It may even be possible that he was the first human to ever see Old Ironforge in all its glory. During the funeral of Magni, Anduin for the first time saw heroes like &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the wake of King Magni's petrification, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; returned to Ironforge to claim the throne. Backed by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, Moira ruled Ironforge arrogantly and with an iron fist. She held all the people of Ironforge hostage, including Prince Anduin. Anduin escaped Ironforge with Jaina's hearthstone, just as &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; also happened to be visiting her. At Theramore, he and Baine discussed their problems and their similar situations of being sons of leaders. Through their discussion, both discovered new insights on the difference between right and wrong and what it means to be a leader. Near the end of their discussions, Anduin gave Baine the great mace &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin's reasons behind it were \"it had chosen Baine, as it had chosen Anduin beforehand.\"\nWhen Anduin heard Varian and eighteen operatives were on a mission to liberate Ironforge by assassinating Moira Thaurissan, he convinced the very reluctant Jaina to open a &lt;a href=\"mage%20portal\"&gt;mage portal&lt;/a&gt; to Ironforge for him, stating that while he hoped he would not become king for many years, one day he would and would have to deal with similar situations. Rushing back to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seat\"&gt;High Seat&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of an &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20Potion\"&gt;Invisibility Potion&lt;/a&gt;, he arrived in time to convince Varian to spare Moira's life. Just before Varian was about to execute Moira, Anduin intervened and urged him that it would be better to guide Moira to be a better leader rather than to just execute her. Despite Moira being a tyrant who held the city hostage, she was still the legitimate heir to the throne and killing her would only put the succession of Ironforge into question, thus leading to more chaos and conflict. Whereas if she lived, through her and her son, all dwarven clans could unite. Varian slowly agreed but was also conflicted as Moira had caused so much chaos and had already threatened the safety of his son. Varian agreed to spare Moira's life but stipulated that if Moira was to be a leader and unite the dwarves, she would have to earn her crown by earning her people's respect. In order to take into account the opinions of all dwarves, Varian called for the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Father and son hugged and reconciled while the populace of Ironforge applauded King Varian's decision.\nThe death of Aerin impacted Anduin in another way. Before he met the dwarven guard, he resented training with heavy weapons and often found excuses to avoid it. But since he lost the dwarf who, for at least a brief time, taught him how to fight, he decided to train again so he could become at least a good swordsman, fully aware that he also has the Light by his side.\nSome time afterward, Anduin fostered the growing friendship between himself and Baine by exchanging letters.\nWolfheart.\nAnduin journeyed with his father to a summit of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; delegates in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving in the middle of the banquet; his father started deprecating &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; for abandoning the Alliance in their hour of need during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. During Varian's chiding, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; noticed &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;'s sudden interest in the young prince. When his father abruptly retired to his guest chambers, Anduin was inadvertently left behind and was found talking with Velen about the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Their discussion, however, was interrupted when the young prince's personal guards noticed he didn't retire with them and came to retrieve him. It was later that night, while the prophet was meditating in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Gardens\"&gt;Temple Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, that Anduin approached him again, wondering if they could resume their discussion.\nAfter reflecting on his discussion with Velen, he was certain that the Light had a plan for him but knew that Varian's willful and overprotective nature was holding him back. It was after Anduin overheard the argument between Malfurion and Varian, that he made his decision and informed his father about his choice to leave, stating that he wanted to pursue whatever destiny the Light was drawing him to. When he felt that he couldn't get his father to listen to him, Anduin started to leave. Varian, in a fit of anger and desperation, grabbed his son's arm, inadvertently hurting him in the process. Though he loves his father, this violent act has caused Anduin to be wary of him. Varian then suggested to Anduin that he should study with &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;, in order to get his son to stay in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, but the young prince declined, stating that Benedictus was not right for what he needed to learn and that he needed to go elsewhere, as previously informed by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, and that elsewhere was with the prophet Velen.\nAfter a final plea by King Varian, Anduin said his good-byes and headed towards the Temple Gardens to inform Velen of his decision. After making sure that the young prince was certain of his choice, Velen offered to take Anduin under his wing and noted that he has a great destiny ahead of him within the Light. After the battle for &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin sends a message to Varian to let him know that he will return to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; after his journey with Velen is completed.\nProphet's Lesson.\nWhen human refugees started to congregate outside the \"Exodar\" in the wake of the Cataclysm, Anduin was among them, offering his services and healing the sick. Despite his altruism, many of the refugees resented him for his special relationship with his mentor &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. When Anduin questioned Velen about why he did not warn about the Cataclysm, Velen showed him a vision of a world destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that as terrible as Deathwing and the Cataclysm were, the war with the Burning Legion was a far greater struggle. That night, Anduin had a vision of a universe that was in the process of being utterly consumed by a darkness. But then beings of Light appeared, rescued him from the dark and showed him the face of one of the male refugees. The beings surrounding Anduin said or sang in a melodic tone, \"Each life, a universe.\"\nAs the weeks passed, tension increased between the draenei and the human refugees, and Anduin rebuked Velen for focusing entirely on the Burning Legion while other, more immediate concerns pressed. When the refugees started a riot, leading to a fight with the draenei guards, Anduin rushed to Velen, begging him to stop the needless slaughter. Reminding the prophet of the words in his vision, that every life is a universe to protect, Velen at last realized that he had lost sight of the present world and its needs by being so focused on the future. Stopping the fight between the refugees and guards, Velen told Anduin that he would one day be a powerful priest and a wise king, and Anduin wished only that his father had heard those words.\nDuring his time in the \"Exodar\", he would also spend some time with the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood of Our Fathers.\nAnduin returned to Stormwind for &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;, only to find his father in the throne room shouting at a group of nobles. Disappointed that his father was still ruled by his temper, Anduin left the throne room. He was reunited with his father shortly thereafter by Archbishop Benedictus, who had arranged a meeting for them at Tiffin's grave at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;Stormwind City Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. \nHaving been reminded of their love for Tiffin and of family, the bad blood between father and son soon faded away. Varian apologized to Anduin for being so blind in not recognizing the man Anduin has become, recognizing Anduin's strengths and giving him his mother's locket.\nTheir tender reunion was cut short by the arrival of a group of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; assassins that had followed them to the cemetery, intent on killing both king and prince. The pair fought back, with Anduin using the Light to bolster and protect his father. However, the last of the assassins managed to summon a massive &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; as he died, which eventually overcame Varian's defenses and nearly killed him. With his father dying, Anduin conjured a to protect them and dispelled the drakonid's defensive magic, allowing Varian to use the last of his strength to slay the beast. As Varian lay dying, he told Anduin that he loved him, that he was proud of him, and not to mourn him as this had always been his fate. Though &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; wanted to take Anduin to a more secure location, Anduin refused to leave his father. Praying to the Light, he infused his father's body with an influx of divine energy and saved his life.\nIn his Remembrance Day speech that evening, Varian stated that though in the past they relied on strength and steel to forge their destiny, a time would come when leaders would need to be healers instead of warriors: those who mend instead of those who break. Anduin watched his father with pride and love as his words stirred the hearts of their people.\nCataclysm.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; enlisted an Alliance champion to mentor his son, Prince Anduin Wrynn. After introducing the two, Varian reveals that he has been amassing a war fleet to assault the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; but several setbacks have delayed its launch. In order to resolve the constant delays, Varian has tasked the Alliance champion to oversee the operation personally while Prince Anduin observes. Varian, wishing for his son to gain some life experience but fearful for his safety, instructs the player to escort him throughout his apprenticeship; this escort later turns into unraveling a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; plot where a &lt;a href=\"Major%20Samuelson\"&gt;trusted Stormwind guard&lt;/a&gt; attempts to assassinate Varian but Anduin thwarts his plans.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nWhile Anduin continued his studies about the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; with the draenei, he remained in contact with his \"aunt\" Jaina through a magical mirror. He and Jaina engaged in brief small talk about his studies and when Jaina went to go meet with Thrall, the young prince told her to be careful and to give his best to Thrall.\nWhen word reached to Anduin about the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, he quickly returned home knowing that if Jaina had survived, she would venture to Stormwind. To his utter joy, his \"aunt\" did survive but during the subsequent hug he gave to her, he noticed that Jaina was stiff in his embrace. After answering why he was in Stormwind, Anduin was silent while Jaina and his father talked about going to war. However, as Jaina, in her quest for vengeance, began to advocate the slaughtering of all the orcs, Anduin quickly yelled her name in a mixture of pain, shock, and horror. When Varian pointed out that the Alliance shouldn't rush into the war and Anduin mentioned how not everyone in the Horde would agree with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s decision to use the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina, in turn, berated both father and son: calling Varian a coward and Anduin a gullible child while apologizing for her role for encouraging his naivete in that regard. Jaina then called Varian and Anduin fools and turned her back on them when they cried out her name and stepped toward her imploringly. That night, both father and son had a long conversation about what exactly hatred could do to a person. Anduin mentioned that while he knew why the Alliance had to fight the Horde, he made it clear that he did not want to be like Jaina; attacking with hatred in his heart. \nLater on, as Anduin, Varian, and &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; observed the new ships being constructed for the Alliance war effort at Stormwind Harbor, the young prince questioned if the night elves would be able to fight their way out of the Horde's blockade. Broll assured him and Varian that the night elves were doing the best they can at the moment and that any lives sacrificed had to count; pointing out that the Alliance had a better chance of victory when they were focused together. After contemplating Broll's words and gazing at the harbor, Anduin couldn't help but wonder why the Horde attacked Theramore with the mana bomb. He furthermore mentioned that the Horde had no idea that the civilians were transported away from Theramore. Varian laid a comforting hand on his son's shoulder and told him that he wished he could tell him why people did horrible things. Upon Anduin's inquiry if Garrosh will win if the Alliance doesn't stoop to his level, both Broll and Varian declared that they would never allow that to happen as long they both live and breathe. When Anduin further asked if Jaina would ever get better, his father told him that he hoped so.\nDuring an Alliance meeting, Anduin informed everyone that Jaina had been to Theramore when &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; asked if anyone had gone there following the massacre. When Gelbin, while relieved at her survival, questioned why she was not present in their planning, Varian only replied that she was too impatient to work with them and is fighting the Horde using her own methods. Soon afterwards, Varian was able to convince those at the meeting to commit to his plan to attack &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; itself. Later, both his father and Anduin gave an inspirational speech to remind the Alliance exactly what they were fighting for: they will fight the Horde for justice, not genocide, and would never stoop to the monstrous tactics that the Horde has committed. They will embody the ideals of the Alliance and will gain victory on their terms. At the end of his own speech, Anduin called upon the Light to bless all those going off to war, including his father. With Stormwind's king on the battlefield, Anduin was left in charge of the kingdom and was noted to have two draenei &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s as bodyguards.\nDuring his father's reign, the prince of Stormwind would sometimes use the service of &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to Varian, he asked her to send messages.\nMists of Pandaria.\nA few months before the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin had &lt;a href=\"Varian%27s%20compass\"&gt;a brass compass&lt;/a&gt; made for Varian's birthday.\nWhile on a diplomatic mission, Anduin's royal flagship, \"&lt;a href=\"Wreck%20of%20the%20Vanguard\"&gt;The Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;\", was engaged by the Horde's southern fleet. During the naval battle, Admiral Taylor bade him to the ship's hold where he felt restless and was unable to help injured soldiers. The flagship ran aground into the uncharted, mist-shrouded landmass of Pandaria. Given the code name \"White Pawn\" by the Alliance, he's shipwrecked in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance characters are tasked to find and rescue him. With the hold filling with water and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Bodyguard\"&gt;his bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; dead, Anduin left the ship and ventured inland.\nHe is later rescued from &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; pursuers by &lt;a href=\"Ren%20Whitepaw\"&gt;Ren Whitepaw&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lina%20Whitepaw\"&gt;Lina&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance adventurer discovers his whereabouts several days later through a vision instigated by a pandaren dream brew. After finding Anduin, helping him heal Ren's fever and learning more about the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, SI:7 agents arrive to return Anduin home. He refuses, however, as he wants to find the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Pools\"&gt;Sacred Pools&lt;/a&gt; of the Vale and study their healing powers. He then uses his powers to &lt;a href=\"%3Amind%20control\"&gt;:mind control&lt;/a&gt; his way out of their custody.\nHowever, not long after this he is captured by the Horde vanguard and brought to General &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Grookin%20Hill\"&gt;Grookin Hill&lt;/a&gt;, who identifies him. Fortunately, he slips away from his captors during the battle at &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt; and caught a ride with a merchant's family as they fled west to &lt;a href=\"Zhu%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Zhu's Watch&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, where he met &lt;a href=\"Mei%20Barrelbottom\"&gt;Mei Barrelbottom&lt;/a&gt;.\nMei tells him about the &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Wing%20order\"&gt;Crane Wing order&lt;/a&gt; and on her advice he accompanied a courier to reach the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt; and sought an audience with &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;. He studied with the disciples under the tutelage of Chi-Ji and learned a great deal, but his time there became much shorter than he was expecting. When the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Sha of Despair&lt;/a&gt; attacked the temple, Anduin escaped to the &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Wing%20Refuge\"&gt;Crane Wing Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, where he accepts the help of adventurers of both the Alliance and the Horde in the defense of the temple from the Sha of Despair and its lesser minions.\nAnduin is later present in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where he, the Alliance, and the Horde prove their worthiness to &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, the temple's &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;, in their quest to discover the Vale. &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt;, who is also present, is impressed with Anduin and sees why his &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;High Chieftain&lt;/a&gt; regards him with such high esteem. They are in turn brought to the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20August%20Celestials\"&gt;Gate of the August Celestials&lt;/a&gt;, where Xuen and his counterparts open the Gates to the Vale. After this, Anduin and the Alliance are then found in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the very conclusion of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms reputation questline, &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; are attacking the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin is found helping the defenders by using his powers of the Light to keep the mogu from entering &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandfall.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;'s construction, Anduin reunites with his father. Anduin tells Varian that the war will poison Pandaria but Varian assures Anduin that he is fighting the Horde not out of hatred, but for a love of what's right. Varian asks Anduin to trust him to do the right thing and to also lend him his support. Both Varian and Anduin resolve to work together to protect Pandaria. When news reached them that &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and night elf &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; have been pursuing a Horde party holed up in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin advises Varian to not let the temple turn into a war zone as it is still recovering from a &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; infestation. Sensing that Garrosh was trying to lure the Alliance from the beach, Varian plans on defusing the situation with a handful of champions. Anduin trusts his father to handle the battle the right way and leaves the situation in his capable hands.\nKing Varian later sends Anduin and the Alliance player to negotiate with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; the withdrawal of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; claim fealty to the Horde and represent a major threat to the war effort. Jaina Proudmoore however, refused; citing a desire to maintain Dalaran's neutrality. Her reason being that despite her disdain for Garrosh, Dalaran could serve as a beacon of hope for peace. By showing the world that both Alliance and Horde can trust each other and work together in their city, the world would be able to believe that they could eventually be above the war.\nLater on, Anduin summons the player to meet him in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Exchange\"&gt;Imperial Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, he explains that the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt; brought back a sha sample from their expedition from &lt;a href=\"Mogujia\"&gt;Mogujia&lt;/a&gt;. He goes on to say that it escaped containment and that it has begun to infect some of their own men. Both the Alliance champion and Anduin work together to cleanse the Sha infestation. After completing the cleansing, Anduin and the champion arrive in time to see the Alliance's dignitaries and allies arrive. With everyone in attendance, they start the proceedings of their summit. Anduin reports to Varian that it was the Sha energy that was causing their troops to act so violently. Though Varian is confident that the Alliance could defeat any foe, Anduin advises Varian to not underestimate the Sha as it feeds on one's innermost weaknesses, twisting and manipulating their thoughts. Just then, an &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Echo of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; manifests and Jaina Proudmoore restrains it in an ice block. Many of the dignitaries are shocked or horrified by its dark power, while others see merit in the Sha and want to study or weaponize the Sha's energy. Varian asks for Anduin's opinion on the matter and he states that while it may be possible to harness the Sha's power as a weapon, they risk destroying their own people in the process, a price that he is not willing to pay. Varian concurs with his son's assessment and destroys the Sha, thereby forbidding its use.\nAnduin then accompanied &lt;a href=\"Sarannha%20Skyglaive\"&gt;Sarannha Skyglaive&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Korune\"&gt;Ruins of Korune&lt;/a&gt; where the Alliance found and teleported the Divine Bell to Darnassus. The Horde managed to steal the bell from the city, which was the reason for the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purging of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. After the purge, Anduin met with Varian and Jaina at Lion's Landing and witnessed Jaina pledge the Kirin Tor to the Alliance but also the ruined negotiations to get the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;Sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance as a consequence of her actions.\nAfter hearing about the Horde's acquisition of the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin began searching for a means to counter its power. His research has led him to an item known as the Harmonic Mallet. The Harmonic Mallet was last seen in the hands of the Monkey King. The tomb of the &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20King\"&gt;Monkey King&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Tomb of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt;, where he and his mogu adversary are frozen in jade. As legend has it, the Monkey King and a &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt; named the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jade%20Warlord\"&gt;The Jade Warlord&lt;/a&gt;\" were in the middle of a duel until both of them somehow became petrified in jade. Anduin discovered an incantation to release him from the jade imprisonment but it would release the Jade Warlord as well. After the Alliance champion defeats the Jade Warlord, the Monkey King asks the champion to solve his three riddles in exchange for the whereabouts of the &lt;a href=\"Harmonic%20Mallet\"&gt;Harmonic Mallet&lt;/a&gt;: an instrument used by the Pandaren rebels in ancient times to counter the mogu's Divine Bell by turning its power into pure harmony. After solving his riddles, the Monkey King revealed that he had to break the mallet and sent his minions to hide its pieces in the far away corners of Pandaria in order to prevent it from falling into Mogu hands. Anduin and the Alliance player then go on a quest to reassemble the Harmonic Mallet.\nWhen news reached the Alliance that Horde forces were amassing in huge numbers at &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Emperor's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, everyone expected Garrosh to use the Divine Bell. Knowing that time was of the essence, Anduin stole the Harmonic Mallet and went to stop Garrosh personally. The player witnesses Garrosh make a speech about the Horde's grand destiny, and how he will use the Divine Bell to erase weakness from his orcs and create a stronger Horde. Garrosh rings the Divine Bell and it turns his &lt;a href=\"kor%27kron\"&gt;kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; into Sha. After they are dispatched by the player, Prince Anduin Wrynn intervenes and tries to deter Garrosh from using the Divine Bell. Anduin's pleas fell on deaf ears, however, and Garrosh used the Divine Bell to sha infest his champion &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt;, who the player then has to fight. Though Garrosh encouraged his troops to master the Sha energy, in the end, none of his champions were able to do so. In the aftermath of the battle, Anduin used the &lt;a href=\"Harmonic%20Mallet\"&gt;Harmonic Mallet&lt;/a&gt; to turn the Divine Bell's chaos into pure harmony. This stuns Garrosh but Garrosh recovers and strikes at the bell and destroys it; causing the rubble to fall on Anduin and crushing his body. Believing him dead, Garrosh lets the Alliance champion live to relay the fate of Anduin to King Varian; thereby illustrating the price for his continued defiance. The player discovers that Anduin still lives, albeit badly injured in Garrosh's unprovoked assault, and retrieves Anduin's broken body from the ruins. Using a signal flare for immediate evacuation, they fly to Lion's Landing where Varian mourns and tends to his son, ordering for &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; to be sent to their location at once. Both Varian and Jaina Proudmoore are furious at this assault and swear to make Garrosh pay. Varian sent for Velen who did the initial healing. He told him that the pain probably would never disappear entirely, and there was a good chance it would increase with age. Years later, the pain became an indicator of danger.\nRise of the Thunder King.\nAnduin was ultimately healed by pandaren mistweavers but is still recovering from his injuries. Despite objections from his father, Anduin insists on wandering around talking to people. He is revealed to be in the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20in%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Tavern in the Mists&lt;/a&gt; recovering from his wounds and escorted by Alliance guards and by &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt;. There he met &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and has been discussing the militant events of Pandaria with him. Anduin later starts playing the pandaren board game &lt;a href=\"Jihui\"&gt;Jihui&lt;/a&gt; with Wrathion. As they play, he and Wrathion discuss &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King, and his leadership style; to which they disagree with each other if whether his tyrannical and brutal reign should be applauded or not. Anduin disapproves of Wrathion's hard cutthroat outlook and Wrathion likewise thinks Anduin too soft. Although suspicious of the black dragon and thinking that he shouldn't be trusted, Anduin is still intrigued by him. When Wrathion starts plotting with the player to confiscate &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; technology, Anduin warns the player to be wary of Wrathion and the reckless pursuit of power lest they end up traveling the same dark path as &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, Anduin becomes suspicious of Wrathion's schemes and asks him what he and the player are up to. Wrathion tells Anduin he has nothing to hide and invites Anduin to accompany him and the player to &lt;a href=\"Mason%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Mason's Folly&lt;/a&gt;, where they partake in the scenic views and Wrathion gifts the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;Crown of Heaven&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin warns the player to think twice before putting the Crown of Heaven on. When the adventurer brings the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;Heart of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, he felt a chill within him at the first sight of it. Then Wrathion takes the heart from the adventurer and Anduin expressed his surprise and revulsion as Wrathion without warning, ate it and began to reveal memories in his head that Anduin didn't understand. After that, Anduin says aloud that he doesn't trust Wrathion; Wrathion replies that \"[he] is wise not to.\"\nTimeless Isle.\nAnduin appears on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by two &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Royal Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;s, standing by a table with &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. At the conclusion of &lt;a href=\"Time%20Keeper%20Kairoz\"&gt;Time Keeper Kairoz&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin notes that time is frozen on the isle, and asks what could have created such an effect, to which Kairoz replies that this is what he wants to find out.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAnduin along side with the rest of the Alliance forces bore witness to a defeated &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. When Varian returns to his faction, Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; advised the High King to \"dismantle the Horde\". Varian commands his guards to march with him towards the Horde side and Anduin, confused of what he intended to do, questioned him of what he was doing. Varian responded to him, \"What a king must do.\" He then witnessed his father negotiate a peace with the Horde.\nWar Crimes.\nBy the time the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; started and the leaders of Azeroth gathered, Anduin was already in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. Once reunited with his father, he stood by his teacher, Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he was seen in &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt; having dinner. When the first day of the trial started, he revealed he had invited &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to witness the proceedings. After hearing the charges against Garrosh, he felt sorry for &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; for having to defend him. When Baine, who acted as Garrosh's defense attorney, and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, who acted as Garrosh's prosecutor, finished their speeches, Anduin wanted to support Baine but was instead taken by his father outside of the trial proceedings so he wouldn't have to interact with Garrosh. Anduin was shocked when he saw Tyrande's first vision about the orcs and draenei on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Although he has learned about the violent history between the two races, he didn't know it was so brutal. When Velen, as the first witness, returned to his seat, Anduin went out for a walk accompanied by Wrathion and discussed Tyrande's strategy. Anduin asked Wrathion whether he considers him a friend to which Wrathion responded that he did. During the second hearing, he watched the visions of the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Kelantir%20Bloodblade\"&gt;Kelantir Bloodblade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frandis%20Farley\"&gt;Frandis Farley&lt;/a&gt; as well as the reactions of &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to them. Anduin approved of Kelantir's courage.\nDuring the second day of the trial, Anduin was called as the fourth witness. He retold the events of Theramore's meeting and how he stopped Garrosh from using the Divine Bell. Anduin revealed that he didn't intervene immediately because he feared what it would do to &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt;. Baine's questions eventually led the prince to say that he didn't want revenge after the Divine Bell incident and closed by saying that he believes Garrosh can change. Afterwards when the Wrynns went to have a meal, the prince encountered &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; and told her he understands her anger at his responses at Garrosh's trial whilst she responded that she understood his decision. After that, Anduin was brought to &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and Baine who revealed that Garrosh wishes to meet the prince. Anduin agreed and convinced his father to believe in him. Garrosh asks Anduin if he believes in destiny. Garrosh continued to question him if he chose the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; or if the Light chose him. Anduin didn't know what to say even though he studied as a priest. Garrosh set an example of a &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;golden-haired, beloved human prince that was a paladin, and yet he turned his back on the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin quickly responded that he was nothing like him. When the hearing of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; was done, Anduin met with Garrosh and they spoke about the new Warchief as well as about what would Garrosh do if there was a peace between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; that mutually benefited both factions. That led Garrosh to send Anduin away.\nWhen the fifth day ended, the prince once again went to see the former Warchief. Anduin wanted to understand Garrosh's reasoning but he retorted that he would never understand. During the sixth day, it was revealed how Anduin, Jaina, and Baine worked together in the past to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;. Varian was angered by his son and Jaina conducting political moves without conferring with him and upon returning to Violet Rise, Anduin witnessed Varian arguing with Jaina. After that, he learned that Varian is going to be Baine's last witness. After the following dinner, the prince met with Wrathion once more and conversed about the recent events. During the seventh day, he watched the vision of Theramore's obliteration and on the last day he heard the closing argument. After &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; came to say goodbye to the Wrynns, Anduin went to visit Garrosh one last time. On his way to Garrosh's cell, Anduin noticed Vereesa lost in her thoughts. She suddenly noticed him, and supposing that perhaps it's the work of the Light, told him that Garrosh's last meal is poisoned, before leaving for Dalaran. Immediately he ran to Garrosh's cell, convincing the brothers &lt;a href=\"Li%20Chu\"&gt;Li&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lo%20Chu\"&gt;Lo&lt;/a&gt; to let him enter for the last time. Anduin and Garrosh's last conversation was even more harsh and antagonistic. While Garrosh mocked him, the pandaren brought him his last meal. As the prince was going to tell him about the poison, Garrosh told him that when he is king, the orcs will march to Stormwind and they will raze it to the ground and the Stormwindians will wish &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin&lt;/a&gt; had miscarried. Anduin didn't know what to do - to watch Garrosh die, or to intervene. As Garrosh took his bowl and was about to take a bite from his meal, Anduin kicked the bowl. The meal spread across the cage and Garrosh took the Prince's arm in anger, twisting it and was about to tear it off. At this moment, a rat emerged and began eating the spilled meal and after a few seconds, died. Garrosh then let Anduin go and Anduin healed his arm with the Light, leaving without further words. He told the Chu brothers to remove Garrosh's chains from his feet during the final verdict of the hearing in order for Garrosh to stand as a warrior. After that, he sought &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Fei\"&gt;Yu Fei&lt;/a&gt;, the pandaren trial courier, and sent Vereesa a message: \"He lives. I will not make &lt;a href=\"Giramar\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Galadin\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; both fatherless and motherless. What you do now is your choice.\" Vereesa's response was: \"&lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; thanks him\".\nAfterwards, he returned to his seat and watched Garrosh's last speech. As he was watching him, Anduin was astounded by Garrosh being unapologetic for his criminal actions. Anduin was later called for by his father and the two went to the entrance of the temple. With &lt;a href=\"Go%27el\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt;, they all sensed something was wrong as &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; went missing. The Prince started looking for her and he returned to the cell and found the Chus knocked out in front of the prison's door. He healed them quickly and they told him that two women with crossbows had attacked them. Suddenly they heard a gnomish voice from inside the cell. The voice belonged to Chromie, who revealed to Anduin that &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; is going to use the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; for something. As Anduin turned, he saw Wrathion and understood that the Black Prince and his two bodyguards, &lt;a href=\"Left\"&gt;Left&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Right\"&gt;Right&lt;/a&gt;, were in league with Kairoz. The Black Prince told him that he is doing what is right for &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and that he hopes that one day Anduin will understand that. Wrathion concludes that he hopes the two of them will fight against a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;common enemy&lt;/a&gt; as brothers in the future. The dragon held up a hand and caused Anduin to faint. Once awoken, he heard noises and when he returned to the main area, he entered chaos. He saw himself - King Anduin Wrynn from an alternate universe wielding &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; - and was warned by him of the hunter Vol'jin who preyed on his people and collected elven and human ears as a necklace. Prince Anduin took Fearbreaker from his alternate universe counterpart's hands and started attacking the alternate universe Vol'jin. However, the troll gained the upper hand and as he was about to kill Anduin, the King Anduin from the alternate universe lunged himself at Vol'jin, but the troll overpowered King Anduin and stabbed him. As he was about to take his ear, Chronormu snatched the hunter and tossed him across the arena. Chromie explained that understanding the essence of his counterpart returns him to his world. The prince kneeled by his alternate counterpart and told the king that their father lives in this reality. With this, King Anduin died and his body vanished. Prince Anduin then began healing other fighters caught in the fray.\nAfter the chaos ended, he ran to his father and saw Jaina was dying from a wound. He started healing her but did not have the strength to save her. He then witnessed &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;'s gift of resurrection and heard Chromie saying that it was Kairoz who orchestrated this attack. Anduin added that Wrathion supported Kairoz in this machination too. Ultimately, he heard the sentence of the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s - that every person here was judged, a fact he had grasped earlier.\nLegion.\n\"Heir to the throne of Stormwind, Anduin is wise beyond his years. Time and again, he has used diplomacy to end conflict, inspiring even his warrior father to lay down arms in pursuit of peace. But diplomacy has its limits, and some villains can't be reasoned with. As the Burning Legion threatens to annihilate Azeroth, Anduin will learn the true cost of peace... and whether he's willing to pay it.\"\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Varian and his fleet traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to battle the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic threat head-on, leaving Anduin behind in Stormwind. The battle ended in disaster, as Varian lost his life in the battle and the remaining Alliance forces barely got out alive due to the Horde's unexpected retreat.\nAt the memorial service for King Varian, Anduin was unable to speak formally. He also received a letter that Varian had written before the disastrous battle from a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;veteran of the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. When the discussion among the Alliance's leaders transitioned to how to respond to the Horde's treachery at the Broken Shore, Anduin agreed with &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; that the Alliance must focus on the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and work with the Horde to that end. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; however, blamed Varian's death on the Horde leaving the Alliance to die and wants to fight them as well. She insisted that her mages would never work with the Horde again and left, as Anduin mourns his father's death, the disaster on the Broken Shore, and Jaina's and Genn's fixation on revenge. He couldn't blame Jaina or Genn for feeling the way that they did, but insisted there was a better way. Following the service, the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; envoy &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt; uncovered Burning Legion infiltrators plotting to attack the Alliance racial leaders, notably the newly crowned King Anduin, during their time of mourning and aided Alliance forces in repelling the demons. Grateful for the Illidari's assistance, King Anduin allowed the Illidari to establish a temporary camp in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt; and tasked an Alliance champion to act as his envoy to them while cautioning the adventurer to keep an eye on them lest their dark powers consume their new allies.\nAnduin later sent a force led by &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; to aid distinguished Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; in obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience\"&gt;A Royal Audience&lt;/a&gt;, started when an Alliance champion reaches Prestige Rank 2, Anduin can be found in Stormwind Keep alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. He hosted the ceremony that congratulated the champion for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; as well as an artifact appearance.\nAnduin was advised by &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; disguised as &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; for a time, receiving lies.\nThe compass.\nFor those of the Alliance, the loss of King Varian Wrynn at the Broken Shore echoed throughout Azeroth. But for his son, Anduin Wrynn, that loss was felt most keenly as he faced not only the loss of a father, but took on new responsibilities as a king.\nAt the Broken Shore, an Alliance hero discovered &lt;a href=\"Varian%27s%20compass\"&gt;Varian's compass&lt;/a&gt;, lost during the initial attack on the Broken Shore, at the bottom of the sea. The adventurer brought the compass to Anduin, who was stunned and realized that he hadn't had time to mourn after his father passed away. The king thanked the adventurer.\nAll was quiet until Genn called for the same adventurer to meet him at Stormwind Keep. Genn mentioned that the king had not been the same ever since the adventurer brought the compass back, mentioning that Anduin had become listless and distracted. Genn sent two guards to surveil him and they said that the king had been praying at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Genn asked the adventurer to remedy the king's melancholy by going to him and convincing him to resume his duties.\nThe adventurer found Anduin at the cathedral, praying to the Light for answers. Anduin felt forlorn, believing that he hadn't earned his father's crown and that his people didn't have faith in him. He decided to travel around the city to see what his people thought of him. To do this, he used a spell that disguised him in dark, hooded clothing. He passed by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;royal guards&lt;/a&gt; and made his way to &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; with the adventurer.\nAlong the way, they came across &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Pitts\"&gt;Roy Pitts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jenny%20Winslow\"&gt;Jenny Winslow&lt;/a&gt;. The two were having a conversation of whether they would be safe under Anduin should the Legion come to Stormwind. Another conversation was encountered with the two children &lt;a href=\"Karyn\"&gt;Karyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dougie\"&gt;Dougie&lt;/a&gt;. Dougie was pretending to be Anduin but Karyn convinced him to be Varian because he was tougher. Arriving to Varian's memorial, Anduin spoke about how he had been praying to the Light for guidance and to know if his father's spirit was at rest, and that while his people liked him and respected him, they didn't believe in him the way they had believed in Varian.\nContent knowing how his people felt, Anduin wanted to know how his advisers felt about him, fearing that they didn't trust him, and returned to the keep on his gryphon with the adventurer close by. Arriving at the keep, he found Genn and Velen discussing him. Velen held Anduin in high regard, saying that a vision had shown him the boy becoming a great leader. Genn, on the other hand, felt that Anduin didn't have the mettle to succeed, pointing out how he didn't have the experience of the Broken Shore and how a compass had managed to easily break his spirit.\nAgreeing with Genn, Anduin decided to travel to the Broken Shore to see with his own eyes the threat they faced. He left the adventurer behind to tell Velen of his plan. While Velen believed that the Broken Shore was dangerous, he also understood that this experience was necessary for Anduin and sent the adventurer to keep an eye on the king.\nThe adventurer found Anduin at a campfire with a bunch of monks and accompanied him to &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Ruin\"&gt;Soul Ruin&lt;/a&gt;, where they put the lost souls of Alliance soldiers to rest. Afterwards, they made their way to &lt;a href=\"Wrynnfall\"&gt;Wrynnfall&lt;/a&gt;, where Genn was showing Velen the site of Varian's death. Velen commented that Anduin didn't know the Legion like they did. Anduin stepped up and revealed himself, much to Genn's initial shock, which quickly turned to sorrow. Revealing his worries and doubts about living up to his father's legacy, the young king found one of his father's swords comprising &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; under the ash and sand and fell to his knees. Genn knelt before a despairing Anduin to speak to him face-to-face and tell him how Varian's heroic actions were a challenge to them to never let fear prevail, even at the very gates of hell. Before Anduin's eyes appeared an image of Varian, whom Anduin asked what he was supposed to do now; Varian simply responded, \"What a king must do.\" In that moment, as Anduin accepted the duties of a king, the sword began to glow in his hands, not with the red-orange hue of a warrior but with the golden glow of a priest. At that moment, Anduin began to heal.\nThe king didn't tell anyone about what he had experienced when he sensed Varian's presence, not even Velen, who would have understood.\nSon of the Wolf (present).\nBy this point, Anduin had recovered Varian's second sword as well and wielded the combined Shalamayne.\nWhile Anduin was rereading his father's letter, he silently contemplated his new duties as king. While musing that this was not the coronation he had dreamed of as a boy, a lone soldier entered the room, saying that he had brought good news from the Broken Shore. He then said \"It seems the war is over... \"for you\"\" before erupting in &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy and lunging towards the king with a dagger in hand. In response, Anduin grabbed his wrist before incapacitating him in a magical web. When &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rivers\"&gt;Captain Rivers&lt;/a&gt; and the guards arrived, Anduin, now standing in front of the trapped &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, calmly told them to sweep the rest of the castle to make sure that the assassin was working alone. Once he and the demon were alone again, Anduin began questioning him what the Legion hoped to achieve, saying that the Alliance would not fall because one or even two leaders died. The nathrezim replied that it already had, that \"the wolf\" \u2014 Varian \u2014 was already dead and that the rest of the Alliance would soon join him in the grave. When Anduin said that the demon clearly knew nothing of the Alliance's resolve, the dreadlord responded by saying that the Legion knew everything and that Anduin was nothing like the wolf \u2014 that Varian had hoped to raise a warrior, but had instead raised a foolish runt who dreamed of peace where there could never be any, that Anduin had made the wolf weak by &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;befriending his foes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;standing in his way&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadlord then claimed that even though the new king had now seen the truth by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;trading words with warriors and nearly dying for it&lt;/a&gt;, he could not hope to stand against those who had killed his father and that he would only lead the Alliance to ruin. However, the nathrezim then made an offer: by joining the Burning Legion, Anduin could achieve the peace he had always strived for. Anduin replied that he was indeed a man of peace, that he was the light that remained after his father's death, and that he would \"finish this\". He then focused &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;holy energy&lt;/a&gt; into the shape of a hammer before using it to strike the nathrezim's chest, instantly killing it and shattering its body into smoldering fragments. Anduin mused that while he had indeed changed his father, Varian had also changed him. He wondered if that would be enough for the Alliance and for Azeroth, and resolved that it would have to be and that there would be peace one day.\nThe Wound.\n&lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, lord of the Burning Legion, was eventually defeated, but not before he managed to wound Azeroth greatly in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. King Anduin ordered &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of to investigate the destroyed land and report back. Despite their losses, Anduin gave a hopeful speech at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind to the Alliance, after which he was approached by Spymaster Shaw and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; for a private meeting. Shaw reported that many &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s had been digging up a &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;mysterious new substance&lt;/a&gt; in Silithus. Though they did not know what this substance was, it seemed that the Horde did know. Anduin said they had to learn more, and Shaw assured him that SI:7 was already on it.\nBefore the Storm.\nAnduin later had a meeting with his councilors in Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"map%20room\"&gt;map room&lt;/a&gt;. Among Anduin's councilors were: Shaw, Greymane, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt;; all of whom Anduin asked for their opinions on Azerite. When Admiral Rogers suggested weaponizing it, Anduin reproached her and proposed to use Azerite for more benevolent applications. Greymane however, thought Sylvanas would use it for destructive purposes and so should the Alliance. Anduin argued that perhaps the Alliance should seek to be more righteous in their use of Azerite than the Horde and though he was sure they could take pragmatic measures to mitigate the Horde threat, he thought that with enough knowledge they could also set out to focus on the non-destructive capabilities of Azerite. Anduin proposed involving the other Alliance nations in their discovery and seek their aid in understanding the enigmatic mineral. Anduin also revealed his plans to travel to the other member nations of the Alliance so that he may strengthen their diplomatic bonds and provide economic aid. Greymane however, reminded Anduin that he is king of Stormwind and his people needed him there, adding that Gilneas for their part, needs no royal visit. When Anduin transitioned the conversation of how his travels to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; has benefited his development as a leader, Greymane stressed to Anduin that his safety and presence is integral to the stability of his kingdom and the dangers of him adventuring with no successor to his throne. Even so, Anduin firmly believed that although Stormwind needs him, him traveling to the other Alliance countries to promote unity and prosperity is the right thing to do for all and the proper use of peace time.\nSometime later, Anduin had breakfast with Genn Greymane and Prophet Velen. Anduin told Genn he would like him to act as a temporary leader of Stormwind while he was away. While Genn was honored and agreed to serve Stormwind in Anduin's absence, he also noted that he was an old man and that Anduin should be thinking of creating an heir. Anduin distracted his advisers from the uncomfortable topic by turning their attention to making plans for their diplomatic tour and ways for Stormwind to show their allies its appreciation. Anduin's first stop in his diplomatic tour was &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and Anduin had gifted the dwarves ten wagons of &lt;a href=\"barley\"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 the key ingredient to arguably Ironforge's best-loved export, &lt;a href=\"ale\"&gt;ale&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin and his entourage were treated to a feast with the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. By the time they were about to be served desert, Anduin, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, and her &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; decided to take a stroll through Ironforge while Velen stayed behind to converse with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;. As Anduin and Moira had a pleasant conversation while Dagran explored &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, a messenger told them that &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; has returned to Ironforge and required a conference with the both of them. Moira and Anduin found Magni in the &lt;a href=\"Library%20%28Ironforge%29\"&gt;Library&lt;/a&gt; section of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Explorers\"&gt;Hall of Explorers&lt;/a&gt;, conversing with &lt;a href=\"High%20Explorer%20Muninn%20Magellas\"&gt;High Explorer Muninn Magellas&lt;/a&gt; and Velen, while Falstad, Muradin, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tread%20Sparknozzle\"&gt;Captain Tread Sparknozzle&lt;/a&gt; stood beside them listening intently. Magni explained that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is wounded and that they must set to healing her or all will perish. Thus Magni has been recruiting priests and other healers for that express purpose. Moira proposed that they reach out to the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; to aid in this endeavor. Anduin also thought this was an opportune time to show all in attendance the shard of Azerite he had in his possession. Magni was the one to coin the name Azerite and confirmed it was the \"essence\" of Azeroth which is proliferating on the surface. Azeroth would normally be able to heal itself, but with &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;'s sword impaled in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, it is unable to do so without outside help. Despite stated desires to weaponize Azerite against the Horde, Anduin reminded the leaders that they are not at war with the Horde and that their priorities should be to heal Azeroth and to keep Azerite from falling into the Horde's hands. Anduin asked Gelbin to lend the gnomes' ingenuity to the Alliance and figure out ways to put Azerite to good use while Magellas sent a team of &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; to Silithus. With their purpose clear, the leaders of the Alliance set out on their tasks.\nAnduin, Velen, and Moira later portaled to &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where he witnessed the multiracial priests of the Conclave. There he met the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, who Anduin stated was one of his heroes. After being introduced to the priests of the Conclave, Anduin pondered if the Conclave could become a template for the disparate estranged factions of Azeroth so they too may come together one day. Faol also introduced Anduin to &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, whom Anduin was relieved and shocked to hear had survived. Though he had questions for Calia, Calia was unwilling to talk about her past and Anduin had to prioritize enlisting the aid of the Conclave for the mission of healing Azeroth. Moira addressed the Conclave and requested their aid. After Anduin's injury from the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin would only receive aches in his bones when he was being cruel, thoughtless, or courting danger; Anduin believed these warning signs to be the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; guiding him. Since he felt no pain from his body, he thought it safe to share with the multi-factional priests of the Conclave the discovery of Azerite. He told them that with Azerite, they may have the potential to fix Azeroth but they require more research on the mineral before they can utilize it. In the meantime, Anduin asked the Conclave to recruit other healers such as &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to their mission. Faol welcomed Anduin to partake in Conclave affairs and return anytime he wished and Anduin agreed that he could garner new ideas from the Conclave. Anduin gave Moira his shard of Azerite to deliver to Mekkatorque, while he made preparations to return to Stormwind.\nGenn Greymane and Anduin later had dinner in Stormwind, where they were filling out all the paper work required to formalize the state of affairs before Anduin's trip to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Genn once again thanked Anduin for trusting him with his kingdom, but he felt it was his duty to discuss the matter of an heir for Stormwind. Though Anduin tried to make light of the situation, Genn sternly reminded him that matters of politics isn't a game and Stormwind could find itself in a dire situation if power is transferred to the wrong person. Genn gave Anduin the same advice he would have given his late son &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt;: that life is too short and unpredictable. Genn urged Anduin to use this time of peace, for however long it may last, to search for a queen to bear him a successor. Genn suggested that if he has not found a mate already, perhaps he should consider an arranged marriage and would even offer his own daughter's hand. Anduin knew he needs to undergo a courtship eventually but he found the idea of an arranged forced marriage, stranger or not, abhorrent and felt &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; would feel the same. Anduin promised he will revisit this topic with him at a later date and transitioned the discussion to be about his meeting with Calia Menethil. When Anduin discussed how the Conclave had brought together priests from all walks of life, including Forsaken and Horde, Genn reminded him that although his compassion for all races is an admirable trait, he must be wary it does not lead to dangerous naivet\u00e9. Although the Horde has produced some notable noble members such as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, Genn stressed that the Forsaken are depraved abominations who don't feel the same things living people do. When Anduin countered that the Conclave was being led by the Forsaken Alonsus Faol, Genn was outraged that such a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; had befallen such a beloved hero of humanity and questioned Anduin how he could tolerate it. Anduin responded that the Conclave had shown him that the Forsaken aren't all mindless &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and although not all of them are good, some such as Alonsus Faol and &lt;a href=\"Frandis%20Farley\"&gt;Frandis Farley&lt;/a&gt; are. Although Genn was eager to walk out and dismiss the notion of seeing the Forsaken as people, Anduin was stern and managed to get Genn to listen to his proposal. Anduin proposed using Faol to open negotiations and heal the rift between the Forsaken and the Alliance. Anduin proposed that if the Alliance reunited the Forsaken with their families, Sylvanas may be convinced to not consider the Alliance as a threat and use Azerite for destructive means. And should true diplomacy with the Forsaken succeed, then the Alliance and Horde can work together to heal Azeroth. Later on, Anduin tasked &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; to send a letter to Baine Bloodhoof about initiating a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;meeting between Forsaken and their living relatives&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnduin arrived in Darnassus and met with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the night elves' progress in healing Azeroth and their investigations about Azerite. During their discussion, a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; portalled in to deliver a message from &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos reported &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to him and informed Anduin she will be unavailable for the foreseeable future. Anduin revealed the message spoke of Jaina and all the leaders spoke of their hopes that Jaina will one day return to active duty in their coalition. With Velen already spurring the draenei to aid in their endeavors, Anduin &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20hearthstone\"&gt;hearthed&lt;/a&gt; back to Stormwind. There Anduin met with Valeera who reported that &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt; had refused to accept his letter for Baine, as he was being watched, but noted he would relay the contents of the message to his chieftain instead. She also gave Baine's letter to Anduin which implied that Sylvanas Windrunner had learned of their correspondence and had pressured him into cutting off all contact with Anduin. Anduin was also gifted a small chip of Baine's horn as an offering of respect and friendship. As Anduin lamented that his pool of trusted comrades was growing smaller, Valeera reassured Anduin that he can always count on her friendship but warned him as king, he cannot afford to trust unwisely.\nAnduin returned to the Netherlight Temple to discuss with Faol and Calia the progress of their mission. Furthermore, Anduin sought to enlist Alonsus' aid in his endeavors to formalize a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; between the Forsaken and their human loved ones. Although Alonsus had doubts of the two races' ability to move past their prejudices or theirs to overcome the obstacles that sought to oppose such a unity, with Calia's urging, Alonsus agreed to work with his fellow priests to lay the groundwork for the event. Anduin then received word that his manservant &lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll Benton&lt;/a&gt; was dying. Though Anduin rushed to his side to tend to him in his final moments and even offered to heal him with the Light, Wyll refused as he tired of living with old age and wanted to see his deceased loved ones once again. After arranging the funeral of Wyll, Anduin summoned his councilors, with the addition of &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, to the map room. When Anduin revealed his intention to set up the Gathering, all of his advisers were opposed to the plan with the exception of Velen, who supported it, and Shaw who remained neutral to the idea. Even so, Anduin's desire for peace, partially to honor his friend Wyll's dying wish, and his belief that Sylvanas would never endanger her Forsaken in such a way that would start a war overcame his trepidation for any of the stated risks. Sternly, he commanded his advisers to support him in securing and orchestrating this meeting.\nSome time later, Anduin heard back from Sylvanas Windrunner that she has agreed to support the Gathering, but only on the stipulation that it be conducted with a small vetted group and rules implemented to heighten the security of both factions. Anduin also received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Vellcinda Benton&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; and Wyll's widowed wife. She thanked Anduin for informing her of Wyll's passing and for looking after him in his final moments. She also informed Anduin that all members of the Desolate Council were in full support of the Gathering and they have been tasked by Sylvanas to aid in the vetting process. In the meanwhile, Anduin, Genn Greymane, and Calia Menethil set out to recruiting suitable human participants for the Gathering from the Alliance's side. As they worked together, Anduin asked Calia if she sought to reclaim the throne of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and if she had a child that could one day become her heir, to which Calia did acknowledge a daughter and told Anduin her intentions. However, Calia also requested to participate in the Gathering. Since his body did not respond to any nefarious intentions, Anduin agreed to permit it should Faol also consent.\nAfter Anduin orchestrated a tense yet productive reunion between Genn Greymane, Turalyon, and Alonsus Faol, Anduin had managed to gain Turalyon's support for the Gathering but Genn still remained cynical. During the Gathering, Anduin met with Sylvanas Windrunner face to face to set the terms of the event and bluntly asked her if she intentionally betrayed his father during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Though shocked by Anduin's straightforwardness, she gave an honest answer, that the Burning Legion's numbers sealed Varian's fate regardless of the decision she made. Though the Gathering started off peaceful, Sylvanas eventually ordered to recall the Forsaken participants. When some Forsaken participants refused or hesitated to retreat from the event, Anduin felt the Divine Bell's pain in his body and realized that Calia had revealed herself to instruct any of the deserting Forsaken to find sanctuary in the Alliance's side of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas responded by sending her dark rangers to kill all the Forsaken participants. As Anduin's generals scrambled to prepare a defense and secure the Alliance participants, Anduin took a gryphon to try to secure any of the Stormwindians trying to flee with their Forsaken counterparts or rescue any of the Forsaken participants from assassination. However, he came too late, and all the Forsaken participants died. Sylvanas herself personally murdered &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; right in front of him, and with his Light powers exhausted, Anduin called Sylvanas' bluff that she would kill him since she was not prepared to face the unrestrained ire of the Alliance. Leaving himself vulnerable, Anduin carried Calia's corpse back to Stromgarde. He later sent Calia's corpse to Netherlight Temple and Velen advised Anduin to travel there as well to seek &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;'s council so he may know how to guide his people in coping with the tragic events. Saa'ra summoned Anduin to its chamber, where Anduin learned that Calia's body was not decomposing. With Saa'ra's guidance, Saa'ra, Alonsus Faol, and Anduin Wrynn raised Calia Menethil back to life with the power of the Light, but as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin helped the Stormwindians bury the Forsaken participants of the Gathering. As Anduin and Genn attended the Forsaken's funeral, Anduin fully expected to be chastised for his failure and welcomed Genn to do so as he felt responsible for the dead. Instead, Genn gave him comforting words and told him to not blame himself, and that Sylvanas was the one responsible for killing her own people. Genn apologized and acknowledged that the Gathering showed him that the Forsaken still had humanity in them and that peace was possible between them and the living. Anduin also acknowledged that Genn was right about Sylvanas, but Genn said that he was wrong about her as well, as he thought her to be ruthless to the Alliance but not to her own people. Anduin lamented how Sylvanas had politically outmaneuvered him to twist the outcome of the Gathering to her own advantage. Anduin finally came to the conclusion that peace could never be possible with Sylvanas in power, and that he truly believed that Sylvanas was irredeemable.\nNew allies.\nAnduin sent letters summoning champions to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, where he unveiled his plans to seek new allies for the Alliance. Eventually, and thanks to &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance recruited both the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;, with Anduin thanking the champions for their assistance back at the Embassy.\nQueen &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;' aid have proven to be valuable assets to the Alliance. Sometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, King Anduin formalized the induction of the Dark Iron dwarves into the Alliance.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nAs Anduin and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; sparred in the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20%28Stormwind%20Keep%29\"&gt;royal garden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; interrupted their training to report that their plan to saturate &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with agents had been successful. Shaw stated that there has been a disagreement between &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and High Overlord &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; regarding the deployment of troops. Saurfang was said to have wanted an army deployed to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, while the Blightcaller regarded it as a waste of resources. After relaying this information to High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin and Tyrande agreed this argument over war strategy indicated that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had weaponized &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and were planning to secure a monopoly of the mineral in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande had begun to secretly amass a night elf army in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to intercept the Horde forces should they march to Silithus.\nThe reported public fistfight between Nathanos and Varok and Nathanos' subsequent reprimanding seemed to confirm the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders' suspicions of the Horde's capability to make Azerite weapons and that &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had endorsed Saurfang's Silithus campaign. After deliberating with other Alliance leaders about their course of action, Anduin decided to endorse the deployment of the night elven army to protect Silithus. Anduin and the Alliance leaders would continue to create war strategies in Stormwind to prepare for the upcoming war. In the midst of their planning, Anduin and the Alliance leaders decided to take a break by visiting &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. Their recess was interrupted by a Stormwind guard who reported the Horde was invading &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and that night elven refugees were being portaled into Stormwind. Realizing that the Horde had deceived them into weakening Ashenvale's defenses, the Alliance leaders coordinated with each other to accommodate as many refugees as possible and to reinforce the Ashenvale warfront. As the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; progressed, Anduin became more restless. One sleepless night, he went to the &lt;a href=\"map%20room\"&gt;map room&lt;/a&gt; to look over the map table and recalled which areas the night elves were losing ground in. Genn, who also couldn't sleep, joined him in contemplating about their dire situation. Anduin discussed with Genn that the Horde's influence would nearly dominate all of Kalimdor and should Sylvanas hold Darnassus and its citizens hostage, it could tear the Alliance apart or paralyze the Alliance from retaliating. Anduin told Genn that Sylvanas may coerce him to abandon &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; in favor of safeguarding a hostage &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and that political manipulation would put them at odds. To Anduin's surprise, Genn told Anduin he would not withdraw his support from the Alliance even should such an event come to pass, as he would never betray the kindness of the night elves in order to reclaim his homeland. Genn stated he was committed to the protection of his Alliance allies even if it required sacrifice and that was something that Sylvanas did not understand about the living nor the Alliance. Anduin and Tyrande, who had overheard their conversation, were moved by Genn's words. Tyrande stated that even should her city fall, the Alliance will not be divided. However, she also bore bad news as recent reports stated that the night elves were making their stand at &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on in the war, Tyrande received a missive that revealed that &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt; wall defense had failed and he was in the process of confronting Sylvanas alone. This new information had compelled Tyrande to fight by Malfurion's side despite Anduin's objections. When Anduin realized nothing he could say would dissuade her, he gave Tyrande &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; that he had attuned to Stormwind and told Tyrande to come back with Malfurion alive since their people would need their leadership in these troubled times now more than ever. Tyrande found &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; kneeling and confronted him. She was successful and returned with a recovering Malfurion to Stormwind, but it became apparent when smoke was coming out of their portals that the evacuation efforts were running out of time. King Genn Greymane and Queen &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia&lt;/a&gt; evacuated the last of the refugees they could save before it became too dangerous to maintain the portals. When they returned, Genn revealed that the Horde had burned down &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin was among many who were shocked that Sylvanas would resort to such a tactic. Anduin regretted not taking the numerous chances he had to stop her in the past and felt the casualties of this war would forever haunt him until he could avenge them. Anduin resolved to stop Sylvanas permanently.\nBattle for Lordaeron.\nAs High King of the Alliance, Anduin led the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; with King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; as his second-in-command. Their forces managed to corner the Horde in the ruined &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, which they began to besiege. The battle was turning in the Alliance's favor until Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; launched a devastating counter-attack on an Alliance siege weapon, which rallied the Horde in driving back their enemies. Anduin ordered his forces to push forward and personally killed several Horde warriors until he was knocked down by a blow from &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, whom Genn swatted aside before trying to help Anduin and being incapacitated by a troll shaman. After fending off a troll warrior who tried to attack him while he was down, the young monarch looked around himself and saw his army wavering. Dropping his father's sword, the young king then conjured a massive dome of Light to heal his forces and to keep the Horde at bay. After the dome ceased, he rallied his reinvigorated forces and told his men to stand united for the Alliance, with both Horde and Alliance forces charging toward each other and resuming the battle. \nThe Alliance army managed to overcome many of the Horde forces, but the tide of the battle turned when Sylvanas unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; on the battlefield and used her necromancy to summon an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army from the fallen; forcing the Alliance to fall back. The Alliance was nearly routed until &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrived to neutralize the Blight and the undead with a powerful &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; spell and created an opening for the Alliance inside the city. Anduin and the other Alliance leaders beat back the Horde forces inside the city. King Anduin had personally ordered the capture of Varok Saurfang as a prisoner of war, who he respected. The Alliance pursued Sylvanas to the &lt;a href=\"imperial%20chamber\"&gt;imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt;, where King Anduin demanded she surrender herself or die. However, Sylvanas had lured the Alliance leaders into a trap and had rigged Capital City to be blighted. While Sylvanas escaped to her &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance leaders were trapped in the collapsing imperial chamber. Fortunately, Jaina Proudmoore had mass teleported the Alliance leaders onto her own magical flying ship before the imperial chamber could fully saturate in blight. Anduin and other Alliance leaders returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; to plan their next move.\nKul Tiras.\nFollowing the Battle for Lordaeron, the Horde sent an elite force to rescue the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; prisoners &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt;. At one point the agents had a close call when they only barely avoided Anduin, who was patrolling the streets on &lt;a href=\"Reverence\"&gt;Reverence&lt;/a&gt; alongside several guards, but the infiltrators managed to escape with the prisoners to &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing a possible alliance between the Zandalari and the Horde, Anduin sent &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; on a mission to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of bringing it back into the Alliance and gaining access to its legendary fleet. Genn and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; followed her and established a foothold on the island, for their plan must not fail.\nAfter the Alliance settled in Kul Tiras's capital city of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin arrived aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" accompanied by his &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Lion's Guard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Shwayder\"&gt;Captain Shwayder&lt;/a&gt;. He entrusted an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; with the task of preventing the Horde from allying with the Zandalari. To aid their efforts, he gave them full support of the Alliance's finest soldiers, the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;High Commander Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt;. For situations that require a more subtle approach, he put the and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; at their disposal.\nAt the end of Wyrmbane's campaign, Anduin provided congratulations to Wyrmbane and his team: &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kelsey%20Steelspark\"&gt;Kelsey Steelspark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; for their work, but he knew more was to come.\nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; named Jaina the new &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; of Kul Tiras. At the ceremony, Anduin was introduced to a young woman, &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt;, who revealed that she was the daughter of Bolvar Fordragon and had been raised by the Proudmoores since the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Shocked by this, Anduin asked for Taelia to come to Stormwind when she could so he could share stories about her father.\nLost Honor.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin and Greymane watched as soldiers prepared for war and Greymane commented that soon they would have to start recruiting from farmers. Anduin had thought they were fighting for peace, but what he saw was just fighting. Genn reassures Anduin he's doing everything he can to stop Sylvanas, causing Anduin to give a resolute stare of disagreement out into the distance. \nAnduin approached Saurfang in his cell to ask him why the orc had spared him at Lordaeron when he could have killed him and ended the war there. As Anduin asked him if he was wrong about Saurfang's honor and questioned if he wanted more innocents to suffer, Saurfang angrily shouted that he had given everything for the Horde but Sylvanas was destroying it, and what he wanted was to have his Horde back. Saurfang admitted to Anduin that the reason he had spared him was because he thought Anduin could stop Sylvanas, but as Anduin left the Stockades he told Saurfang he couldn't\u2014not alone. As Anduin left, he kept Saurfang's cell door open.\nTides of Vengeance.\n&lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; sought to convince Anduin to commit Alliance forces to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; to retake it from the Horde, but with the war focused on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;; Anduin did not have the troops to do so. Despite Anduin's refusal, Genn wouldn't stand by. Citing all the aid that the night elves had given to the Gilneans in the past, Genn sent Gilnean forces to Darkshore to help.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; and death of &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin returned to Boralus and spoke with Shaw, Genn, Wyrmbane, and Jaina. Although there was victory, Anduin mourned the loss of life and worried about &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, who was barely surviving after his encounter with &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin also worried that rather than drive a wedge between the Horde and Zandalari, killing Rastakhan had only ignited the Zandalari's fury. While Wyrmbane, Genn, and Shaw wanted to push the advantage and win the war in a matter of weeks, Jaina argued that attacking while the Zandalari mourned their king would make them no better than Sylvanas. Anduin resolved to keep fighting, but said that the Alliance must never lose sight of who they are and what they stand for.\nAfter Genn, Shaw, and Wyrmbane left, Jaina and Anduin spoke in private about the losses in Dazar'alor and Mekkatorque's state of health, which neither Jaina nor Stormwind's priests could help. Anduin was glad to have his aunt back with them, and Jaina commented on how much had happened while she was away; specifically, she wanted to know about the rumors she had heard of her old friend &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and what happened in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The two left to go somewhere private to talk.\nAs a token of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;' renewed bonds with the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; gifted King Anduin his own &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran battleship&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of Azshara.\nAfter Alliance spies caught wind of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; planning to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina, recognizing that she owed Baine for returning Derek to her, agreed to Anduin's request to rescue Baine. Thus, she, along with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Alliance champion&lt;/a&gt; headed off to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. During the rescue, the Alliance encountered and allied with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; in order to rescue Baine. After liberating Baine from his execution and teleporting everyone out of Orgrimmar, Jaina and Shaw departed from the Horde in order to report the mission's success to Anduin.\nAs Saurfang's and Anduin's forces rallied together, Anduin and Saurfang had a private meeting in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin asked what type of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; Saurfang would be. In response, Saurfang revealed that the Horde he joined was birthed by blood and tainted by corruption, the Horde was founded on the great lie that anything it did was honorable. He further remarked that it wasn't Thrall or &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; but Sylvanas who inherited &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s bloody legacy. However, Anduin denied this telling him them that his forces were the Horde but was interrupted by scornful Saurfang who remarked that he never knew honor. He further remarked that his loyalists deserved more and that he felt that the Horde was forever shackled to the past, which caused Anduin to point out that the Horde had no inclusive claim to regrets by invoking &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Saurfang was dismissive, however, pointing out that nothing could close the chasm between the Horde and Alliance, which made Anduin ask what they were fighting for. After a moment Saurfang and Anduin rallied their forces to break the cycle and defend Azeroth, with \"For Azeroth\" as their rallying cry.\nThus to protect Azeroth and depose of Sylvanas, the Horde revolutionaries and Alliance planned to strike at Orgrimmar and to that end set up camp in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. In response to Sylvanas's forces collapsing part of the tunnel between Razor Hill and Orgrimmar, Anduin turned to &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; to breach the canyon. With their forces established within the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin turned to dealing with Sylvanas's spies and protecting their siege weapons. Knowing that &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest weakness was its multiple entrances, Saurfang's strategy relied on attacking all three entrances at once. To that end, he and Anduin directed for &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;'s forces to attack Orgrimmar from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; to lead their forces to attack the city from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and for Anduin, Saurfang, and Thrall to lead their forces to attack Orgrimmar from Durotar. They further ordered &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; to lead her people to protect &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; in case of Sylvanas launching a counterattack.\nHowever, before the battle could commence, Saurfang recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. When Sylvanas questioned why she should accept his challenge Saurfang merely pointed out that she wanted him to suffer, causing Sylvanas to wordlessly agree. While Sylvanas armed herself, Saurfang was granted Thrall's axe and &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; by Anduin. Sylvanas initially had the upper hand against Saurfang, however, when she began to mock him about hope, Saurfang got his second wind by declaring that Sylvanas couldn't kill hope. As Saurfang turned the tide against Sylvanas, he claimed that she failed to kill hope at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, failed in getting the Horde and Alliance to keep killing each other at Lordaeron, he further declared that the Horde would endure, that Horde was strong and was able to slash Sylvanas across her eye. This turn caused an enraged Sylvanas to declare that Horde was nothing, that they were all nothing. Sylvanas then killed Saurfang quickly with a blast of unknown magic and abandoned the Horde altogether. In the wake of Saurfang's death, Anduin, Thrall, and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, carried his body into the now opened gates of Orgrimmar as the majority of Sylvanas's forces had declared for the revolution following Sylvanas's betrayal.\nIn front of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and Anduin served as the speakers for Saurfang's memorial service and Anduin departed from Orgrimmar after the service was over. Thrall proclaimed that Varok would be brought to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; as the High Overlord would have wanted.\nVisions of N'zoth.\nThe war between the Horde and the Alliance was over when Sylvanas abandoned the Horde, but the threat of N'Zoth remained. Anduin met with Baine, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, Shaw, Valeera, as well as Magni who came with Wrathion as his new advisor to help to deal with the Old God. Wrathion told him that the armies would be useless and that N'Zoth would strike at the minds. Afterward, Magni requested from Anduin to give him back &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; which the young king agreed to.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin called for the Alliance leaders to gather in Stormwind. During this meeting, Anduin declared that with the armistice signed, the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; was over. However, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; rejected this and declared that the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Black%20Moon\"&gt;Black Moon&lt;/a&gt; still cried out for vengeance, and it would not stop until the Horde answered for its treachery. In response, Anduin reminded her that further bloodshed would not bring back the fallen and suggested that they must renew hope and forge a future for those who survived. Tyrande challenged this view by asking what would happen when the next warchief mustered an army and asked if hope would save him if Stormwind burned. Though Anduin acknowledged that it was difficult to trust, he expressed his hopes for the future by revealing that the Horde changed when they abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; position for a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;council style leadership&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, Tyrande told him his faith was naive and she should only sign a treaty when it was written in Sylvanas's blood. Genn believed that there was truth in Tyrande's words and that though they had peace today, soon enough the Horde would sound the drums of war once more. Though realizing that not all would walk the path to peace, Anduin believed that it was the best way to build a future.\nFollowing the meeting, Anduin remained tense and revealed to Jaina that while she found peace in her heart, he couldn't say the same about himself and his belief that neither Tyrande nor Genn would consider the war to be over until Sylvanas was brought to justice. In response, Jaina expressed her belief that Sylvanas couldn't hide for long with &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; scouring the seas and the searching every dark corner of Azeroth. However, Anduin revealed that he wasn't concerned that Sylvanas would remain in hiding but that she would not. Anduin then changed the subject by asking Jaina about a messenger from Kul Tiras. He subsequently learned that &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; sought to see Stormwind City and learn more about her father, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. The pair then got into a brief argument about telling Taelia that he had become the new &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;; with Anduin against the idea of telling her the truth, believing that it would break her heart. In the end, Jaina decided that the decision remained in Anduin's hands but warned him that if she learned that the truth was kept from her, it would hurt her all the more.\nShadowlands.\nShadows Rising.\nFeeling crushed over the knowledge that &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had decided to remain in &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, while leaving all of his missives unread, Anduin decided to take &lt;a href=\"Reverence\"&gt;Reverence&lt;/a&gt; for a ride to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing explosions, the pair investigated and discovered that &lt;a href=\"Jago\"&gt;Jago&lt;/a&gt; had taken advantage of a farmer's son hospitality near &lt;a href=\"Saldean%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Saldean's Farm&lt;/a&gt; by using the barn to brew moonshine, which had caused the explosion that destroyed the building's roof. Upon seeing Anduin, Jago tried to attack the young king, blaming him for not stopping Sylvanas at the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. Jago was intercepted by Mathias and passed out soon after. After briefly speaking with Alleria about Sylvanas, Anduin and Shaw soon departed for &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnduin then attended a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; in the crypts of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, in which the corpses of retrieved of members suggested that &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s were on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. This knowledge caused Turalyon to wonder if Sylvanas sought vengeance on &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; for pulling her support to the Banshee Queen, while Genn believed that Talanji was still working with Sylvanas and was providing her shelter on the island. Anduin then declared Turalyon as the Lord Commander of the Alliance forces, with the task of finding &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and to use whatever means he must, something that Genn told him was a wise choice.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, knowing about his concerns with the lack of progress from Turalyon and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in finding &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, sought to counsel him towards patience but none of her arguments were able to ease his troubled heart. Thus, when Anduin requested that she personally check on the pair for an update, she agreed. Jaina was then disturbed to see that the pair had been interrogating a man by having Turalyon use the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to shackle him in place, while Alleria's &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; powers invaded his mind. After hearing the information they learned, which proved that &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;an agent&lt;/a&gt; of Sylvanas was heading towards &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina departed with the intention of informing Anduin about the information and exactly how it was obtained. She further revealed her belief that their tactics represented him poorly and by sanctioning them, she questioned what it said about them.\nAfter a moment of thought, Anduin said that they would do whatever they must to bring murders to justice. That it said that they shall not forget those lost in war, never forgot &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. He then reminded Jaina how she was not above the swinging the harsh hammer of retribution and asked if she had forgotten. Jaina retorted that she had not forgotten but reminded him how &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; had once warned &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; to uphold honor or be ended. She further remarked that one of her brightest wishes was for Anduin's reign to endure and be remembered fondly, for more than anything that he was remembered in the same breath as his father.\nAnduin responded by remarking that difficult decisions have to be made and that he trusted Turalyon and Alleria. He then asked her if their statues would preside over &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; if they were without honor. This caused Jaina to remark that people change. The young king agreed but once more declared that he trusted Turalyon and Alleria, despite the misfortunes that have befallen them. He then pointed out that Stormwind would not exist without them and that they were woven into the very fabric of Stormwind's history. Recognizing that there would no swaying him, Jaina told Anduin that clarity and time are the final editors of all stories, as she would know.\nHe discretely sent &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; to ask &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; if the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had any knowledge of Sylvanas being in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, to which Baine responded negatively. Anduin also sent Shaw to obtain further intelligence on &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, while also sending Turalyon and Alleria to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; should nothing be discovered on the Zandalari coast. They were soon interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, who reported that Shaw had been taken prisoner by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. When Turalyon and Alleria sought to respond with war against the Zandalari, convinced that they were working with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; called upon them to not add fuel on an already kindly fire and risk the treaty. Jaina then stated she would use the treaty itself before turning to the blade.\nThus, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; received a missive from Jaina where she revealed that they were aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council. In the end, the council voted unanimously in favor of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Jaina and Anduin in hopes that it would aid in the hunt and capture of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, they subsequently met on a boat at seas off the coast Zandalar. In a show of open trust, Thrall revealed that he had met with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, stunning both Jaina and Anduin. When Anduin accused the Horde of betraying the Alliance by allowing Sylvanas to have a refuge on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Ji became outraged. While Thrall was quick to smooth over Anduin's worries, the information they received allowed the orc and pandaren to realize that the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; were aiding the Widow's Bite. When Anduin mentioned how &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; was taken prisoner by the Zandalari Empire, Ji reassured the young king that the Horde Council did not execute prisoners without trial. However, Anduin retorted that he wished to have Shaw returned soon. When the waves threatened to upend the boat, Jaina ported everyone to safety.\nFeeling the need to be a boy again, Anduin secretly traveled to &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; under the alias Jerek where he was caught by Jaina. After he explained himself, Jaina told him that she understood as he had caught her red-handed too.\nAfter the Horde destroyed the Widow's Bite and saved &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, they released Shaw and sent him back to Stormwind with &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;, who was captured at the end of the conflict and who Thrall wanted to be sent to Tyrande. After Shaw revealed what Thrall wanted of her, Anduin agreed but first, he sought a word with her. Anduin demanded to know where Sylvanas was, and Sira declared that she was nowhere they could find her and that they had already lost. In response, Anduin attempted to use magic against her which caused a look of fear on Jaina's face shook Shaw to the core, while Sira just laughed, declaring once more that they had already lost, and that Anduin would serve well. She was subsequently placed in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;s and Anduin sent a missive, informing Tyrande that he had a gift from the Horde for her.\nLater, Anduin wrote a letter to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, granting them temporary leave from their regular duties and assigning them on a mission to inventory artifacts hidden across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaptivity in the Maw.\nWhen the Scourge began to &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;rampage&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth, Anduin was among the leaders captured by Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and taken into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of torment in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. In his absence, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; took up the position of regent and protector of Stormwind with the support of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the Maw, Anduin, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and Jaina were held captive and tortured under the personal oversight of Sylvanas and the ruler of the Maw, &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. According to Thrall, it sometimes felt as if the group was being tested for something. Anduin was held captive in the &lt;a href=\"Tremaculum\"&gt;Tremaculum&lt;/a&gt;, where his imprisonment was overseen by &lt;a href=\"Phael%20the%20Afflictor\"&gt;Phael the Afflictor&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina tried repeatedly to rescue her \"nephew\" but failed due to the large number of forces guarding him. Even throughout their torments, Anduin insisted to Jaina that their allies on Azeroth would come to rescue them. This eventually proved true when adventurers and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; entered the Maw. Thrall and Jaina accompanied adventurers to the Tremaculum, where Sylvanas was having a conversation with Anduin and expressed disappointment in his \"narrow vision\" before departing. The heroes freed Anduin from his bonds and the group returned to the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Respite\"&gt;Forlorn Respite&lt;/a&gt;, where they learned from the captured &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Amalgamation\"&gt;Tormented Amalgamation&lt;/a&gt; that there was a possible way out of the Maw in the form of &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;a waystone&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Zovaal%27s%20Cauldron\"&gt;Zovaal's Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, which was also the location where Baine was being held captive. On the way to the Cauldron, the group encountered &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, who blasted them into the . The party made it out of the river to Zovaal's Cauldron just in time to see the Jailer drop Baine off a cliff. They subsequently discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; had placed a curse on the High Chieftain's soul and had to work together to save his life. With an invisibility spell by Jaina, the party made it to the waystone, which began to react to the adventurer's presence. Anduin remarked that although he had studied &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts, the waystone seemed to be made by a &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;different hand&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer began charging the waystone, an effort that was noticed by the Jailer and prompted him to send his Mawsworn armies to stop them. When the party was about to be overwhelmed, Anduin proclaimed that the Light was with him even in the Maw and called down a barrier of holy magic which held off the Mawsworn long enough for the champion to escape to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. The Jailer declared this to be \"interesting\", and when Anduin claimed that he had failed, the Jailer calmly responded \"No... I have precisely what I need.\" The Jailer subsequently brought Anduin, Thrall, Jaina, and Baine into his tower of &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; for further torture. The Jailer specifically wanted Anduin because his heroic personal qualities would allow him to enter the realm of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; for the purposes of the &lt;a href=\"%23Chains%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Jailer's plan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter starting to aid the Shadowlands' &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s and becoming known as &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s, adventurers repeatedly ventured into Torghast with the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; (who used the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; to peer into the tower), rescued Baine, Jaina, and Thrall, and brought them to the safety of Oribos. However, Anduin was taken deeper into the tower than the others, and the heroes initially found no sign of him. During the rescue of Thrall, the Maw Walkers eavesdropped on a private conversation between the Jailer and Sylvanas in which the Jailer proclaimed that they had to begin preparation of their new \"weapon\". Sylvanas convinced the Jailer to leave him to her, arguing that bringing their \"instrument\" around into believing in their cause would yield superior results compared to simply enslaving him. In the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Corridors\"&gt;Twisting Corridors&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walkers recovered Anduin's &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Emblem\"&gt;emblem from his armor&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Length%20of%20Light-Infused%20Chain\"&gt;length of chain&lt;/a&gt; used to hold him, but not the king himself.\nShortly after, Sylvanas visited Anduin in his cell deep within Torghast. Anduin told her that he was tired of her lies and games. In response, Sylvanas frankly explained that she and the Jailer intended to use Anduin as a weapon to achieve their goal: breaking the unjust system of Death and replacing it with one that is fair and in which everyone would have control of their fate. Anduin questioned why Sylvanas believed that she wasn't simply being used by the Jailer. In response, the banshee gave the king her ultimatum: join them willingly or be made to serve. The entire conversation was remotely observed by Bolvar, the Maw Walkers, and the leaders in Oribos through the Helm of Domination. They agreed that they had to remain patient and cautious, since the Jailer might decide to \"discard\" his prisoner if he believed his prize to be in jeopardy.\nAround the same time as the Jailer's ally &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, the Jailer had Shalamayne reforged into &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt;, which he infused with the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s soul. The Jailer told Sylvanas that they had to take a more direct approach with forging Anduin into their next weapon. The banshee returned to Anduin's prison to offer him a last choice between willing cooperation or forced servitude. Anduin realized that the reason Sylvanas tried so hard to persuade him was because there was a part of her mortality still haunting her and she wanted to give him the choice she'd never had. Sylvanas interrupted him and thrust Kingsmourne on him while telling him to submit. Anduin was not fazed, replied that Sylvanas held all the power, and told her to make her choice.\nIn Oribos, Baine argued that the Azerothians should attack Torghast and free the king right away, but Thrall countered that they weren't ready to launch an assault on the Maw. Jaina stated that they would work with their allies in Oribos to rally the covenants and, with their help, hopefully stop the Jailer and save Anduin.\nChains of Domination.\nIn the end, Sylvanas made the choice to forcibly turn Anduin into an unwilling vessel for the Jailer. He was equipped with Kingsmourne as well as a suit of armor covered in &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; runes that suppressed his will and allowed the Jailer to control him directly, but it was Arthas' soul within Kingsmourne that served as the main source of Anduin's Domination. Each time the Jailer dominated Anduin's will, he felt himself slipping further away, as though everything he had once been was being consumed by darkness.\nDisguised as his normal self, Anduin traveled to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and asked for an audience with the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; Archon &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, Anduin passed the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, who reacted to the sight of the king by reaching up and touching the &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;-caused wound on his own chest. At &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Archon's Rise&lt;/a&gt;, Kyrestia recognized the Jailer's presence in Anduin and demanded that he release the king from his grasp. In response, the Jailer's voice spoke through Anduin to proclaim that \"He is bound to me, just as you once sought to bind your own brother\". Anduin plunged Kingsmourne into the ground, creating a shockwave that stunned the nearby &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%23Paragons%20and%20Hands\"&gt;Paragons&lt;/a&gt;, before leaping at Kyrestia, stabbing her through the chest, and extracting her &lt;a href=\"covenant%20sigil\"&gt;covenant sigil&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the second of five desired by the Jailer. Anduin briefly returned to his old self and reacted with horror at what he had done before the Domination runes on his armor flared up and placed him under the Jailer's control once again, after which he returned to Torghast to deliver the sigil to the Jailer.\nThe Jailer subsequently sent the Mawsworn to attack &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; and seize the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s sigil, and the covenants united to defend the forest. Jaina and Bolvar joined the defense in the hopes of saving Anduin, but saw no sign of him on the battlefield. The covenants managed to push out the Mawsworn, but Anduin snuck behind enemy lines, breached the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and absorbed the queen's sigil into Kingsmourne. He created a Maw barrier to keep Jaina and Bolvar from reaching him, and they could only watch as he opened a portal and escaped back to the Jailer.\nA Maw Walker accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt; later traveled to Torghast and gave the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; his sigil back, freeing him from his imprisonment as the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;. The Jailer immediately noticed this, teleported into the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;, and began battling the Primus while Heirmir and the hero fought the Jailer's accompanying minions. As the battle progressed, the Jailer stunned Heirmir and the Maw Walker and summoned Anduin, who resurrected all of the Mawsworn that Heirmir and the hero had killed. After he and his master launched a coordinated attack to stun the Primus, Anduin used Kingsmourne to sever the sigil from the Primus' body and launch it into the Jailer's waiting hand. Having now obtained all but one of the sigils he needed, the Jailer teleported himself, Anduin, and his other minions away.\nSylvanas later briefed Anduin on the plan to claim the final sigil from the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;: Sylvanas would deal with the forces of Azeroth atop Torghast, and once they reached the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; in Oribos, Anduin would defend the Jailer while he completed his ritual to break the Arbiter's defenses. Anduin lamented the control the Jailer had over him, but Sylvanas told him that their sacrifices would be worth it once they achieved their goal. Anduin cut her off and said that the two of them would both be \"lost\" by the time that happened. He then expressed his hope that his friends would remember him the way he'd been, not what Sylvanas had made him become. Unbeknownst to his captors, Anduin secretly used the Light to enchant &lt;a href=\"Varian%27s%20compass\"&gt;his father's compass&lt;/a&gt;, imbuing it with the memory of his conversation with Sylvanas.\nThe Jailer's plan proceeded as intended: he ascended to the Crucible and broke through the Arbiter's defenses while Anduin was forced to battle Jaina, Thrall, and Bolvar on the central platform and Sylvanas kept the Maw Walkers occupied on the surrounding pillars. After claiming the Arbiter's sigil, the Jailer opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; and revealed his true goal: not to give everyone free will as Sylvanas had believed, but to remake reality into one where all would serve him. Sylvanas turned against him upon hearing this, but he left her at the mercy of the Maw Walkers and their allies and left with Anduin through the portal, telling him to \"Be the first to witness reality's end\". Moments before he disappeared through the gateway, Anduin managed to resist the Jailer's control just enough to drop Varian's compass on the ground, allowing Jaina to find it. She brought it back to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;, where she and Bolvar magically examined it and unlocked the message Anduin had left for them. Jaina and Thrall concluded that there was still some part of the king resisting the Jailer's Domination and resolved to save him no matter what it took.\nEternity's End.\nIn Zereth Mortis, the Jailer commanded Anduin to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt; and use Domination to enslave its protector &lt;a href=\"Dausegne\"&gt;Dausegne&lt;/a&gt; in order to open the way to the Jailer's ultimate goal, the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing that Anduin had been sighted near the Forge, Jaina, Baine, and a Maw Walker hurried there in the hopes that they could free the king from the Jailer's control. However, before they could get to him, the Jailer arrived in person, forced the dominated Dausegne to disable the Forge, and used it to transport himself, Anduin, and Dausegne directly to the Sepulcher before sealing the way behind them.\nBack in Oribos, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; helped Sylvanas awaken from the coma the Jailer had put her in, allowing her to lend her help to the Maw Walkers' allies (after Uther convinced them to trust her). Sylvanas stated that they had no chance of stopping the Jailer without a means to resist his Domination magic and that freeing Anduin might be the key. Uther believed that since Sylvanas had held Kingsmourne, the mourneblade that bound Anduin to the Jailer's will, her presence could also help to free him. Alongside the Maw Walkers, Uther, Jaina, and Sylvanas headed into the Sepulcher, where they ultimately confronted Anduin at &lt;a href=\"Domination%27s%20Grasp%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Domination's Grasp&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the ensuing battle, Anduin periodically used Kingsmourne to separate the Maw Walkers' souls from their bodies, allowing them to assist the king's own struggling soul and restore his willpower, in turn allowing him to manifest the source of his Domination\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20a%20Fallen%20King\"&gt;Remnant of a Fallen King&lt;/a&gt;\u2014from the mourneblade. At the end of the battle, the Jailer forced Anduin to plunge Kingsmourne into the ground, enveloping him in smoke as the sword seemingly began draining his soul and the Jailer whispered to him to fulfill his \"final purpose\": annihilation. As Anduin struggled, he suddenly saw his father Varian appear at his side to remind him that Shalamayne had not been forged by darkness, but by valor. He then saw Varok Saurfang appear at his other side to add that the sword had been forged by honor as well. Varian continued that both of their legacies along with that of Shalamayne were with Anduin. With Varian and Varok's help, Anduin was able to get a firm grip on Kingsmourne and\u2014with a great exertion\u2014split it in half, turning it back into Shalla'tor and Ellemayne and finally freeing him from the Jailer's control, with his Domination armor fading away like smoke. Splitting Kingsmourne also released the last remnant of Arthas' soul, which faded away as Anduin and the heroes watched.\nAlthough his will was now his own again, Anduin was haunted by the lingering effects of Domination and the memories of the things the Jailer had made him do. The heroes brought him to &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; in Zereth Mortis in the hopes that he could tell them how to counteract the Jailer's power, but he stated that he didn't know how. The group turned to another plan by first gathering phrases from the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and then meeting in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, where memories could be drawn out and expunged and where those who had suffered from Domination in the past could infuse the memories of what had allowed them to resist into the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin\u2014who wished he'd known about the place earlier\u2014volunteered for the ritual after Bolvar and &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, stating that he wanted to do whatever it took to help defeat the Jailer. When he gazed into his memories, however, he was quickly overwhelmed by his painful memories of the Maw and forced to stop. Sylvanas recognized his struggle from her own experiences and asked to \"offer perspective\" by describing how she'd once broken free of Arthas' control and sought revenge against him.\nThis caused Anduin to understand that everyone who'd been affected by Domination got the strength to resist from something, be it nobility or vengeance, and that he had friends who were willing to stand with him. He attempted the ritual again, this time managing to draw out a &lt;a href=\"Mawbound%20Monstrosity\"&gt;Mawbound Monstrosity&lt;/a&gt; which the Maw Walker defeated, allowing the king to infuse his resistance into the shards. Afterward, Sylvanas told him that this wouldn't be the end of his suffering, but at least a step forward. The group then returned to Torghast to meet with the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, who used the language and the memories to reforge the Helm of Domination into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, an instrument allowing them all to become resistant to Domination.\nWith the resistance granted by the Crown, the Maw Walkers managed to defeat the Jailer within the Sepulcher. Afterward, Sylvanas was brought to Oribos to be judged for her crimes by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin and his friends attended the trial, during which Sylvanas handed herself over to the judgment of her nemesis Tyrande. Pelagos asked if anyone presented objected to this. Anduin looked conflicted but remained silent, and the trial ended with Tyrande sending Sylvanas to the Maw to free all of the souls trapped therein.\nAnduin told the Maw Walkers that he couldn't simply go back to being the person he'd once been and that he still needed time to recover from the trauma of the Jailer's control. He thanked them for helping to set him free and asked them to continue aiding the Alliance and Horde and defending Azeroth. In the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, Genn Greymane, who'd come to the trial as well, told Anduin not to blame himself for the things the Jailer had made him do. Anduin tried to argue that he should've been stronger, but Genn replied that he was the strongest man he knew. Anduin stated that he couldn't return to Azeroth yet and that he trusted &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to watch over the Alliance and Genn to watch over their loved ones in his absence. Genn protested at first, arguing that Stormwind's people needed him, but then accepted Anduin's decision and asked him to take the time he needed and come home when he was ready.\nAnduin ultimately made the decision to enter the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to find Sylvanas. However, after some time, Sylvanas questioned as to why he was there, with so many people awaiting his return. In response, Anduin admitted that while his friends believe his hands are clean, he doesn't feel that they are cleaned, causing Sylvanas to point out it was perilous to confuse \"what you are made to do with what you choose to do.\" However, Anduin countered that he couldn't help it, as it all blurred together into something horrific and exhilarating, that it sickened him that such satisfaction may have been his own. This allowed Sylvanas to realize that Anduin had arrived to aid her because he feared that he might not be who he thought he was. Anduin further revealed that he was afraid to call on the Light, concerned that it wouldn't answer him. After Sylvanas reassured him about his own free will and choices, Anduin departed, as they each wished each other farewell.\nDragonflight.\nAnduin has remained missing for the three years since the Jailer's defeat. Genn has followed up many rumors regarding sightings of the young king, but none have turned up anything substantial. Genn has concluded that Anduin won't be found until he's ready to be found, and in the meantime Turalyon remains in his position as regent.\nA time-displaced version of young Anduin appears in the &lt;a href=\"Everywhen%20Inn\"&gt;Everywhen Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, being teleported there when he was playing &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; with his father. He asked &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to get back &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20Lucky%20Hearthstone%20Card\"&gt;his lucky&lt;/a&gt; card that &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;dragon whelp&lt;/a&gt;s stole from him. In the meantime, he played Hearthstone with &lt;a href=\"Innkeeper%20Bob\"&gt;Innkeeper Bob&lt;/a&gt;, who also provided him with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20Juice\"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt;. Once the adventurer recovered the card, he took a portal home to his time.\nThe War Within.\nSometime following his disappearance, Anduin begins receiving visions and hearing a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;voice&lt;/a&gt;, leading him to the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. There, he is located by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, who has also begun hearing the voice. Believing his return is needed, Thrall asks for Anduin's &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to be restored. This causes Anduin to lash out, claiming he has no Light due to his actions while under &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal's&lt;/a&gt; influence. Thrall's reassurance and trust in Anduin restores some of his confidence, before they are interrupted by the voice again, calling out \"Hear me\". This causes the pair to gaze up at the dormant &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, believing that the mad titan was aiming at someone when he stabbed the planet.\nSon of the Wolf (possible future).\nIn a possible future, many, many years later, Anduin Wrynn as an old man re-reads his father's last letter and contemplates that there is only one more battle to be fought. Aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; informs the High King that it is time, that they will never have an opportunity or chance like this again. As Anduin stands up, he remembers his father and all the others who have fallen, and Velen says that the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; will triumph over the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; this day.\nPowers and Abilities.\nAnduin was born with a great connection with &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, from a young age he trained in the priesthood and was able to cast many spells linked to the sacred light. From force fields to healing and casting rays of light, but his most notable ability has been the ability to revive others through light, a skill that only a few can use.\nQuests.\nObjective of.\nHe needs to be interacted with in:\nHe needed to be spoken with in:\nTactics.\nKing Anduin is perhaps the hardest city leader to defeat for Horde players. The location of Stormwind Keep and Stormwind's geography make getting to Anduin undetected nearly impossible. Additionally, Anduin's elite guard are spread all the way along the path to the king, ranging as far as the steps of the keep itself, and as such players on flying mounts may want to use the side entrance to Stormwind Keep in order to save some time. Every second counts, as a fast kill is vital due to Stormwind being highly populated during most hours and Alliance players are very likely to come to the aid of their King. Unlike Varian, Anduin also comes equipped with the ability to heal and shield his allies. Melee fighters should also be wary of his Psychic Scream.\nPersonality.\nAlthough only a young adult, Stormwind's king, Anduin, has persevered through numerous trials and tribulations, such as being kidnapped by the scheming black dragon Onyxia. His greatest challenge, however, might lie in his relationship with Varian. Anduin is no stranger to his father's love and affection, but he is constantly wary of sudden outbursts from Varian's violent, gladiatorial side. Anduin has also struggled against his father's insistence that he become a warrior.\nEvents just prior to the Cataclysm signaled a new chapter in Anduin's life. While undergoing martial training in the dwarven bastion of Ironforge, Anduin witnessed as Moira Thaurissan\u2014the estranged daughter of the late King Magni Bronzebeard\u2014held the city hostage with a contingent of Dark Iron dwarves. Despite being the legal heir to Ironforge, she drew the ire of Varian for her heavy-handed tactics. Before long, the king and a team of SI:7 agents infiltrated the city, intent on killing the brash dwarf heiress. Only through Anduin's wise and resolute intervention did Varian stay his hand and spare Moira's life, thus averting a political disaster that might have ignited a dwarven civil war.\nDuring his time in Ironforge, Anduin also discovered his true calling in life: to be a priest devoted to the tenets of the Holy Light. For those who know Anduin well, this discipline is a perfect fit for the prince, who has consistently proven himself to be compassionate and thoughtful. No longer the child-prince of Stormwind from years past, Anduin is fast becoming his own man with the courage to speak up for what he believes in. He does not share Varian's outright hatred and mistrust of the Horde. On one occasion, he even imparted sage advice to the tauren chieftain Baine Bloodhoof after the death of his father, Cairne. Yet in Azeroth's current state of turmoil, it is unknown whether Anduin's destiny with the Light will proceed on its current course, or whether his path will take a different turn.\nAfter assuming the throne of Stormwind, Anduin's yearning for peace clashes with his duty to fight. But he has begun to prove himself as a skilled wartime leader for the Alliance.\nAppearance.\nAnduin is physically similar to his mother Tiffin, with light skin, blue eyes and medium-short blonde hair which he ties in a ponytail. He previously wore priest of light robes but after ascending to King of Stormwind he began to wear blue and gold armor with a lion symbol in the center.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMists of Pandaria.\nGossip.\nOur people have their differences, &lt;class&gt;, but we are all guests in this place.\nThe pandaren have shown me great hospitality and respect, as I'm sure you've also received, and now they need our help.\nThe Horde is not without honor.

According to Baine, Kairoz selected the most broken and darkest versions.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nAnduin is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" as a ranged healer. His \"Heroes of the Storm\" design is based on his \"\" appearance, with armor combining his prince garbs with the plate armor he wears in combat. He carries &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; on his back, though he only uses it for a few of his abilities, most of which are based on priest spells from \"World of Warcraft\".\nSpeculation.\nAlthough not a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; nor a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, he could possibly be considered a \"battle-priest\".\nHoly Word: Salvation?\nWhile the spell he used during the \"Battle for Azeroth\" opening cinematic has been confirmed to not be &lt;a href=\"%3AMass%20Resurrection\"&gt;:Mass Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin has a spell in \"Heroes of the Storm\" called Holy Word: Salvation which appears to be identical in terms of both appearance and effect, implying it is, in fact, the same spell.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He was one of the dreadlords assigned to watch over the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and grew agitated when they began to suspect the Lich King of treachery and possibly becoming a threat to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. But Tichondrius was confident that, despite his obvious ulterior motives, the Lich King was still providing the tools they needed to make way for the invasion. In a meeting in the Twisting Nether, Tichondrius assured Anetheron that everything was still well in his control.\nWhen Archimonde came to the world, Anetheron went with him and served as a personal guardsman. Anetheron showed his tenacity when he led the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the final, climactic &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.

The fight is a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;Battle for survival&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreparation.\nLook at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29%23Tips%20on%20Bosses\"&gt;MH Boss Tips&lt;/a&gt; for general information. It is particularly important to distribute the healers accordingly in order that as few of them are hit by Carrion Swarm at the same time. Two tanks are needed \u2014 one for Anetheron and one for the Towering Infernals. Fire resistance gear helps on the Infernal tank (but is not mandatory).\nThe Infernal tank healers can set up far away from the boss to outrange the Carrion Swarm (staying inside healing range of the Infernal tank ofc). The shadow protection buff from priests on the raid can be casted before / during wave 8, and a small amount of shadow resist gear can be worn by healers to resist the carrion swarm damage and debuff.\nRogues should keep &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; active on the boss at all times, to reduce the effect of his Vampiric Aura. This can be replaced by a warrior's &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;.\nTowering Infernals.\nThe boss himself is rather straightforward &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;. The only tricky problem is control of the Infernals. They spawn on random people, therefore a paladin is a good choice, because of quick range pulling with &lt;a href=\"Exorcism\"&gt;Exorcism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avenger%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Avenger's Shield&lt;/a&gt;. A good tanking spot for the Towering Infernals is near Jaina Proudmooore, so that she helps killing them. Warrior Infernal tanks can make their job easier with an &lt;a href=\"Intervene\"&gt;Intervene&lt;/a&gt; macro. Hunters should misdirect the Infernals on the tank as soon as they spawn.\nIn all cases, it helps if raid members about to receive an Infernal run towards the tanking position. It's also imperative that everybody (particularly the person who just spawned the Infernal) stays outside the fire AoE. Only ranged DPS should kill Infernals. Alternatively, when the raid has high total DPS, the Infernal tank can wear full fire resistance gear and just keep all Infernals tanked. DPS does not change target but stays on the boss the whole time. This makes the fight much faster, the Infernals despawn when the boss dies.\nLoot.\nDo NOT talk to Jaina until all the loot is distributed. Talking to her after Anetheron is dead starts an event which includes an enormous wave of undead invading the human town.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The dragons were not happy with their old masters and fiercely hunted the Dragonmaw. What few remained fled from Grim Batol, with one group seeking refuge in the mountains of the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, specifically at the &lt;a href=\"Angerfang%20Encampment\"&gt;Angerfang Encampment&lt;/a&gt; east of &lt;a href=\"Whelgar%27s%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Whelgar's Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros' son, &lt;a href=\"Nek%27rosh%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nek'rosh Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, took up leadership of the clan and vowed revenge against the dragons who slew his father. While not the same threat as they were when they had dragons, these Dragonmaw were still fierce opponents.\nWhile they normally hid in the hills, a group of Dragonmaw expanded into &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;, threatening to cut off &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the Wetlands. Meanwhile, Nek'rosh aimed to lay siege to Menethil itself \u2014 which would have been effectively blocked from reinforcements due to the fighting in Algaz \u2014 and ordered the construction of several &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s. He was ultimately defeated by Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and his head was brought to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Stoutfist\"&gt;Captain Stoutfist&lt;/a&gt;, thus ending the Dragonmaw threat to Menethil. Captain Stoutfist had also adventurers bring him &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20War%20Banner\"&gt;war banners&lt;/a&gt; from the defeated Angerfangs.\n&lt;a href=\"Velora%20Nitely\"&gt;Velora Nitely&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s after their shinbones to create &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Legguards\"&gt;legguards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Krom%20Stoutarm\"&gt;Krom Stoutarm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jorah%20Annison\"&gt;Jorah Annison&lt;/a&gt; asked adventuring &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s to bring the Angerfangs' &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Channeling\"&gt;rods of channeling&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Strahad%20Farsan\"&gt;Strahad Farsan&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Angerfang are led exclusively by &lt;a href=\"Gorfax%20Angerfang\"&gt;Gorfax Angerfang&lt;/a&gt;; describing him as 'chief' of the Angerfang Dragonmaw. He was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Whelgar\"&gt;Prospector Whelgar&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that the Dragonmaw do not attack them at &lt;a href=\"Whelgar%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Whelgar's Retreat&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Gorfax, the Angerfang joined &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s Horde alongside the rest of the Dragonmaw clan. It is unknown whether or not any of the group sided with Hellscream during the rise of the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; or defected into the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDespite his defeat at the hands of the Alliance adventurer, Gorfax could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde when a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer reached Prestige Rank 2. He was present at the ceremony hosted by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulated the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nBy the time of the first Azerothian &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival, Gorfax has become chieftain. He recounts the dishonor of the Angerfang in supporting the previous leaders of the Dragonmaw, but vows to do better by rebuilding the Dragonmaw as a whole in a legacy free of &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslaving&lt;/a&gt; others.\nItems.\nA number of items added in as random world drops are named for the group:\nSpeculation.\nBesides the orcs at and around the Angerfang Encampment, &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Whelpstealer\"&gt;Dragonmaw Whelpstealer&lt;/a&gt;s are found at the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Belt\"&gt;Green Belt&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Ma%27ruk%20Wyrmscale\"&gt;Ma'ruk Wyrmscale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Scout\"&gt;Dragonmaw Scout&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Grunt\"&gt;Dragonmaw Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s are found at &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;.

Often, the term is used as a verb meaning to apply a soulstone to a target.\nCreating a Soulstone.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Create%20Soulstone\"&gt;Create Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; spell requires 3 seconds of casting time, an amount of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; that depends on the rank of the spell, and a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;. The soulstone created is &lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt; to the warlock, but only one soulstone can be held at a time.\nCreating a soulstone only starts the global 1.5-second cooldown, but due to the soulstone being &lt;a href=\"unique\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; and soulbound, it must be used before another can be successfully created.\nTypes.\nThe main difference between the type of soulstones is the amount of &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; they restore when the target of the buff is revived.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nTactics and tips.\nUsing a Soulstone.\nHaving a soulstone in the inventory provides no benefit, and it cannot be equipped. The benefit occurs when the warlock selects an ally (or himself/herself) and uses the soulstone (usually by right-clicking on it). This requires approximately 2 seconds and ends with a sound and graphical effect that surrounds the target of the soulstone (prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, this effect always appeared on the warlock using the Soulstone). The buff image (), looks like a soulstone on the target. The soulstone self-resurrect effect lasts 15 minutes.\nUsing a soulstone has a 15-minute cooldown that begins when the warlock actually uses the soulstone on someone. If the target dies after 1 minute, it will be 14 more minutes before the same warlock can use another soulstone on anybody. If the target dies after 14 minutes, though, the warlock can use another one in 1 minute. Because the cooldown is the same length as the effect's duration, it is possible for the warlock to provide near-continuous coverage for one person (possibly themselves).\nDying while Soulstoned.\nA player who dies while &lt;a href=\"soulstoned\"&gt;soulstoned&lt;/a&gt; will be presented with an extra option: besides the usual \"&lt;a href=\"Release%20Spirit\"&gt;Release Spirit&lt;/a&gt;\" choice, there is a new option called \"Use Soulstone\". Choosing this will immediately return the player to life where he or she died, with reduced health and mana. Choosing \"Release Spirit\" or accepting another player's resurrection will essentially waste the soulstone effect.\nBefore using a soulstone to resurrect, it is good to make sure no &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s are in close &lt;a href=\"aggro%20range\"&gt;aggro range&lt;/a&gt;, since depending on the strength of the soulstone or survivability against any nearby mob that attacks immediately, a quick death also wastes the soulstone benefit.\nUsing a Soulstone in a group.\nThe best use of the soulstone in a group situation is for the warlock to pick a &lt;a href=\"rez\"&gt;rez&lt;/a&gt;-capable character (usually a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;) and soulstone that person as a form of \"wipe insurance\". It is the Soulstoned person's job to be sure to die far from the mobs' spawn points, so that, if the entire party is wiped out, they can wait until no mobs are around, then self-resurrect with the Soulstone and commence &lt;a href=\"wipe%20recovery\"&gt;wipe recovery&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost groups choose to have a paladin soulstoned first, as they tend to have the best survivability of the rez-capable classes. Priests and druids are usually the next in line, followed by shamans (who are already capable of self-rezzing via &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn general, it is best to soulstone a character who will be standing away from monsters, as that character has less of a chance to accidentally aggro another group.\nTips for being Soulstoned while in a group.\nIf you are the target of a soulstone, congratulations! For the next 15 minutes, if you &lt;a href=\"Death%20%28gameplay%29\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt; you will be able to rez right where you died. With great power comes great responsibility.\nTake extra care where you die (this is known as \"dying well\"). Soulstone resurrection takes place at the exact spot where your corpse is \u2014 if that's right next to the mobs that just &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt;d your party, you'll immediately draw aggro and probably die again. If you are soulstoned and the wipe is coming, try to pick a safe place away from the mob's &lt;a href=\"spawn%20Point\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; so you can resurrect safely.\nDo not succumb to the delusion that you can singlehandedly turn the tide of the battle by resurrecting with partial health and mana and no buffs in mid-combat. Your group is counting on you to wait until the mobs go away and \"only then\" to use the soulstone to &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt; yourself and begin resurrecting the others.\n\"Never rez until the wipe is complete\" is generally the best plan, but there are very specific, limited occasions when using the Soulstone as a combat rez is an acceptable tactic. One situation is if you died while soulstoned but are near where mobs will return after the wipe \u2014 that is, if you died badly \u2014 and there's nothing you're losing by using the soulstone now except a chance to turn the tide of the battle. Another example might be if you are the healer and you die late in the fight, when the boss is almost dead (1% to 3% health). Using the soulstone as a combat rez and using a mana potion to get your mana back up quickly can mean that you are soon looting. (It can also mean that everyone now has to run back from the graveyard or even that your run is over due to respawns. Be careful in this situation and realize you will be taking a lot of flak, and maybe even removed from the group, if you do this wrong.) These situations are \u2014 or should be \u2014 fairly rare, however. When in doubt, wait until combat is over to use the soulstone.\nIf you are in a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;, the same rules apply; if you're in a safe spot, don't resurrect using the soulstone unless you're too near where the mobs would be in the case of a wipe. If you merely died from a bit of bad aggro management and the fight is still clearly under control, it is also generally acceptable to use the soulstone. If a boss is nearly dead, you may also want to use the Soulstone. The difference in a raid is that you should probably request the raid leader's orders before using the Soulstone in any case other than having died in a spot you know is bad (and if that's the case, tell the raid so they don't presume you used it wrongly!). The leader should be watching the situation closely and know what to have you do. Also, if he tells you it's alright to use it in combat, you are thereby exempt from any fault if it was the wrong decision.\nIf you have the ability to &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt; other players, check to see whether they're Soulstoned before you do so. The \"soulstoned\" buff will appear if you select their corpse (assuming they haven't yet released). This means they're looking at the \"Release Spirit/Use Soulstone\" dialog box, perhaps thinking about what to do. The only reason they shouldn't self-resurrect if there's an ally alive and going around resurrecting people is if by using the soulstone they might aggro nearby mobs, as by having an ally cast a resurrect spell on them they will move to that ally's (hopefully safe) location. But if they've died in a good location, you only have your mana to lose by casting a rez on them.\nIf you are a shaman that has been soulstoned, and die, take care not to use Reincarnation as you will start its long cooldown, use up an &lt;a href=\"Ankh\"&gt;Ankh&lt;/a&gt;, \"and\" waste the soulstone.\nTips for warlocks using Soulstone in a group.\nUnderstand the responsibilities you are giving an ally if you soulstone them. Choose a party member based not only on their class abilities to recover your group from a wipe, but also on their understanding of the guidelines above. If you soulstone someone who tends to die bad, or who rezzes during combat, consider someone else next time. Remember that the rest of your group are also depending on you to soulstone the right person.\nSoulstones and shamans.\nIn general, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s are considered a lesser choice for soulstone after priests and paladins because of their &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; ability. However, using a soulstone will allow the shaman to save the Reincarnation cooldown for another wipe, and if someone else is soulstoned, the shaman generally shouldn't be using Reincarnation anyway. So, the argument that \"Reincarnation is doing nothing while not being used, and using it sooner and having the soulstone on someone else just sees to the ability's usefulness and the cooldown coming back faster\" is moot.\nThe shaman's resurrection ability has no cooldown, just like a priest's or paladin's, and a shaman is nearly as viable a choice for the soulstone as anyone. The one reason that the shaman would be considered a slightly lesser choice for it would be if the group wishes to have more than one person capable of self-resurrection in case one of them dies in a bad place. Also remember that, much like paladins, some shamans will be built to be in melee combat, and the chance of a melee character dying in a good place to use a Soulstone is less probable than a ranged character doing the same. Enhancement shamans will generally be tied with Retribution paladins for the lowest priority rezzers to receive the soulstone buff.\nSoulstones and druids.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Wotlk\"&gt;Wotlk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s were considered the last of the healing classes to soulstone. This was due to the fact that the only resurrection spell a druid had was &lt;a href=\"Rebirth\"&gt;Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;. While Rebirth is, and remains, the only resurrection spell that can be used in combat, it costs the druid a &lt;a href=\"reagent\"&gt;reagent&lt;/a&gt; unless &lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;ed, and has a long cooldown. (20 minutes since patch 2.3, down from 30 minutes.)\nWith the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Revive\"&gt;Revive&lt;/a&gt;, a normal resurrection spell without cooldowns or regeants, this raises the potential for druids to be soulstoned. Druids remain the only class that can resurrect in or out of combat, as well as tougher armor either by wearing leather, or turning into a &lt;a href=\"druid%23Shapeshifting%20Form\"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;. If one is considering to soulstone between a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; and a druid, the main healer should get a soulstone. Druids could arguably be a wiser class to receive a soulstone, but may not be ideal if a priest or other class is dying frequently.\nSpell information.\nThe Create Soulstone spell is of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Demonology\"&gt;Demonology&lt;/a&gt; ability category, and has 7 ranks. The act of using a soulstone of any rank begins an action of the type \"spell\" titled \"Soulstone Resurrection\" (English client). This spell occurs when the soul is stored, not when the player is resurrected. This may be identified with &lt;a href=\"Addon\"&gt;Addon&lt;/a&gt;s by using spell events."}

Notable islands like &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tel%27Abim\"&gt;Tel'Abim&lt;/a&gt; are located here. Since this sea is found in between the continents, it is a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly development.\nThe South Seas were originally planned to be the setting for \"World of Warcrafts first expansion. &lt;a href=\"Johnathan%20Staats\"&gt;Johnathan Staats&lt;/a&gt; describes it as having had a flavor similar to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and explains that the development team were extremely enthusiastic about pirate themes following the release of the ' film. However, technical limitations meant that the servers were getting too overloaded with data in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and its continents of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, preventing Blizzard from just adding more zones without either upgrading the server equipment or making the code more efficient. Thus, the team decided not to add more Azeroth content and instead use another realm, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, as the setting for the first expansion, later named \"\". This is also why the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; are on the Outland realm instead on their proper continents.\nIn the RPG.\nThe South Seas supposedly boast action, unique civilizations, and ancient mysteries. On the negative side, most of the action is swashbuckling, most of the unique civilizations are composed of bastards like the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and most of the ancient mysteries are dangerous. It is possible to cross the South Seas with a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; as that is what &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; did after purchasing &lt;a href=\"Gryphadin\"&gt;Gryphadin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Port\"&gt;Steamwheedle Port&lt;/a&gt;.\n10,000 years ago all the lands in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were part of the same giant landmass: the primeval &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; summoned the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;'s energy, and at the climax conflict, the well imploded and tore the giant continent asunder, splitting it into the &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;s as they exist today... and a few &lt;a href=\"island\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt;s. It also created a raging magical vortex known as the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, which occupies the center of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. This vortex forms the northern boundary of the South Seas, and south of it are several tropical islands. Though small, these islands have played pivotal roles in history.\n&lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; is the largest and southernmost of the South Seas islands, and, despite the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; presence, the safest. &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; is \"the port\" in the South Seas, and the only one worth mentioning that exists between the western and eastern continents. Of the South Seas islands, &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Isle\"&gt;Plunder Isle&lt;/a&gt; is the closest to the mainland, in this case to southern &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; ply the waters between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the South Seas, and occasionally travel west toward Kalimdor."}

The message read \"What are you dong here?\". The bottle was removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.8.0\"&gt;patch 1.8.0&lt;/a&gt;, though its shadow remained.

It was impossible to get to these islands without a special ability or additional help, as &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; would kill the player before reaching shallow water. The two islands were geographically similar. One of the islands was populated by &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Roc\"&gt;Fire Roc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Southsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;.

It also contained a number of uninhabited &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; structures and an abandoned goblin &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt; between the two islands.\nThese islands were involved in the quest &lt;a href=\"Draconic%20for%20Dummies%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Draconic for Dummies (quest)&lt;/a&gt; for acquiring &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;The Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Players on &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands%20quest%20chain\"&gt;The Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest chain&lt;/a&gt; were able to get an optional quest named &lt;a href=\"Love%20Song%20for%20Narain\"&gt;Love Song for Narain&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Meridith%20the%20Mermaiden\"&gt;Meridith the Mermaiden&lt;/a&gt;. After completing this quest, Meridith would grant the player a swim speed buff. \nAlternatively, a player could reach the islands by using a combination of &lt;a href=\"Swim%20Speed%20Potion\"&gt;Swim Speed Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aquatic%20Form\"&gt;Aquatic Form&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Path of Frost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hook%20of%20the%20Master%20Angler\"&gt;Hook of the Master Angler&lt;/a&gt;. It was also possible to heal through the &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; to reach these islands.

Before being divided it extended into &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; without break; the two areas are now separated by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Divide\"&gt;Great Divide&lt;/a&gt;. This region is not only one of the hardest hit by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, but also one of the biggest war zones in the escalating conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. In the wake of the Cataclysm, the Alliance has been aggressively expanding into the heart of the continent from the east coast.\nHistory.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; tore through the Barrens, carving a steep, magma-filled gorge across its center, from &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Coast\"&gt;Merchant Coast&lt;/a&gt;. The areas north and south of the divide became near inaccessible to each other. Following this, what was once the Barrens became more commonly referred to as Northern Barrens and Southern Barrens. Much of Southern Barrens was also affected by ground ruptures.\nSouthern Barrens immediately became an area of devastation. Horde settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; building the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; from hostile outsiders. To the south, the quilboar continued to menace other races and spread their territory. To the north, a druid's experiment gone-wrong resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Overgrowth\"&gt;Overgrowth&lt;/a&gt;, where even the plants are murderous. Horde and Alliance each built up new outposts for the purpose of war, centering on the &lt;a href=\"Battlescar\"&gt;Battlescar&lt;/a&gt;, which sits in the middle of a narrow pass, a natural bottleneck. The Alliance plans to blast its way through in order to maintain an overland link between Theramore and Northwatch Hold, not to mention a route into the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where the Alliance can lend aid to its allies. The Horde intends to seal off this pass, isolating &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nAs part of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt; plan to &lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20War\"&gt;destroy Theramore&lt;/a&gt; attention is first turned to the Alliance presence outside of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. As such Hellscream ordered for the destruction of Northwatch Hold, who had received word of the joint Tauren-Troll attack coming there way from &lt;a href=\"Hannah%20Bridgewater\"&gt;a scout&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Aubrey\"&gt;Admiral Aubrey&lt;/a&gt; also received word of blood elf, Forsaken, and goblin ships coming from the sea, and quickly realized that the orcs would be coming from the North. Despite the Admiral's best attempts Northwatch Hold was ultimately razed to the ground, though a few of the Alliance forces present were able to escape and regroup at &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; under Admiral Aubrey.\nAfter waiting for several Hellscream ordered for the army to move to continue its mission. However while en route the forces of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;Fort Triumph&lt;/a&gt;, launched an attack that they hoped would cripple the Horde army advancing towards Theramore. Instead, Fort Triumph itself fell, with its own siege weapons being added to the Horde war machine. With both Northwatch Hold and Fort Triumph destroyed, the Horde's control of the region was uncontested, until the Alliance launched a counter-attack that regained control of Northwatch.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Southern Barrens saw conflict between the forces of the Alliance and Horde. All major faction settlements came under attack, including the rebuilt Northwatch Hold and Bael Modan.\nAfter the war, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; stopped by the area and reported that the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; still stands and protects tauren tribes from quilboar moving into Mulgore and the Alliance's many needling strikes. The Overgrowth is often visited by wandering adventurers, and Honor's Stand, being resupplied, remains in Alliance hands. Although it is quiet since the armistice, surviving Horde soldiers previously serving at the outpost are hoping to reclaim it.\nGetting there.\nA pit of lava known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Divide\"&gt;Great Divide&lt;/a&gt; has split the Barrens in two and separates this zone from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. It cannot be crossed directly without a flying mount. However, there is an area on the border between the Northern Barrens and &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; that splits off and leads here. This is the normal method of getting here since the questing experience has been designed to segue from Stonetalon to the Southern Barrens. Low-level Horde players can also reach the Southern Barrens through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; border but should be advised that this zone is a much higher level. Alliance players can run through &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; (a series of bridges have been constructed and lead here directly from Theramore) or head down the coast from &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Southern Barrens is the southern half of what used to be the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. It is bordered on the south by &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, west by &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, east by &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and north by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Divide\"&gt;Great Divide&lt;/a&gt;, a steep, magma-filled canyon.\nThe landscape here is predominately plains, the exception being the unnaturally thick jungle of the &lt;a href=\"Overgrowth\"&gt;Overgrowth&lt;/a&gt; in the northern part of the region. Mountains to the east and west create a natural bottleneck in the middle of the region. In the southern half, a break in the eastern mountains leads to the marshes of Dustwallow. The quilboar have completely claimed the southern end, expanding their thorny settlements past the narrow canyon leading to Thousand Needles.\nNotable characters.\nPerhaps the most notable character in the history of the Barrens, &lt;a href=\"Mankrik\"&gt;Mankrik&lt;/a&gt;, can be found here exacting revenge on the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s for killing his wife. Other well known faces include the druid &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, who has recently awakened from his slumber in the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. Of the recent arrivals, one of the more famous (or infamous) is the human &lt;a href=\"General%20Hawthorne\"&gt;General Hawthorne&lt;/a&gt;, known to the Horde as the 'Butcher of &lt;a href=\"Taurajo\"&gt;Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;'.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The zone can be found to the west of the &lt;a href=\"Cradle%20of%20Chi-Ji\"&gt;Cradle of Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the name, the Southern Isles in fact comprises only one major island, and a small sand and rock outcropping to its north. This discrepancy is fixed with later phasing.\nNotes.\nNo quests take place on the Southern Isles, and there are no hostile mobs to be found; the only inhabitants (besides the odd &lt;a href=\"Spiny%20Terrapin\"&gt;Spiny Terrapin&lt;/a&gt;) the neutral Viseclaws and &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Glider\"&gt;Krasarang Glider&lt;/a&gt;s found in the surrounding shallows. With the conflicts planned to occur along the shores of Krasarang Wilds in &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.1\"&gt;Patch 5.1&lt;/a&gt;, it may be speculated that this area has been left intentionally empty to leave room for the coming conflict, and possibly NPCs and other changes to be implemented in that patch.\nFrog island.\nImmediately to the east of the main Southern Isle lies an unnamed island, remarkable for its population of frogs. Three species are present here, all unique to this island: the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Croaker\"&gt;Krasarang Croaker&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Frog\"&gt;Krasarang Frog&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Tideskirter\"&gt;Krasarang Tideskirter&lt;/a&gt;, mostly concentrated around the south and eastern parts of the island. The island also sports several non-interactable signs, each bearing a representation of a frog. However, far more remarkable is the behaviour of those inhabitants. Each type of frog has a distinct appearance, and equally distinct behavior.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Croaker\"&gt;Krasarang Croaker&lt;/a&gt;s are the largest of the three types, mostly red with blue limbs. These frogs are mostly found in pairs, a couple of yards apart, facing each other. Every few seconds, they appear to cast a spell of some kind; the hands of the frog glow green, complete with a sound effect (both the visual and sound effects are very similar to those caused by using a &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;). This lasts for approximately two seconds, at which point the frog will leap into the air, croaking and sticking out its tongue; the spell appears to be completed at this point, signified by a sound effect (again very similar to that from completing a &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; cast) and the disappearance of the green effect from around the frog's hands. The frog then jumps for a second time, followed by a moment's pause before beginning the spell again. There are a few solitary Croakers, but these do not exhibit any of the behavior of the paired Croakers, instead to be found hopping freely around the island.\nThe Croaker pairing process is also quite unusual. Generally, only paired Croakers cast their 'spell', and if a paired Croaker is killed, its mate will cease to cast its spell and will not resume casting it until its mate has re-spawned. A Croaker can also be aggroed, causing it to follow its aggressor; in this case the Croaker's mate will often follow it. However, if there is another within range, the suddenly solitary Croaker may instead decide to consider this to be its new mate, even if that Croaker is already paired to another. By selectively killing Croakers, it is therefore possible for players to rearrange the social network of these frogs from a simple set of couples to something closer to a daisy chain. Croakers can also be kited extremely long distances without attacking them, and it is even possible to cause Croakers to pair-bond at new locations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Frog\"&gt;Krasarang Frog&lt;/a&gt;s are smaller yellow frogs, and are always found in fours. Most sets of Krasarang Frogs are stationary - except for occasionally jumping and sticking out their tongues - and are found in rough circles (or diamonds), facing inwards. A set of these frogs is always found surrounding each pair of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Croaker\"&gt;Krasarang Croaker&lt;/a&gt;s. However, a few sets are mobile, to be found traveling around the island in often erratic patterns, including leaping from high places.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Tideskirter\"&gt;Krasarang Tideskirter&lt;/a&gt;s are the smallest of the three types, and also the most mobile. They are light blue, and always found in threes. They can be found running in fixed, circular routes, always in the water. Some can be found running in small circles around the other frogs, while others run far out, circling the island itself. Each trio seems to have a lead frog; this frog runs at the head of the trio, effectively leading the others.\nThe island and its surrounding sandbanks also have a small population of &lt;a href=\"Spiny%20Terrapin\"&gt;Spiny Terrapin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCro'akan.\nThe frogs on this island are quite prolific and have a rapid respawn rate. For this reason, players may be tempted to kill them en-masse in order to earn the &lt;a href=\"Critter%20Kill%20Squad\"&gt;Critter Kill Squad&lt;/a&gt; achievement. However, the frogs are not entirely defenceless.\n is a large level 92 elite frog NPC that is spawned in response to the death of a sufficiently large number of frogs on the island. He spawns in the center of the island, underneath the largest tree, with a number of possible colorations. Incensed by the senseless slaughter of his fellow amphibians, Cro'akan quickly dispatches players with his instant-death Frog Justice ability. Cro'akan is immune to attacks."}

He is the son of the late &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, whom he looked up to as a role model. While Baine has formidable skill on the battlefield, his true talents lie in the arena of diplomacy. He is a strong force for moderation, calm wisdom, and unity within the Horde, especially in their dealings with the Alliance.\nFollowing Cairne\u2019s death in a duel with Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Baine fled his home in &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt; when the tauren matriarch &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;'s agents attacked the village and seized &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Although still pained by the loss of his father, Baine staged a counterattack on Magatha and her forces, ultimately retaking the tauren capital and defeating the treacherous matriarch. Cairne\u2019s honorable son spared Magatha's life, banishing the matriarch and her traitorous allies to the harsh &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Since then Baine has assumed the role of high chieftain of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;'s courageous tauren.\nWhile bitterness might still linger over Cairne's &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;demise&lt;/a&gt;, Baine had remained loyal to the Horde and its Warchief for the good of the tauren race. He eventually supported the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in ousting the warchief, and eventually pledged his support to Garrosh's successor, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. With Vol'jin's passing shortly after the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Baine remained loyal to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and was present when Vol'jin named her the Warchief with his dying breath. However, Baine has become disgusted with Sylvanas' cruelty and lack of honor and has worked in secret with legends within the Horde and even some in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to undermine Sylvanas' plans, ultimately wanting to overthrow her as warchief. Ultimately, following the death of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and Windrunner's abandonment of the Horde, Baine became one of the leaders to form and sit on the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, representing the tauren.\nFollowing the Council's formation, Baine was captured along other leaders of both factions by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, and was sent into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; where he was tormented within &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;. He was eventually rescued by &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s and joined them in their campaign against &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and his forces.\nBiography.\nBaine was born to &lt;a href=\"Tamaala\"&gt;Tamaala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt;. When Baine was young, he never had a place to call home, and home was where his people were.\nCaught.\nBaine accompanied his father Cairne as the tauren settled in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. However, a band of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Khiragg\"&gt;Khiragg&lt;/a&gt; attacked the tauren village and kidnapped Baine, imprisoning him in their encampment. This sent Cairne into a lethargy, and without his leadership, the centaur threatened to decimate the tauren. When &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and his companions came to Mulgore to recruit Cairne's help against the invading &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne declared that he could be of no help since \"his heart was dead\". The tauren &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20%28tauren%29\"&gt;Tagar&lt;/a&gt; asked Rexxar to seek out &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20Outcasts\"&gt;outcasts&lt;/a&gt; to search for Baine. With the outcasts' help, Rexxar found Khiragg's camp, killed the centaur, rescued Baine, and brought him back to his father. Cairne was overjoyed, told Rexxar that he had given him \"new life\", and pledged his forces to the coming battle.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt;, Baine Bloodhoof led an investigation into &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; operations to the east and a campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Palemane\"&gt;Palemane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s to the west. With his father growing older, Baine took a greater role in the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; with each passing year.\nBaine attempted to warn the dwarven miners of &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Digsite\"&gt;Bael'dun Digsite&lt;/a&gt; that their violent mining methods were hurting the spirits of the Earth and even attempted to scare them off by sending &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to break their tools. However, the dwarves did not listen and continued using explosives on the earth. In Cataclysm Baine was shown to be right as the enraged Spirits of the Earth rose from the ground and killed all the dwarves at the digsite.\nStormrage.\nBy the time of the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Baine had become a major leader of the tauren. When the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; began to slowly claim all of the denizens of Thunder Bluff, he helped guide his people in their resistance, if however futile. The Nightmare affected some of these tauren, among them a friend of Baine called &lt;a href=\"Gam\"&gt;Gam&lt;/a&gt; who had his vision changed by the Nightmare so that Baine got the appearance of Centaur. Gam attacked Baine who in the end had to drove a spear through Gam's chest and let him fall off a bridge to his death.\nLater, when &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; called for the warriors of Azeroth to battle against the Nightmare, Baine was one of the many to answer. Once within the Emerald Dream, Baine once again showed his aptitude for leadership. When the Horde expressed agitation about Malfurion giving leadership to &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; for the battle, Baine was the first to stand by his side, alleviating all tension and showing that this conflict was above their petty differences. Although they fought a seemingly hopeless battle, the united forces of Azeroth eventually claimed victory, and Baine was able to return to his people to help repair the damage.\nElemental Unrest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; Baine aided in the defense of Thunder Bluff by combating the water and wind elementals that appeared on the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Rise\"&gt;Spirit Rise&lt;/a&gt;.\nAscension on the eve of the Shattering.\nAs the war in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; carried on, Baine led his people in Cairne's place whenever his father was absent, such as Cairne's journey to &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Baine is shown to be an effective and beloved leader, a worthy successor to his father.\nCairne is killed by Grimtotem treachery during a duel with the new Warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, in the arena in Orgrimmar. Upon his death, &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne's sworn rival, orders her tribe to take over Mulgore and kill everyone in it and sends assassins to &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt; to kill Baine, who remained unaware of what happened in Orgrimmar. However, Baine is tipped off by a Grimtotem defector, the shaman &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; who was supposed to lead the group attacking Bloodhoof Village, and managed to escape under the cover of a kodo stampede, sending messengers to other villages warning them of the Grimtotems' treachery. They then make their escape to &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, where they join &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; who had also managed to escape an attempt on his life. Eager to avenge his father and reclaim Thunder Bluff, Baine asks his father's old friend and adviser on how to fight Magatha. Hamuul informs the young chieftain that their potential allies are few, with Garrosh's allegiances unclear, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; being unable to help (as orcs loyal to Garrosh patrol the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; thanks to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;past events&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; being too far away, and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; being too few. Realizing he could not call upon friends, Baine decides to ask aid from an honorable enemy: &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile there, Baine unexpectedly meets Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, heir to the throne of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;; after an initial uneasiness, Baine warms to the young man, so unlike his warrior father, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt;. His sadness and churning emotions at all that has transpired cause great empathy in Anduin; in an act of friendship, he gave Baine the great hammer &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient Bronzebeard heirloom given to him by King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon \"likes\" Baine and steadies him with the Light that it wields, and he promises to treasure it always. Jaina is moved by this gesture and agrees to provide Baine monetary support in his efforts to bring down Magatha and the Grimtotems.\nBeing born a Grimtotem, Stormsong's black pelt makes him the perfect (and really, the only one available) undercover agent, and so travels to &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; to purchase the aid of its leader, &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, with untraceable &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; gold. The goblin engineer - who had always liked \"the old bull\", as he has called Cairne - agreed to assist Baine in his quest, providing &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s, explosives, and other supplies. While those tauren that are available to join Baine's forces and volunteers from throughout the Horde are eager to help, the Theramore gold also hired the technical and martial skill of mercenaries. With the materials and manpower he needs, Baine leads a surprise attack on Thunder Bluff, under the cover of a false storm provided by Stormsong's shamanic powers. Baine succeeds in defeating Magatha, sparing her life when she agrees to yield (although he would have been quite happy to end her had she not). Allowing those Grimtotems who would follow him to remain, Baine exiles Magatha and her loyalists.\nNow wielding his father's &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt;, Baine confronts Garrosh in Thousand Needles, bluntly accusing him of willfully participating in Magatha's treachery. Garrosh insists that he was unaware of the trickery until it was too late, and expects that Baine will also challenge him. Baine refuses, believing that Cairne's challenge was intended to unite the Horde and another challenge would divide it further, and begrudgingly considers the matter settled. Though he is still angry at Garrosh for his part in his father's death (after all, Garrosh had upped the ante by making the \"Mak'gora\" a duel to the death), Baine acknowledges him as his Warchief, to which Garrosh, admiring the new High Chieftain, pledges the loyalty of the Horde to the new leader of the tauren.\nHe attended the funeral of Cairne in Mulgore and was one of the last that spoke with Thrall and Aggra before they departed for Ratchet. Baine promised him to have Doomhammer's Plate delivered to Orgrimmar.\nSome time afterward, Baine fostered the growing friendship between himself and Anduin by exchanging letters.\nAs Our Fathers Before Us.\nIn the wake of Baine's ascension to high chieftain of the tauren, his formerly icy relationship with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; has become even more strained. Baine had willingly chosen not to pursue vengeance against Garrosh for the death of Cairne Bloodhoof in favor of a united Horde leadership. Baine knew that the Horde needed a strong guiding figure if it was to survive, and Garrosh could give his people inspiration. Baine meets with Garrosh and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, and the young chieftain is frustrated to learn of Garrosh's increasingly numerous demands from the mighty tauren people.\nOne such demand is access to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;'s pristine and pure water supplies, since the Horde's new &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; allies had tainted much of the water adjacent to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with their industrious projects in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Baine is apprehensive to grant Garrosh this request, and Hamuul even more so, though after a heated exchange he agrees to the demand - if a tauren representative is sent to watch over the goblins' operations from this point forward. Garrosh accepts the compromise and angrily leaves the meeting after reiterating his duties to keep the Horde's people safe to the onlooking tauren. In a discussion with Hamuul, Baine expresses optimism that Garrosh will either learn to overcome his recklessness in time or that it will certainly be the death of him. Hamuul is not entirely convinced, and even puts forward the notion that the tauren had existed long before the Horde - and that if servitude to Garrosh continued in this manner, they could always go back to those independent roots. Baine denies this answer and states his loyalty and hope in the Horde that his father helped to shape.\nRegardless, the shipments of water are satisfactory, and soon enough the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; had ample supplies of water in their homes. However, brutal raids on several of the caravans in Mulgore draw Baine's concern, and the high chieftain leaves to observe the damage. He is disheartened to witness the slaughter wrought on by the culprits, though comes to the conclusion that it was the work of the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; - better armed than ever before. Baine believes that negotiation may be possible with their new leadership at this late juncture, though Garrosh learns of this and insists the murderers be dealt with in force. Baine's advisers have similar opinions, and urge the high chieftain to sanction a deposition of their new leadership in retaliation of their violent raids and harassment of tauren land. However, Baine declines this plan, citing that such coarse action is Garrosh's way - not his. Baine instead resolves to continue working towards diplomatic measures, and find another compromise; though his advisers remind him of the quilboar's consistently brutal nature.\nSeveral of the tauren begin to express dissatisfaction with Baine's compromising attitude with Garrosh. Viewing his willingness to bow down to every demand made of him as an affront to their peoples' interests, they consider walking away from the Horde. Meanwhile, Baine continues relentlessly to find the answers to the quilboar issue. He looks to Hamuul for guidance, and the archdruid instructs him to commune with the shamans in addition to the druids to find the answer.\nBaine later finds himself dealing with yet another troublesome issue - several tauren preparing to leave both Mulgore and the Horde, led by &lt;a href=\"Greyhoof%20Farwanderer\"&gt;Greyhoof Farwanderer&lt;/a&gt;; disheartened that Mulgore has become simply an extension of Garrosh's will. Despite Baine's encouragement to remain loyal to the Horde, referencing it as being far more than its leaders; an enduring and unifying concept that Thrall and Cairne helped shape. Baine reasons that given the chance, these problems will be overcome and the Horde will be saved from both its external enemies and internal strife; though the wanderers prepare for their journey either way.\nIn the face of these disheartening events, Baine finally receives some good news from Hamuul in regards to the quilboar. They conclude that the source of their renewed unrest is also that of water; the recent cataclysm having cut off the quilboar's own sources. Baine and Hamuul personally inform Garrosh of this, though the warchief grows highly irritated after learning of yet another attack on tauren land that had gone unpunished. After an insulting exchange over the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and Baine's continued passivity in regards to the savage quilboar assaulting Horde territory, Garrosh assures him that something realistic will be done about this problem, and quickly. Garrosh later steams ahead with an attack on the quilboar without telling the tauren, though they do find out about it and Baine hurriedly arms himself and his &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; to save the Warchief from his own recklessness. Baine finds himself doubting his leadership capabilities in the face of this constant turmoil. He receives the unlikely support of Hamuul, who reassures him that his decisions for the good of their people are just and noble. In Mulgore below, Garrosh and a regiment of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; prepare their assault on the quilboar.\n&lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; in hand, Garrosh and the expert Kor'kron make quick and ruthless work of the quilboar in their tunnels. However, an ambush launched by hundreds of the beasts has the Kor'kron regiment literally swarmed over; Garrosh himself disarmed and backed into a corner. As he prepared to fight to the death, Baine, Hamuul and the Sunwalkers arrive to relieve the battle. Baine succeeded in repelling the ambush with his equally skilled use of &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, and helped the warchief reclaim Gorehowl. The Horde forces retreat, and Hamuul demonstrates the power of the Earth Mother to Garrosh as he calls upon a river. Baine stands over the defeated quilboar, and instructs them that this river will provide them with all the water they need - providing no more attacks are made on the tauren people. The quilboar anxiously return to their tunnels.\nBaine informs a silent Garrosh that if the tauren need further assistance in Mulgore, they will let him know; and the warchief travels back to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; via zeppelin.\nBaine is approached by Greyhoof Farwanderer and the tauren that had prepared to leave Mulgore prior. Having witnessed Baine's victory over the quilboar, they apologize for doubting the high chieftain's ability to lead and request a pardon for this rash action. Baine grants it, and urges them to remain strong and steadfast in these trying times for the good of their people.\nLooking upon his land as night falls, Baine turns to his guests, and reaffirms his belief in the Horde - that his father had promised to repay a great debt to it, and that he will deliver it.\nCataclysm.\nAs the leader of the tauren, he faces the troubles of Mulgore. With the help of young tauren, he kills &lt;a href=\"Orno%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Orno Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt; Baine can be seen alongside Hamuul and Kador honoring Cairne near Thunder Bluff.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; fell, Baine had a gate separating the Barrens and Mulgore constructed. Some tauren were content with that decision, and did not burn for revenge, but the Grimtotem who disagreed, and others who chose to strike back at the Alliance from Vendetta Point, were expelled from Thunder Bluff, though suffered no other repercussions.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nWhen the Warchief issued a call for the other leaders of the Horde to gather for a meeting in Orgrimmar, Baine answered the summons despite not feeling right within the \"new Orgrimmar.\" Upon arriving he exchanged a nod with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, engaged small talk with &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, and was greeted by &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; who informed Baine that he did not like the topic of the meeting. When Hellscream arrived, after keeping the others waiting, he revealed his &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;plan to scour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; from the continent and stunt the Alliance's military presence. Furthermore, with the threat of reinforcements from the south removed, Garrosh intends for the Horde to gain control of territory belonging to the night elves. When &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; objected to the plan, proclaiming that though the Alliance would be unable to attack the Horde on Kalimdor, they would then turn their attention north: towards the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. When Lor'themar remained silent, Baine found himself feeling for Sylvanas, as she was hoping for support from someone who would be reasonable and was receiving none.\nWhen Eitrigg asked to voice his opinion on the matter, Garrosh mentioned he already heard his opinion. However, Baine pointed out that they had not and in response, Garrosh grudgingly allowed for the adviser to speak. While sharing his opinion, Eitrigg found himself being cut off by Gallywix who proclaimed that there would be no costs and that he was only hearing talk of profit. In anger of the goblin's quip about the blood of foes and allies being spilled for profit, Baine found he could no longer be silent. Baine angrily told Garrosh that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; did not deserve such treatment and how she had helped him when others of the Horde had not. In response, Garrosh told Baine to be silent unless he wished to share the same fate as his father. In response, Baine asked if that meant dying &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;betrayed&lt;/a&gt;. When Garrosh roared in fury &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward to protect Baine as did Eitrigg, though at the same time &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, a Blackrock orc and Garrosh's new bodyguard did the same for Garrosh.\nAfter ordering Malkorok to back down Hellscream leaned into Baine's face and asked him if his loyalties were with the Alliance who had &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Taurajo\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; his people, or him and the Horde. In response Baine calmly stated that if he were ever to leave the Horde he would have done so before this moment, a reference to Cairne's death and Garrosh's decision to not get involved during the battle between Magatha and Baine for control of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. For a second Baine noticed that an expression of shame crossed the Warchief's face before it swiftly vanished. Soon afterwards, the meeting ended with Garrosh declaring that the Horde will move on to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, and any Alliance response would be dealt with swiftly.\nAfter the meeting, Baine and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; had a short conversation. Baine learned that Malkorok and other Blackrock orcs were allowed to join the Horde. When Baine showed his displeasure of Garrosh letting a &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; orc and a former servant of &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde, Vol'jin pointed out that he let members of the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde. When Baine responded that he supposed that he thought better of tauren over orcs these days, Vol'jin comments that in these days he did too.\nWhen it was time to begin the invasion, Baine led his tauren forces from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; and then joined up with Vol'jin and his Darkspear forces. Baine then co-led the combined Tauren and Darkspear army as it marched from the Gate to Northwatch, killing any Alliance that got in their way. As the Horde armies engaged the forces of Northwatch, Garrosh ordered his &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; to summon molten giants. Not understanding exactly what Garrosh's shaman had summoned, Baine asked &lt;a href=\"Kador%20Cloudsong\"&gt;Kador Cloudsong&lt;/a&gt; and was informed by the outraged shaman that Garrosh had called forth and enslaved molten giants, an act that was declared forbidden by the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;. After witnessing the elementals smashing against whoever got in their way, Baine called for his forces to retreat, unwilling to let any of them come to harm from the fearsome fire elementals.\nAfter Northwatch fell to the might of the Horde and witnessing the molten giants being banished, Baine confronted Garrosh. As the argument between them got heated, Malkorok got in Baine's face and challenged him to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. In response Baine ignored Malkorok; only mentioning that he had lost too many braves and had no desire to see more Horde lives lost. Turning to Garrosh, Baine mentioned he was only concerned about what may come and was subsequently told that his concern was noted but unwarranted by Garrosh. Baine was further told that Garrosh had plans and when they reached their conclusion he would gladly accept Baine's apology but until then, Garrosh did not wish to hear any more of Baine's concerns.\nWhile returning to his base camp nearby, Baine ordered his forces to attend to the body of the fallen. He further ordered that his people not desecrate any of the fallen alliance soldiers, reflecting that the Earth Mother loved all her children. Alone within his tent, Baine found himself reflecting upon Garrosh's thoughtless, heedless, and selfish manipulation of the elements for personal glory. His conclusion made him decide on one course of action. Taking care not to be noticed by any eyes and ears open to Hellscream, he ordered &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt; to come before him. Baine ordered Stormhoof to warn Jaina Proudmoore of the Horde attack on Theramore and requested that &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; be given back to its &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;former owner&lt;/a&gt;, remarking that he felt that he no longer deserved to wield the weapon due to his part in Northwatch's fall.\nIn the days that followed their victory, members of the Horde(most notably Baine, Vol'jin, &lt;a href=\"Kelantir%20Bloodblade\"&gt;Kelantir Bloodblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frandis%20Farley\"&gt;Frandis Farley&lt;/a&gt; grew frustrated and confused with Garrosh's decision to remain at Northwatch instead of pressing the attack; as Theramore was having enough time to gather reinforcements that would make the conquest of Theramore even harder. With Garrosh refusing to see anyone, Baine and the others had a secret meeting to discuss exactly what the Warchief was thinking. However, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Zixx%20Grindergear\"&gt;treachery from within&lt;/a&gt; tipped Garrosh of the meeting. It wasn't until Vol'jin voiced the concern that the enslaved elements could lead to the elements themselves taking arms against the Horde, that it was discovered they were being watched.\nWhen Garrosh showed his disbelief at the knowledge that the meeting was true, Baine pointed out no one had chanted \"Death to Garrosh\". All they did was question. However, Malkorok told them that questioning the Warchief was questioning the Horde. Baine retorted that logic only worked if one believes that two plus two equaled five and further mentioned that the meeting only happened because Garrosh refused to see anyone but Malkorok. In turn, Garrosh said he did not need to answer to anyone and they will wait until he commands them to march. When told by Hamuul that Thrall would have seen them, Garrosh, while pointing at his own brown skin, asked if this looked like the green skin of Thrall. Baine noticed that Garrosh appeared modified upon Hamuul's declaration that no one would ever mistake Garrosh for Thrall and Malkorok narrowed his eyes. While being eyed by Garrosh, the orc stated that he understood that both Baine and Vol'jin were loyal to Horde in their own way and then ordered everyone to return to their encampments.\nWhen Baine realized that word did not reach Garrosh or Malkorok of Perith Stormhoof's mission he breathed a sight of relief. Immediately afterward, Baine realized that while he needed Garrosh's goodwill, Garrosh, in turn, needed Baine's. Due to Baine being a known moderate, a large number of Horde would go his way. After taking a moment to contemplate the revelation, Baine journeyed back to his tent. As he was heading towards his encampment he remarked that he badly needed to purify himself with the clean scent of sage smoke, for his always felt sullied every time he acquiesced to Garrosh's commands.\nLater on Vol'jin and Baine were granted a meeting with Garrosh and both noticed that Malkorok was also present. The three leaders of the Horde had a polite conversation before Baine began to address his concerns and questioned Garrosh why it seemed he only listened to the Blackrock orc. After witnessing Malkorok being told to stand down, Garrosh mentions he had orders for the fleet while turning to Baine and Vol'jin. Feeling hopeful that Garrosh was either beginning the attack on Theramore or letting them in on his plan, both the troll and tauren were stunned when Garrosh's order was for the fleet to withdraw. As they left to carry out his order, Baine told Garrosh he hoped a Horde would be left after this debacle. As they were leaving the Darkspear and Tauren leaders heard loud laughter from both their Warchief and his bodyguard.\nWhen Garrosh finally began the attack on Theramore, Baine not only led his tauren in battle but was chosen along with Vol'jin to be a part of Garrosh's personal attack force on Theramore's North Gate. During the siege, Baine became locked in battle with Theramore's spymaster and Jaina's bodyguard: the night elf &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt;. Proving to be a fearsome opponent, Pained kept Baine on his toes and his eyes upon ear. When Vol'jin made his way over to him, and Garrosh who was nearby, to inform them that a dragon, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, was not only aiding in the defense of Theramore but was also trying to trap the Horde forces in order to prevent any possible retreat. After receiving this information, Garrosh ordered a retreat and Baine stayed behind to ensure that more Horde soldiers would be able to follow the retreat. Though when Garrosh told Baine to retreat as he did not wish to mount a rescue mission for himself, Baine growled and swung his mace, knocking Pained to the ground and quickly retreated from the battlefield.\nWith the battle for Theramore seemingly lost, Baine angrily marched to Garrosh as he gazed at Theramore from the bridge of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Bay\"&gt;Dustwallow Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and threw a cloth with blood on it at his face. In response to Garrosh's growl, Baine noted that the blood of the slain tauren was a more fitting decoration that his tattoos. To Baine's confusion, Garrosh merely laughed, calling him a stupid beast, and then pointed upward. It was then that the truth about the attack on Theramore was revealed. The attack was never meant to destroy the stronghold; it was meant to weaken and gather high ranking leaders of the Alliance, such as &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt;, together for one reason: so a mana bomb could not only destroy the city but kill all those who came to its defense. A move that Garrosh claimed would weaken the Alliance. Shortly afterwards the gathered Horde forces bore witness to the mana bomb destroying Theramore, to the cheers of many and the disgust and outrage of others, with Baine being among the later.\nAs he witnessed the destruction of Theramore, Baine asked to himself of where was the orc who had executed &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt; for murdering countless innocent druids, and once stating that honor should not be abandoned no matter how dire a battle, had gone. While Garrosh and many of the Horde celebrated in Orgrimmar, Baine, Vol'jin, Kelantir Bloodblade, Frandis Farley and some Horde members consisting of tauren, blood elves, and Forsaken gathered at the inn at Razor Hill in silent protest. Malkorok and his &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; later blew up the inn, killing those inside like Bloodblade and Farley who had questioned and badmouthed the Warchief and dubbed it an \"accident\". While Baine's thoughts of the \"accident\" are unknown, it is presumed that he, not unlike Vol'jin, does not believe it.\nFollowing the Alliance counter-attack on Orgrimmar, where the Alliance fleet was pushed back and the Horde controlled Kraken slain, Baine along Vol'jin, Garrosh, and Malkorok learned that Northwatch was retaken. They further learned from one of Baine's Longwalkers that the Alliance fleet was en route to destroy the Horde blockade which was created in the wake of Theramore's destruction. Baine then bore witness to Garrosh ordering the coastal blockade of Kalimdor to fall back. The young Bloodhoof finds himself pleased with this decision, viewing it as Garrosh giving up on his conquest of Kalimdor. However, when he goes to commend Hellscream, he learns that Garrosh has changed his plans: instead of expelling the Alliance from Kalimdor, Garrosh now aims to wage a war of total genocide.\nIn response, Baine calmly tells him that he and his tauren are now returning to Thunder Bluff and that should Garrosh want the continued support of Baine Bloodhoof, another Theramore must never happen. Garrosh merely gives Baine a slight smirk he can't interpret and tells him that the declaration is \"dully noted.\" As Baine leaves his eyes connect with Vol'jin who gives him a sad glance and a nearly imperceptible shake of his head. In turn, Baine nods his head showing Vol'jin that he understands Vol'jin's desire to protect his people. As Baine and his tauren returned to Mulgore, Baine couldn't help but wonder if Garrosh was mad with power or just simply mad.\nMists of Pandaria.\nBaine had dreams of a valley, golden with blossoms, filled with the hope of peace and ordered &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dawnchaser%20tribe\"&gt;Dawnchaser tribe&lt;/a&gt; to sail into uncharted waters near &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; in search of it.\nLandfall.\nBaine has journeyed to Pandaria and is keeping a close eye on Hellscream. When Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Sha-Touched%20Grunt\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; were unable to the master the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; energies Hellscream imbued them with, Baine ordered &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; to send for loyal champions of the Horde who are capable of combat and discretion to knock the sha infused orcs back to their senses. Baine sends a message to Vol'jin and informs him of what has occurred. After hearing the rumblings of dissent and worry from his fellow tauren, Baine decides to remain on Pandaria in order to ensure that things don't get out of hand. While Baine is confident that he can stay close to Hellscream, Vol'jin remains worried about his safety and secretly tells champions of the Horde to watch out for Baine.\nBaine later travels with Garrosh to the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; and sets up the outpost &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%27ar%20Advance\"&gt;Garrosh'ar Advance&lt;/a&gt; just east of One Keg. With the &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt; warlord, &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Kien\"&gt;Shan Kien&lt;/a&gt;, refusing to tell Hellscream where the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; is, &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt; is ordered to draw his blade. Seeing this, Baine steps in and offers another solution; one without bloodshed. By using an ancient pandaren tincture that recalls memories which he learned in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, Baine has Horde heroes look into Shan Kien's past. Upon retrieving knowledge of where the Divine Bell is hidden, adventurers return to report the location to Baine. Baine remarks the Horde will look for the cave and when it is found they will be called upon again.\nThe Thunder King.\nWhen Baine learned about the Garrosh attack on Anduin, he was distressed.\nEscalation.\nHaving heard of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; taking place, Baine traveled to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, arriving there just after &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Razor%20Hill\"&gt;a battle&lt;/a&gt; between the Darkspear forces and the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he found that Vol'jin had survived the assassination attempt by Garrosh's men in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. He assured his cooperation to the troll chief, but since many tauren were still inside Orgrimmar, he needed to plan it out very carefully, to prevent them from being harmed. He also mentioned that Garrosh had turned the city into a fortress and that it would be wise to seek other allies \"beyond the Horde\". He sent his friend &lt;a href=\"Abrogar%20Dusthoof\"&gt;Abrogar Dusthoof&lt;/a&gt; to Shrine of Two Moons in order to keep an eye on the events of the Vale.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nBaine and Vol'jin have moved inside Razor Hill, where their forces (Thunder Bluff Warriors and Darkspear Headhunters) were also arriving. The two leaders discussed the current situation of their army approaching by the sea and about Garrosh. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Vol'jin's Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; secured the lion's share of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; with its forces now at the gates of Orgrimmar. Baine and Vol'jin faced off with &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;, who unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Juggernaut\"&gt;Iron Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; against them. After its defeat, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; secured the entrance to Orgrimmar, and told Vol'jin and Baine to go ahead while she held the line.\nBaine with a team of Horde members is then seen in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; battling against the Kor'kron orcs.\nBaine is present along with the rest of the Horde's leadership (barring &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;, who was injured earlier in the siege) at the defeat and arrest of Garrosh. When Thrall names &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; the new Warchief, Baine kneels in respect.\nWar Crimes.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the Horde travel to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; to witness the fate of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; decided not to mete out judgment unto Hellscream among themselves and instead chose to hold a trial involving the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Warchief Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, with the approval of other Horde leaders save &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, chose Baine to play the role of defender during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. After meeting with the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;, Baine agreed to defend Garrosh to the best of his abilities.\nBaine played his role as defender opposite &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and performed his role well. Notably, he refused to pull punches on fellow leaders of the Horde. He pointed out that Vol'jin may have caused Hellscream to see the trolls as traitors with &lt;a href=\"More%20Than%20Expected\"&gt;his words and actions on the Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; and got &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt; to admit that, despite almost killing the Warchief at the Siege of Orgrimmar, he would spare his life given the chance again.\nAt one point, Baine's ability to defend Hellscream was brought into question as Whisperwind revealed his past dealings with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Hellscream, who previously described Baine as making his last days \"entertaining\", elected to keep the High Chieftain as his defender to the surprise of the entire court.\nUltimately, Baine explained his reasons for defending Hellscream so fiercely in his closing statement. He concluded that, while alive, decisions can still be made and people may yet change, Garrosh Hellscream included. Hellscream undermined this statement by proclaiming that, after everything he had done and all the lives he'd ruined, with full knowledge of the people he'd harmed in his bloodthirsty path of warfare, he regretted nothing.\nDuring Hellscream's escape, Baine battled a version of himself from an alternate timeway. This alternate Baine slew Hellscream after Cairne's death by tearing him apart with his hands, taking the mantle of Warchief for himself. During the fight, Baine became frustrated at the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s staying out of the chaos surrounding them. It was then that the Celestials proclaimed to the combatants \"Remember the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;\", leading Baine to realize that he couldn't fight this alternate version of himself, but had to accept him. Baine accomplished this after reminding his alternate self about the wisdom of their fathers, after which the alternate Baine returned to his own timeline. In the aftermath, Baine was among the leaders of both factions watching as Jaina Proudmoore was healed from her fatal wound by &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; the Red Crane standing alongside Tyrande Whisperwind.\nLegion.\nBaine was present at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; battling through the armies of demons. After the Horde escaped from the isle, he witnessed the death of Vol'jin in &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; and was present at his funeral ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; where he fought against &lt;a href=\"Felblade%20Assassin\"&gt;Felblade Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Baine can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nBaine, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"brave\"&gt;brave&lt;/a&gt;s, participated in the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; parade led by Warchief Sylvanas. He joined her at the Valley of Wisdom. At a dinner celebrating the Legion's defeat, Baine gave a speech about celebration despite their losses. He and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; expressed distrust towards &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; as he went to speak with Sylvanas privately about a &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;mysterious new substance&lt;/a&gt;. When Baine told Saurfang that Gallywix had been sending many of his goblins to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang angrily stated that nothing good ever came from Silithus.\nBefore the Storm.\nBaine Bloodhoof later set up a meeting between &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Magni had asked Sylvanas to remove the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblins from &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; healers in the mission to restore &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' destruction. Sylvanas tasked Baine to organize the Horde's response in the healing efforts, but she prohibited cooperation with the Alliance and ordered Baine to cease all contact with King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Much to the objections of the other Horde races, Sylvanas also chose to maintain &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; mining operations and investigations, citing its research to be invaluable to the Horde's efforts and that she will divulge the research when the moment was right.\nLater on, Baine wrote a letter to Anduin which stated that Sylvanas had learned of their correspondence and had pressured him into cutting off all contact with him. Baine also gifted Anduin a small piece of his horn to serve as a memento of their friendship and also expressed his hopes that one day, they may resume their friendship without being impacted by divisive politics.\nHighmountain tauren.\nHe later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; with the other leaders. When &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; called for new Horde recruits to counter the Alliance's recruitment initiative and to replenish their ranks, Baine proposed recruiting the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; and planned to recruit them during a feast between their two peoples. After Warchief Sylvanas gave her endorsement, Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; set off to greet Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and her entourage at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; was tormented by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt; attempting to corrupt him, and he and Mayla were forced to retreat back to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; while Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champion defended Thunder Bluff from Uul'gyneth's invasion force. Apparently, the wards Ebonhorn had been maintaining in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; weakened just enough to let the Darkness seep through. \nLater on, Baine and the Horde champion traveled to Thunder Totem to offer their aid to mend Ebonhorn, who has been fighting unconsciously to keep a darkness from consuming him. Mayla sent the Horde champion to &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Graysky\"&gt;Spiritwalker Graysky&lt;/a&gt;, who has the Horde champion undergo &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker\"&gt;Spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt; rituals to walk in the memories of &lt;a href=\"Igrul%20the%20Scalebane\"&gt;Igrul the Scalebane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oenia%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Oenia Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; in order to restore the wards that kept the dark corrupting forces at bay. After restoring the wards, Ebonhorn regained consciousness and revealed Uul'gyneth sought to return and conquer &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. Baine, Mayla, the Horde champion, and Ebonhorn left to join &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviash\"&gt;Aviash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt; to thwart the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;'s ritual to incarnate Uul'gyneth and restore the final ward. They failed, however, and Uul'gyneth was summoned into the physical realm, leaving the Horde champion little choice but to vanquish Uul'gyneth the Darkness. After the battle, Baine was surprised to see Ebonhorn revealing his true form as the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; Ebyssian, but he agreed to keep his identity a secret. Mayla in turn expressed her gratitude for rescuing her people from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by the strength and courage of the Horde, Mayla and Baine traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to pledge the Highmountain tauren to the Horde.\nA Good War.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; led the Horde's army through the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, publicly to head to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; but truthfully to launch an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Baine caught up with the High Overlord and asked about his mission. Varok didn't know how, but Baine's tone of voice implied that he knew something of the real plan, and Saurfang told himself that he needed to stop underestimating Cairne's son. Baine stated that most in the Horde, including himself, didn't understand the goal of the mission or why it must be done now. Saurfang replied that there was an opportunity, there was danger on the horizon, and it would be best to deal with it quickly. When Saurfang said that the plan was his own and not Sylvanas', Baine seemed relieved and wished Saurfang luck on his mission.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBaine participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He was furious that Sylvanas simply let Saurfang behind to the mercy of the Alliance, but when Sylvanas gave him the option of going outside to die or to tend to the living, Baine chose the latter saying \"For the Horde\" with an angry tone. He left the throne room before the blight was released in the city.\nAfter the Horde began trying to get the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s to lend them &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;their navy&lt;/a&gt;, Baine took a portal from &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;Great Seal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that the Horde did not lose sight of what defined them and what made them strong. Following the events within &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; that led to the death of the matriarch of the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ma%27da%20Ateena\"&gt;Grand Ma'da Ateena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; would send word to Baine about the Blood God &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, causing Baine to wonder how &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; could let an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; stay so close to &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;his empire&lt;/a&gt;. Baine was also informed of the death of &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; and the release of &lt;a href=\"Mythrax%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning of these events, Baine revealed that he shall inform Sylvanas of what occurred and that she would know how to best proceed against this new threat.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt; was successfully defended, King Rastakhan had word sent to Baine to prepare the Horde for the upcoming conflict. Expressing his belief that the Horde was founded on aiding those in their hour of need, Baine pledged to aid the Zandalari. Following the death of G'huun, Baine was present when &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; presented their victory over G'huun to the Zandalari Empire.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Siege of Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; Baine attended &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral, sympathizing with &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; over the pain of losing a father and disagreeing with &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; who encouraged her to state her grief with vengeance against the Alliance. With the Alliance soon to achieve victory in the war, Baine sought to open negotiations with them but his suggestion was swiftly shot down by Sylvanas. When Sylvanas raised the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Baine was furious. He later saw him bound in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Ritual%20%28Dazar%27alor%29\"&gt;Hall of Ritual&lt;/a&gt; and lamented about Sylvanas and resolved to set things right.\nWhen Baine wished to speak to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; once more, Talanji performed a seance to call on his spirit. With all that Sylvanas had done to strain the Horde's unity, Baine had to know who the voice that spoke to Vol'jin telling him to make her warchief really was. But Vol'jin's memory had been muddled by death, denied for him by shadows that he knew were coming for his friends. Spirits of the dead attacked the seance, and Vol'jin realized Baine's question was a good one if someone was trying to have him killed for asking it. At Vol'jin's request they traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and called on his spirit there to shed some light on the mystery. As they searched more spirits attacked them, and Vol'jin realized that that day on the Shore, something wasn't right with the way the demons' blades slipped past his guard as if the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; had forsaken him. Even now he still could not hear their voices, and no matter how much he called to Bwonsamdi the loa of death was not answering. He realized that something had been helping the Legion that day to ensure that Vol'jin died.\nVol'jin, Talanji, and Baine traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; revealed that he had not been ignoring Vol'jin's previous cries for aid; rather, he had not heard them at all. They confronted Bwonsamdi to ask him if he was the one who had told the shadow hunter to make Sylvanas the warchief, which Bwonsamdi denied. Even as much as Bwonsamdi was all for war and death, Sylvanas took things too far, and besides that Sylvanas kept the souls of what she killed as undead instead of releasing them for Bwonsamdi to claim. Troubled by their words, Bwonsamdi agreed to help them find out who had really told Vol'jin to put Sylvanas in charge.\nBwonsamdi opened a &lt;a href=\"%3ADeath%20Gate\"&gt;:Death Gate&lt;/a&gt; to one of his rivals in the ownership of souls: the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Like Bwonsamdi, the Lich King told Vol'jin that he was not responsible and that Sylvanas was upsetting the balance of life and death. Furthermore, the Lich King informed Vol'jin that he had been altered more than he realized and as neither undead nor damned he did not belong in the Frozen Throne. The Lich King sent &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s after them, forcing them to flee through Bwonsamdi's gate. Realizing that Vol'jin's spirit was getting help from some other power, Bwonsamdi also sent them to speak to the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;. Eyir informed the group that Vol'jin had been \"touched by the hand of valor\" and become something beyond even her power to forge, but whoever it was that had aided him was was not the same person who had told him to make Sylvanas warchief. Back at the Necropolis, Bwonsamdi mused that while Eyir and the Lich King were not his only rivals they were the ones he thought most likely to be behind it. He urged Vol'jin to search not the living world but the Shadowlands for his answers. Vol'jin agreed to return to the Other Side, with the promise that if he found anything he would send word.\nBaine later attended Talanji's coronation.\nFeeling that Sylvanas has gone too far Baine, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;, sought to liberate Derek Proudmoore from her and return him to his family. He personally delivered Derek to Jaina off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;the ruins of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. However, Jaina was outraged believing that Derek was Sylvanas's puppet, but Derek was able to reassure his sister that his mind was his own and that Baine had saved him from such a fate. A shocked Jaina could only ask Baine why and the High Chieftain responded that there was a sickness in the Horde, that they waged war even as the Earth Mother was dying, that the Horde has forgotten what truly matters, and his heart could no longer bare it. In response to Jaina's warning that Sylvanas could kill him for this Baine merely replied that \"No life was worth living, if we cannot be true to our nature.\" As he returned home to seek solace in his family, he encouraged Jaina to do the same.\nAt Sylvanas's command, he journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; with the other leaders of the Horde. Sylvanas revealed that Derek Proudmoore had help in escaping to the Alliance and questioned Zelling who Nathanos held at bow point. In response, Baine admitted his role in Derek's freedom and revealed that Sylvanas planned to deny Derek his free will by violating his mind to which Sylvanas thanked him for his honesty. After Nathanos killed Zelling, an outraged Baine asked her if they were nothing more than pawns in her game and accused her of betraying the Horde. However, the Warchief was unmoved and, in turn, accused Baine of betraying the Horde and ordered his arrest. As the guards surrounded Baine, he declared that Sylvanas would leave the Horde in ruins.\nRise of Azshara.\nSometime following his arrest, Baine was imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, where Sylvanas planned to keep him until his execution. However, both the Alliance and other Horde leaders such as &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; discovered what Sylvanas was planning and plotted his rescue, with King Anduin sending &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, and Lor'themar sending word to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. En route, the two groups would unite and resolved to rescue Baine together. Sylvanas, who had anticipated a rescue attempt, arranged for &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Hathorel\"&gt;Magister Hathorel&lt;/a&gt; to ambush anyone who sought to free Baine. However, despite the Magister's best efforts, he failed, and Baine was mass teleported out of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; along with the rescuers by Jaina to Mulgore. As Jaina left to report the mission's success to Anduin, Baine saluted her the tauren salute in gratitude.\nFollowing his liberation, Baine called for tauren champions who had proven their worth to return at Thunder Bluff at once, for the spiritwalkers had whispered their name with urgency. Baine revealed to them that the spiritwalkers have been plagued with visions of chaos and turmoil. When Thunder Bluff came under attack by a &lt;a href=\"Malevolent%20Spirit\"&gt;Malevolent Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, Baine rallied the tauren in defending the city and called for their aid. Following the defeat of the Malevolent Spirit that led the attack, Baine ordered its death, only for the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=\"Cairne\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tamaala\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; to appear before. Cairne told his son that the tauren way was not destruction but harmony, that they need both the light and shadow to see what lies before them. Cairne then pointed out that Baine helped the champion restore balance to the spirit realm and what balance is what the tauren strive for. When Baine asked for his parents to stay as he had much we wished to tell them, Cairne informed his son that he knew, but it would have to wait for another time. Before he departed Cairne told Baine that they were always proud of him and to always remember that they and the Earth Mother watch over him. Baine then thanked the tauren who aided them against the malevolent spirits and asked for them to thank the Spirit Guide who warned them of the malevolent spirits' coming.\nBaine supported Saurfang in his revolution against Sylvanas though his wounds forced him to stay behind in Thunder Bluff as the revolutionaries and loyalists clashed. While in the city, &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; arrived to tend to his wounds and the pair were later joined by &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, who was ordered by Saurfang to defend Thunder Bluff in case Sylvanas launched a counterattack. During the conflict, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. A stunned Lor'themar ordered for &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to report what had transpired to Baine. In response a grieving Baine stated that they will meet in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, to honor the memory of Varok Saurfang. Baine subsequently attended Saurfang's funeral. Acknowledging that without Saurfang's courage he would have been killed by Sylvanas, Baine declared that the best way to honor Saurfang's memory is to carry his legacy forward. Furthermore, he stressed that the Horde cannot remain divided, that they should reflect on all that they've endured and move forward united as one.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Rilgiz\"&gt;Rilgiz&lt;/a&gt; refused a &lt;a href=\"Former%20Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;Former Banshee Loyalist&lt;/a&gt; access to the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Bank of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;, Baine declared that many were led astray by Sylvanas's lies and thus they must come together as a united Horde. He further declared that those who seek forgiveness are forgiven and should be allowed to use Rilgiz's service, to which the goblin agreed.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nShortly after the end of the war, Baine relocated to &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where he listened to the petitions of several of the Horde's allies: &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Dresh\"&gt;Commander Dresh&lt;/a&gt; (who reported that work on an &lt;a href=\"Crushblow\"&gt;outpost&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; had halted due to a &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt; revolt), &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Sonji\"&gt;Bladeguard Sonji&lt;/a&gt; (who requested more forces to defend the coast of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Nazeshi\"&gt;Nazeshi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; (who reported that the &lt;a href=\"Vintner%20Iltheux\"&gt;vintner in Suramar&lt;/a&gt; was refusing to work with the staff the Horde had provided for the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; production). At the same time, Baine was approached by &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt;, who asked to let his people join the Horde. The High Chieftain was forced to decline as the aforementioned issues had stretched the Horde's resources thin and he could not agree to add new members to their ranks while their current allies were struggling. Kiro and his fellow vulpera &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; decided to offer their help and traveled to the Highlands, Zuldazar, and Suramar, eventually solving the Horde's problems and impressing Baine's allies. When the three vulpera returned to Orgrimmar, Baine realized that he had been wrong to dismiss them so hastily and offered them a place in the Horde, which they gladly accepted.\nBaine was later seen with Mayla in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, observing the meeting between &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Baine and the other Horde leaders received the terms for an armistice from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; addressed the absence of a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the idea of the Warchief being necessary, instead bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; was created, with Baine representing the tauren people. In the face of Rokhan's uncertainty of becoming the chieftain of the Darkspear, Baine convinced the troll that he had proved himself in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, and that as the Darkspear had faith in him, so did Baine. Recognizing Baine's words as true, Rokhan took his place as the new Chieftain of the Darkspear tribe and their representative in the council.\nBelieving that the Horde stood at a crossroads, Baine felt that it was time for the Horde to claim a new destiny and that the path they choose shall determine their fate.\nShadows Rising.\nIn light of &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s call for the Horde to respond to the Zandalari &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;wounds&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting, Baine declared that they all had their grievances but that they must be weighed against the interests of the Horde. Remarking that it wasn't easy, Baine declared that in time they can seek to right the wrongs done to the Zandalari. However, Talanji aghast at having to further wait, and the council soon fell into bickering until &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; called for it to be adjourned. Soon after the meeting ended, a failed assassination attempt was made on Talanji, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; queen and a key ally, forcing Baine and the rest of the Horde leaders are forced into action. They empowered the young &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, still grieving the loss of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her.\nAt some point afterward, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; was sent by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to Baine to find out if the Horde had any knowledge of Sylvanas being in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, to which Baine responded in the negative.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; shaman &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; warned Thrall that something was terribly wrong in the spirit world, Thrall made the decision to go &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and decided to bring &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and Baine, due to him despising Sylvanas. Upon meeting with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Baine noticed their frosty, rigid silence. Thrall subsequently formally apologized to the night elves and pointed out how Baine sought to overthrow Sylvanas and remove her as warchief. When the meeting started to dissolve into an argument about &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;responsibility&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Baine asked Maiev what justice was to her and asked her if &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; must burn, if the death of their innocents would appease her, and if she thought pain does not simply bring more pain. In the aftermath of Tyrande's revelation that she saw their words as empty pledges of justice, Baine, along with Calia, allowed herself to be corralled out of the area by Yukha. However, Thrall refused to be corralled out and promised Tyrande that he would deliver what is owed, that he would give her the head of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The group subsequently departed Nordrassil and arrived in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; soon after.\nRiding a &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Thunderhoof\"&gt;thunderhoof&lt;/a&gt;, Baine was among the Horde forces that arrived to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; in order help the Zandalari against &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; assaulting &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;his Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. In the battle's aftermath, Baine declared that it would be their honor to have Talanji join them on the council.\nAfter approving the mission of &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, Baine sent a letter that allowed them to travel across Horde territories.\nDeath Rising.\nWhen the Scourge began to &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;rampage&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; gone, Baine was targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his and &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla&lt;/a&gt;'s best efforts, he was captured and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nHeld captive by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Baine was brought before &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, and during this time his spirit was wounded as the Jailer judged his worth. The &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt; found Baine's unworthy and subsequently threw Baine off a platform. However, Baine was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, who quickly found the &lt;a href=\"Wither%20Blade\"&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; to mend Baine's spirit.\nWith his spirit restored, Baine joined the others in seeking out the &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;Eroded Waystone&lt;/a&gt;, which they hoped could help them get out of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Upon discovering the sheer size of the Jailer's army, Baine remarked that it rivaled that of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and was in fact growing larger. Upon arriving at the waystone, they were confronted by the Jailer's forces, and though the champion was able to escape, Baine and the others were captured.\nAfter being captured Baine was sent to &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, where he was held in chains. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Arkoban\"&gt;Warden Arkoban&lt;/a&gt;, he was rescued from the tower and brought to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, which Baine called \"a... remarkable place.\" He later warmly greeted Jaina and Thrall after their own liberation, and implored &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; to peer deeper into Torghast in order to discover Anduin's location.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, an ally of the Jailer, Bolvar felt a darkness calling to him within Torghast. Baine learned from Bolvar that a new mourneblade was being forged within the tower and that the Jailer decided that the time had come for Anduin to become his agent, regardless of his choice. Baine was stunned when the Jailer attempted to gain control of Bolvar through the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and prepared himself for battle. After Jaina and the Maw Walker were able to sever the connection, Baine called for them to immediately attack Torghast and rescue Anduin. However, Thrall and Jaina countered that they had to hold back and rally the covenants, a notion that Bolvar agreed with. Thus Baine bowed to their advice and bore witness to Bolvar's imploring of the Maw Walker to continue their efforts and declaration that when the time came, they would claim victory.\nChains of Domination.\nAs the covenants rallied together to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Ardenweald\"&gt;defend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; from Sylvanas and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Baine was amongst those who remained behind in Oribos to defend the city.\nEternity's End.\nBaine was amongst the crowd that welcomed the Maw Walker back to Oribos after the connection to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; was established and subsequently journeyed to the realm to aid the fight against Zovaal. He and Jaina later arrived to aid the Maw Walker against &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, who after declaring that he had bought Zovaal's champion enough time, departed before they could personally join the fight. Jaina subsequently used her magic to bring the group to the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;, with Baine hoping that if they got there in time they could liberate Anduin from the Jailer's control. However, the trio arrived only to witness the oracle &lt;a href=\"Dausegne\"&gt;Dausegne&lt;/a&gt; fall under Zovaal's sway and open the way to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; for him. After Zovaal teleported his forces towards the Sepulcher, Baine and the others returned to &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; in order to report what they witnessed to Bolvar.\nHaving returned to Oribos, Baine participated in a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar, Jaina, and Thrall about the comatose Sylvanas Windrunner. In this meeting, Uther revealed that Sylvanas's soul had been fractured from the moment of her death, that the Jailer had severed their bond, and with their reunion Sylvanas had been condemned to endlessly relive her atrocities as long as her soul remain divided. In response to this, Baine remarked that perhaps Sylvanas shouldn't be awoken. However, Bolvar countered that Sylvanas was the only one who likely knew the Jailer's plan and could be the key to saving Anduin. Though Jaina and Thrall echoed Baine's distrust of Sylvanas, the group ultimately let Uther mend the soul wound, which allowed for Sylvanas to rise and join the fight against Zovaal.\nFollowing Anduin's liberation from Zovaal's control, Baine attended the meeting with his fellow Azerothians and the Primus as they sought a way to protect themselves from Zovaal's &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;domination magic&lt;/a&gt;. Baine felt as if they must once again go to the farthest reaches of existence to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The Primus, pointed out that Zereth Mortis' &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be resistant to Domination and that using the helm might allow the heroes to find the source of their resistance. Thus Bolvar, &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, and the Maw Walker worked together to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Inscrutable%20Phrase\"&gt;Inscrutable Phrase&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, and imbue them within the intact half of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce this task was completed the trio joined Baine, Thrall, Anduin, Jaina, Sylvanas, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Baine subsequently witnessed those who had overcome Domination in the past draw out the memories of their resistance and willpower and infuse it into the shards. After Bolvar declared that they had all the pieces they needed and that it was time for Primus to reforge the helm, Baine noted that it was time to return to the Maw. Thus Jaina directly opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Torghast\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; and the group used it to reach the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;. Baine subsequently witnessed the Primus reforge the helm into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, which was quickly used to ensure that the group was resistant to Domination, as the light from the crown touched him, Baine declared \"For the Shadowlands.\"\nAfter the Jailer's defeat, Baine attended Sylvanas' trial in Oribos. He was satisfied by her punishment, stating that it was right that she faced justice for her actions. He told Maw Walkers that, for a time, he had hated Sylvanas for what she had done to him and the Horde, but that in the long run, hatred will only lead to one's doom. Before going home, Baine and Lor'themar stayed for a time in the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; atop Oribos. Lor'themar asked the tauren if there were any souls he'd like to visit before he returned to Azeroth. Baine understood that Lor'themar was asking about Cairne and replied that he didn't need to, since he felt that Cairne's spirit was always with him, guiding him in everything he did, just as Cairne's own ancestors had once guided him. Baine then turned the question on Lor'themar, who stated that he'd always wondered if he was suited to lead the blood elves and that he'd like to visit the soul of his predecessor &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to feel that the torch of leadership had truly been passed. Baine told his friend that he understood the feeling and wished him luck.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nBaine, with Mayla as his date, was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception, they spoke with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; had crashed the wedding. After Kurog caused a scene with Wrathion, Mayla informed Thalyssra how the Grimtotem was the aggressor. Thalyssra subsequently ordered Kurog to leave, and Baine thanked Wrathion for stepping in as Kurog was a powerful shaman. Wrathion informed the High Chieftain that there was no need for thanks and then departed himself.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; accepted the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; invitation to visit the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, he and &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Cindrethresh\"&gt;Scalecommander Cindrethresh&lt;/a&gt;, where Ebyssian explained how the isles held great wonder and many perils and that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; would not abide conflict on their shores. In response, Baine declared that the strength of the Horde has always been in its people, that they would honor its truce with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and that the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; will work together with the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; on an &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition of discovery&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime after this, Baine made his way towards the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin%20tower\"&gt;zeppelin tower&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, where he seemed prepared to see the expedition depart. However, seeing how both the Horde and Alliance had answered the dragon's call, caused Baine to remember absent friends, something he confessed to Mayla when she noticed that he was distracted. He then revealed that &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; had kindly responded to his letter, revealing that while there had been sightings of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, none could be verified. Baine then reflected that with all Anduin had suffered in the Shadowlands, he was simply not ready to come home. Mayla responded by reminding Baine that the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; guides everyone along the path they need to walk, and encouraged Baine to be patient as she feels that one day his friend will return when his feet guide him back to those who love him. A grateful Baine thanked Mayla for the reminder and her kindness.\nGrowing concerned at the lack of word from &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; after he had led his &lt;a href=\"Windtotem\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Baine personally traveled into plains to investigate the matter. When Mayla offered to accompany him, he rejected the offer. Eventually, he accepted the aid of adventurers that Mayla had sent to help soothe any possible tensions between the tauren and &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt; due to the bloody history between the tauren and &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Baine warmly welcomed their aid and feeling uncomfortable with entering a centaur encampment, enlisted them with entering &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; in order to ask the Maruuk about the Windtotem. However the Maruuk knew nothing of the missing Windtotem and decided to send &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tomul\"&gt;Scout Tomul&lt;/a&gt; to help Baine in his quest, a fact that displeased the High Chieftain.\nAfter discovering the destroyed Windtotem encampment, Baine sought to rally the survivors and acquire mementos of the fallen. Following this, Baine was informed by Tomul that any tauren survivors of the attack were likely to have regrouped at &lt;a href=\"Toghusuq%20Village\"&gt;Toghusuq Village&lt;/a&gt;, which he found sound reasoning and placed his faith in the adventurers and their trust in Tomul, that it was not a trap. After regrouping with the tauren, Baine acknowledged that, though he hated to admit it, Tomul was proving her worth. Thus he was inclined to trust Tomul when she received a lead on his whereabouts, despite &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Tagar Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; warning him against trusting her. Thus the trio headed into the &lt;a href=\"Shikaar%20Highlands\"&gt;Shikaar Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, where they fought against &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, rescued Windtotem survivors, and discovered that Bovan had been in the area before he was taken elsewhere. In the aftermath Baine and Tomul had briefly bonded over losing their homes to enemy centaur, while Tomul directed them with bringing Bovan's necklace to &lt;a href=\"Boku\"&gt;Boku&lt;/a&gt;, so that the mystic could divine his location.\nAfter discovering that Bovan had been taken prisoner to &lt;a href=\"Nokhudon%20Hold\"&gt;Nokhudon Hold&lt;/a&gt; and was the prisoner of &lt;a href=\"Jamoku\"&gt;Jamoku&lt;/a&gt;, Tomul declared that the mission had become too dangerous. Determined to save Bovan, Baine countered that they couldn't wait, that with his potions that would mask their presence they could easily sneak in and save him. However, Tomul pessimistically predicted that the Nokhud wardogs would easily sniff them out and refused to throw her life for a lost cause, a statement that outraged Baine, who called her a coward that was fleeing at the first opportunity. Offended by the suggestion of cowardice, Tomul promised to not Baine if he was determined to get himself killed. Determined to save Bovan, Baine and the adventurer rushed to Nokhudon Hold, only to discover that he was too late, Bovan had been slain.\nErupting into black rage and grief, Baine rampaged throughout the hold, killing many of the Nokhud forces and personally confronted Jamoku. As they clashed, Baine and the adventurer were reinforced by Tomul and other members of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt;. With their aid, Baine was able to personally kill Jamoku. In the aftermath, the group took the fallen and returned to Toghusuq Village, with Baine spending much of the trip in silence, a fact that made Tomul realize that Bovan had meant a great deal to him. At Tomul's suggestion and Baine's approval, a shared funeral was carried between the tauren and centaur for their shared fallen. In the funeral, Baine personally lit Bovan's pyre, while declaring that he had a life dedicated to courage, humility, and honor, because of him, that he could never repay him, but hoped that his words and deeds would always honor Bovan's memory. Following the funeral, Baine sent Maya word of all that had transpired and apologized to Tomul for the negativity he showed her. For her part, Tomul accepted it with grace and offered the hand of friendship, to which Baine accepted.\nSometime after the funeral, as the tauren began rebuilding Toghusuq Village, Baine personally sent word of Bovan's passing to &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;. In response to the news, the trio made the journey to the Ohn'ahran Plains, which pleased Baine to see his friends once more, with him remarking that it eased his heart to see them even though he wished their reunion was under more pleasant circumstances.\nBaine later aided the Maruuk and &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in combating &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk%20Assaults\"&gt;Suffusion Camp: Cinderwind&lt;/a&gt;. During the fighting, he admitted that while he was getting used to fighting side by side with the centaur, he found their cause to be just one. He further declared that minions of the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; must be stopped.\nTactics.\nLike Cairne before him, Baine is a powerful &lt;a href=\"tauren%20chieftain\"&gt;tauren chieftain&lt;/a&gt; and his in-game abilities are a testament to it. Now without the risk of Horde shamans and druids hurling entire &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; raids from Thunder Bluff's lift-balconies, an air-born raid can attack Baine directly from his tent. It is recommended to tank him inside of it, as his knockback ability has a wide range, and can result in unsuspecting victims gaining aggro on more of Thunder Bluff's guards and elite patrols than necessary. Downing him as fast as possible before the Horde can mount a defense raid is the best strategy to employ.\nIt is worth bearing in mind that Baine's elite guards, the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Guard\"&gt;Honor Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, share the knockdown that the &lt;a href=\"Bluffwatcher\"&gt;Bluffwatcher&lt;/a&gt;s possess - without diminishing returns. As such, a large amount of guards in addition to constant stunning can allow Baine to simply crush an unprepared tank while its healers are unable to react.\nRegardless, Thunder Bluff is not the most populated capital city of the Horde, and a prepared and subtle raid should be able to defeat Baine without huge interference.\nPersonality.\nBaine is everything Garrosh Hellscream is not: he is patient, calm, wise beyond his years, and looks to spill as little blood as he possibly can by looking at every possible alternative that could avoid a battle. His ability to speak calmly to Garrosh despite his rapid demands and insults to his people's ways only show Baine's inner control and patience in dealing with someone he feels will either end up killing himself, or growing up the hard way. He greatly dislikes anything that disrupts the peace and gets to the heart of the matter in order to quickly resolve a problem. Baine believes deeply in his people, but often feels doubt that he is not the great leader his Father was, and tries to calmly lead his people in dark times with his confidence in not Garrosh, but in the Horde's integrity and ideals. While Baine is not afraid to take charge and tell people calmly what he thinks, he is almost always trying to avoid unnecessary conflict, especially in a world already filled with much strife and suffering. Diplomacy is his strong suit, but he is a force to be reckoned with, as he fights to end a conflict as soon as possible. Despite any of his personal losses or direct affronts to his leadership, Baine is incredibly forgiving of people, and able to lay aside grudges for the sake of his people, and his own inner peace. As he tries to emulate his Father, he also walks his own path, as someone who is incredibly perceptive and deals with problems logically, as well as seeking to help deliver peace to a world that sorely needs it.\"\nIn the RPG.\nIt would seem that after &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; had a chance to speak to the tauren chieftain at Thunder Bluff about the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Digsite\"&gt;Bael'dun Digsite&lt;/a&gt;, that Baine Bloodhoof asked a group of young tauren to act as emissaries to the dwarven excavation of Bael\u2019dun to convince the dwarves to cease their careless digging. Given enough effort, the tauren apparently convinced the dwarves to allow a shaman to oversee their site to make sure that the land is properly cared for during the excavation, and that the dwarves return to the land as much as they take. Baine then asked them to deal with the Venture Company as well \u2013 a more difficult proposition, however, it seems a few good axe swings were likely more effective than conventional diplomacy.\nQuotes.\nMists of Pandaria.\nGossip.\nAn honorable meeting, &lt;class&gt;.

He was teleported inside the Temple of the White Tiger where he clashed with Baine as Kairoz had told the Warchief that he defended Garrosh. He wore a massive mace and warchief's heavy armor. According to the main-universe Baine, Kairoz selected the most broken and darkest versions. To send them back to their own realities, one was to accept the other-self. That happened as both remembered the wisdom of their father, Cairne.\nIn another timeline, where the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in bringing about the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, Baine exists as a &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Baine\"&gt;maddened echo&lt;/a&gt; in the lava-filled remains of the Obsidian Dragonshrine, now nothing more than a vessel of unquenchable malice and anger."}

Whatever the Mooneater's true nature, those who dream of Baku tend to slowly descend into a fugue state and develop the ability to manifest their will in surprising ways.

During the last such ambush, Balaadur and his minions killed the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arrexis\"&gt;Arrexis&lt;/a&gt; and claimed his staff, &lt;a href=\"Ebonchill\"&gt;Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Balaadur protected a &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam&lt;/a&gt; portal opened by the Legion at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;.

In the case of powerful &lt;a href=\"conjurer\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt;s, Balaadur himself entered the fray, somehow creating tears in reality and forcing or convincing said mage to enter it. In the extremely rare cases where someone lived to tell the tale, Balaadur was seen sporting the weapons of his dead targets, flaunting them as trophies. While he was not yet able to enter &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, this also made it nearly impossible for the Council to prevent or prepare for his attacks.\nAround the time of the First War, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Arrexis\"&gt;Arrexis&lt;/a&gt; and his appprentices conducted experiments around the warding magics surrounding the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Heeding the malicious advice of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who at the time was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and secretly killing members of the Council of Tirisfal in \"accidents\", Arrexis and his followers conducted a great ritual they believed would protect the area from &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic incursions. However, the ritual inadvertently opened a path between Azeroth and the Twisting Nether, and Balaadur's minions immediately fell upon the shocked magi and dragged them into the Twisting Nether, where they were slaughtered to the last. Balaadur took Arrexis' staff, &lt;a href=\"Ebonchill\"&gt;Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;, as a trophy of his bloody victory, marking the end of the ancient tradition of passing the greatstaff from master to apprentice. To prevent anyone from repeating Arrexis' mistake, the Council stripped all records and mentions of the mage and his disastrous ritual from their records and exiled &lt;a href=\"Daio%20the%20Decrepit\"&gt;Daio&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; for his part in the debacle.\nLegion.\nDuring the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"mage%23Frost\"&gt;frost mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; begin searching for Ebonchill to use it against the Legion. After the adventurer uncovers evidence of what happened to Arrexis and Ebonchill, Meryl proposes that the three mages recreate Arrexis' ritual in order to attract Balaadur's attention. The adventurer is sent out to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Powerful%20Mana%20Gem\"&gt;mana gems&lt;/a&gt; from Alodi's bank vault in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Stone\"&gt;demon stone&lt;/a&gt; from Balaadur's home realm by talking to the now elderly Daio in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt; and to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Kirin%20Tor%20Camp\"&gt;abandoned Kirin Tor camp&lt;/a&gt; west of Karazhan where the fateful ritual took place. Once all of these tasks have been completed, the adventurer and Meryl travel to the &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsunian&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href=\"Faronaar\"&gt;Faronaar&lt;/a&gt;, a key invasion point for the Legion, where they gradually recreate the great ritual. The plan succeeds, and Balaadur pulls the adventurer into his domain, the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20the%20Mage%20Hunter\"&gt;Realm of the Mage Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. The mage and the mage hunter engage in a battle that ends with the champion killing Balaadur and reclaiming Ebonchill before returning to Azeroth."}

After allying with the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, he declared war on the other &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; clans and tried to claim &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;'s power for himself in order to restore what he saw as the centaur's past glory.\nBiography.\nBalakar is the son of &lt;a href=\"Jhakan%20Khan\"&gt;Jhakan Khan&lt;/a&gt;, who led Clan Nokhud to become one of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; clans. Jhakan was well-respected, but Balakar did not inherit his father's patience or wisdom. Jhakan and his partner &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Nazuun\"&gt;Nazuun&lt;/a&gt; raised their son as best they could, but Balakar \"was never one to listen long enough to understand\". Jhakan mistook Balakar's undermining nature for ambition to lead and kept him close in the hopes of teaching him respect and dignity. The khan wore a &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20the%20Ancestors\"&gt;unique medallion&lt;/a&gt;, which he planned to gift to Balakar on his coming of age day. The night before the big day, he took his son on a ritual hunt. However, during the hunt, Balakar killed Jhakan in order to take control of the clan. When he returned to his people in the morning, alone and bloody, Balakar lied that his father had tried to kill him out of fear of being succeeded. Most of the Nokhud believed him. Years later, he told his mother Nazuun the truth in private, and she left Clan Nokhud in despair. Under Balakar's leadership, the Nokhud's old traditions were overruled and they grew more insular from the other clans. Balakar's &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; advisor, &lt;a href=\"Windsage%20Garuman\"&gt;Windsage Garuman&lt;/a&gt;, warned the other Ohn'ir of Balakar's hunger and of his disrespect for centaur culture.\nShortly after the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; army led by &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to reach the dragons' portal to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons repelled them, and the Primalists knew they needed the aid of the centaur to defeat the dragons. Koroleth easily recruited Balakar and convinced him and the Nokhud to start using forbidden storm magic. Balakar believed that his clan deserved the storm's power, with which they would \"show the Maruuk how far they have fallen\". He brought Koroleth with him as he and the clan traveled to the Nokhud encampment in &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; to attend the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt;. Windsage Garuman protested against this; in response, Koroleth egged Balakar on into killing Garuman with his new storm powers.\nThe green dragons sent an emissary, &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt;, to the Khural to ask &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; to aid the dragons against the Primalists. Sarest agreed to do so, but Balakar interrupted the meeting by marching into the &lt;a href=\"krutal\"&gt;krutal&lt;/a&gt; with his warriors and Koroleth. He accused Sarest of dishonoring &lt;a href=\"Maruuk\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt;'s memory by surrendering the centaur's lands to outsiders and sending centaur to die for the dragons' sake. Sarest ordered him to stand down, but Balakar responded by killing Gemisath with a strike of storm magic and having his Nokhud attack the other clans in an attempt to take control of Maruukai. Balakar himself retreated from the city and left &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Bahir\"&gt;Guard Bahir&lt;/a&gt; in charge to cover his escape. &lt;a href=\"Khansguard%20Akato\"&gt;Khansguard Akato&lt;/a&gt; opined that Balakar was blinded by lust for power and disgraced his clan by \"leading them into the storm\".\nBalakar began marshalling his army to conquer the Ohn'ahran Plains. Meanwhile, Sarest and her allies prepared their own forces and asked Clan Ohn'ir to find &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; so that Sarest could blow the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; and ally with the green dragons, since she knew that she could not win the war against the Nokhud without the dragons' aid. However, using a false summons from &lt;a href=\"Tigari%20Khan\"&gt;Tigari Khan&lt;/a&gt;, Balakar and the Nokhud lured the Ohn'ir into an ambush at &lt;a href=\"Ridgewater%20Retreat\"&gt;Ridgewater Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and enacted a plot with the Primalists that resulted in Koroleth capturing Ohn'ahra. Shortly after, Balakar personally led a warband of Nokhud in an attack on the Horn of Drusahl and massacred the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Teerai&lt;/a&gt; who guarded it. Sarest assumed that Balakar intended to destroy the Horn to prevent her from summoning the dragons, and went to confront him in person. Upon seeing the sack of the Teerai village, she decided that Balakar had betrayed everything the Maruuk stood for and that he was irredeemable. However, his plan was not to destroy the Horn, but to use it: Koroleth forced the captive Ohn'ahra to bless the khan, allowing him to blow the Horn and summon the green dragons &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solethus\"&gt;Solethus&lt;/a&gt; into a trap. The Nokhud tried to kill Merithra with one of their &lt;a href=\"dragonkiller%20ballista\"&gt;dragonkiller ballista&lt;/a&gt;e, but Solethus sacrificed himself to save her. Koroleth then forced Ohn'ahra to teleport her and Balakar away.\nKoroleth subsequently led a new Primalist attack on the Emerald Gardens, but was defeated by an alliance between the dragons and the remaining centaur clans. Meanwhile, Balakar withdrew to &lt;a href=\"Nokhudon%20Hold\"&gt;Nokhudon Hold&lt;/a&gt; with Ohn'ahra, intending to use her power to \"bring forth a mightier Maruuk\", while his raiders began an &lt;a href=\"Nokhud%20Offensive\"&gt;offensive across the plains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s helped rally the Teerai, Ohn'ir, and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Shikaar&lt;/a&gt; against the Nokhud and their allies, then attacked Nokhudon Hold and engaged Balakar. The khan completed a ritual to infuse himself with Ohn'ahra's power, but the adventurers killed him and freed the Windmother. With his last words, Balakar asked the ancestors to forgive him. Sarest announced that Balakar's weapon would be broken, denying him a place of honor with the ancestors, and expressed hope that Clan Nokhud would be able to heal now that they were free of his influence."}

With her defenses weakened and her gold supply exhausted, she cannot last much longer. You must bring Malfurion and Tyrande to Maiev's base and crush the imminent Naga threat.\"\nIllidan's Minions.\n\"The Naga forces are still poised to attack. Destroy them and send Illidan's foolish minions back to the sea so that you can recapture Illidan.\"\nOptional Quests.\nNight Elf Fleet.\n\"The Night Elf fleet was separated when crossing the perilous ocean. Now the three remaining ships are stranded offshore, unable to safely land. Reach all of the ships and clear a path for them to land upon the shore.\"\nPrelude.\nAfter successfully stealing the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan ordered the larger part of his Naga under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; to travel to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, to prepare for the ritual which would destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan himself stayed behind upon the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; with a smaller force of Naga commanded by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Serpentra\"&gt;Lady Serpentra&lt;/a&gt;, to finish the destruction of his sworn enemy, Maiev Shadowsong.\nHowever, Maiev had been successful in calling for reinforcements. Horrified by the reports of Illidan's actions, Tyrande Whisperwind and Malfurion Stormrage quickly mustered a relief force and traveled to the Broken Isles to aid the &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately their fleet was scattered by the storms of the region. The two Night Elves hastily attempted to rally their forces as the Naga renewed their assault upon Maiev.\nThe Battle.\nMaiev and her few remaining Sentinels had been driven to the ruins of the ancient library of &lt;a href=\"Izal-Shurah\"&gt;Izal-Shurah&lt;/a&gt;, a place devoid of resources. They fought grimly against the overwhelming numbers of Naga, knowing defeat to be all but inevitable. Meanwhile, Tyrande used her owl scouts to discover Maiev's position. She and Malfurion sought out the Night Elf ships driven off-course, fighting their way through gangs of Naga and sea monsters to link up with some &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Giant\"&gt;\"special allies\"&lt;/a&gt; Malfurion had had summoned specifically for the attack. These proved instrumental in tearing apart the Naga base closest to Maiev's beleaguered Sentinels.\nMaiev was overjoyed to see Malfurion, but treated Tyrande with disdain for her part in releasing Illidan from his prison. Regardless of their divisions, the three commanders united to engage the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, who had stepped in to personally lead the Naga against the Night Elves. The latter forced Illidan back to his base and routed his Naga.\nIn the confusion of the final assault upon the second Naga base, Illidan managed to slip away with his &lt;a href=\"Naga%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;. He was tailed by Tyrande, who was in turn ensnared by a &lt;a href=\"Myrmidon\"&gt;Myrmidon&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan told Tyrande that to follow him was to invite disaster, and what he did was for the good of all; Tyrande replied that she saw now that it had been a mistake to release him. With the arrival of Maiev and Malfurion, Illidan fled, leaving the Myrmidon to cover his escape.\nAftermath.\nIllidan fled to Dalaran to unite with Vashj and her forces, who had begun the final preparations for the mighty spell which would tear apart the Lich King's realm. They were followed by his three pursuers, however, who united with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; to confront him once and for all.\nDespite their emphatic defeat of the Naga on the Broken Isles, the Night Elves did not attempt to reclaim their former lands for themselves. Whether the Naga remained in the sunken ruins is not known."}

Plus, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; uncovers an &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;'s plot while in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, and must warn Lo'Gosh of the danger headed his way.\nPlot.\nThe issue begins where \"&lt;a href=\"Destiny%20Awaits%21\"&gt;Destiny Awaits!&lt;/a&gt;\" left off, with Lo'Gosh getting knocked off &lt;a href=\"Sharptalon\"&gt;Sharptalon&lt;/a&gt;'s back by one of &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt;'s slavers while he and Broll are escaping Thunder Bluff. Luckily, Broll manages to grab hold of Lo'Gosh's arm and maneuvers Sharptalon in such a way that his companion can get within striking distance of the slavers and cut them down from their &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s. During the fight, Lo'Gosh notices that Sharptalon has been wounded and, after dispatching the last of Rehgar's guards, questions his and Broll's next course of action; while they need to go back and rescue Valeera from &lt;a href=\"Helka%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Helka Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, Sharptalon is in no shape to carry the pair all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Coast\"&gt;Merchant Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Broll replies that he has family in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; and that they can land there to let the &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; recover before backtracking to free Valeera, assuming she hasn't escaped already.\nBack in Thunder Bluff, Valeera and &lt;a href=\"Bristlefur\"&gt;Bristlefur&lt;/a&gt; are hiding behind a tent on the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rise\"&gt;Elder Rise&lt;/a&gt;, having lost sight of Lo'Gosh and Broll after their escape. Suddenly, Valeera sees &lt;a href=\"Blackklaw\"&gt;an ebon gryphon&lt;/a&gt; arrive on the mesa, carrying the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Assassin%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Stormwind Assassin's Guild&lt;/a&gt; member that was hired by the mysterious hooded figure to kill Lo'Gosh. The assassin meets with &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, who received a message through the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; that he was coming. The assassin states that he wants Lo'Gosh dead or alive and will pay for information about him. Magatha replies that the champion of &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; has escaped but tells the assassin to come into her tent so they can discuss things further. Valeera decides to eavesdrop on the conversation.\nAs dawn breaks, Sharptalon is seen carrying Broll and Lo'Gosh through &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Broll tells Lo'Gosh about how Ashenvale has become disputed territory, and of how &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; began harvesting wood from the forest to construct their nation in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; while Broll was a gladiator. Suddenly, the group comes across a vast swathe of the forest that has been completely felled and desecrated by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces, and nearby they spot a large group of Horde soldiers preparing to ambush an approaching &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; force. Broll concludes that the Horde's wanton destruction of the forest was a ruse to lure the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; into a trap.\nLanding Sharptalon, Broll and Lo'Gosh greet the Sentinels, who include a night elf &lt;a href=\"priestess%20of%20the%20moon\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt; and Broll's cousin &lt;a href=\"Telandria\"&gt;Telandria&lt;/a&gt;, and inform them of the nearby Horde contingent. Lo'Gosh suggests that the Sentinels use the same strategy the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were hoping to use on them: quietly set warriors in the forest behind the orcs, then lead a small force directly into the open that will flee at the sight of the Horde soldiers, luring the orcs into a chase and allowing the warriors hidden in the forest to attack from the rear. The priestess suggests that Broll sit the fight out. Lo'Gosh protests and instead suggests that Broll sweep down on the battle on Sharptalon to frighten the Horde forces. Broll agrees and assures the priestess that he has spent years learning to contain his rage.\nDuring the evening in Thunder Bluff, Valeera overhears the conversation between Magatha and the assassin. Magatha throws a set of rare herbs into a campfire to create a vision of where Lo'Gosh has gone, revealing that he and Broll are in Warsong Gulch and that their lives are already in danger.\nIn Ashenvale, Broll and Lo'Gosh prepare to perform the feint. Broll asks the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; how it feels to be mounted on a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; after his time atop Sharptalon. Lo'Gosh replies that it feels natural and that he must have spent much of his previous life on horseback. Without further ado, Lo'Gosh leads a handful of Alliance soldiers as they rush out in front of the Horde army before turning around and riding back, luring the orc forces into the open and allowing the bulk of the Alliance army to sweep down on them. As the battle is joined, Broll leaps down from Sharptalon and shapeshifts into a &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; to join the fray. However, at the back of the battle lines, an orc &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; suddenly summons a huge, uncontrollable &lt;a href=\"lava%20elemental\"&gt;lava elemental&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndifferent to the warring factions, the elemental begins wreaking havoc on the battlefield and setting fire to the surrounding forests. Broll is overwhelmed by rage and \u2014 despite the priestess' protests \u2014 shapeshifts back into night elf form and summons the elements of fire and thunder to Ashenvale, conjuring a chaotic storm and causing roots to erupt from the ground to envelop the combatants. Lo'Gosh yells for Broll to stop while the rain from the storm destroys the lava elemental. Even so, Broll remains enveloped in rage, and Lo'Gosh is unable to reach him until he rips free of the roots that bind him and knocks his companion unconscious with a branch. Immediately, the storm breaks and nature begins to return to normal while the Sentinels apprehend the defeated Horde forces.\nBack in Thunder Bluff, Magatha and the assassin have finished watching the vision of the battle. The assassin gives Magatha a hundred gold for her help and leaves on his gryphon. Valeera quickly follows him on Bristlefur.\nIn Ashenvale, Lo'Gosh and Telandria discuss the unconscious Broll. Lo'Gosh reflects that he never knew what Broll was capable of, and that the druid had restrained himself in Dire Maul by only ever fighting with his staff and as a bear. Telandria explains that Broll was not always so quick to anger. He was born with antlers, a rare sign of great potential, and people long waited for his greatness to manifest. However, wile he grew up into a powerful druid with great skills of shape-shifting, he didn't seem to be anything special. In time, he was gifted with the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact crafted by &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and connected to &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;a green dragon&lt;/a&gt; that linked Broll to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. It was thought that the idol would allow Broll to manifest his full potential, but he advanced no further and he began to feel as if he had failed to fulfill his promise. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Broll fought &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces alongside his daughter &lt;a href=\"Anessa\"&gt;Anessa&lt;/a&gt;. His command was cut off from the main force and was attacked by a group of powerful &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s drawn to his hiden core of druidic power. Desperate, Broll called on the deep earth to protect his allies and stood his ground, allowing the others to pull back towards the main force while the trees uprooted themselves to attack the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and demons. In the end, however, he was overwhelmed by the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt; and dropped the idol as he fell. Anessa rushed to her father's side, but when Azgalor's blade, &lt;a href=\"Spite\"&gt;Spite&lt;/a&gt;, struck the idol, it unleashed an explosion of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy that killed Anessa instantly.\nWhile Broll's sacrifice saved many lives and contributed to the mortal races' victory, the fel blast left him traumatized and tainted. Blaming himself for the loss of the idol and his daughter, he was unable to contain his rage and his manifestations began to endanger others. His animal transformations became monstrous and eventually ceased altogether, with only the bear standing by him and allowing him to use its form. Shortly after, Broll vanished. Telandria finishes her tale by saying that if Broll became a gladiator as Lo'Gosh says, he chose that path willingly, for if he had wanted otherwise, no master could have contained him.\nSuddenly, Broll wakes up and immediately apologizes to his cousin for thinking he was ready to be among them again. He concludes that without the structured aggression of arena combat, he is still a danger to people around him. Lo'Gosh tells Broll to get over it, since his actions saved them all from the lava elemental and ensured the Sentinels' victory over the Outriders. Telandria informs Broll that while everyone thought that the Idol of Remulos had been destroyed, rumors have surfaced that it was secretly carried off by a &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; and now taints the forest near &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20Hold\"&gt;Thistlefur Hold&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting the furbolgs there. Broll thanks Telandria for the information and resolves that if the idol still exists, it his responsibility to cleanse or destroy it once and for all, and that he will go to Thistlefur Hold."}

He uses two &lt;a href=\"Volcanospike%23Heroic\"&gt;Volcanospike&lt;/a&gt; swords as his personal weapons.\nWorld first \"heroic\" kill on 25-man achieved 7.7.2011 by Method - EU-Xavius.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Baleroc earned a reputation as a merciless combatant during the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20wars\"&gt;elemental wars&lt;/a&gt; of ancient Azeroth. Now that he is confined to the Firelands, Baleroc's sanity has dwindled. Few elementals dare disturb him, fearful that they will become victim to his battle lust.\"\nAbilities.\nIn all difficulty settings, Baleroc has a hard enrage timer of 6 minutes.\nStrategy.\nTanking.\nBaleroc is a 2-tank fight with an Blaze tank and a Decimation tank. \nThe Decimation Blade mechanic motivates you to have one tank who has a little over 250K health so that he can survive Decimation Blade. The other tank will gain stacks of Blaze of Glory which will eventually cause him to have much more health. \nThe Decimation tank should start the pull and stack Blaze of Glory until he has just over 250K health. At this point the Blaze tank can wait for safe time (not during an impending Decimation Blade) and taunt off the Decimation tank.\nIf the Blaze tank were struck with Decimation Blade late in the fight he would suffer much more than 250K damage, causing unnecessary load on the healers. Conversely, if the Decimation tank were struck by Inferno Blade, he might not have enough health to survive the Incendiary-Soul-augmented damage. This tank swap might remind raiders of the &lt;a href=\"Chimaeron\"&gt;Chimaeron&lt;/a&gt; Break/DA tank option.\nWhen Baleroc empowers his blade, it will be random whether he chooses Decimation Blade or Inferno Blade (note: the first blade will always be Inferno Blade), but you do have a warning to give you time to taunt. Once his blades are empowered they are in that mode for 12 seconds. This means that the Decimation tank can take a total of 3 strikes that do &gt;240K damage. This damage cannot be reduced by cooldowns, absorbs, or blocks, but fortunately it \"can\" be dodged or parried. Unfortunately this is not reliable, so healers still need to get him back &gt;90% health during the 5 seconds between swings. If the healers are having difficulty doing this reliably the Blaze tank can taunt until the Decimation tank is restored. This is a desperate tactic because the healers then have to heal up the Blaze tank from near death, and in the late stages of the fight it is not unusual for the Blaze tank to have more than a million health.\nThe random nature of the blades and the chance to avoid Decimation Blade does, along with the rapidly ballooning healing output, does mean that losing the Decimation tank late in the fight is not necessarily an instant wipe. The Blaze tank can survive a single Decimation Blade, and healers can often (though with difficulty) manage to heal through the vastly increased damage if they've been stacking Vital Spark properly, and it's possible to randomly get Inferno Blade (instead of Decimation Blade) repeatedly. In addition, if a tank is resurrected, he retains his stacks of Blaze of Glory, so it is possible for him to resume his role.\nShards of Torment.\nBaleroc drops Shards of Torment: 1 in 10-man, 2 in 25-man. The shards will spawn on the closest non-tank to Baleroc, generally one of the melee, so it is a good idea to have the melee stack up at a particular location before each shard spawn to ensure a predictable location. \nIf no one is near a Shard of Torment, it inflicts Wave of Torment upon the entire raid. Do not let this happen. When players are in range of a shard the closest one gets stacked with Torment. \"Torment must be taken by DPS.\" Healers and especially Tanks never ever want to get Torment, because the Tormented debuff that follows halves their healing performed and will cause the Tank to take deadly damage from Inferno and Decimation Blade.\nThe stacks of Torment cause increasing shadow damage. The shard \"tank\" wants to let Torment stack as high as possible before running away and letting another DPS \"tank\" the shard. The high stacks of Torment allow healers to stack Vital Spark faster. Each shard will apply a total of 24-25 stacks of Torment, so either 2 dps taking 12 stacks apiece (topping out at 48000 shadow damage per second to the shard tank) or 3 dps taking 8 stacks apiece (topping out at 32000 shadow damage per second to the shard tank) is recommended. An alternate strategy is to have one dps with a large damage reduction cooldown (a Retribution paladin with Divine Protection glyphed is a good candidate due to the short CD) take 15-18 stacks, with another dps taking the remaining 8-10. This allows healers to gain an extremely large number of Vital Spark stacks from that shard phase.\nOnce a player has stopped tanking a shard, they will lose their Torment stacks after 1-2 seconds and gain Tormented instead. Tormented significantly increases shadow damage taken, meaning it would be a really bad idea for a Tormented player to get any Torment stacks until the Tormented has fallen off. This means that DPS will have to take turns tanking the shard. However it is important to note that the Torment channel does not refresh the Tormented debuff. This only happens if you gain, then lose the Torment debuff. Tormented lasts 40 seconds. If using 3 DPS per shard (8 stacks each), this means a minimum of 5 dps will need to be in the shard rotation, as the Tormented debuff will fall off again just as the first player needs to take it from the 5th.\nThis Tormented debuff also means it is \"extremely\" important that the Decimation Blade tank doesn't accidentally take a tick of the shard and gain the debuff, as Decimation Blade will one-shot that tank with it up.\nOn Heroic mode, Tormented will spread to all nearby players. Because of this, extra care needs to be taken that Tormented Players are stacked away from other players (but not too far, due to Countdown), that the tank(s) \"never\" get Tormented, and that healers get it as little as possible.\nHealing.\nHealers can be divided into two teams. One team will heal the boss tank while the other team heals the shard tanks suffering from the Torment debuff. \nUsing direct heals (not AoE or HoT heals) on a player with Torment stacks Vital Spark.\nWhen a healer with Vital Spark casts a heal on a player with Blaze of Glory (either of the boss tanks) then it converts spark stacks to Vital Flame, increasing healing done to the Blaze of Glory player.\nAfter 15 seconds the Vital Flame will convert back into Vital Spark with the same number of stacks it had previously.\nOnce the Vital Flame ends the healing teams should swap duties. The ones that were previously stacking Vital Spark by healing Torment victims should start healing the boss tanks and activate their Vital Flame. The ones that were healing the boss tanks should start healing Torment victims and stack more Vital Sparks. Alternatively, to reduce target swapping and ramp-up time on healing, healers can stay on the tank for two Vital Flame cycles, then swap off for two. This results in healers swapping every 30 seconds rather than every minute. Since the shards last approximately 28 seconds apiece, this swap lines up well with them and can be used as a rough gauge of swap timing.\nCountdown.\nIf you are a Countdown victim, move to the other player and hold still until the debuff falls off. If you fail to do this, or move too slowly, (or run away too soon), you will both explode and do massive damage to most of your teammates. If one player has Tormented, it is possible with perfect execution to avoid spreading the debuff; however, this can be almost impossible in actual circumstances (for instance, due to latency). Backup healers and soakers must be prepared to take over in case a healer or shard soaker receives Tormented as a result of Countdown.\nEnrage.\nOn all difficulties, Baleroc has a hard enrage timer of 6 minutes. Notably, his enrage does not immediately wipe the raid, and it is possible with kiting and a good string of avoidance to kill him after his berserk.\nSolo strategy.\nPop CDs on the pull. Get far away from the Crystal of Torment. Baleroc's hitbox is a good distance indicator, as the crystal should be on the opposite side of Baleroc's hitbox from the player. The pulsing Wave of Torment does \"far\" less damage than the stacking Torment debuff. The heroic-only Countdown mechanic never comes in to play, as there is only one player to target.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nTrivia.\nBaleroc is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Epcar\"&gt;Richard Epcar&lt;/a&gt;."}

This title is no longer obtainable because all new &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;s were brought online with the Gates unlocked, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion saw the removal of all quests relating to the world event.\nObtention.\nIn addition to all players on a realm working towards completing the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%23Gathering%20war%20supplies\"&gt;War Effort&lt;/a&gt;, one player had to create the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; - a very difficult task that could only be solved by a server's top guild(s) back when the questline was added.

Anyone else who followed them within 10 hours, usually only 1 to 3 people, was rewarded with the title too.\nAlthough it is still possible to complete the questline for the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, doing so when the Gates are already opened will not reward neither the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Qiraji%20Resonating%20Crystal\"&gt;Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal&lt;/a&gt; nor the Scarab Lord title."}

According to popular belief, it is thought that you need to kill Whitemane first or she will resurrect Mograine again; she does not, but it is good to kill Whitemane first because she will heal herself and Mograine occasionally."}

A major adversary of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, their name has become synonymous with corruption and extremism, and several quests in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; involve attacks on Scarlet Crusade troops, leaders, and strongholds. The Scarlet Crusade maintains several bastions throughout the former lands of Lordaeron, namely the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, and up until the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the fortified &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and several smaller camps and &lt;a href=\"scout%20tower\"&gt;scout tower&lt;/a&gt;s spread throughout the whole area of northern Lordaeron.\nIt is one of the hierarchies left over from the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; after its destruction by the Scourge. After the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarlet Crusade renamed itself to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; and operated in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, though some members of the original Scarlet Crusade did not transfer to the Scarlet Onslaught.\nSince the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarlet Crusade has experienced a downfall, losing many of its holdings in the now-recovering Plaguelands to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and many of its surviving members, ironically, to &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the Scarlet Crusade in Lordaeron regrouped at the Monastery under the command of &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Goodchilde\"&gt;High Commander Goodchilde&lt;/a&gt;, they were soon assaulted by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; who totally wiped them out, in order to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; as a member of their new &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. In Northrend, while the Scarlet Onslaught was largely dismantled and originally stated to be the replacement for the Crusade, &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen\"&gt;New Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; continues to operate, even though it has lost the majority of its leadership and its goals have been dashed away, and was interchangeably referred as the Crusade and as the Onslaught.\nAs of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Scarlet Brotherhood\" was formed, marking a resurgence of the Scarlet ideology in Lordaeron, they declared themselves to be &lt;a href=\"House%20Menethil\"&gt;House Menethil&lt;/a&gt; loyalists and were politically opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which they saw as being led by a traitor.\nHistory.\nThird War.\nThose who would later become the founders of the Crusade met in &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, where together they purified a dark crystal into what would become the core of the holy &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; sword. By that time a faction had started growing in the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, largely led by &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;. This faction was intolerant of what they deemed as the \"lesser races\".\nThe core of the Crusade's forces began as a group of survivors of the Silver Hand who regrouped in &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; after an offer of &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. Ashbringer in hand, Highlord &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; led the knights of the now disbanded Silver Hand through Lordaeron. Such were his acts that he and his weapon quickly became legends.\nThe Ashbringer.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the core of the Crusade's force came to a meeting in Hearthglen to determine whether they should pursue and eliminate Arthas or fight to take back Lordaeron from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Their meeting concludes with the decision of Saidan Dathroan to focus their efforts on &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; to stop the spread of the undead epidemic.\nDuring an assault on Stratholme, however, became separated and lost during the assault. They were overjoyed when he finally reappeared, but none of them could have imagined the truth: that during his absence he had been killed and replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remnants of the Silver Hand managed to strike an alliance with the communities of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; while also establishing a forward base in an old &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; not far of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. However, dissensions started appearing in the leadership of the human resistance. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; suggested that in order to retake their fallen cities, the order should recruit among the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Other prominent leaders such as &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; disagreed, considering the fate of Lordaeron the affairs of men.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; showed the will to attack the Forsaken, Balnazzar began manipulating the organization to serve his own ends. Together with his brother &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, he devised a plan to remove a serious threat to both of them: Mograine and his &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; sword. As Saidan Dathrohan, he started talking a lot with Alexandros's son &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;, playing on his desire for approval and recognition, until he eventually managed to convince him to betray his father. Renault led his father and into Stratholme, where they were set upon by the Scourge. Though Alexandros fought bravely, and many undead fell before his blade, he eventually dropped the Ashbringer, which Renault used to stab his father through the back before fleeing. Fairbanks, who had been buried beneath the undead bodies and thought slain, eventually returned to the Scarlet Monastery and tried to tell the others what had happened. Saidan Dathrohan claimed he had been tainted by the undead, and he was executed. However, there were those who believed that their comrades had fallen from their once-noble purpose, and left to form their own order, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Those that remained formally named themselves the Scarlet Crusade.\nOne day, Renault's younger brother &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion&lt;/a&gt;, who had joined the Argent Dawn, came walking into the chapel of the Scarlet Monastery. Renault initially assumed he had come to join the Scarlet Crusade, until he saw what he was carrying: the Ashbringer. Furious, he began to savagely beat Darion, not noticing that a strange shadow was emerging from the blade. The shadow coalesced into the form of Alexandros Mograine and, after accusing his son of betrayal and murder, killed him. Darion took the Ashbringer and left, and soon after &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as commander at the Monastery.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; was later mortally wounded by the undead and died in his daughter's arms while defending &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. The reinforcements from the Monastery led by &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;High Inquisitor Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; managed to save the city.\nA Cleansing Fire.\nIn year 24, the Scarlet Crusade patroled Lordaeron villages, checking them for the plague. On one such patrol, Saidan and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas\"&gt;Sir Thomas&lt;/a&gt; led a group of crusaders into a village, which was deemed corrupted by the Grand Crusader. Thus, the crusaders slew the townsfolk.\nLater, the crusaders struck at a settlement north of &lt;a href=\"Dalson%27s%20Tears\"&gt;Dalson's Tears&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; which housed Sir Thomas' family. Unbeknownst to him, Thomas killed his family, and it was too late when he realized what he has done, and went mad. The other crusaders dragged him back to the Scarlet Monastery. Saidan then convinced Thomas to join the crusaders in an attack against the Scourge during &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;. Although he killed Scourge, Thomas also killed his fellow crusaders. As such, the Crusade was forced to cut down their former brother. Then, the soldiers brought his body back to the monastery.\nLight's Wrath.\nAt some point, the Scarlet Crusade set out to create a staff of unparalleled holy might. A weapon that would rival even the legendary &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in righteous fury. As the Ashbringer derived its power from a shadowy artifact that had been purified in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and affixed to the blade, the zealots sought to do the same for its staff. The order sent its most loyal crusaders into the war-torn &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; in search of a suitable relic, and the few who returned bore a strange jewel bristling with darkness. Some sources say it had been part of a truncheon carried by one of the first &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; to walk the world. Other accounts hint that the dreaded &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; has shaped the jewel with his spectral hands. Whatever the truth, the Crusade would use the black gem to create the staff known as Light's Wrath.\nTen of the Scarlet Crusade's learned priests gathered in &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; to create Light's Wrath. For weeks, they practiced a ritual that would purify the dark jewel and bind it to the staff. However, when &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; learned of the plans to forge Light's Wrath, he feared that such a weapon could unmask his deception and shatter his hold over the Crusade. The &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; disrupted the cleansing ritual, and the crusaders lost control of their delicate spellwork. A storm of holy energy ripped through the meeting place, instantly killing the ten priests. Yet Light's Wrath was left intact. The blast had purified the jewel and affixed it to the staff. Upon close inspection, Balnazzar found that the staff trembled with unstable energies. Wielding it with any reliability would be near impossible. Rather than destroy the weapon, the demon allowed the Scarlet Crusade to keep it. He looked forward to the mayhem it would cause in the years to come.\nDuring a battle near &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; outnumbered the Crusade by twenty to one, until the staff was used to destroy the undead. However, it killed its wielder and many of the soldiers at his side, while the surviving crusaders have been left dumbstruck. At some point, the Scarlet Crusade raided a small village in search of the Scourge, using Light's Wrath to \"cleanse\" the living townfolk, as they were afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt;. But once again, the priest using the staff lost control of its power, and what was once the town square became nothing more than a smoldering crater, filled to the brim with bodies. Of all the Scarlet Crusaders who bore Light's Wrath, &lt;a href=\"Halbin\"&gt;Inquisitor Halbin&lt;/a&gt;'s discipline and calculated focus were unmatched among the order's members. In the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, he used the staff to sear his &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; prisoners, extracting information for the Crusade to utilize in its war against the undead. However, the more Halbin interacted with the Forsaken, the more he grew to loathe the cursed beings. In time, he no longer cared about gathering intelligence from them and simply wanted to hear their screams. One night, anger overwhelmed his thoughts and seal the inquisitor's doom.\nIt is unknown exactly when Light's Wrath slipped between the Scarlet Crusade's fingers. Eventually, the staff fell to the care of a troll priest named &lt;a href=\"Jakhar\"&gt;Jakhar&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt; sent to wage war against the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Crusade seemingly established their own Church to persuade the folk to join in.\nAt some point, rumors flew that a plaguebearer was hiding around a village. The Scarlet Crusade had seen to it that every last inhabitant was rounded up and burned alive. Among the villagers was the family of the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thorval\"&gt;Lord Thorval&lt;/a&gt;, who yearned to hunt down the Crusaders.\nDue to its origins as the regrouped survivors of the Silver Hand, the Scarlet Crusade counted members from citizens and races of all over the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and human citizens of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Their opinion of the exterior world turned sour, however, and they started seeing other races than humans as unclean. Human outsiders were still recruited but only after facing dangerous trials. It was additionally suspected that the organization had ties to wealthy intolerant families that supported them.\nThe Scarlet Crusade continued to cling to their scattered holdings, obsessed with eradicating the undead and retaking their once-beautiful homeland. The Crusaders became intolerant of all non-human races, regardless of alliance or affiliation. They started believing that any and all outsiders were potential carriers of the undead plague - and must be destroyed. The &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; was converted into a Scarlet Crusade stronghold by &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, who commanded a large garrison of fanatically devoted warriors, and High Inquisitor &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;, the true master of the fortress. However, after Commander Mograine's mysterious death, he was eventually replaced by &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Goodchilde\"&gt;High Commander Goodchilde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after the formation of the Scarlet Crusade, the Scarlet Monastery was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; three times in the &lt;a href=\"Summertide%20Assault\"&gt;Summertide Assault&lt;/a&gt;s. The Crusade also attempted a strike against the Scourge base in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and built a &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Fleet\"&gt;fleet&lt;/a&gt; specifically for that purpose. The attempt failed, although the Crusaders reached as far as the mouth of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. There were many casualties among the high ranks of the Crusade, including its first and only &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, first &lt;a href=\"Orman%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Captain General&lt;/a&gt; and first &lt;a href=\"Invar%20One-Arm\"&gt;Chief Assassin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scarlet Crusade also created many new anti-undead weapons, such as an attempt at a second &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a staff they called &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;:Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; intervened, interrupting their efforts and triggering a violent magical explosion. The damaged staff's power proved nearly uncontrollable. After several wielders tried and failed to use the staff safely, the elite magi of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; hid it away lest it unleash further deadly calamities. The human mage &lt;a href=\"Timolain%20the%20Accursed\"&gt;Timolain&lt;/a&gt; was also commissioned to create powerful new bows and guns.\nThe Scarlet Crusade has been raiding the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s holdings, and the Forsaken of &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; have fended off their incursions, retaliated in kind, and tested their poisons on &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Scarlet%20Zealot\"&gt;Captured Scarlet Zealot&lt;/a&gt;s. The Forsaken in turn has enlisted &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to aid &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; in conducting strategic strikes against the Scarlet Crusade in &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; in order to soften them up for the assault on &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos directed adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Demetria\"&gt;Demetria&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the chief advisor to Grand Crusader &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the aid of adventurers to redeem his son &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, who has risen through the ranks of the Scarlet Crusade and is now their &lt;a href=\"Highlord\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt;. Tirion has the adventurer collect numerous mementos and deliver them to Taelan in order to restore his faith in honor and nobility. Tirion's plan worked; Taelan was moved by the mementos and desires to reunite with his father so they can both become heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Taelan and the adventurer sneak out of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; to regroup with Tirion but they were caught by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt; who murdered Taelan for his desertion. Tirion Fordring slays Isillien in retribution while the adventurer dispatched Isillien's &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Elite\"&gt;Crimson Elite&lt;/a&gt;s. In the aftermath of the battle, Taelan's death had spurred Tirion to redeem the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; so that evil, regardless of its politics or pleasantries, is extinguished from the world.\nIn Stratholme, the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 led by the powerful &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, is locked in battle with a contingent of Scarlet Crusaders, led by Grand Crusader Dathrohan. Both forces held portions of the ravaged city and both sides were locked in constant, violent combat. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; has been sending adventurers into Stratholme to contend with both factions. Despite their tenuous alliance, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Nicholas%20Zverenhoff\"&gt;Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; condemned the Scarlet Crusade as &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemers&lt;/a&gt; and directed adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Galford\"&gt;Archivist Galford&lt;/a&gt; and burn down his archives in order to take away the Scarlet Crusade's most valued documents and punish them for their heretical zealotry. Adventurers eventually confronted Grand Crusader Dathrohan and during their battle with him, uncovered that he was really the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; in disguise. Adventurers sent the &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Balnazzar\"&gt;Head of Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; to Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff as proof of Balnazzar's evil masquerade. Zverenhoff was shocked that the Crusade was manipulated by such an evil force and pondered what the ramifications of Balnazzar's corruption will have on the Scarlet Crusade should the truth come out.\nAt some point, the Scarlet Crusade seems to have launched a first assault on &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Admiral Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Invar%20One-Arm\"&gt;Invar One-Arm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orman%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Orman of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; were all lost there.\nSome Scarlet Crusaders allied with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in order to attack &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, though the temporary truce was not sanctioned by the Grand Crusader.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nBy that point, the Scarlet Crusade's misguided zeal was so strong that it had even tainted the blessing spoken over their &lt;a href=\"holy%20water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; sought to exploit that taint to prepare a &lt;a href=\"Extinguishing%20Mixture\"&gt;mixture&lt;/a&gt; that was to extinguish the &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel%20Eternal%20Flame\"&gt;eternal flame&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThere was, however, one region of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; which had been remarkably untouched by the plague that had despoiled the remainder of northern Lordaeron. This region was appropriately known as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of the Scarlet capital of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Lord%20Valdelmar\"&gt;Lord Valdelmar&lt;/a&gt;, and the towns of &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt;. These towns came under the protection of the Crusade forces after successful negotiations between Silver Hand knights and local administration. Crusaders stationed in Tyr's Hand, led by High General - one of the Crusade's original founders.\nAll that changed with the arrival of in the skies above the Enclave. In short order, the Scourge had established a &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Breach\"&gt;base camp&lt;/a&gt; in the Ebon Hold's shadow and began their campaign of destruction. As the death knights of Acherus began to march on Havenshire, Abbendis claimed to receive visions from the Light, instructing her to take the most faithful of her troops and journey to Northrend. This became known among the Scarlet troops as the \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Dawn\"&gt;Crimson Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\", a revival of the Crusade and its \"holy mission\".\nThe Fall of the Scarlet Enclave.\nBy that point, the death knights had laid waste to &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt; and were now seeking to find out more about this \"Crimson Dawn\" mentioned in &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt;'s registry, taken from the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; after they murdered New Avalon's &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Quimby\"&gt;Mayor Quimby&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that a &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Courier\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt; had been sent from &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; by High Commander &lt;a href=\"Galvar%20Pureblood\"&gt;Galvar Pureblood&lt;/a&gt;, informing Abbendis that an army of Crusaders from Hearthglen and Tirisfal were being assembled to reinforce the Enclave and battle the forces of Acherus. One of the death knights, disguised as the courier (having murdered the real courier, taking his clothing and Pureblood's message), delivered the message to Abbendis. Realizing that the Plaguelands were lost, Abbendis ordered \"the courier\" to return to Pureblood, inform him to turn his armies around and prepare for the journey to Northrend. She gave \"the courier\" a copy of her diary, claiming it would explain everything. It was at this point that she declared that the Scarlet Crusade was no more - that they were now the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe message never reached Pureblood, and his forces were annihilated by the Scourge as a result. With the combined army marching to their doom, High General Abbendis boarded her flagship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Sinner%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Sinner's Folly&lt;/a&gt;\", and set sail for Northrend, leaving the Crusade to its fate.\nCataclysm.\nWith the exposure of &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, the senior leadership eliminated, the Lich King's defeat, and &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; retaking his old town of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarlet Crusade has become a shadow of its former self. Due to the decline of the Scarlets in the Plaguelands, the Argent Crusade has become the strength in the region, effectively succeeding the Scarlets as the new hierarchy of the former Kingdom of Lordaeron. Only a few loyal members have survived and remained in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Smith\"&gt;Scarlet Smith&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Executioner\"&gt;Scarlet Executioner&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Judge\"&gt;Scarlet Judge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Interrogator\"&gt;Scarlet Interrogator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20High%20Clerist\"&gt;Scarlet High Clerist&lt;/a&gt;, clinging to the hope that Abbendis would return and tortured by hunger.\nIt has been discovered that the Crusade has completely lost &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, with Balnazzar shedding his disguise and killing the remaining Scarlet Crusaders within the city. Balnazzar then used his necromantic powers to resurrect them as the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;. Unknown how, but a similar fate has befallen the Scarlet presence in Tyr's Hand, including the members formerly found at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. Hence, in an ironic twist of fate, the eastern Scarlet holdouts in Lordaeron have literally become what they sought to destroy.\nWhat is known is that the Scarlet Crusade have expanded their fortifications to the west of the &lt;a href=\"Solliden%20Farmstead\"&gt;Solliden Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;, in a new, small area called the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Palisade\"&gt;Scarlet Palisade&lt;/a&gt;, and that they managed to keep the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in their control. Thus, the Tirisfal Glades appear to be the last remaining bastion of living Scarlet Crusade activity, and dissident crusader &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Joseph the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; intends to bring other crusaders back to their senses. However, he seems to fall into the grips of insanity either with the knowledge that he was forced to kill his former comrades or through some unknown means. So even if Joseph completes his goal the Scarlet Crusade may still be lost in the sway of insanity.\nMists of Pandaria.\nRecent events indicate that the Scarlet Crusade is still active in their last bastion in Tirisfal Glades, the Scarlet Monastery and are slowly rebuilding the order. New members have been appointed to lead the Scarlet forces inside, as well as one surviving member of the former leadership, &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;, the High Inquisitor of the Scarlet Crusade. Along with &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Durand\"&gt;Commander Durand&lt;/a&gt;, who replaced Renault Mograine as Scarlet Commander - they are responsible for the operations inside and possibly outside the Monastery. Due to the corruption wrought by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend's branch of the Crusade, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarlets became ashamed of their past and have tasked their new archivist and lead mage, &lt;a href=\"Flameweaver%20Koegler\"&gt;Flameweaver Koegler&lt;/a&gt; to burn the pages of history.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Hall of Champions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armsmaster%20Harlan\"&gt;Armsmaster Harlan&lt;/a&gt; has dedicated his life to the art of wielding the weapons and indelicate instruments of the Scarlet Crusade, and he is pleased to provide a demonstration for the Crusade's &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt; enemies.\nAccording to [[Lilian Voss]], the only way to bring the Crusade to an end is to eliminate Whitemane, and this deed can only be accomplished by thrusting the [[Blades of the Anointed]] into her body, otherwise she will keep coming back.\nSoon after Lilian and the heroes of the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]] entered the Monastery and killed many of the remaining forces along with Sally. Following this, some members of the order went into hiding, while others started to regroup and reoccupy the Monastery.\nLegion.\n[[File:Crusader Michael Goodchilde TCG.jpg|thumb|[[High Commander Goodchilde]], leader of the remnants crusaders before the fall of the order.]]\nAt the time of the [[third invasion of the Burning Legion]], the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]] assaulted the [[Scarlet Monastery]], now led by [[High Commander Goodchilde]], in their quest to resurrect [[Sally Whitemane]] as a member of their new [[Four Horsemen]]. [[Thassarian]] declared they would not leave until every last crusader had been killed and every banner burned.\nThe [[Scarlet Onslaught]] in [[New Hearthglen]] appeared to be still alive and well after the death of their leaders, executing [[heretic]]s and betrayers. A few former crusaders along with their apostate champion [[Mariella the Heretic]] later joined the ranks of the [[Conclave]]. Several [[Crimson Pilgrim]]s also appeared in [[Dalaran]].\nA lone [[Scarlet Quartermaster]] settled at [[Darkmoon Island]] in order to sell Crusade-related paraphernalia in an attempt to raise funds for the order.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nA set of Scarlet Brotherhood propaganda pamphlets can be found near the [[Calston Estate]] in Tirisfal. In the pamphlets, the Brotherhood proclaims that [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin Wrynn]] of [[Stormwind (kingdom)|Stormwind]] is an [[undead]]-loving traitor who worked with his \"lover\" [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] to stage a fake massacre at the [[Gathering]] in the [[Arathi Highlands]]. According to the Brotherhood, this was done in order to drum up sympathy for the [[Forsaken]] and to lure out [[Calia Menethil|Princess Calia]] so that she could be murdered and raised into undeath, allowing Anduin to marry her and usurp Lordaeron. The pamphlets advise members of the order to rally behind the [[worgen]] king [[Genn Greymane]] and help him wipe out the Forsaken, after which they will turn on Greymane and destroy the worgen as well in order to ensure that Lordaeron belongs only to \"pure-blooded humans\". Finally, the pamphlets state that the Brotherhood has secretly raised someone that they claim to be the son of Princess Calia and an [[Arathi tribe|Arathi]] nobleman and therefore the rightful king of Lordaeron, whom they will reveal and place on the throne after the undead and worgen have been wiped from the land, thereby restoring the [[House Menethil|Menethil]] dynasty.\nMost of these pamphlets, if not all, are not true. Of note, Calia's child is actually a daughter, not a son, and her husband was a Lordaeron footman, not an Arathi nobleman. Whoever the Scarlet Brotherhood has, if they have anyone, is likely not actually the Menethil heir as they claim.\nFollowing the [[Fourth War]], [[Mathias Shaw]] mentioned in his reports that the Scarlet Crusade in the [[Eastern Plaguelands]] has retreated, its influence having waned over the last few years, but above all that he was informed, at least from what they know, that the Crusade was totally wiped out by the Ebon Blade when they went to the Monastery to destroy them and resurrect Sally Whitemane to integrate her into the Four Horsemen. He also mentions the existence of a group which calls itself the \"Scarlet Brotherhood\", and whose only attacks consist of anonymous pamphlets uttering absurdities.\nShadowlands.\nIn the [[Shadowlands]], [[Houndmaster Loksey]] and [[Fanatic Crusader]]s could be found atoning for their sins in [[Revendreth]].\nBy the time the [[Forsaken]] started rebuilding [[Brill]], [[Scarlet Warrior]]s patrolled the road to [[Cold Hearth Manor]] and around [[Stillwater Pond]].\nYears later, following the [[war against the Jailer]], the [[Bronzebeard]] brothers reported that even with their leadership wiped out by the adventurers, there were still enough members of the Scarlet Onslaught in [[New Hearthglen]] to continue their twisted crusade against anyone they think an enemy. They also mentioned a surprising number of crusaders in the [[Onslaught Harbor]].\nDragonflight.\nFollowing the reclamation of the [[Ruins of Lordaeron]] by the [[Forsaken]], the Scarlet Crusade mounted an assault on the undead yet again, claiming [[Fenris Isle]] and the [[Dawning Isles]] in [[Silverpine Forest]] under the command of [[Scarlet Commander Forsythe]]. On the isles, they were training, and their archmages were holding portals for more of their footsoldiers to join them from somewhere. They also took [[Valgan's Field]] and had a small presence at the [[Decrepit Fields]]. The crusade was infiltrated by a hero of the Forsaken, and Forsythe was eventually slain by the hero and Lilian Voss, driving the Crusade out of Fenris Isle.\nTerritories.\n[[File:Scarlet Heroes.jpg|thumb|Monuments to the Scarlet heroes.]]\nOnce, the Scarlet Crusade controlled much of the [[Plaguelands]] in northern [[Lordaeron]]. All of their major holdings have been destroyed or taken over by other forces.\nIn the [[Eastern Plaguelands]] they had the city of [[Tyr's Hand]], and the [[Scarlet Bastion]] within the ruins of [[Stratholme]] under their control. Both fell to the undead when its inhabitants were transformed, at least in Stratholme, into the [[Risen]]. Some time prior to the [[war against the Lich King]] they lost the [[Scarlet Enclave]], east of Tyr's Hand, to the [[Scourge]]. Its survivors would organize into the [[Scarlet Onslaught]] and sail to [[Northrend]] where they would begin anew.\nIn the [[Western Plaguelands]] they once settled the town stronghold of [[Hearthglen]], but they would ultimately lose it to the [[Argent Crusade]] who transformed it into their new headquarters. They held outposts throughout Western Plaguelands as well, though, these have all been purged; such as the [[Charred Outpost]].\nIn [[Northrend]], the Onslaught primarily operates out of [[New Hearthglen]], located in the [[Dragonblight]], on Northrend's southern coast. There are two other bases in the Dragonblight: the [[Onslaught Base Camp]] located north of the [[Carrion Fields]] beneath [[Naxxramas]], and the [[Scarlet Point]] east of the [[Crystal Vice]]. There is also a more secluded base, the [[Onslaught Harbor]], set on a broken island off the mountainous, western coast of [[Icecrown]].\nThe last bastions of the Crusade were located in the [[Tirisfal Glades]]. The [[Scarlet Monastery]], a peaceful monastery that was converted into a stronghold of the fanatical Crusade, and the [[Scarlet Palisade]], an outpost which protects the [[Solliden Farmstead]], as well as several towers scattered through the zone. One of these towers, the [[Scarlet Watchtower]], was dispatched by the Forsaken, killing its leader, [[Captain Perrine]]. The Forsaken ultimately dispatched the Crusaders at the [[Scarlet Palisade]] as well after rescuing [[Lilian Voss]], removing it as a threat. The [[Scarlet Watch Post]] was then slaughtered when their leader, [[High Priest Benedictus Voss]] was killed by his daughter, Lilian, in vengeance. The monastery was noted as being attacked several times, though it was ultimately finished off by the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]] when they sought to raise [[Sally Whitemane]] as one of the [[Four Horsemen]].\nThe status and safe locations of the Scarlet Brotherhood are largely unknown. They reference having the last Menethil heir in a secure safe location, which is specified to be secret. While it is possible this location, and heir, is fabricated (namely as Calia was noted as having a daughter, not a son as the Scarlet Brotherhood claims); it is unknown. The only hint of their presence is that the Brotherhood's pamphlets are entirely centralized in Tirisfal Glades, namely near the Calston Estate. The last remaining Scarlet tower in Tirisfal to not have been destroyed is the [[Crusader Outpost]]. Led by [[Captain Vachon]], the area is assailed by adventurers sent by [[High Executor Derrington]] . Rather than kill the captain, however, the area is merely assailed to set the Crusade back and the Captain is never actually killed; despite being present through both this attack and a previous attack from Lilian Voss. Whether he or any of his remaining crusaders became part of the Brotherhood or were slain another time is unknown.\nRelations.\nThough the Crusade's ranks are all human, it is not openly welcomed by the [[Alliance]]. However, its mission appeals to most within the Alliance, who generally agree that the [[undead]] need to be removed from [[Lordaeron]] so its citizens can return home. As news of the Crusaders' rising madness compete with tales of their good deeds and names of heroes amongst their ranks, especially the less informed peasants of regions far away from former Lordaeron still view this organization as a stalwart defender against the undead threat. In part, this is true, as the Crusade has indeed rescued refugees and defended civilian settlements in the Plaguelands many times, including a project to re-settle villages that have been destroyed by the Scourge during the war. Scarlet Crusaders protected the [[Solliden Farmstead]] and its inhabitants, making it one of the few places in northern Lordaeron where the native farmfolk were able to survive to this day and also one of the few places in Lordaeron where they can get food that is unaffected by the [[plague of undeath]]. Until the Forsaken sent their newly risen champions from [[Deathknell]] to deal with the situation.\nGenerally, the actions of the Scarlet Crusade are tolerated out of ignorance, and both the [[Alliance]] and the [[Church of Holy Light]] distance themselves from the Crusade's activities officially, but without trying to interfere. The Scarlet Crusade, maintained recruitment officers within the Alliance prior to its destruction - examples can be found in the [[Cathedral of Light]] in Stormwind and in the Alliance outpost of [[Nijel's Point]].\nThe Scarlet Crusade has killed countless refugees fleeing the horrors of the Scourge, regarding them as possible carriers of the plague or even undead sympathizers, and their growing zealotry made the Crusade enemies all over [[Azeroth]]. Travelers were advised to stay clear of Scarlet Crusaders regardless of whether any undead are in the party.\nDespite their \"alliance\" against [[Kel'Thuzad]] in the flying citadel of [[Naxxramas]], the Scarlet Crusade and the [[Argent Dawn]] were strongly opposed to each other. At [[Light's Hope Chapel]], [[Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff]] denounced the blind zealotry of the Crusade, and how they have destroyed many innocents in the name of the Light, even calling them [[Blasphemy|blasphemers]] for their crimes. During their meeting, [[Eligor Dawnbringer]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Light]] managed to keep relations between the organizations from turning violent, but he threatened them to leave them to the justice of [[Tirion Fordring]] and the [[Knights of the Silver Hand]] if the representatives of the Crusade were no longer present on amicable terms. Another example of their hostility, after raiding a Scarlet Crusade prison house, the [[Adventurer|Death knight of Acherus]] discovered that there were a number of Argent Dawn prisoners there, with apparently most of them already dead.\nSubgroups.\nScarlet Onslaught.\nThe rallied forces of [[Brigitte Abbendis]] that sailed to [[Northrend]] to combat the [[Lich King]]. Establishing numerous footholds, such as [[New Hearthglen]] and [[Onslaught Harbor]]; they sought to find justice for Lordaeron and their own crusaders who had been slaughtered fighting the Scourge. Despite this, they remained overtly hostile to any and all outside forces; leading to the [[Argent Crusade]] under [[Eligor Dawnbringer]] to dispatch Abbendis and many of her subordinates. Rallied by [[Barean Westwind]], the legendary Scarlet admiral who was found by Abbendis wandering Northrend (claimed to have survived by a miracle of the light); the remaining Onslaught members moved to Onslaught Harbor to assail the Lich King directly. Here, they were once again harried by heroes at the behest of the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]; where it was revealed that Barean had indeed died years ago in Northrend. \nSimilar to the Crusade's own Saiden Dathrohan, Barean's corpse was possessed by the defeated Dreadlord, [[Mal'Ganis]], who had harbored a desire for vengeance after his near death in battle against [[Arthas Menethil]]. Disappearing and leaving the Onslaught leaderless, it miraculously survived in New Hearthglen past the war. It was revisited again by priests of the [[Conclave]], seeking allies in their war against the [[Burning Legion]]. There, [[Mariella Ward]] and her fellow Scarlet Apostates were recruited after defeating the new Scarlet leader, [[Inquisitor Ward]]; though the Onslaught remains firmly rooted in New Hearthglen.\nIt is the only branch of the Crusade that is still active with a militant force; though they are extremely far from their homeland and their objectives, if they have any, are completely unknown.\nCrimson Legion.\nAn elite force of the Crusade is the Crimson Legion, led by the Grand Crusader himself. The Crimson Legion appeared to have directly linked back to Dathrohan and guarded his sanctum within [[Stratholme]]. They held their own version of the Scarlet Crusade tabard, an alternating pattern of white and red with a white version of their Scarlet flame iconography upon the middle. This tabard was also worn by high-ranking members of the Crusade, such as [[Brigitte Abbendis]], though it is unknown if that means they were also part of the Crimson Legion. It, alongside most of the Crusade in the Eastern Plaguelands, was decimated by various forces. They were put to an end when [[Balnazzar]] revealed his treachery and shed his Dathrohan disguise; raising them all into the ranks of his [[Risen]].\nScarlet renegades.\nThe Scarlet renegades were former members of the Scarlet Crusade who have openly rebelled against the order. They sought to reform the order after having realized the evil corruption of the crusade. The Renegades sought redemption after the actions of the crusade and have thus allied themselves with the Alliance. They asked for their aid to seize control of the crusade and, while successful in doing so, their leadership appears to have fallen to madness.\nTheir status following \"Mists of Pandaria\" is unclear.\nRanks and classes.\n[[File:Brother Crowley.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Brother Crowley]].]]\nIn the RPG.\n[[File:WoW RPG Scarlet Crusader by chriss2d.jpg|thumb|upright|A member of the Scarlet Crusade in \"[[Dark Factions]]\".]]\nThe Scarlet Crusade is a group of maddened zealots so dedicated to the removal of all undead that they commonly attack the living. In the [[Western Plaguelands]], the Scarlet Crusade strikes against the Scourge from Hearthglen. Many [[Knights of the Silver Hand]] remained on Lordaeron for several reasons ranging from missing the fleeing boats, to a sense of duty to clear their homeland of the undead. With the destruction of Lordaeron in front of them and the knowledge that [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] had betrayed them, some knights actually went mad. They hunt the undead in Lordaeron with a zeal that frightens. Many innocent mortals have been killed through misunderstandings, or simply \"just making sure\". These [[paladin]]s have a frightening policy: When in doubt, assume the person is undead and kill him. These knights would never admit that they walk the same dark road that led to Arthas\u2019s damnation, but few of them continue to follow the [[three virtues]]. Those who question their leaders are assumed to be undead sympathizers and are slain. Many serve the Scarlet Crusade out of fear, as to speak up means instant death.\nThe Scarlet Crusade is what happens when mad zealots take over a good cause. While the [[Alliance]] is in agreement that the Scourge needs to be eradicated from Lordaeron so they can return home, few Alliance members would agree with the methods used by the Scarlet Crusade. The Crusade\u2019s members are mostly soldiers \u2014 many are Knights of the Silver Hand \u2014 who saw such devastation wrought by the Scourge that they resort to extreme measures to destroy the undead. This includes killing any mortal they assume to be undead, killing mortals to get to undead or killing mortals who may sympathize with undead. \u201cSympathizing with the undead\u201d is how Crusaders interpret someone arguing that their methods are severe. They are the natural enemies of the Scourge and the Forsaken, but they are also the enemy of anyone who cannot prove that he is alive \u2014 usually within ten or so seconds. The Crusade has indeed destroyed several undead encampments on Lordaeron. They may end up alone on the continent \u2014 or more likely, die trying. The Scarlet Crusade sees no difference between the Forsaken and the Scourge and battle the Forsaken zealously.\nDespite its excesses, the Crusade is a powerful force in the [[Eastern Kingdoms|eastern kingdoms]], having already destroyed several undead encampments in [[Lordaeron]] and defeated a number of dangerous [[Lich]]es as well as the [[Dreadlord]] [[Beltheris]]. They are expected to continue battling until either the Scourge are driven from Lordaeron or the Crusade itself is destroyed.\nThe Scarlet Crusade distrusts any non-humans although they once had other races, such as High Elves and Dwarves, in their ranks.\nHistory of the Crusade.\n[[Isillien]] was formerly a priest of the [[Light|Holy Light]] in Lordaeron, assigned to be the liaison for the Knights of the Silver Hand. There he worked closely with the elder [[High General Abbendis]] and his youthful charges, tutoring the young paladins in their quest for truth. [[Priest]]s and paladins fought as the Scourge attacked the city, but they fled as Lordaeron fell around them. Some whisper it was the wounds both men received in battle, or perhaps just the shock of seeing their whole purpose destroyed, but since that day both Isillien and Abbendis had become quite insane. Isillien and Abbendis wandered the area as the Scourge defiled the land, destroying what undead they could, gathering what warriors would join them. They had but one concern: eradication of all that had destroyed Lordaeron.\nIsillien and High General Abbendis gathered together several other people to join them. Among them were Abbendis's daughter [[Brigitte Abbendis|Brigitte]], [[Alexandros Mograine]] (wielding the newly-forged [[Ashbringer]]) and his son [[Renault Mograine|Renault]], [[Taelan Fordring]], and [[Saidan Dathrohan]]. This group was focused on the singular goal of defeating the Scourge in all its forms.\nIn the times after the [[ascension of the Lich King]] and [[Plaguelands civil war|the rise]] of the [[Forsaken]], the elder Abbendis and felt that although they had a good base, they really needed to attack the [[Scourge]] where they were the thickest: in the [[Eastern Plaguelands]]. Isillien took on the title of Grand Inquisitor, while the elder Abbendis led the majority of the forces to Tyr's Hand in the east to strike at [[Stratholme]]. As they established their bases and took in many more warriors, they destroyed any undead they found.\nTaelan Fordring, one of Isillien\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, adored his tutor and his general. He offered his family\u2019s keep and land, untouched by the undead, for their base of operations. The group gained members whose lives had been ruined by the Scourge. Most members have seen a loved one die and, more often than not, be raised to fight alongside her murderer. Isillien became the spokesman for the group, his ravings gaining more followers than repelling them \u2014 and who could argue with the man that the undead were evil?\nSome had reason to pause when Isillien\u2019s young page was found with Isillien\u2019s knife through his heart, and the priest calmly reported that the page had died that afternoon while hunting, and the undead had raised him and sent him back as an assassin. He was so convincing that the incident cemented the fear for most: if a freshly killed and raised undead can look just like a regular human, they had no idea who among them may or may not be with the Scourge. After a month of quarantine, all priests and [[warrior]]s with the Crusade were declared clean. Frequently, groups of refugees fleeing the undead also fell beneath their furious swords. As the Grand Inquisitor claims, one cannot be too careful. All undead \u2014 good, evil or neutral, Scourge or Forsaken \u2014 are the rivals of the Scarlet Crusade. The undead are abominations and must be destroyed before the land and the people can heal. They count the Alliance and the [[Church of Holy Light]] as their allies, but these organizations quickly distance themselves from these fanatics and instruct all travelers to give a wide berth to any Crusaders.\nOrganization.\nThe Scarlet Crusade is structured much like the military. The male Abbendis and Isillien were the leaders. Abbendis was the official head of the Scarlet Crusade. He considered himself the arm of the Crusade while Isillien is the heart. Abbendis guided the military attacks of the Crusade from Tyr\u2019s Hand in the Eastern Plaguelands, communicating frequently with Isillien, who guides the priests in the Crusade in their new roles as inquisitors, based in the Western Plaguelands. He is in charge of questioning undead and mortals alike to ferret out whatever information he can on the movement and settlement of the undead. Isillien acts as the leader of the priests and guides the inquisitions in the west along with his impressionable paladin Taelan, while Abbendis controlled the warriors in the east. The Crusade has thirteen generals leading the lower ranks: 2,000 troops based in Hearthglen and 10,000 based in Tyr\u2019s Hand. The generals were not only chosen by the ranks they had in the war, but also by their dedication to the cause. Few make it very high in the ranks if they do not have a burning fervor to destroy all undead. Veterans who have fought the Scourge before are quickly promoted. Any dissent in the ranks is considered to be caused by undead infiltration, for the Crusade cannot fathom a reasonable mortal having any disagreement with the elimination of the undead. Such individuals are considered to be undead themselves, or worse, deranged undead sympathizers. Thus the organization of the Scarlet Crusade is flawless, as the crusaders work with one mind towards one goal. If they do not work with total agreement, it is at least complete fear of their superiors that keeps them in line. It's based in the Plaguelands, but hunts undead everywhere it can in northern Lordaeron. With the death of the elder Abbendis fighting the scourge, his daughter took over as High General.\nCurrently, the head of the Scarlet Crusade is [[Saidan Dathrohan|Grand Crusader Saidan Dathrohan]]. Serving beneath him are [[Demetria]] (the Scarlet Oracle), [[Brigitte Abbendis|High General Abbendis]], [[Grand Inquisitor Isillien]], [[Taelan Fordring|Highlord Taelan Fordring]], and [[Crusader Lord Valdelmar]]. The grand crusader handles the grisly, prolonged siege of Stratholme. Abbendis commands military assaults and assists the grand crusader in the siege, while Isillien handles interrogations and intelligence in the west.\nMembership.\nMembership in the Scarlet Crusade is high, relative to the human population of the region. The strong sense of abandonment, futility and fear runs high in all humans on Lordaeron, and the Scarlet Crusade feeds that fear with reassurance that the evil will fall while the good remain untainted. The Crusade attracts mostly warriors, people who find in this post-war state that living by the sword is the only way to survive. They feel the need for a strong community where their skills will be utilized, and the Scarlet Crusade maintains that they need strong warriors for their cause. Some priests are drawn to the righteous eradication of the undead, but they often see the Crusade for the zealots they are and rethink their entry. This, of course, is considered suspicious, and they are often slain for their misgivings. The biggest problem prospective members encounter is assuring the Crusaders that they are not undead themselves. Since the Grand Inquisitor was almost killed by his own page (so the story goes), the group is incredibly paranoid about the undead infiltrating their ranks. There is however one [[undead]] in their ranks ([[High Inquisitor Fairbanks]]) however he has been locked away in an secret room, why the crusaders haven't killed him yet remains a mystery. The supposedly common knowledge that undead are hideously deformed and easy to discern from the living makes no difference to these people; they believe necromancers are capable of disguising the undead as living. Thus, new members (if they survived alerting the Crusade to their desire to join) are quarantined for 30 days to see if they begin to exhibit signs of the plague or being an undead. They are visited by the Grand Inquisitor or the High General during this time and are \"questioned\". No Scarlet Crusader discusses his quarantine and initiation.\nMembership is comprised chiefly of human [[warrior]]s, [[ex-paladin]]s, [[priest]]s and [[paladin]]s (dark or otherwise), [[scarlet knight]]s, [[scarlet inquisitor]]s, [[Scarlet Chaplain]]s, [[Scarlet Crusader]]s, and [[scarlet battle mage]]s professions.\nMilitary.\n[[File:Scarlet crusader.jpg|thumb|[[Scarlet Crusader]].]]\n[[File:Heretics of the Holy Light.png|thumb|Scarlet Crusade and Argent Dawn members looking at each other in \"[[Dark Factions]]\".]]\nDespite their increasingly small numbers, the members of the Scarlet Crusade never falter, turn aside, or retreat. The Scarlet Crusade fights directly and it fights to the death.\nMost military forces fight conservatively and hoard their members, but the crusaders take no care for their own lives. They wade into battle with zealous fervor, slashing and hacking until they either fall or vanquish all enemies.\nOnly the backing of the priests and paladins keep the order alive, both literally and figuratively. The impassioned speeches and charismatic leadership of the order\u2019s healers motivates their troops into battle, and their healing magic keeps their zealots whole. The military training of the order\u2019s paladins serves the crusade well, as the paladins train the members in basic troop formations and simple tactics that increase their odds of survival.\nGenerally, members of the Scarlet Crusade don\u2019t bother flanking their enemies, as they\u2019re used to fighting undead that are slow and easy to strike and immune to backstabs. Scarlet Crusade units fight in tight formations. They form rings whenever possible, standing shoulder to shoulder, so no one member risks being surrounded by a shambling mob of undead. If forced to disperse, members try to pair up and fight back to back.\nPaladins and priests freely use their healing abilities and spells in combat, not only to bolster their own troops, but to harm undead enemies. Paladins and priests try not to use their turn undead ability, as their goal is to destroy their enemies, not scatter them. If overwhelmed by superior numbers, though, or confident in their ability to destroy nearby undead with a turn attempt, the commanders call upon their holy power. Many Scarlet Crusade priests can rebuke undead; they force their undead foes to cower long enough for the knights to do their work.\nWhen fighting living opponents, the Scarlet Crusade varies its tactics only slightly. The Crusade rarely takes on hordes of living enemies; when they do engage the living, it is usually to target individuals or small groups. Members of the Crusade do use flanking maneuvers when fighting the living. They\u2019re most concerned with preventing the escape of their prey, as living opponents move much faster than undead, and often panic. Mounted knights run down fleeing enemies, while the foot soldiers remain behind to engage slower targets. Foot soldiers also use trip attacks to reduce the odds that their prey will escape.\nLocations.\n[[File:LoCFinsidecover.jpg|thumb|A Scarlet Crusader on the cover of \"[[Lands of Conflict]]\".]]\nThe Western Crusade\u2019s headquarters are in the rural area of Hearthglen, the inheritance of Taelan Fordring. Their main headquarters are in the Eastern Plaguelands in the small community of Tyr\u2019s Hand. They command from the [[Scarlet Basilica]]. The community is also host to several churches including a newly built [[Scarlet Monastery]], a massive building that draws refugees looking for safety.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Scarlet Crusade| ]]\n[[Category:Human organizations]]\n[[Category:Religions]]\n[[es:Cruzada Escarlata]]\n[[fr:Croisade \u00c9carlate]]\n[[pl:Scarlet Crusade]]"}

However, Borough's Holy Wrath ability allows him to instantly wipe out large numbers (20 or so) of non player undead surrounding him. He is moderately difficult to solo at or below his level but with additional players and/or levels he gets much easier to defeat. The main point is to wipe out his adds as quickly as possible.\nWhen dealing with his knock back effect (Cleave) you can either get around it by bracing yourself against a wall or use it to your advantage by steering the knockbacks to remove you from the range of his adds. His adds have a short leash. Borugh however, does not.\nIt would be prudent to have as much healing as possible, such as improved rune tap and using attacks such as Unholy Strike, Icy Touch and Death Strike."}

Later, the Silver Hand splintered into the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, with the Crusade keeping the Monastery and renaming the place to Scarlet Monastery.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Inquisitor Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; relocated here. Not only did it become a home of the Crusade, but it also was a military area as well as a place for their prisoners. When the Crusade learned about a Scourge attack on &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, Renault commanded Whitemane to gather a squad of soldiers and head to Hearthglen. As Whitemane left, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, guided by the voice of the Ashbringer, arrived to the Monastery, where the voice manifested into the spirit of Alexandros who killed Renault for his betrayal in the Monastery's chapel.\nAfter the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, there was a meeting between &lt;a href=\"Castillian\"&gt;Castillian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; taking place north of the Scarlet Monastery.\nCompendium of Fallen Heroes.\nAt some point after the formation of the Scarlet Crusade, the Monastery was attacked by the Scourge three times in the &lt;a href=\"Summertide%20Assault\"&gt;Summertide Assault&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; were captured and brought to the monastery, being interrogated by &lt;a href=\"Halbin\"&gt;Halbin&lt;/a&gt;. During one night of torture, anger overwhelmed him, and for only a brief instant, his hold over &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;:Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt; slipped. An explosion rocked the torture chamber and engulfed Halbin in holy fire. It is said he died a slow death, his howls of agony ringing through the Scarlet Monastery for days on end.\nLegends.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; in Year 24, the &lt;a href=\"Headless%20Horseman\"&gt;Headless Horseman&lt;/a&gt; was created in the Monastery by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies over the dead body of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Raleigh%20the%20Devout\"&gt;Raleigh the Devout&lt;/a&gt; believed in the cause of the Scarlet Crusade to rid Azeroth of the undead. As he spent time at the Monastery, he realized that the Crusade's grasp on reality was slipping because they thought everyone was plagued who didn't wear the tabard of the Crusade. Innocent men and women were tortured because they were supposedly plagued.\n&lt;a href=\"Meven%20Korgal\"&gt;Meven Korgal&lt;/a&gt; was sent from the Monastery to spy on &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; helped the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20renegades\"&gt;Scarlet renegades&lt;/a&gt;, a small faction of rebel Crusaders who aimed to take over the monastery. They were led by their increasingly unhinged champion, &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20the%20Insane\"&gt;Joseph the Insane&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; assisted a contingent of Forsaken troops and abominations, led by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; in annexing the Monastery for good. Neither side was ultimately successful, and the Monastery remained firmly under the control of the Scarlet Crusade.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDespite heavy losses across all fronts, the Scarlet Crusade has survived within the Scarlet Monastery. Here, the remaining crusaders prepare to continue their battle against the undead and those they judge guilty of carrying the taint of undeath. However, a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Hooded%20Crusader\"&gt;Hooded Crusader&lt;/a&gt; seems intent on taking them down from the inside.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the Scarlet Crusade regrouped at the Monastery under the command of &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Goodchilde\"&gt;High Commander Goodchilde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt one point, the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; entered the Monastery in order to retrieve the saddle of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt;'s steed, killing &lt;a href=\"Faralis%20the%20Fanatic\"&gt;Faralis the Fanatic&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Later they were assaulted a second time by the Ebon Blade and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; who crushed the remains of the fanatical organization to raise &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; as one of their own.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the third invasion and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in his reports that the Scarlet Crusade was totally wiped out by the Ebon Blade when they went to the Monastery to destroy them and resurrect Sally Whitemane.\nIn the RPG.\nInstead of being situated in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarlet Monastery was said to actually be a newly-erected &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Basilica\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; in the center of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;."}

Hunters' traps can freeze or slow Mograine and Whitemane, so you can have more time for ranged attacks. Another approach is to send either 2 tanks or &lt;a href=\"combat%20pet\"&gt;combat pet&lt;/a&gt;s to take the bosses and have everyone else be ranged and healers. Area attacks and other multi-target spells are useful. After Mograine is killed, Whitemane will come through previously locked doors and resurrect him, and they will heal each other to 100% health. For some classes, the Cathedral is soloable, starting at around level 50. It is a particularly valuable training ground for Hunters, since they can learn much about double-mob pulling and trapping here. Warlocks can use the Succubus to control humans and prevent them from running."}

Formed from the most zealous and racist members of the original Crusade, the Onslaught appears to care little about the Crusade's wishes, as it employs shadowy &lt;a href=\"raven%20priest\"&gt;raven priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Darkweaver\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Death%20Knight\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; into its ranks.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Onslaught was largely dismantled, but ideologies aren't so easily killed. During the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, New Hearthglen continued to operate, even though it has lost the majority of its leadership and its goals have been dashed away.\nDespite having originally stated to be the replacement for the Crusade, by the time of , they are interchangeably referred to as the Crusade and as the Onslaught.\nHistory.\nAt the time of the Onslaught's foundation, the Scarlet Crusade had been under constant siege, with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attacking their forces at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. There was, however, one region of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; which had been remarkably untouched by the plague that had despoiled the remainder of northern Lordaeron. This region was appropriately known as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of the Scarlet capital of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the towns of &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt;. These towns came under the protection of the Crusade forces stationed in Tyr's Hand, led by High General &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; - the last survivor of the Crusade's original founders.\nAll that changed with the arrival of in the skies above the Enclave. In short order, the Scourge had established a &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Breach\"&gt;base camp&lt;/a&gt; in the Ebon Hold's shadow and began their campaign of destruction. As the death knights of Acherus began to march on Havenshire, Abbendis claimed to receive visions from the Light, instructing her to take the most faithful of her troops and journey to Northrend. This became known among the Scarlet troops as the \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Dawn\"&gt;Crimson Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\", a revival of the Crusade and its \"holy mission\".\nThe fall of the Scarlet Enclave.\nBy that point, the death knights had laid waste to Havenshire and were now seeking to find out more about this \"Crimson Dawn\" mentioned in New Avalon's registry, taken from the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; after they murdered New Avalon's &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Quimby\"&gt;Mayor Quimby&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that a &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Courier\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt; had been sent from Hearthglen by High Commander &lt;a href=\"Galvar%20Pureblood\"&gt;Galvar Pureblood&lt;/a&gt;, informing Abbendis that an army of Crusaders from Hearthglen and Tirisfal were being assembled to reinforce the Enclave and battle the forces of Acherus. One of the death knights, disguised as the courier (having murdered the real courier, taking his clothing and Pureblood's message), delivered the message to Abbendis. Realizing that the Plaguelands were lost, Abbendis ordered \"the courier\" to return to Pureblood, inform him to turn his armies around and prepare for the journey to Northrend. She gave \"the courier\" a copy of her diary, claiming it would explain everything. It was at this point that she declared that the Scarlet Crusade was no more - that they were now the Scarlet Onslaught.\nThe message never reached Pureblood, and his forces were annihilated by the Scourge as a result. With the combined army marching to their doom, High General Abbendis boarded her flagship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Sinner%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Sinner's Folly&lt;/a&gt;\", and set sail for Northrend, leaving the Crusade to its fate.\nLandfall in Northrend.\nSailing across the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; for many weeks and losing one of her ships to the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;, Abbendis and her chosen followers made landfall on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in southern Northrend. Their banner was planted on the heights above the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Shore%20%28Dragonblight%29\"&gt;Forgotten Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where they began construction of their capital, &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen\"&gt;New Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. This, Abbendis declared, was the \"Crimson Dawn\", the foundation of a new Crusade.\nWithin a month of the Onslaught's arrival in Northrend, Abbendis received an unexpected visitor: Admiral &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Fleet\"&gt;Scarlet Fleet&lt;/a&gt; commander who had been believed dead on these shores many years earlier. Westwind claimed to be the only survivor of his fleet and assured Abbendis that he was not there to usurp her, but rather serve as her adviser. The Admiral - secretly possessed by the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, thought to have been the first to fall to &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; nearly a decade before - guided the Onslaught's actions from thereon out. The men took with great zeal to Westwind, who founded the &lt;a href=\"raven%20priest\"&gt;raven priest&lt;/a&gt; sect by passing on a \"blessing\" to &lt;a href=\"High%20Abbot%20Landgren\"&gt;High Abbot Landgren&lt;/a&gt; and ordered the construction of &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Harbor\"&gt;Onslaught Harbor&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Yet despite Westwind's assurances and the troops' belief that he would bring them victory, Abbendis suspected that the Admiral was not as he seemed.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were sent by the Horde, the Alliance and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Onslaught and its leadership in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinuing activities.\nThough their leadership was destroyed, the rank and file of the Scarlet Onslaught survived and continued their crusade against all who opposed them. When members spoke out against their atrocities, they were jailed and executed. Many of these so-called &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;s were rescued from New Hearthglen by the High Priest of &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, who sought their aid against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears later, following the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; brothers reported that even with their leadership wiped out by the adventurers, there are still enough members of the Onslaught in &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen\"&gt;New Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; to continue their twisted crusade against anyone they think an enemy. They also mentioned a surprising number of crusaders in the &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Harbor\"&gt;Onslaught Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the brothers Bronzebeard entered &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20Cavern\"&gt;Frostmourne Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, they reported that the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Point\"&gt;Scarlet Point&lt;/a&gt; at its entrance is a shattered, half-finished fortification, but didn't mention the presence of the crusaders. It is unknown if they managed to sneak past them or if the outpost was abandoned.\nBases.\nThe Onslaught primarily operates out of &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen\"&gt;New Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, on Northrend's southern coast. There are two other bases in Dragonblight: The &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Onslaught Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; located north of the &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Fields\"&gt;Carrion Fields&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Point\"&gt;Scarlet Point&lt;/a&gt; east of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Vice\"&gt;Crystal Vice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is also a more secluded base, &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Harbor\"&gt;Onslaught Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, set on a broken island off the mountainous, western coast of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;."}

When items with a duration are &lt;a href=\"Stack\"&gt;stackable&lt;/a&gt;, units added to an existing stack will obtain the duration of that stack. Thus the timespan of items can be extended so long as items of a newer duration can be obtained.\nA duration may also be expressed as \"requires (event name)\". Items of this nature will disappear when the event concludes. As all instances of that item are removed at the same time, their duration cannot be extended by acquiring new items of that type.\nItems with durations may not be mailed nor placed on the auction houses.\nVarious items received during holiday &lt;a href=\"event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; have durations.\nExamples of items with durations:\nNote.\nLimiting items with a lifespan of realtime, or sometimes played-time, is well established. Limiting items by \"requires (event)\" is relatively recent (2009 events and later). It has fairly often been the case that items for new events have been given a \"Duration\" without the item tooltip being appropriately updated before the event is released. These items are often updated during later &lt;a href=\"Hotfix\"&gt;Hotfix&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"Patch\"&gt;Patch&lt;/a&gt;es."}
