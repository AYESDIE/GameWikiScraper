Along with his brethren, he rejected the gift of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and turned to the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s instead, becoming an incarnation of fire. While every ounce as powerful as &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;, he lacks the discipline to focus that strength into singular goals and would be just as happy burning his own followers down as he would his enemies. While Iridikron always had his schemes, Fyrakk has only sought out power. \nAfter being freed from the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, Iridikron would direct Fyrakk to wage war against the &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; with his sister &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt;. However, Fyrakk would eventually lose sight of the Incarnates' original goals after consuming the &lt;a href=\"Shadowflame\"&gt;Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt;, wishing to instead to use &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt; to burn all of Azeroth to cinders and reforge it in his own image. His sister was disgusted by his cruelty and mania, driving her away to join the Aspects. Fyrakk, having recruited &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Primalist\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; cause and wielding a shadowflame-forged axe known as &lt;a href=\"Fyr%27alath%20the%20Dreamrender\"&gt;Fyr'alath the Dreamrender&lt;/a&gt;, assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; with his new army, intent on taking Amirdrassil before it could bloom. With the Aspects' forces reinforced by the united armies of the mortals of Azeroth, the Guardians of the Dream eventually repelled Fyrakk's assault and destroyed him atop the new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. \nFyrakk appears as one of two antagonists in the &lt;a href=\"Embers%20of%20Neltharion%20campaign\"&gt;Embers of Neltharion campaign&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;. He later serves as the main antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20the%20Dream%20campaign\"&gt;Guardians of the Dream campaign&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Patch%2010.2.0\"&gt;Patch 10.2.0&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk%20the%20Blazing\"&gt;final boss&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil%2C%20the%20Dream%27s%20Hope\"&gt;Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope&lt;/a&gt; raid. \nHistory.\nAncient past.\nWhile the proto-dragons who would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; accepted the gift of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, the proto-dragons who would become the Primal Incarnates rejected it. Tensions rose between the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; who wished to cleanse the world of the titans' \"stain\" and the dragonflights, breaking out into open rebellion about 20,000 years ago when &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; struck first by leading an assault on &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; army on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. In the battle, she destroyed &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, the titan relic which Neltharion was using to control the dracthyr. This caused Neltharion to give in to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time and use their power to seal her away within the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nA cataclysmic conflict ensued between Primalists and dragonflights known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Scaleborn\"&gt;War of the Scaleborn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; and Fyrakk were ever loyal to the Incarnate's ideals, but &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; truly embraced the war. At the end, he struck terrible bargains to keep their cause alive. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes the other incarnates never knew the true depths of his depravity. Despite the Primalists' alliance with the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; to end the dragons' reign, the remaining Primal Incarnates were ultimately defeated, but Alexstrasza, having failed to restore peace between the two groups, still couldn't bear to kill them given they had once been as close as clutch-mates, and decided to imprison them instead, within the titanic &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\n20,000 years later, &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth the Storm-Eater&lt;/a&gt; schemed to release her kin from the Vault. Though Raszageth died, she succeeded in her endeavor, and &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;, Fyrakk and &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; were released. Seeing how Raszageth's haste led to her downfall, Alexstrasza speculated that the Incarnates would take their time to gather their strengths first, and that Iridikron's mastery of the earth would harbor them in the meantime.\nFyrakk was eager to take revenge for their sister, but Iridikron did not want to rush in and believed they needed to even the scales with the Aspects first. The Incarnates adventured to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; as the last echoes of Raszageth's storm faded, where they breached an ancient vault belonging to &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and found a device that would give them the location of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, the Earth-Warder's secret underground. They had no interest in the laboratory of &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt; itself, but in the molten fire that could be found below. &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; followed behind them secretly to claim Neltharion's legacy.\nThey found one of the hidden entry points to Zaralek right below &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, where they broke through the ground and sent Fyrakk down, blazing through the earth, to claim the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; power below and wake the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;'s Elders at the &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Caldera\"&gt;Zaqali Caldera&lt;/a&gt;. There, Fyrakk bathed in a giant pool of both elemental lava and &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Ebyssian and Sabellian's efforts to stop Fyrakk, the Incarnate fully infused himself with its power and used it to free the djaradin Elders. He then unleashed &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk%20Assaults\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; all across the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and ravaged the &lt;a href=\"niffen\"&gt;niffen&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Loamm\"&gt;Loamm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; departed and left the war against the Aspects to Fyrakk and Vyranoth. At some point, Fyrakk struck a bargain with the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, where they agreed to open the way to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; on the condition that Fyrakk ensured that they would become immortal. During this time, Fyrakk became increasingly more and more unhinged; setting his sights on the nascent world tree, &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt; and even clashed with Vyranoth when he tried to burn the captured &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt;, as she was more focused on removing the titans' iron grip on this world over causing harm to their enemies. Some time later, the two reunited at &lt;a href=\"Lunedane\"&gt;Lunedane&lt;/a&gt;, where he revealed his bargain with the druids to her, earning her displeasure. He was unmoved by her fears that the Primalists were losing sight of their goals and declared that there was something that he wanted her to see. Under his sister's shocked eyes, he used the &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt; in combination with the fire magics of the Druids of the Flame to corrupt &lt;a href=\"Larodar\"&gt;Keeper Larodar&lt;/a&gt;. He further revealed his intention to do the same to Amirdrassil itself, a notion that disgusted Vyranoth as she wanted to deny the Aspects their prize and not twist it into some vile abomination. Fyrakk was unmoved and declared that they couldn't win the war bound by her ideals. In response, Vyranoth declared that the course was set and the pair departed from Lunedane.\nUnbeknownst to Fyrakk, Vyranoth seeing that his own heart had become cruel, blazing with insatiable malice, and wreathed in shadow made the decision to warn &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; of his intentions and even agreed to stand against him. In time, Fyrakk learns that his sister had turned against him but remained unconcerned, instead becoming more focused on initiating his campaign to claim Amirdrassil and rebirth the world in flames. With the Druids of the Flame and the djaradin's aid, Fyrakk was given a powerful new weapon to aid him in his conquest, the axe Fyr'alath, the Dream Render which allows him and his forces to invade the Emerald Dream itself. Gathering his forces, including the Fire Lord &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt;, Fyrakk besieged the World Tree but would face delays due to the Temple leading to the tree's core bared his path. Fyrakk managed to launch a surprise attack against Alexstrasza after she brought down the wards that prevented those in Azeroth to enter the Dream, mocking her for her failure. The Life-Binder retorted to Fyrakk that he once fought for an ideal but now only desired power and to kill, to which The Blazing happily admitted to but before he could kill Alexstrasza, he would be confronted by the leaders of the world, having come to defend the World Tree. Infuriated yet forced to retreat as his forces were routed, Fyrakk grew more desperate as he breached into the Temple himself, casting aside what was left of his druids, yet would be forced to face the World Tree's defenders right at the heart of Amirdrassil. Despite his mastery over fire and Shadowflame, Fyrakk was felled before he could corrupt Amirdrassil's core, allowing it to complete it's blooming and in doing so, Azeroth herself re-empowered the Aspects and even Vyranoth, marking a new beginning for dragonkind.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and is the tallest tree, atop the tallest peak, with its fruit containing the seeds of all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azerothian&lt;/a&gt; trees. It serves as an afterlife for all winged creatures of Azeroth including even &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, all of which could be seen flying amongst its many branches.\nG'Hanir died with its mistress Aviana when she was killed by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and the tree lost all its leaves. However, Aviana set out to restore it in \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" after her resurrection, and as of \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" it seems to be restored, as Aviana sought to invite the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; and offer them a place on the Mother Tree.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nG'Hanir was created at the dawn of the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as the first thing &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; shaped within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. It was a source of healing and balance, a place where all life could rest and survive. From it bloomed many fruits and flowers, and new life flowed outwards in waves, sweeping across the land. Freya sculpted many pools of life in other locations within the Dream, but G'Hanir was the first, the tallest, and the most radiant. For millennia, it served as a source of healing and balance that extended beyond the Dream and into the physical world.\nAs life flourished on Azeroth, generations of animals came and went. Soon the Emerald Dream was filled with the spirits of countless beasts, and G'Hanir became a haven for winged creatures. Its many boughs and branches had room for all, and its healing, peaceful energy calmed even the most distressed minds. Many powerful spirits were drawn to G'Hanir. Some wanted to simple gaze upon it; others wanted to sit at its base and bask in its shade for a while. One powerful spirit that was drawn to G'Hanir never left: the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;.\nAviana grew enchanted with G'Hanir, as it was more than a tree; it was a source of life, healing, and peace. Aviana spent years melding her power into the tree, and soon all winged creatures of Azeroth dreamed of spending the afterlife flying through its branches. Aviana's spirit became tied with G'Hanir, and in time this would have lasting consequences.\nWar of the Ancients.\nG'Hanir died during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; when Aviana was killed by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The shock of Aviana's death reverberated through the Dream, and all the leaves of G'Hanir fell from their branches. Many mourned it, and some succumbed to the temptation of serving dark forces in Aviana's absence. But although she had died, her spirit lingered. As the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; struggled to rebuild their society in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; discovered a gift: A &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir%2C%20the%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;single branch&lt;/a&gt; from the Mother Tree, with a single acorn hanging from its leaves, had been left in their care. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; used the acorn to grow &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sensed that it had been Aviana's spirit that had given the branch to them, and he believed it was best to keep it hidden. Many of &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;Aviana's children&lt;/a&gt; had been lost to chaos, and they might be driven to claim the remnant of Aviana's legacy for their new masters. Quietly, Malfurion moved the branch to a safe location within the Emerald Dream. Few knew of its location, but its influence was felt far and wide. For many millennia, the branch served as a stabilizing force for the Dream, and the land near it was said to be a place of great healing and peace.\nRecent times.\nTen thousand years later, Aviana was one of several Wild Gods brought back from death to defend &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; from the forces of the fire &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. After the mountain was saved, Aviana turned her attention to G'Hanir once again. Times had changed, but her dream of providing a spiritual haven for her kind had not. She set out to restore the Mother Tree to its full glory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Aviana had an interest in giving the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; a place on the Great Bough, and sought a way into offering the species an invitation."}

Worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, G'huun was known as the Blood God. Though it was quite less powerful than the other Old Gods, the threat it posed was still world-ending. G'huun's corruption was called \"underrot\". It sought to spread its rot, pestilence and decay across the world and beyond, and to consume &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nG'huun is one of the main antagonists on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", and serves as the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; raid.\nBackground.\nOrigins.\nG'huun was accidentally created by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s when they experimented with means to solve the problem posed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. They used Uldir to \"try to figure out what makes Old Gods tick,\" including performing experiments. This led to \"some creepy and weird stuff there,\" and G'huun is the result of years of experiments where the titans couldn't figure out how to cure this Old God disease. When they experimented upon the Old Gods' unending, ravenous need to corrupt, they unexpectedly created a perfect avatar of that desire. G'huun is nothing but rot, pestilence, and decay\u2014the ultimate parasite who cannot stop itself from consuming its host until it is gone. He was locked away in the facility of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20seal\"&gt;sealed&lt;/a&gt; with three seals: &lt;a href=\"Atul%27nazman\"&gt;Atul'nazman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;Great Seal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor%20%28pyramid%29\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. The seal in Atul'Aman was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; long ago, while Atul'nazman was damaged by G'huun's minions.\nG'huun had apparently been attempting to control the Zandalari trolls for centuries. The first confirmed major case was when &lt;a href=\"Kel%27vax%20Deathwalker\"&gt;Kel'vax Deathwalker&lt;/a&gt; subverted the worshipers of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Terrace of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; to worship G'huun instead. The old god promised Kel'vax eternal life and turned him into a &lt;a href=\"troll%20lich\"&gt;troll lich&lt;/a&gt;, along with command over the dead.\nDuring the final era of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tribes\"&gt;Council of Tribes&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to summon &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; was made, which released a &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;plague of corrupted blood&lt;/a&gt;, killing thousands of trolls. It was deemed that the bodies, too polluted for proper burial, would instead be burned and kept in special urns. As time progressed, this method became commonplace among the Zandalari in disposing of their dead. After the great plague, there were still those who clung to the magics of the blood god. They tested their magics and perfected them. One such relic was a totem, which when concentrated upon, would drain not just the life from their enemies, but also their blood, infusing the caster with it and altering them in unusual ways. This was the dawn of those the Zandalari call \"&lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\" Eventually the blood trolls would begin worshiping G'huun. Because G'huun has no need for technology, the blood trolls regressed into a more primitive state compared to other troll races. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ma%27da%20Ateena\"&gt;Grand Ma'da Ateena&lt;/a&gt; and the blood trolls considered themselves the children of G'huun.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWith his prison weakened, G'huun's corruption begun spreading across the land, threatening to cover all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He also started wresting control over the souls of the dead from &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the loa of death, leading to a conflict between them.\nG'huun corrupted &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, the loa of &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, and turned him into his servant. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s worked alongside &lt;a href=\"Jo%27chunga\"&gt;Jo'chunga&lt;/a&gt; and struck Hir'eek down in order to weaken G'huun's forces.\nWith the seal of &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Nazmir\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Atul%27nazman\"&gt;Atul'nazman&lt;/a&gt; destroyed by G'huun's forces, &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and his allies, &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt;, worked to free the Blood God by undoing the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;last remaining seal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was to have G'huun replace the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, which Zul saw as weak, as the trolls' new god who would lead them to &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;rule the world again&lt;/a&gt;. The seal was ultimately destroyed by a revived Mythrax during the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.

After facing the other horrors of Uldir, the raid faces the root of the corruption that seeks to devour &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, and potentially, all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis fight consists of 3 phases and revolves around using the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;-made Reorigination Drive to wipe out adds and severely damage G'huun at critical junctures. \nAdventure Guide.\n\"In Uldir, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s had hoped to find a solution to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. But when they experimented upon the Old Gods' unending, ravenous need to corrupt, they unexpectedly created a perfect avatar of that desire. G'huun is nothing but rot, pestilence, and decay, the ultimate parasite who cannot stop itself from consuming its host until it is gone.\"\nOverview.\nG'huun begins the encounter encased within the chamber's wall, calling forth minions to assault his foes. To dislodge him from his lair, the Reorigination Drive must be fully charged by depositing Power Matrices within it. Once active, G'huun begins his assult in earnest. G'huun can be stalled by continuing to power up the Reorigination Drive, causing Reorigination Blasts to weaken him. Upon reaching low health, G'huun unleashes his might, destroying the Reorigination Drive, preventing the use of Reorigination Blasts.\nAbilities.\nStage Two: Behold the Power of G'huun!\nUpper Platform.\nSame as phase one\nStrategy.\nThis fight requires 2 tanks. Healing will be light in phase 1, but the need for heavy healing will grow when G'huun himself joins the fight. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; effects should be saved for the final phase. While any DPS composition works, high-mobility classes like &lt;a href=\"monks\"&gt;monks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunters\"&gt;demon hunters&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"warlocks\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt;, can make Phase 1 far easier. \nPhase 1.\nDuring this phase, G'huun will stay inside the wall and constantly heal itself, making damaging it pointless. All it will do is cast Explosive Corruption. This will hit several players with a debuff that, after 4 seconds, will explode and create both slime on the ground and blight-orbs flying in different directions. Players should try to drop this debuff as close to the walls as possible and away from high-traffic areas, as the slime both hurts and slows down players.\nMost of the raid will be in the center arena battling G'huun's forces at any given time. Cyclopean Terrors are eye tentacles and simply cast Mind Flay on players with slowly increasing damage and should be focused down first. The Dark Young is a giant creature that hits the tank hard and casts Dark Bargain. This spell causes a circle to appear on the ground, and when players OR enemies are within the circle when the mob finishes casting, they will gain a strong DPS and Healing increase, but increase damage taken. Tanks should try to make it so the Dark Bargain is cast on the Cyclopean Terrors to get them down faster. DPS and Healers can also take a stack, but should be mindful that, if they gain 2 stacks, they will get &lt;a href=\"charm\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt;ed and need to be taken down. \nThis phase will go on until the raid uses the Power Matrix orbs that spawn on the sides of the room to create a Reorigination Blast, killing all the adds and starting Phase 2. To trigger it, players must run a total three orbs from the spawn location (small altars on the left and right side of the arena) to the Reorigination Drive at the other end of the hall. The orb will spawn on the left-hand side of the arena, then the right, then the left again. Along the hall, there are cysts that cause blighted ground that will slow you down and cause negligible damage. As previously said, classes with high mobility can essentailly solo this segment with the help of a warlock's &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Gateway\"&gt;Demonic Gateway&lt;/a&gt;. A monk with &lt;a href=\"celerity\"&gt;celerity&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior with &lt;a href=\"warbringer%20%28Wrath%20Classic%29\"&gt;warbringer (Wrath Classic)&lt;/a&gt; (charging the cysts), or a demon hunter are all great options. If these are not available, 3 players must move and throw the orb between each other due to the orb slowing down and eventually rooting the player holding it. If a player throws the orb and it does not land on another player, it will shatter against the ground uselessly and you will have to start over. The reason to bring 3 players is that, if a player has held an orb within 5 minutes, they will not be able to hold one again and the orb will shatter when thrown. Divide players into appropriately-sized groups before hand and this phase should end with minimal difficulty once the mechanics are understood. \nPhase 2.\nAs the Reorigination Blast fires, it will stun and wipe out all adds over the course of 24-seconds. Stack and heal through the damage. After the adds have died, G'huun itself will emerge and attack. The tank-swap mechanic is Growing Corruption, causing G'huun to deal ever-increasing damage to the tank he is currently targeting, and can only be reset when he hits a different target, similar to &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt;. He will also be casting Explosive Corruption on his current tank. Ideally, tanks should watch their DBM timers and time their taunts so that the tank with the stacks takes the Explosive Corruption and then is able to run out to keep the Blighted Ground against the wall. \nDuring this phase, the raid can stack up to better heal-off the damage from G'huun's Wave of Corruption. This causes all players to take unavoidable damage and also causes them to gain stacks of Putrid Blood, causing damage over time. The only way to dispel this stacking debuff is to stack on the player with Blood Feast, a large red circle that roots a single player. This will spawn a Gibbering Horror add which must be picked up immediately. This add will hit the tank and cast Mind-Numbing Chatter to interrupt anyone currently casting. Healers must pay attention to DBM timers for this cast as damage during this phase is very high from the Waves of Corruption. Each stack of Blood Feast cleansed will empower the add by 5%. Cleansing stacks frequently, or not standing on the Blood Feast, will lead to smaller and more frequent adds, while waiting for several Blood Feasts to pass will lead to fewer and stronger adds.\nYou can only activate ONE more Reorigination Blast this phase and you typically want to use it to transition cleanly into Phase 3 by using it to kill the currently-active add. You can be done multiple ways, such as only summoning 2 big adds, activating Reorigination Blast, and cleaving them both down while killing the boss. Use the blast to get to 25% and Phase 3 will begin. \nPhase 3.\nAt 25%, the Reorigination Drives will no longer function, leaving the raid to finish off G'huun on their own. During this phase, G'huun will cause the roof to collapse, causing even greater raid-wide damage over time. He will also gain Gaze of G'huun, causing anyone currently facing towards it to run away in fear for 6 seconds. Simply turn away to do so. He also stops casting Blood Feast, meaning there is no way to cleanse Putrid Blood stacks. Try to save healing cooldowns for this phase as it will get very damage-heavy. The raid should not stack due to the collapsing roof hurting and knocking you back from the impact-site. Thus, the raid should try to spread out with the healers in the center of the room, better able to reach everyone. As Putrid Blood stacks get higher and Explosive Corruption continues hitting non-tank players, the fight becomes a brutal race to see who dies first: The raid or the boss. Use your Bloodlust, keep the Explosive Corruptions near the walls, and chain your healing cooldowns smartly, and your raid should be victorious with high dps. "}

Basically, the clock started when you received your first one, and did not reset until they disappeared or you had consumed them all. \nThis aspect of how the item works has not changed. Your stack of these will still be treated as a lump that all expire at the same time.

It was located to the far northwest of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;\u2014beyond &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 and it was surrounded by unmapped space between itself and the main continent, making it completely impossible\u2014contrary to popular belief\u2014to reach without &lt;a href=\"exploit\"&gt;exploit&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nAlthough there are many rumors and exaggerations about GM Island, it was simply a place for the game masters to login, logout, and then be able to teleport to some standard areas. GMs do not discuss the area.\nThe island was very small, with a mansion (using the model of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Command%20Center\"&gt;Command Center&lt;/a&gt;) surrounded by a unique wall and a &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssociated lore.\nStrangely, Blizzard does mention GM Island in some lore. In their recruitment section, on their official European website, the company explains how players from every race (&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; alike) do their best to make sure any technical problems in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; are resolved. The &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; \"Ari\" and the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; \"Tuskfyre\" are two of these inhabitants of GM Island. These characters are nowhere to be found elsewhere in-game, however.\nShort story.\nThe tall troll stifled a yawn as he stretched his long limbs. He was overlooking the bay from atop a small hill close to the wharf. The first rays of the sun were tentatively breaking the cover of darkness and it promised to be another fine day. He scanned the horizon, looking for the first signs of the ritual that took place daily at the same time. And sure enough, far in the distance, he saw the first dots materializing and slowly growing larger as they moved ever closer to shore. \"Hmm, so the ferryman will be in time again, will he?\" Ari asked, startling Tuskfyre as he seemingly appeared out of nowhere. Tuskfyre looked at Ari while the little gnome gazed through one of his strange devices which allowed him to see over vast distances. \"He's more reliable than your little mechanical toys,\" Tuskfyre teased him good humouredly.\nWith a grating noise, the boat came to a halt alongside the pier. A sailor tossed a rope to one of the ghouls who slowly tied it to a bollard. Even before the boat had come to a complete stop, a merry crowd of the strangest company Azeroth had ever seen assembled began to jump ashore: fleet-footed night elves, brawny, heavyset orcs, sturdy dwarves, regal humans, chattering gnomes and powerful taurens.\n\"Alright, the day shift has arrived. Time to get moving,\" Tuskfyre said as he turned around and began to stroll down the hill. On his way towards the building, the undead of the night shift crossed his path as they were heading to their mouldy tombs where they would pass the daylight hours until it was time for them to rise again at night. Tuskfyre made his way through the main hall, which was now bustling with activity.\n\"Goooood morrrrrning!\" the troll's voice rang across the room, calling the wild bunch to attention. \"Reports indicate no unusual activity. The zombies have done a good job during the night, everything has been going smoothly. We'll take it from here; if there are any problems, you know what to do. Remember, everyone is counting on you. Don't let them down!\" he said as he handed out the day's assignments.\nThe men and women of his team made their way to their workstations and began to operate the mysterious devices mounted to the tables. Trusting Ari to ensure the smooth running of the devices, Tuskfyre retreated to his antechamber and began to check through the reports of mass brawls, petty larceny and drunken gnome punting, assigning tasks to various members of his team and checking in with his colleagues to discuss some of the important issues of the day. When the sun had risen high in the sky, he allowed himself a short break in his work and walked over to the window overlooking the small port.\nBeyond the sea there were hundreds of thousands of adventurers, all doing their best to find their place in this world. Deep in thought, the troll scratched his tusks. A long time ago, he had been one of them, an honest soul always looking for the next adventure, always an encouraging word for his comrades on his lips and a deadly arrow on his bow. How long had it been since he had put his adventurer's hat to rest and donned the robes of blue? It never failed to amaze Tuskfyre how quickly time passed on the island. Each day held a new challenge, and the troll loved challenges. Thinking back to his tribe, he couldn't help but smile his typically crooked trollish smile. If they could see him now!\nA knock on the door and the sound of bony feet on the wooden floor took Tuskfyre back to the real world. Erynshar, one of the few undead from the day shift, stood in the doorway, shifting from one foot to the other uneasily. He had arrived only recently on the island. \"Yes, Eryshnar, what do you need?\"\n\"It is really rather embarrassing, master Tuskfyre,\" he began, \"there is a young elf, a druid in fact... she is having problems talking to her trainer for a class quest. She is doing everything right and I can't locate the problem.\"\n\"Ah the young ones, still learning the ropes,\" Tuskfyre mused. \"Don't worry, these druid trainers sometimes don't know their left from their right. We will have this druid back on track before you know it. Here, let me show you how it is done...\"\nPrison chamber.\nUnderneath GM Island, embedded in the lower structure of the island, is a hidden room. This room is completely textured with large white tiles and illuminated with one single light source, leaving a bright circular spot of light in the center of the room's floor. There are no objects in the room.\nThe prison chamber allows player to enter, but they are then unable to leave unless teleported out by a GM. The walls are made so that you cannot jump up them like other walls in the game.\nIn earlier versions, this room used to contain one single chair, but it seems to be no longer present. The chair is now back as of patch 3.3.3.\nThe purpose of this room is unknown to any GM, speculation within the company is that the programmers put it in for their own amusement similar to the room within Wintergrasp Fortress as a Moderator would not need to move a player to question them. The room is a good 100 yards below the surface of the island and has only been seen by a few GMs."}

This act erases friend and ignore lists.

The Frostwolves defend the pass alongside their Horde allies, but the assault rapidly becomes overwhelming. As the Horde is pushed back and channels a massive lightning spell to seal the pass, Ga'nar stays behind to buy the farseer enough time to complete the spell, having fully acknowledged that Durotan has become a better leader than he ever could have. The lone Frostwolf warrior charges into the fray, slaying numerous enemies as Drek'thar completes the spell and collapses the pass.

The city was once surrounded by desert, but since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; Gadgetzan was converted from a busy goblin city into a busy beachfront capital.\nSome of the best goblin engineers, miners, and alchemists ply their trade here. The goblins believe in profit above loyalty, thus Gadgetzan is considered neutral territory in any &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; conflict. Anyone with a fat wallet or services to offer is welcomed in Gadgetzan. Both governments officially recognize goblin neutrality, and for those who don't, the streets are heavily patrolled by goblin bruisers ready to pound to a pulp anyone disrupting their trade by instigating conflict.\nThe city boasts many features including a port for all factions, but also with a blanket of black fumes hanging over the city.\nHistory.\nThe first mention of Gadgetzan is approximately two years after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, &lt;a href=\"Charnas\"&gt;Charnas&lt;/a&gt; would open his bookstore here, and &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, with his brother &lt;a href=\"Silverlaine%20Thorne\"&gt;Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt;, visited it.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAlthough goblin neutrality is almost universally acknowledged, there are still those who seek to sow chaos and anarchy. For Gadgetzan, this came in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Wastewander\"&gt;Wastewander&lt;/a&gt; bandits, a gang of miscreants who occupied the &lt;a href=\"Waterspring%20Field\"&gt;Waterspring Field&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Noonshade%20Ruins\"&gt;Noonshade Ruins&lt;/a&gt; on the northeast Tanaris. Few goblins care about ancient ruins (unless they have treasure) \u2013 for all they care, the bandits could have the old blocks of stone, however, the Waterspring Field was vital to Gadgetzan's survival in the desert which provided them with the liquid gold.\nWater towers out in the field were constructed and maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan%20Water%20Company\"&gt;Gadgetzan Water Company&lt;/a&gt; under the blazing heat of the desert sun, so the goblins weren't going to give up their hard-earned towers that easily. However, the goblin &lt;a href=\"bruiser\"&gt;bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s needed to stay in town to keep the gnomes' collective Napoleonic-complex from getting out of hand and to stop the seemingly endless dueling among the various visitors from disrupting business. Therefore, it fell to brave mercenaries from all corners of the world to help the goblins in their time of utmost need.\nBy this time, the city was briefly visited by &lt;a href=\"Kova%20Broadhorn\"&gt;Kova Broadhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miles%20Corebender\"&gt;Miles Corebender&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bellthazor\"&gt;Bellthazor&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the ocean flooded in close to the town, turning the area outside the eastern wall into beach-front property and obliterating the nearby &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Port\"&gt;Steamwheedle Port&lt;/a&gt;, whose survivors moved into the city for a modest relocation fee, and destroying the water towers in the Waterspring Field. What was an apocalyptic result for some, it came as a fruitful opportunity for Gadgetzan to turn the city into an important neutral port.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20of%20Theramore\"&gt;Destruction of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; sent the \"&lt;a href=\"Starsword\"&gt;Starsword&lt;/a&gt;\" full of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; civilians to Gadgetzan. Its status remained unknown.\nTraveler.\nBy the time of the Cataclysm, the city had greatly expanded and it was described to contain winding and labyrinthine streets full of almost every known race to the human &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, and even a new west gate for the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Faeyrine%20Springsong\"&gt;Faeyrine Springsong&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, lives here, and the author of \"&lt;a href=\"Common%20Birds%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Common Birds of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", the goblin &lt;a href=\"Charnas\"&gt;Charnas&lt;/a&gt;, has his shop in the city.\nGadgetzan was visited by the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;, Aramar's group, and &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe city came under the attack of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during their &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. It was defended by &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt;, its inhabitants and the Alliance and the Horde.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; visited the city. The troll ambassador was worried about the fumes.\nGetting there.\nGadgetzan is located on the norheastern region of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, in the southeast corner of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. It can be accessed by traveling through &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, crossing a mountain pass at the southeastern edge to travel into Tanaris. The town is built at the base of the pass.\nAn alternate way to reach Gadgetzan for Alliance players is to swim south along the coast from &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can also take a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=\"Zephyr\"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;; requires with &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; (portal located in &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;) and walk to Gadgetzan from there.\nPlayers who have specialized in &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Engineering\"&gt;Gnomish Engineering&lt;/a&gt; can build a that can teleport them directly to Gadgetzan once every 4 hours.\nReputation.\nKilling &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Pirates\"&gt;Southsea Pirates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wastewander\"&gt;Wastewander&lt;/a&gt; nomads will increase your &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.

The former is available if you are unable to complete the field sampling in under two hours.\nAn article from the \"&lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan%20Times\"&gt;Gadgetzan Times&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGadgetzan: The Jewel of Tanaris\n&lt;a href=\"Fara%20Boltbreaker\"&gt;Fara Boltbreaker&lt;/a&gt;\n\"GADGETZAN \u2013 Sitting like a sapphire on the silvery-white sands of Tanaris, Gadgetzan is one of the greatest cities of Kalimdor and, to hear goblins speak, of the world itself. Using their ingenuity, the goblins of the Steamwheedle Cartel have tamed the desert and erected a trading outpost the likes of which none have seen before. This city is open to both members of the Horde and Alliance, provided they keep their weapons sheathed. The city of Gadgetzan features a neutral bank, an auction house run by goblin auctioneers, and vendors galore.\nThe first of these, the bank, accepts deposits from both the Horde and the Alliance and, working with the banks in Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Thunder Bluff as well as the banks in Ironforge, Stormwind, and Darnassus, allows access to deposits made anywhere in the world. The agreements and technology that allows the goblins to access the other banks and deposits made in them is a closely guarded goblin secret.\nThe second feature is the Auction House. The auction house in Gadgetzan, to hear the goblins speak, puts the houses in Orgrimmar and Ironforge to shame. The Gadgetzan auction house allows members of the Alliance and the Horde to sell goods that can be purchased by anyone, even members of the opposing faction. One of the most popular trades made through the auction house is the lucrative \"pet trade.\" On any given day, one can walk into the Gadgetzan auction house and see humans trading kittens to the Horde and the Tauren trading prairie dogs to the Alliance. Some speculate that the trade in cuddly creatures may cause the two sides to come to terms yet.\nThe third major feature of Gadgetzan is the sheer variety of vendors and professionals. In Gadgetzan, one can find materials for many professions from cooking to enchanting. A variety of armor and weapons is sold with no questions asked.\nThese three things alone make Gadgetzan an ideal city. The rest of the city's amenities, including an inn with beds for all races and sizes, a forge and anvil used and praised by the Mithril Order itself, a Stable Master who is an expert in handling animals from the world over, as well as transportation by Wyvern or Gryphon are just icing on the cake. Taken altogether, all of these things make Gadgetzan one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, city in the world.\nThat's not to say that Gadgetzan is perfect, of course. There are some minor problems that pester the people of this desert paradise. Small things like the Wastewander bandits who threaten the Waterspring Field. Adventurers who beat the bandits back earn the gratitude of the goblins and will be, in time, suitably rewarded. Of course, sometimes the problems come from the adventurers themselves. The Gadgetzan envisioned by the goblins is a trade haven but sometimes the Gadgetzan that really exists resembles a battlefield. Such battles are finished quickly once the Bruisers arrive on the scene, though, so future visitors need not worry overmuch about the violence they hear about in Gadgetzan. Aside from a few minor quirks, the city of Gadgetzan truly is the goblin-built jewel of Tanaris.\"\nIn Hearthstone.\nGadgetzan is the setting for the fifth expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", \"\". In the expansion, Gadgetzan is described as having massively expanded from a small desert town to a large, bustling port city following the flooding of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Now with access to sea trade, Gadgetzan suddenly became a valuable port between Azeroth's continents \"without any of that annoyinh baggage that comes with faction allegiance or any sort of regulation whatsoever\". Over the years, a vast number of \"completely legitimate and not-at-all illegal business folk\" began taking a liking to that sort of environment.\nA few years down the line, what was previously a lone oasis of greed in the barren desert is bursting at the seams. That leads to disagreements, and with no real law to restrain them, some folks form organisations to enforce their own rules. Three major crime families now rule the back alleys of the newly expanded Gadgetzan, battling for control of the city's lucrative (but definitely legal) business: the brutish weapon smugglers of the &lt;a href=\"Grimy%20Goons\"&gt;Grimy Goons&lt;/a&gt; led by the cunning and powerful &lt;a href=\"Don%20Han%27Cho\"&gt;Don Han'Cho&lt;/a&gt;, the mystical assassins of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Lotus\"&gt;Jade Lotus&lt;/a&gt; led by the young and clever &lt;a href=\"Aya%20Blackpaw\"&gt;Aya Blackpaw&lt;/a&gt; and the outcast spellcasters and potion-peddlers of the &lt;a href=\"Kabal\"&gt;Kabal&lt;/a&gt; led by the mysterious and intelligent &lt;a href=\"Kazakus\"&gt;Kazakus&lt;/a&gt;. Besides these three, there are also some minor factions active in the city, such as the \"&lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; biker gang.\"\nGadgetzan has previously been mentioned in \"Hearthstone\" through two different goblin minions: the from the classic set and the from \"\".\nAs of 2017 there are no plans to recreate Gadgetzan in \"World of Warcraft\" to match the \"Hearthstone\" version.\nThe novel \"\" similarly reflects Gadgetzan's larger size and winding streets, though none of the other new aspects portrayed in the \"Hearthstone\" expansion are present.\nIn the RPG.\nIn Lands of Mystery.\nGadgetzan, located up near the edge of the northern mountains in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, is a metal-walled town, with rusted buildings, giant moving wheels, and smoke rising from chimneys all about. You can hear the hammering and grinding from at least a mile away. It was built and is manned mostly by &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, with some &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s helping out here and there.\nThis small, walled settlement is made almost entirely of metal, with some stone mixed in between. The dominant features are forges and a number of massive machines used to produce and cut metal structures, such as the &lt;a href=\"Waterspring%20Field\"&gt;many wells found throughout the desert&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently &lt;a href=\"Wastewander\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; knock them down almost as fast as goblins put them up, although why they would destroy a source of good water is beyond understanding. The skies above Gadgetzan are almost always choked with black smoke from the various machines that always operate, and you might want to bring a set of earplugs if you expect to get any sleep at night.\nGadgetzan, like &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, is crawled with all sorts of people there. You can see &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and even &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s in the streets, all moving about on whatever business brought them to this busy place. Most of them arrive via &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bulkrek%20Ragefist\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bera%20Stonehammer\"&gt;masters&lt;/a&gt;' keep their camps outside the city walls, opposite to each other. &lt;a href=\"Road%20Warrior\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt; in Gadgetzan are rollicking places. You can hear stories there that no one wouldn't believe. With the information you get in these places, it may save your life several times if you plan to venture into the desert.\nAbout twice a year rain falls on Tanaris. When this happens, it's not just a drizzle, but an intense downpour that lasts for hours. The few scraggly plants that survive in the desert do so chiefly because of this tiny bit of moisture, but for the residents of Gadgetzan, it's a cause for celebration. The entire town comes to a stop, and a holiday breaks out, the &lt;a href=\"Rainy%20Day\"&gt;Rainy Day&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone collects as much water as they can, and then it's an all-day and all-night party. Part of the celebration's appeal is its unpredictability.\nItems such as &lt;a href=\"%3Afirebloom\"&gt;:firebloom&lt;/a&gt; plants or volatile rum can be purchased on the open market of Gadgetzan. The town is also a good stopping-off point for anyone intending to head into &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chief%20Engineer%20Bilgewhizzle\"&gt;Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of the town.\nIn Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game.\nThe neutral &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; trading outpost of Gadgetzar is the only spot of civilization in the entire desert of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. Weary explorers can find most gear that they need here, as well as a place to escape from the blistering sun and other dangers from the desert."}

The Bruisers are responsible for upholding law and order with a firm hand, and ensuring that all exchange is fair.\nBehind the scenes of a busy trading hub, a serious guerrilla war is being fought between the Alliance and the Horde. There are series of skirmishes every day in the outskirts of Gadgetzan, sometimes escalating in to clashes between guilds just outside the guarded area. Now, with the re-establishment of the Cenarion Hold in Silithus, the future looks even darker for the residents of Gadgetzan. There are more and more Horde and Alliance traveling through the area to reach the challenges that await them in Silithus, often taking their frustration out at each other while stopping at the goblin establishment.\nGadgetzan Times was granted the opportunity to have a word with one of the Bruisers. These goblins are responsible for keeping order in town and have become increasingly stressed over recent developments of the conflict. Hikkle Ricksprinkle, a Bruiser tells us of some of the problems the Bruisers have experienced: \"We had to order a shipment of guns to keep up with the way the conflict has taken. Recently the faction grievances have been taken to a whole new level. Rarely a day passes by without a hunter or a mage climbing on to one of the rooftops just here, and shooting down at whoever might be passing by. At first we were quite helpless with the situation as we had no means of getting them down, but with the new order of good ole Blunderbuss rifles we've taken the situation under control.\"\nAdaptation is now the key, as the warring factions come up with new ways to slow each other down. And as the Bruisers improve their weaponry and training, they have to cut off their free time. \"Currently we're all working full time, 24 hours a day, 6 \u00be days of the week. We only ever take a break Tuesday mornings. Still, we can barely keep order in Gadgetzan as it is.\" There are always new things to adapt to. The hunters in the area sometimes send their pets to harass others while hiding among the corpses littered in the area. The Bruisers are currently looking for ways to find the villains responsible, as they are rarely brought to justice. \"The hunters are the worst, absolutely! They don't only have their pets do the dirty work; they also lay down their horrible traps. Every guard from here to Steamwheedle has stood in a block of ice, trapped by the tasteless prank of a hunter. It's not funny at all, and we take action towards anyone found setting traps in Gadgetzan.\"\nThe Bruisers also offered the Gadgetzan Times a list of general guidelines to visitors.\nCaution should be exercised in the following situations:\nEven though the factions bring their disagreements with them, there positives still outweigh the negatives. \"They keep the pirate, silithid and troll populations down, so at least we don't have to deal with them as well. On top of that, we take our modest fees of the trade that happens here, so we have quite an income from the merchants alone. The Pirates to the east, trolls to the west and silithid and ogres to the south are all a constant threat to Gadgetzan. If it wasn't for the brave adventurers passing through, the town wouldn't be here today.\""}

Sitting in on a meeting in the library in Ironforge, she reports back to us the lessons learned from the magi.\nIronforge \u2013 This week, gnomish and human magi researching the history of the arcane presented their findings to a special mage-only conference held in the library in Ironforge. The Gadgetzan Times' Fara Boltbreaker was invited to cover the event. Below is her report from this event.\nMagic has a long history in our world. However, as many magi remind us, the practice of magic comes with a heavy responsibility. Irresponsible use of magic led to the War of the Ancients and the Sundering. The historical records of the kaldorei, or night elves as they are more commonly known, are quite clear on this.\nThe War of Ancients.\nMagic began with the night elves living near the Well of Eternity. Their queen, Azshara, ordered her special servitors, the quel'dorei, meaning 'Highborne,' to join the night elf priests in trying to uncover the secrets of the Well. In their quest to learn its secrets, the night elves discovered that they could manipulate the cosmic energies flowing from the Well. Even though they knew that this power, to create or destroy, should be handled with care, the quel'dorei and Azshara practiced magic with little forethought. The night elves' use of magic was like a clarion call to Sargeras, the dark titan. He gathered his Burning Legion and followed the call to Azeroth. Azshara, swayed by Sargeras' power, agreed to work with the quel'dorei to open a portal in the Well of Eternity so that he could enter the world from the Great Beyond. Thus, it was through the heedless use of magic that the Burning Legion first came to our world. The invasion was ended only when the portal that Azshara and the quel'dorei had opened collapsed, causing the Sundering.\nMagic, at first, was practiced only by the night elves. However, after the Sundering, the night elf magi were exiled by the others after the magi refused to give up their spellcraft. The night elf magi set sail for the distant horizon and landed in Lordaeron. Forsaking their nocturnal culture, they turned from worship of Elune, the moon goddess, to veneration of the sun. From this point forward, they called themselves the 'high elves.' In Lordaeron, the exiles set up their kingdom called \"Quel'Thalas.\" For long centuries, the high elves lived in Quel'Thalas and used their magic to keep the trolls at bay. It was not until after the humans had united under the Arathi nation and the trolls had all but destroyed the high elf kingdom that magic spread to the humans. The high elves agreed to teach magic to the humans in exchange for help against the trolls. The united human and high elf effort pushed the trolls back.\nRecent History.\nWith the troll threat contained, the human empire of Arathi began to expand. The second city-state of the empire, Dalaran, was founded and became a haven for human magi. Dalaran's reckless use of magic drew demons back into the world, albeit not in the numbers that had flooded through during the War of Ancients. The high elves then warned the humans about the Burning Legion and the disaster that could arise from the uncontrolled use of magic.\nGiven its history as a destructive force, practitioners of magic are often held in awe and suspicion. With such great power comes great responsibility, and magi will generally only teach their art to those who are willing to take up the burdens that magic entails. However, with the destruction of Dalaran and magic's own disaster-strewn history, many wonder if the world would be better off without magi altogether."}

At the dinner table, at work, at home, in the garden... everywhere! He has even started shouting about it when we are in bed! Recently, he has also started claiming that he does other things in the name of the Light, not just vanquishing evil. For instance, when he ate our sons birthday cake he claimed that he had done it 'For The Light!', and when he neglects to take out the trash he leaves it just inside the door 'for The Light!' Please, Auntie Fizzle, what should I do?\"\n\"Mrs. &lt;a href=\"Janice%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Janice Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; of Stormwind\"\nGreetings Janice,\nDevotion to a cause is always a worthy thing, but just sometimes it can go too far. Evidently you have tried talking to your husband about this problem. If that doesn't work, then I suggest you talk to a few warlocks and develop a healthy interest in the ways of Shadow. Then whenever you don't feel the desire to cook dinner, you can always declare it as being 'For the Darkness'. He'll soon get the idea.\n\"Dear Auntie Fizzle,\"\n\"Many years ago, I was married to a lovely woman and we lived happily in Stratholme. But when the Scourge came, we were separated and she was killed. I have since married again and am very happy. But recently I have learnt that my former wife has now risen as an Undead and is living in the Undercity of Lordaeron. I have also learned that she still loves me and considers me to be her husband. What should I do?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Crowe\"&gt;Gerald Crowe&lt;/a&gt; of Goldshire\"\nGreetings Gerald,\nA healthy spray of air freshener tends to keep those pesky Undead away. If that doesn't work, just buy her a pink dress. No self-respecting Undead would be seen\u2026 dead\u2026 in pink.\n\"Dear Auntie Fizzle,\"\n\"I recently placed a wanted poster in Orgrimmar for the head of the false warchief Rend Blackhand. Now all these people keep turning up to claim the bounty, all carrying heads. I wouldn't mind so much, but the smell of all those heads is terrible. What should I do?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Valkasha\"&gt;Valkasha&lt;/a&gt; of Orgrimmar\"\nGreetings Valkasha,\nA surplus of heads can be turned to good usage. Have you considered making a sculpture out of them? Or perhaps you can give them to the orc orphans to play football with. You could always turn them in for bounty rewards yourself. Or make a museum. They do say that skulls are an orc girl's best friend.\n\"Dear Auntie Fizzle,\"\n\"I maintain a small farm in the Tirisfal Glades. Whilst I am constantly fighting off these Undead who want to steal my pumpkins, I have found a new problem. Murlocs! The murlocs keep coming out of the sea, running all over my fields and stealing my seeds. What can I do?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Jack\"&gt;Farmer Jack&lt;/a&gt;\"\nGreetings Farmer Jack,\nA murloc invasion is a terrible thing. Even I sometimes lie awake at night hearing that gargling sound. However, perhaps you can turn the situation to good fortune. Have you considered hiring the local Undead to kill murlocs instead of stealing pumpkins? I am sure you could get away with paying them with rusty weapons or ragged armor. Failing that, just cook some smelly fish stew and leave the windows open. Even murlocs don't like to see their cousins being cooked into a delicious stew."}

Mostly I have found the benefits of the condition to outweigh the disadvantages. But one problem remains: my hair! No matter what I do with it, my once gorgeous hair now sticks out everywhere, in all directions. Any attempts to comb it just results in clumps falling out. Auntie Fizzle, what can I do?\"\n\"Ms &lt;a href=\"Helga%20Parker\"&gt;Helga Parker&lt;/a&gt;, Undercity.\"\nGreetings Helga,\nUnfortunately, being a zombie can have a negative effect on one's appearance. There are a few things you could do though. Perhaps you could shave all your hair off? Being a bald undead is quite in fashion at the moment. Or you could try washing large amounts of super-sticky glue into your hair. Once in place it won't move again.

Am I being paranoid?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Klarissa%20Cartwright\"&gt;Klarissa Cartwright&lt;/a&gt; of Stormwind.\"\nGreetings Klarissa,\nJealousy is a powerful emotion, and most succubi are incredibly attractive. I would imagine that Aelneth is more attractive than you. But men will be men and will chase after the most attractive one. So of course you are not paranoid, and of course this situation is not tenable. The solution is simple. Either make yourself more attractive (I gather there are some surgeons in Undercity who specialize in new faces and bodies), or feed the succubus lots of muffins and cherry pie until she explodes. Easy.\n\"Dear Auntie Fizzle,\"\n\"Thank you for your wise advice last time. The murlocs have now gone from my farm. But now I have a new problem. Dwarves! A group of dwarves have set up an archeological dig in my pumpkin field, claiming there are relics of their lost civilization down there. Now, I know that the only thing in my pumpkin-field is pumpkins. What should I do?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Jack\"&gt;Farmer Jack&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nGreetings Farmer Jack,\nI'm glad my advice worked for you last time, and I hope I can assist you again. Dwarven archeologists can be particularly stubborn, but like most infestations, they can be cleared away with a little bit of thought. Have you considered hiring goblin guards? However, here is another solution. Dwarven archeologists are investigators looking for the next clue. So all you need to do is to plant some evidence into the dig site that makes it clear that the humans had done it in Southshore with the candlestick. The dwarves will be off like a flash."}

Gone is the clattering of scorpids, evicted from their natural home by the powerful roar of engines. As engineers from around the world congregate to create the fastest machine ever to traverse these once open plains, Gadgetzan Times was given the unique opportunity to talk with some of the pit crew.\n\"What we are trying to achieve here is not simply a land speed record.\" G.T. was told by &lt;a href=\"Gregor%20Fizzwuzz\"&gt;Gregor Fizzwuzz&lt;/a&gt;, assistant to the great Brassbolts brothers, \"I mean sure, we want to build something that will be remembered through history as a fine piece of Gnomish Engineering, but more importantly; we want to beat those Goblins!\"\nIt's true that the Gnomish engineers have progressed far in the development of their 'racers' but following them step for step technologically have been the Goblins who know a money-maker when they see one.\n\"The Gnomes never build anything that works,\" remarks &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Sprockett\"&gt;Ed Sprockett&lt;/a&gt;, one of the goblin crew-workers, \"They spend so much time tinkering and fiddling with the little things that they forget that they are working on a larger project. The smaller components that regulate the internal lighting and the cushions on their seats may be good ideas but if the 'thing' never moves, it's a complete waste of time.\"\nThe Gnomes and the Goblins have been out here in the Shimmering Flats for a long time trying to build a better speed racer than each other. So how much progress has been made?\nG.T. tried to pose this question to one of the Brassbolts brothers but they were surprisingly reluctant to speak. Instead, young Fizzwuzz spoke up again:\n\"Well. We've come a long way from mechanostriders that's for sure!\" he laughs, \"There's still a lot of work to do but we feel that greats strides have been taken and we are close to a breakthrough.\"\nHe took this opportunity to give G.T. a sneak peak at the marvelous progression away from the mechanostrider which was the Gnomish racer.\n\"Sure, it looks like a water tower crossed with a zeppelin,\" he said with a nervous smile, \"but it has major changes to its basic structure which are going to make it much better.\"\n\"The stripe will make it go faster!\"\nFor the time being, it seems that Goblin technology has little to fear from the Gnomes."}

Engineering is like a religion here. Practitioners of the art come from all over the world to consult with the Master Engineers and to show their work. But here you will not find the abomination to the art that is gnomish engineering: oh no! The Gadgetzan goblins are masters of their own brand of engineering.\nGadgetzan Time's Nipskee Fizzwidget had a chat with Master Goblin Engineer Nuxt Sparklespring, who outlined the differences between the two forms of engineering.\n\"Those gnomes call themselves engineers, but they do not know the true secrets!\" Nuxt said, as he seated himself in our offices. Clearly, this is a matter that he feels passionate about. \"They waste so much time messing about with their ridiculous gadgets, which hardly ever work and always have unforeseen malfunctions, that they do not see the real potential of engineering!\"\nAnd what is the real potential of engineering? Nuxt has an immediate answer: \"explosions of course!\" he says waving his hands about, \"the bigger, the better! It's all about explosions, baby!\"\nWhen asked if he would be interested in giving a demonstration, he was only too happy to oblige, and headed to his testing yard. All around the small yard were soot and scorch marks of previous experiments.\n\"We are always looking for bigger and better ways to blow stuff up,\" says Nuxt, as he shows us around. He is clearly in his element as he sets up a number of target dummies at the end of his testing yard. Already he is rubbing his hands together gleefully at the thought of more explosions. \"As the war around us continues and we are surrounded by pirates, trolls, and other enemies, we need to be ready to blow them all into little pieces.\"\nThe first demonstration is of a simple stick of dynamite. Nuxt explains. \"Dynamite is the foundation of explosive engineering. You only need some blasting powder and a bit of cloth and you have a powerful weapon. You just light the fuse and throw.\" He demonstrates and one of the target dummies is blown into pieces. Nuxt cackles gleefully.\n\"Dynamite throwing is a complex art though, restricted to those of us with an understanding of how it works. For laymen like you though, you want to try EZ-Thro Dynamite.\" He passes me a large stick of dynamite. There is a label on it which reads 'The dynamite for non-engineers that nearly always gets to the target!'\n\"Now, dynamite is very useful when you are in a fight already, or perhaps you want to start one, and the target is in throwing range. But what about if you have time to prepare? Supposing you knew an enemy was approaching and wanted to blow it up before it sees you?\" He takes out a small mechanical squirrel and winds it up, then places it on the ground. \"Imagine this is a pirate or a bandit and it's coming to get you. Now, you could throw dynamite, it is true, but it is much better to use a landmine!\"\nHe lays a device on the ground in front of the squirrel, and then activates it. Nuxt explains, \"a land mine will sit there doing nothing until someone is unfortunate enough to step onto it. At that point it will make a huge explosion and blow the target into smithereens!\"\nWe watch with bated breath as the mechanical squirrel edges its way towards the landmine. The suspense is palpable. And then it happens. There is a click and a pause, and then an explosion. Pieces of the squirrel rain onto the ground and Nuxt bursts out laughing, \"neat, huh?\"\nThe final part of the demonstration involves camouflage. Once again, Nuxt provides an explanation. \"A real art to using explosives is of course to blow up the target before it even knows that you are there. That's where camouflage comes in!\"\nThere is a baa-ing noise from behind me and a small sheep wanders over. \"Watch this,\" says Nuxt, winking conspiratorially. The sheep ambles its way over to the target dummies, sniffs at the ground, and then blows up. A part of the wall to the yard collapses from the explosion. \"Oops,\" says Nuxt. \"Time to apologize to the neighbors again, hehe!\"\nWe head back inside to wash off the soot and embers from the explosions. Nuxt explains how a budding explosion enthusiast can become trained as a goblin engineer.\n\"Well, first you gotta learn the basics. Begin making some small dynamite, also a few of those infernal gnomish gadgets. Once you have learned enough to be ready to train as an artisan engineer, then we may admit you to our order. That is provided that you pass our extensive and dangerous tests, of course!\"\nNuxt explains that his boss, &lt;a href=\"Nixx%20Sprocketspring\"&gt;Nixx Sprocketspring&lt;/a&gt;, is responsible for assisting and testing engineers who want to follow the goblin path. \"Not all make it,\" he admits. \"Some blow themselves up before they earn their goblin engineering membership card. But it's a dangerous business, baby!\"\nSadly at that point Nuxt could not comment further, as he was called away to answer questions from the bruisers about the exploded wall."}

I am &lt;a href=\"Jetsett%20Spannerwork\"&gt;Jetsett&lt;/a&gt;, the travel goblin, and I am going to take YOU, the readers on a lavish tour of Azeroth and the greatest wonders of our world.\nWe start our world tour in Silithus. This desert of shifting sands can be found at the far south of the continent of Kalimdor, and is easily reachable. Just speak to your local wind rider or gryphon master for flight prices.\nThe scenery here is outstanding as the ruined towers play host to thousands of wondrous insects. Don't get too close though. The local wildlife bites! Far to the south the great landmark walls and gates of Ahn'Qiraj are worth a visit for any discerning tourist.\nAccommodation is rustic and basic. The only inn can be found at Cenarion Hold, and is operated by the local Cenarion Circle members. The locals around the Cenarion Hold are friendly to all-comers and may even have a few tasks for anyone looking for work. However, be cautious of the local branch of the Twilight Cult, which does not take so kindly to newcomers.\nTo summarize, Silithus is an interesting destination for any adventurer keen to get off the beaten track and away from the cities. However be wary of the hostile wildlife and natives and take copious amounts of bug spray.\nNext time: Jetsett's Guide to Azeroth continues with the Searing Gorge."}

Chronicling his voyages, he lets Gadgetzan Times' readers know what's hot where he's been.\nGreetings friends! Welcome back to my tour of Azeroth. This month I have been visiting the delights of the Searing Gorge.\nThe Searing Gorge is considered to be a dangerous place by many standards. Found in the Eastern Kingdoms, in the shadow of the towering Blackrock Mountain, this is an ash-covered, unusual landscape packed with ridges, gorges and lava-flow.\nThorium Point.\nThe Dark Iron dwarves have set up a stronghold here, which can make travel through the region somewhat perilous. Nonetheless, there is much to be seen here, making a visit a must for the discerning traveler.\nA tour could start with a visit to the Thorium Point, a small friendly outpost on the edge of the ridges. Here the Thorium Brotherhood dwarves can provide tourists with a colorful rendition of local history. They may also be able to provide you with a sample of the local cuisine, consisting mostly of barbecued spider parts. Accommodation is basic but cheap. The dwarves are not ones for luxury, preferring instead a more simplistic mode of living.\nThe Cauldron.\nThere are a number of tourist hot-spots in the region. A visit to peer over the sides of the gorge known as the Cauldron, to see the dwarves hard at work far below, is a memorable experience. The very brave may even venture down for a closer look at the caverns and quarries.\nAnd of course no visit would be complete without a chance to stand at the bottom of Blackrock Mountain and gaze up at this monstrous peak towering far above you. Brave tourists may even venture inside through the giant gates to gaze upon the swirling lava of the Molten Span.\nTo summarize, the Searing Gorge is an interesting but dangerous destination for the world traveler, but the sights make the risks worthwhile. This location is not recommended for any tourists unable to take the heat.\nNext time: Jetsett's Guide to Azeroth continues with Mulgore"}

I am a gnome engineer living in Ironforge.\nI must totally contradict the statement that \"goblin engineering is the only true form of engineering.\" There is only one true form of engineering, it is true, but everybody knows that the only true form of engineering is gnomish engineering! Any fool can make things blow up. Designing and creating the gizmos and gadgets that we gnomes are famous for, takes true skill.\nAs for Gadgetzan being the center of the engineering world, I'm afraid I must refute this statement as being complete claptrap! The beautiful city of Gnomeregan has always been the center of the engineering world, and always will be! Well... perhaps when we have reclaimed it. This project is taking more time than was originally anticipated, but someday we will succeed and we will return to our glorious city! Oh yes!\nBut I digress. Sir, I feel obliged to ask you to not print such rubbish about engineering in the future, and to give ample column space in the future to the only true form of engineering: gnomish!\nYours in faith,\n\"Master Fingle Pixelbeans\"\nIronforge."}

The mage, exhausted from the effort, smiles happily with a sense of achievement, then sits down to eat his newly conjured sandwich.\nSarah's Dinner.\nWith all the focus on the raw channeling powers of the magic users of Azeroth we decided it was time to have a look at the other side of the magic world.

I spent weeks,\" she continued, \"finding the best ingredients and researching the best recipes in order to give them a meal to remember. On the special day, I was in the kitchen for 16 hours balancing everything perfectly and, only when I was certain that the meal would dance on their palettes, did I allow it to be served.\"\nThere is a moment of hesitation from the chef and Ginger McGrubbins told us that this is not an easy subject for Sarah to discuss. We waited patiently for her to gather her wits and continue her story.\n\"Everything was fine at first, the guests were eager with anticipation at the aromas which I had created and, after everyone had received their servings, our master invited them all to 'tuck in.' That is when it happened.\"\nShe paused briefly, taking a deep breath, before providing us with the conclusion to the tale.\n\"Without even having tasted the food placed in front of him, our master clicks his fingers and conjures a muffin!\"\nWe then questioned a visibly shaken Sarah as to the significance of this and she gives a venomous reply,\n\"He claims it was to add 'variety' to the meal. All my hard work and he conjures a muffin! To add variety! If I had my way there would have been no muffins within a hundred miles of that feast!\"\nLife Among The Magi.\nWith that she stormed off, clearly distressed by the lack of understanding amongst the attendants at the interview.\nAfter stifling a giggle, Ginger explains:\n\"It's difficult for non-magic users, like Sarah and I, to work in an environment which relies so heavily on the stuff. I was originally employed as a cleaner but after I swept two types of magic dust into the same bucket I was moved to gardening. Honestly, you'd think they had never seen a bucket cast chain lightning in a desperate bid to return to freedom in the forest!\n\"The gardens weren't much safer,\" she added. \"We found ourselves fighting off creeping vines and the occasional butterfly that had gotten too close to one of the masters' experiments\"\n\"All in all it's a hard life.\" She reflects \"I've seen my fair share of mishaps and it can be difficult making a living when the normal household tasks can be performed by others with a click of the fingers but, I'll tell you this, I wouldn't swap it for anything.\""}

Gathering water, or making devices to improve their water-collecting methods, dominate the GWC lives. They had thought of everything: deeper wells, methods to make it rain, condensation devices, plans to draw the salt out of seawater, even an insanely long pipe running all the way to the closest spring in Thousand Needles. \nThe GWC has problems with the &lt;a href=\"Wastewander%20Bandits\"&gt;Wastewander Bandits&lt;/a&gt;, who attack their wells around Tanaris, and with the &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Pirates\"&gt;Southsea Pirates&lt;/a&gt;, as if it weren't for them, the GWC could ship in supplies from Steamwheedle \u2014 but the pirates intercept most shipping these days, so until they're dealt with, things will stay as they are."}

They did not arrive with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; and have apparently lived in Northrend since long before the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;; Alliance forces refer to them as \"locals\" and as a distinct people. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, many of them were were absorbed into the &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; organization which transformed its members into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trapper%20Jethan\"&gt;Trapper Jethan&lt;/a&gt; traveled south to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wildervar\"&gt;Fort Wildervar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; to trade meat and fur with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; forces there. Jethan also recommended &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to visit his people's outpost in the Grizzly Hills when they headed north.\nAt some point before the war, the deceased &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; was resurrected by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and sent to &lt;a href=\"Solstice%20Village\"&gt;Solstice Village&lt;/a&gt;, where he created a &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt; to convert the trappers into worgen. According to &lt;a href=\"Anatoly\"&gt;Anatoly&lt;/a&gt;, the trappers joined the cult because they believed that everyone would inevitably come to serve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and that it was better to do so as a worgen than by becoming an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. The inhabitants of the town of &lt;a href=\"Silverbrook\"&gt;Silverbrook&lt;/a&gt; were initially reluctant to embrace the cult, but sympathizers gradually sprung up among the residents. The trapper &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20%28Grizzly%20Hills%29\"&gt;Mikhail&lt;/a&gt; was unsettled by this and sent his daughters &lt;a href=\"Sasha\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anya\"&gt;Anya&lt;/a&gt; away from town while he attempted to reason with the other villagers, but the cultists responded by killing him. The miners at &lt;a href=\"Hollowstone%20Mine\"&gt;Hollowstone Mine&lt;/a&gt; also refused to join the cult. In response, Arugal made an example out of them by transforming them into undead. Another trapper, &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Glass\"&gt;Hugh Glass&lt;/a&gt;, managed to escape from the worgen to the &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;Redwood Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; but seemingly lost his mind in the process.\nShortly after arriving in the hills, the Alliance troops at &lt;a href=\"Amberpine%20Lodge\"&gt;Amberpine Lodge&lt;/a&gt; reached a deadlock with the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces from &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Hold\"&gt;Conquest Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Over several weeks, the Alliance tried to negotiate a pact with the trappers in the hopes that they would provide logistical support and agree to serve as scouts for the king's army. &lt;a href=\"Envoy%20Ducal\"&gt;Envoy Ducal&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Silverbrook as part of the negotiations. The Horde sent forces to attack the trappers with the intent of killing them before they could join the Alliance, including by launching an attack on Silverbrook. The trappers eventually agreed to give the Alliance the combat edge they needed if they returned &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Chest\"&gt;a relic&lt;/a&gt; stolen by the Horde. Adventurers successfully delivered the relic and traveled to Silverbrook, where they helped defend the town from the Horde's marauders. However, thanks to Mikhail's daughter Sasha and a &lt;a href=\"Caged%20Prisoner\"&gt;captured Alliance scout&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurers discovered Silverbrook's allegiance to the Wolfcult, thereby starting off a conflict between the Alliance and the worgen. Ultimately, the Wolfcult was defeated when adventurers joined forces with Sasha and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Arugal\"&gt;Shade of Arugal&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmoon Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, years later, Sasha joined the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; brothers visited the Grizzly Hills and reported that Silverbrook is still active and populated by trappers. &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; wrote that he did not care if the Horde wiped the village out, harboring disdain for their previous betrayal against the Alliance. When the Bronzebeards stopped by &lt;a href=\"Solstice%20Village\"&gt;Solstice Village&lt;/a&gt;, the village's trappers gave them a \"sharply unfriendly greeting\", signaling that they retained their old isolationist personality. Muradin speculated that the village may come into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Oneqwah\"&gt;Camp Oneqwah&lt;/a&gt; at some point, a conflict he'd place money on the taunka winning. Arugal's Wolfcult still lingers in the Grizzly Hills, but it's unknown if the trappers at large still hold loyalty to it.\nCulture.\nThe trappers are a hardy people closely familiar with the lay of the land. &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; characterized them as \"isolationists and cranks\". It is apparently common for trappers to make trophies of their kills, including the offspring of the killed animal. They keep &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s and according to &lt;a href=\"Katja\"&gt;Katja&lt;/a&gt;, they also engage in farming (though no crops are actually seen in-game). Trappers speak a variant of &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir culture seems to revolve entirely around hunting, and their settlements use a unique construction style with large amounts of wood and fur. Many trapper buildings are decorated with snowshoes, &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; hides, and skulls from &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s and other creatures. &lt;a href=\"Graveyard\"&gt;Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;s found throughout Grizzly Hills feature grave markers adorned with bear traps.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Sergei\"&gt;Sergei&lt;/a&gt;, an inhabitant of Silverbrook is not considered a real hunter unless they prove their courage by wearing their prey's skin. However, according to &lt;a href=\"Sasha\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt;, this test is actually an initiation rite for the Wolfcult.\nAfter the trappers of Silverbrook were revealed to actually be worgen, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Dumont\"&gt;Lieutenant Dumont&lt;/a&gt; referred to them derisively as \"savages\".\nSpeculation.\nThe , the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;History of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; entry &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20and%20the%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Icecrown and the Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and the online article &lt;a href=\"The%20Undead%20Plague\"&gt;The Undead Plague&lt;/a&gt; all state that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; to subjugate every human inhabitant of Northrend prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. This may mean that the trappers only arrived to the Grizzly Hills after this point. Alternatively, since this detail is only mentioned in sources that predate \"\", it may have been &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned to have only been most or some Northrend humans."}

Players usually don't like trash mobs since they are viewed as a tedious and time-consuming preamble to boss fights. Nonetheless, trash mobs in instances usually give &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; and have some useful drops, frequently some crafting material which cannot be obtained otherwise.\nTrash mobs comprise the non-boss denizens of any &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;, and thus the vast majority of instance inhabitants. They provide additional loot, an opportunity for groups to warm up, and add flavour and tension to what would otherwise be almost entirely empty instances. &lt;a href=\"Patrol\"&gt;Patrol&lt;/a&gt;s are trash mobs that perform the additional function of keeping players on their toes, thanks to the chance of them attacking players unawares, or forcing them into a larger confrontation than they were prepared for.\nDespite the dull title, trash mobs frequently feature specific mechanics, with melee and ranged types, dedicated healer mobs, and mobs with dangerous abilities or safeguards that require specific (albeit usually minor) strategies to defeat. The selection of trash mobs usually changes over the course of an instance, with grunt-level trash just inside the portal, and more impressive examples as players near the final boss. For example, the upper levels of an instance may feature mortal trash mobs, slowly changing to more demonic forms as the players progress, with demons taking over guard duties entirely at the deepest levels. Trash mobs sometimes rise almost to the level of mini-bosses, with a single mob occupying the group for a short while.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"trash mob\" derives from the term \"yard trash\" which was coined in the late 1990s &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt; \"Everquest\". In that game, a low-level dungeon, Unrest, was composed of a house which contained several bosses, surrounded by a front, side, and backyard. In the yards, there were yard trash. Lower level players shouted for groups to kill yard trash for experience either before they were high-leveled enough to kill the bosses or when all the bosses were camped."}

During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he came to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and requested the aid of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the protection of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary weapon of the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; sealed in his &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt;. However, although they managed to secure the artifact, all members of the Tyrs Guard were killed by abominations of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; during the battle, leaving only Travard as the last member of the organization.\nLater, the old paladin discovered that Tyr's tomb had not been completely collapsed, and decided to watch over it alone for several years. When a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; ventured in the tomb to find the memories of Tyr, Travard had been kicked out some time ago by the security systems and decided to help them in their quest. When the tomb definitely collapsed, he followed them to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where he devoted himself to the cause of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to revive Tyr. Using &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; as their new base of operations, Travard and Koranos recruited new members across the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to restore the Tyr's Guard, and together, they began their quest to retrieve the disk containing the keeper's memories.\nHistory.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and the decimation of the Tyr's Guard by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, only a few brave members led by Travard remained to uphold their ancient vows.\nLegion.\nDecades later, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Travard and &lt;a href=\"Efrina\"&gt;Efrina&lt;/a&gt; went to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to seek help, but with the ongoing invasion, no one wanted to come to their aid, and the old paladin hoped that the remnants of their order would be enough to carry out their duty. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; was sent by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; to find Travard in the city, and to bring him at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to help his organization. At some point, Travard and his order came to meet the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and claimed to know the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;. The old paladin explained that they are the protectors of &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, and that recent intrusions have revealed the secret position of the tomb, endangering the ancient weapon.\nWhile he prepared a strike force for the tomb, Travard sent the hero paladin to &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in order to find his brother &lt;a href=\"Galford\"&gt;Galford&lt;/a&gt;, as the latter journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious artifact that would allow them to pass the wards protecting the warhammer. However, the latter died during his quest at the hand of the mad &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt;, and Travard learned with sadness of his brother's death when the champion returned with the Spark of Tyr.\nAs too many knew about the location of the tomb, Travard stated that it was necessary to close it forever, but only after they recovered the hammer. With the help of Tyrosus, the old paladin gathered the members of the Tyr's Guard and departed with troops of the Argent Crusade to the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Forest\"&gt;Whispering Forest&lt;/a&gt;. When the hero paladin arrived at &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, Travard and his paladins had just finished eliminating the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; at their camp, although there had been &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Paladin\"&gt;casualties&lt;/a&gt; during the battle. When they entered the tomb, they discovered abominations of the void and had to eliminate them before Travard could begin the ritual to claim the hammer. However, the ritual could not be performed as one of the Sparks of Tyr was stolen and taken into the depths of the tomb. During their descent towards the &lt;a href=\"Grave-Prison%20of%20Zakajz\"&gt;Grave-Prison of Zakajz&lt;/a&gt;, the Tyr's Guard eliminated many void creatures, until they encountered the &lt;a href=\"Horrific%20Aberration\"&gt;Horrific Aberration&lt;/a&gt; who killed Efrina and her brother &lt;a href=\"Duvall\"&gt;Duvall&lt;/a&gt;. After they slew the monster, Travard resumed the ritual while his allies protected him from &lt;a href=\"Mordoth%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Mordoth the Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, and once the hero paladin was in possession of The Silver Hand, everyone fled from the tomb which began to crumble.\nAs the only remaining member of the Tyr's Guard, Travard explained that Tyr's body and its secrets, as well as the prison of &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, were now buried and protected under tons of stones and water. He then announced that the champion of the Light was in his opinion the most worthy person to carry and protect the legendary artifact, and that they would soon meet again.\nFollowing the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, with his assistance, the Head archivist &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Elda\"&gt;Sister Elda&lt;/a&gt; recorded the writings of the Tyr's Guard in the &lt;a href=\"Libram%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Libram of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nA few years later, the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; was revealed to have not fully collapsed. A &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; ventured to the tomb to find memories of Tyr, where they found Travard frustratedly locked out. After questioning him, he explained that after his order was decimated and the artifacts within the tomb secured; Travard found the tomb had not fully collapsed. He endeavored instead to remain, standing vigil over it as the last remaining Tyr's Guard, until the defenses locked him out. If the hero is the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the Silver Hand, he greeted them amicably and asked them to keep close &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, as it may yield power once again.\nTravard aided the hero and Koranos with activating the various mechanisms in the tomb, hoping that they contained enough memories to activate the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt; in order to revive Tyr's new body. Travard defended the group in the main chamber before leading them to the &lt;a href=\"Darkwalk\"&gt;Darkwalk&lt;/a&gt;; where he guided them to a second console after the first short-circuit. The hero activated the console with the Silver Scale, showing the three of them Tyr's last stand against &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;. Travard commented on various elements of the battle, such as &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;' exile to the south at &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;; speaking on the matter with Koranos. He also made a short commentary when Tyr faced an image of &lt;a href=\"Mordoth%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Mordoth the Hunter&lt;/a&gt;; realizing now that the creature that eliminated his brethren was hunting for Tyr.\nAfter witnessing Tyr's sacrifice, Travard told Koranos and the hero that his faith had been renewed and returned to &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; with them, while the Tomb of Tyr collapsed once more, this time definitively. In &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;, he was present when the Silver Scale was presented before Tyr. He then stated his new mission, as the last of the Tyr's Guard, was to aid the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; in restoring the legendary &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;. He stated he would gather elements of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to aid in guarding over Tyr and helping to restore him. He also claimed that, if Tyr was awakened, he would aid him in his mission.\nFury Incarnate.\nAs he had faith Tyr would need him again soon, Travard made the hard decision to leave the past behind and reforge Tyr's Guard. If Tyr was to walk the world again, the Tyr's Guard would be his vanguard and his servants, following his values and carrying his will. He and &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; later met a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to find worthy recruits. However, while the Silver Hand envoy gave them the names of a few of their paladins, none of them were what they were looking for. As a result, they ended up seeking out four paladins he felt fit the virtues he was after. These came in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20prelates\"&gt;Zandalari prelate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nolaki\"&gt;Nolaki&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Talthis\"&gt;Talthis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hadwin\"&gt;Hadwin&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Valunei\"&gt;Valunei&lt;/a&gt;. From their camp near &lt;a href=\"Brackenhide%20Hollow\"&gt;Brackenhide Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, which served as their training grounds, Travard began their rigorous formation and taught them the story of the legendary keeper.\nIn order to triangulate the location of Tyr's disc, &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; asked Travard and the Tyr's Guard to help the adventurer deliver three beacons to three different places in the &lt;a href=\"timeway\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt;s. Before they began their quest, Travard announced that his recruits were now ready for their last assignments to become full-fledged members of the Tyr's Guard. After each new recruit received their equipment, all of them were sent to fight against the &lt;a href=\"decay\"&gt;decay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and their corruption around &lt;a href=\"Brackenhide%20Hollow\"&gt;Brackenhide Hollow&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the adventurer. Once they all successfully complete their trials, Travard organized the Tyr's Guard initiation ceremony on the steps of &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;. Bathed in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, their tabards changed to a brilliant gold and white, signifying the Guard's reformation.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; announced that they had determined where the paladins needed to place the beacons, three groups were sent to place them in the timelines. On their side, Travard and the adventurer traveled at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Order\"&gt;Temple of Order&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;, where they fought the minions of &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;. While they were successful, Talthis and Valunei did not return from their mission in &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, Travard led the Tyr's Guard to help them, and discovered that Valunei had fallen prey to a &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; who took the appearance of her former master, &lt;a href=\"Iriska\"&gt;Iriska&lt;/a&gt;. Once the abomination was killed, the paladins guarded the last beacon until the signal was operational.\nAlthough they were successful, Travard was worried for his recruits after such an experience, and for himself because of the weight of his responsibilities. The old paladin asked the adventurer to speak with each member of them to ensure that they were doing well. Once assured everyone was ready to continue their duty, &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; announced that Tyr's disc was in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; was in its possession. However, Travard ordered his subordinates to rest, and announced that he and Koranos set up their headquarters in Tyrhold, where they would continue to train and prepare for their future incursion into &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWelcome, &lt;name&gt;. Now that you're here at the Tyr's Guard training grounds, meet my recruits: &lt;a href=\"Nolaki\"&gt;Nolaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hadwin\"&gt;Hadwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valunei\"&gt;Valunei&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Talthis\"&gt;Talthis&lt;/a&gt;. \nBy the end of their training, they will be full members of the Tyr's Guard and ready to assist with our mission to restore Tyr."}

If you want or need a travel route added to this table, please put your request in the .\n Some material in this guide is outdated. See the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20travel%20guide\"&gt;Cataclysm travel guide&lt;/a&gt; for up-to-date information about traveling post-\"Cataclysm\".\nHelp from other players.\nIf you are a low &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; character and wish to travel somewhere but the way is too dangerous, a good option is to have a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28spell%29\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; you to the capital cities of your faction. Alternatively, a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; can use &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;Ritual of Summoning&lt;/a&gt; with two other players to get you almost anywhere. Either method should get you closer to where you want to go.\nThe faction city portals were removed from Shattrath and Dalaran with the Cataclysm. See the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20travel%20guide\"&gt;Cataclysm travel guide&lt;/a&gt; and living without portal hubs for some suggestions. \nMost players will need to use traditional methods of travel to reach destinations in the Old World, such as boats and zeppelins. See the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20travel%20guide\"&gt;Cataclysm travel guide&lt;/a&gt; and living without portal hubs for some suggestions. \n&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; mages get the portals to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; at level 40, and &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; at level 50. \n&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; mages get the portals to &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; at level 40, and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; at level 50.\nAll mages can learn the &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; portal spell at level 65 and the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; portal spell at level 74.\nAll warlocks can learn &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;Ritual of Summoning&lt;/a&gt; at level 42. \nYou should be prepared to give the mage some coin. It is generally considered common courtesy to include a tip for the mage's trouble. As with all player characters, mages vary in temperament and helpfulness, although 2-3 gold is usually sufficient to buy a portal from any mage. Warlocks need two-party members present (\"with\" the Warlock), to perform a &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;summons&lt;/a&gt; so they don't commonly perform one unless you are already in their party or in their guild.\nOf course, these methods can cost money and if you are not hiking you will not pick up flight path points. Still, the above options the fastest ways if you simply want to reach Stormwind as a level 6 night elf just because all your friends are one of the three other races and you want to level with them.\nInns and the Hearthstone.\nWhen each player starts a new character, they automatically receive a &lt;a href=\"hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory that can be used for instant travel back to whatever &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; it is bound to. Binding at an inn involves speaking to the &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; and selecting the \"Make this inn my home\" option. The hearthstone can only be used once every 30 minutes, though &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; have a &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; (called &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Recall\"&gt;Astral Recall&lt;/a&gt;) with the same effect, but with a much shorter timer (15 min). Shamans don't get it until level 30. If you accidentally delete your hearthstone, don't panic. Simply speak with an innkeeper, make that inn your new home and you will receive a new hearthstone.\nWyverns, gryphons, bats, dragonhawks and hippogryphs.\nOne of the most common forms of transportation in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" is flying. Gryphons and hippogryphs provide this for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, while Wyverns, Dragonhawks and Bats are aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Many settlements have a &lt;a href=\"flight%20point\"&gt;flight point&lt;/a&gt;, with an NPC who will allow you to travel to various connected points for a fee. Before you can use a flight path you must travel to it on foot and \"learn\" the path by clicking on the flight path &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; who will have a green ! above their heads. (There are a few exceptions: All characters start with the flight point of their racial capital. &lt;a href=\"Death%20knights\"&gt;Death knights&lt;/a&gt; automatically know every flight point in Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. Some &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; flight points are learned automatically or through quests.) Flight paths are fixed; you cannot control the creature you are on, so sit back and enjoy the view.\nWhile in flight, you cannot perform any skills (except for activating certain auras), but you can tinker with &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; functions, set up your &lt;a href=\"action%20bar\"&gt;action bar&lt;/a&gt;, equip &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chat\"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;, and adjust your game configuration settings. This is an excellent time to change your video settings, especially if your computer is slow to change them. (The color-depth settings are reset to default each time you load the game.)\nZeppelins and boats.\nTravel between the two continents and to locations more remote than are accessible via flight path is done via large Zeppelins, Boats, or similar. These cost nothing to use and operate on a fairly rapid schedule. They are also a relatively safe way to travel, for those with the correct faction alignment, as they usually have guards stationed at the stops. Anyone can use any of these travel options, but the guards will try to kill you if you are not liked by their faction, of course.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has zeppelin services, operated by the goblins, between &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;); Orgrimmar and &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;); Undercity and Grom'gol Base Camp; Undercity and &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Landing\"&gt;Vengeance Landing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;) ; and Orgrimmar and &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;) .\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has boat routes that provide service between &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;), on a purple/blue boat from the west dock, and &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;) ; &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, on The Bravery, from the south dock, and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;), from the southwest dock; &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Coast\"&gt;Forgotten Coast&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;) ; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;) .\nThe &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s run a neutral (all players start neutral to &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;) boat service between &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; run neutral boat services between &lt;a href=\"Moa%27ki%20Harbor\"&gt;Moa'ki Harbor&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Unu%27pe\"&gt;Unu'pe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;) and between Moa'ki Harbor and &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;).\nFor more details see: &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin\"&gt;Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boat&lt;/a&gt;\nPersonal travel.\nCertain classes, such as &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, have different means of personal travel which help them get places faster. The &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; also allows use of four trinkets that allow personal teleportation to either &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt; if you took Goblin Engineering specialization or &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toshley%27s%20Station\"&gt;Toshley's Station&lt;/a&gt; if you took up gnomish specialization.\nAt level 20, all classes can purchase &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s. These aren't overly expensive, costing only for training and for the mount, and can be reduced in price by gaining higher &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with your faction (up to 20% discount), and provide a faster means of transportation than traveling everywhere by foot. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s get mounts and apprentice riding training for at level 20, after speaking to their class &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt level 40, all classes can upgrade to &lt;a href=\"Mounts%23Epic_ground_mounts\"&gt;epic mounts&lt;/a&gt;. These mounts are more expensive ( for training and for the mount), but provide a greater speed increase than does a normal mount\u2014which becomes quite useful when traversing the larger zones intended for level 40+ characters. Again, &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warlocks\"&gt;Warlocks&lt;/a&gt; get special mounts. Prior to patch 3.0.3, these mounts all required completion of long and costly questlines. Now, the quest is a &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warlocks\"&gt;Warlocks&lt;/a&gt; may now train their epic mounts at 40, provided they have already picked up the Journeyman &lt;a href=\"Riding\"&gt;Riding&lt;/a&gt; skill. For &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s , a &lt;a href=\"Deathcharger\"&gt;Deathcharger&lt;/a&gt; is automatically received for free after completing [55] &lt;a href=\"Into%20the%20Realm%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Into the Realm of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. You may buy the mounts of another allied race (IE a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; purchasing human &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; mounts) if you are of exalted rank with that race's home city. You cannot buy mounts of the opposite faction, though some generically available mounts do resemble racial mounts, such as the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Razzashi%20Raptor\"&gt;Swift Razzashi Raptor&lt;/a&gt;, which resembles &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; Raptors.\nAlso at level 40, you may purchase black-colored PVP variant of racial mounts for 50,000 &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt;, which you receive by competing in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat. You must still pay for the riding training. You may purchase mounts of the same faction but different race, even if you are not exalted (i.e, a Draenei can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Black%20War%20Steed%20Bridle\"&gt;Black War Horse&lt;/a&gt; even if he or she is not exalted with &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.) You can never gain Black PVP variants of the other faction's mounts. \n At level 60, all classes can purchase &lt;a href=\"Mounts%23Flying_mounts\"&gt;flying mounts&lt;/a&gt; for use only in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Basic flying mounts ( for training, for the mount) are the same speed on the ground as regular (level 20) mounts, and fly at 150% speed. Epic flying mounts are also available; they're much more expensive ( for training, for the mount), but also much faster (same speed on land as an epic mount and +280% speed in the air). To fly in Northrend, players must also reach level 77 and train &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Weather%20Flying\"&gt;Cold Weather Flying&lt;/a&gt; for . There are certain mounts that fly even faster, +310% speed, but these still require spending on training and are exceedingly hard to obtain.\nThere are no special mounts for &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warlocks\"&gt;Warlocks&lt;/a&gt; in Outland. &lt;a href=\"Druids\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt; can learn a &lt;a href=\"flight%20form\"&gt;flight form&lt;/a&gt; from their class &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; at level 60. At level 70, &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Flight%20Form\"&gt;Swift Flight Form&lt;/a&gt; becomes available through a long but fun questline once you have paid the for the artisan riding skill. Since patch 3.0.3, druids can also obtain Swift Flight Form from their trainers at level 71, but the quest is still available to get it one level earlier and counts as a &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Deeprun Tram.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; provides free transportation between &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The entrances to the tram are found in the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20District\"&gt;Dwarven District&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind and in &lt;a href=\"Tinkertown\"&gt;Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt; in Ironforge. There are 2 Trams and each of them will need 2 min to get to Ironforge (from Stormwind) and back, meaning that one has to wait 1 min at maximum.\nIt is also the only safe way to travel between Stormwind and Ironforge for low-level characters the first time as you cannot use flight paths until they are discovered. The areas between the two cities are for much higher-level characters.\nPortals.\nThere are a few cities that provide free portal travel between major cities. In the eastern room off of the courtyard in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, there is a portal that leads to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, which leads players to the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Silvermoon%20City%29\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. This is the only portal that can be used to go both ways (Undercity \u2192 Silvermoon City, Silvermoon City \u2192 Undercity). As the portal is &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-aligned, it cannot be used by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; characters because it would trivialize raiding of Silvermoon City.\nEvery capital city has a portal heading to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; right by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which is useful for level 58 characters ready to head to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the faction camps just beyond the portal there are portals to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. You can use this combo to save &lt;a href=\"hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;'s cooldown.\n Prior to \"Cataclysm\", there were portals in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; to each faction's major cities. These portals were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;. However, in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1.0\"&gt;patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, two portals in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; (one to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and one to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;) were restored. To reach other destinations, players now need to use more traditional methods of travel to reach destinations in the Old World. See living without portal hubs and &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20travel%20guide\"&gt;Cataclysm travel guide&lt;/a&gt; for some suggestions."}
{"id": "63041", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=63041", "title": "Travel guide for special occasions", "text": "Lunar Festival.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt; lasts from February 5th to February 23th, approximately.\nVery simple quests associated with the Lunar Festival provide some unique travel opportunities for the duration of the festival. An &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/%3Fi%3D52679\"&gt;invitation&lt;/a&gt; to the festival (found in all but the Draenei and Blood Elf capital cities) allows the bearer to teleport to &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. The hill on which you arrive contains one circle of moonlight for each non-Burning Crusade capital city. Using the invitation within one these circles teleports you back to one of these cities (they are marked off by the races dancing around the circle). So if, for example, you teleported into Moonglade from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, once the invitation's 10 minute cooldown elapsed, you can then teleport to, say, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis opens some opportunities for reaching places that would otherwise be hard to get to, particularly for low level characters. The arduous journey from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, for example, becomes trivial. Simply use the invitation to teleport from Ironforge or Stormwind to Moonglade, then teleport from there to Darnassus. Hop the ship from there or take the free hippogryph to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Take the boat from there to the Wetlands. Similarly, low level elves can use the invitation to reach the other Alliance (excluding the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a moot point for night elves anyway) capitals easily.\nFurthermore, the Lunar Festival offers the opportunity for low-to-mid-level non-druid characters to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; non-druid flight path in Moonglade without having to die repeatedly in &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;. This will prove very handy at higher levels, as some bind-on-pickup recipes and plans are sold only by vendors in Moonglade.\nHowever, the Lunar Festival lasts only a month and takes place only once a year. Once the festival is over, it will not be active again for 11 months. Check the calendar on the World of Warcraft website for details of the dates."}

This epic action-adventure series features a young cast of \"Warcraft\" characters discovering the mysteries and majesty of the world around them. It is a story told from a different perspective when compared to other expanded universe offerings, being a more down-to-earth experience and dealing less with big bads.\nWritten by celebrated comic book author and animator Greg Weisman, the first book includes full-page illustrations and sketches created by &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard artist &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt;, along with a full-color cover illustration by Blizzard artist &lt;a href=\"Stephane%20Belin\"&gt;Stephane Belin&lt;/a&gt;. \"Traveler\" is also available in &lt;a href=\"Digital%20books\"&gt;digital form&lt;/a&gt;, and as an &lt;a href=\"audiobook\"&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; released by Scholastic Audio in November 2016, narrated by &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20de%20Ocampo\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n de Ocampo&lt;/a&gt;. The second part, ', was released in February 2018. The third and final part, ', author changed to &lt;a href=\"Madeleine%20Roux\"&gt;Madeleine Roux&lt;/a&gt;, was released in December 2019.\nDescription.\n\"It's been years since twelve-year-old Aramar Thorne, a clever boy who is never without his precious sketch book, has seen his father. So when Captain Greydon Thorne comes ashore and asks his son to join him at sea, it feels as if someone has redrawn Aram's entire world. At sea, Aram struggles to get along with the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\"'s crew - especially Second Mate &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa&lt;/a&gt;, a tough teenaged girl who has been reluctantly placed in charge of him. Just as Aram starts to get his head above water, a band of vicious pirates attack the \"Wavestrider\", turning his world upside down once again. As Aram and Makasa try to find his way home, they encounter creatures both terrible and wondrous, and Aram will seek to understand Azeroth's denizens as he draws them in his sketchbook, forming unlikely friendships along the way. But the journey is hindered by Greydon's compass, which never points north. If the compass isn't leading Aram and Makasa home--to safety--to what destiny is it leading them?\"\nTimeline.\nTraveler doesn't offer a concrete date of the events with relation to the overall timeline, but there are several references throughout the books that refer to the overall world's setting. What is concrete is that the main storyline happens during a late summer nearing autumn. Below is the list of the references with potential explanations.\nThe story should take place in the summer of Year 28 or 29, during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" instead of \"Mists of Pandaria\", but the timeline inconsistency with Ironpatch remains."}

He previously worked as a game designer for \"\". His first position as a game designer was as a member of the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" team, handling item design duties.\nHe announced on July 11, 2018, that he decided to start a new adventure after 13 years with Blizzard. He passed away on August 10th, 2022, at the age of 41.\nAs Indalamar.\nAs Indalamar, he was an active player during \"World of Warcraft\" beta, and was widely attributed as the cause of a series of nerfs to the warrior class. He was a member of the Nurfed guild. Some players on the Warrior forums gave him the flattering title of \"The Warrior.\" Indalamar's fame stems from a discussion on the Warrior forums during the Beta testing phase of World of Warcraft. The discussion centered around the possibility that warrior damage output was far too high. Indalamar thought it was. Many disagreed, so he filmed a video of himself farming to prove his point. Within a few hours, the discussion's thread had several pages worth of replies, and in the same day Blizzard nerfed the Fury tree for warriors, which was the tree Indalamar was mainly using. The changes made were in relation to the Bloodthirst and Slam abilities. The old version of Bloodthirst allowed a 100% critical chance with bonus damage after killing an enemy, which meant (as Indalamar showed) that a warrior could start every fight with a huge critical and proc Flurry every time. The Slam ability was also redesigned to become interruptible.\nAfter beta, Travis Day was hired on by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; to be an item developer."}

That's a good sign.\nCompletion.\nEvery trap you sprang is a life saved, be it &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;, or otherwise.

They are listed as &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s in \"World of Warcraft\".\nBackground.\nTreants are powerful ancient trees that served under &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; in ages past. Treants resemble large moving trees with faces. Over time, treants also grow to be &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;ancient protectors&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are closely affiliated with &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and are often seen accompanying powerful druids and &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt;. Many treants were driven mad during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and the destruction of the forests, as well as demonic corruption, has driven them to lash out at anyone that approaches. &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; have, on rare occasions, infused their drinks with corewood from the treants to the west of the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThe lowest level treants are found in the southern reaches of &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20Isle\"&gt;Sunstrider Isle&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Dath%27Remar\"&gt;Shrine of Dath'Remar&lt;/a&gt; all the way to the bridge. The lowest level hostile treants are the Level 9 &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Green%20Keeper\"&gt;Withered Green Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;. In past times they assisted the blood elves in gardening the Isle, but have since grown out of control. The treants of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; are also remnants of former allies of the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt;, but retaliated when the Blood Elves were forced to burn the woods surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; to prevent further intrusion by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the Withered Green Keepers, led by &lt;a href=\"Old%20Whitebark\"&gt;Old Whitebark&lt;/a&gt; have turned against their former allies an attempt to foster the regrowth of their forest. There are also treants defending &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorrupted treants can be found in &lt;a href=\"Middenvale\"&gt;Middenvale&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; and just south of the border of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, in Ashenvale. In Felwood, treants can be found in &lt;a href=\"Irontree%20Woods\"&gt;Irontree Woods&lt;/a&gt;. Many hostile corrupted treants can be found in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; in the east wing. There are a few treants that are for the most part &lt;a href=\"passive\"&gt;passive&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;.\nTechnically there are treants in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;: They were once trees, but following the explosion in &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, the magic corrupted them and they became animated. In &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; you (as an Alliance player) introduce treants into the ecosystem in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; seeks to heal lands once belonging to the treants and ancients. This quest calls for you to speed up growth of &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Seedling\"&gt;Grove Seedling&lt;/a&gt;s which, when fully grown, become &lt;a href=\"Living%20Grove%20Defender\"&gt;Living Grove Defender&lt;/a&gt;s, neutral to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and hostile to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Treants have also been spotted in &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and are both neutral and hostile.\nThird War.\nTreants assisted night elves. Some of them were corrupted.\nIn the RPG.\nThis creature looks to be a short, angry tree-man. Its branchlike arms end in three-fingered claws. Treants are small, tree-like beings. They are rarely seen in times of peace, but in days of conflict they patrol the forests and fling themselves at nature's enemies. Treants do not speak, but they understand Darnassian. Little is subtle about a treant's tactics. They charge their enemies as soon as they can, slashing with their wooden claws."}

The timed scenario runs hourly at the bottom of the hour (at xx:30).\nThe scenario has players assist researchers &lt;a href=\"Rannan%20Korren\"&gt;Rannan Korren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greta%20Herzig\"&gt;Greta Herzig&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; as they investigate a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; mining lockdown with their new &lt;a href=\"niffen\"&gt;niffen&lt;/a&gt; guides in the Zaralek Cavern.\nThe adventurer Rannan Koren, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, often heads into the fray before his colleagues are ready. His group, with the players' help, will try to lift a hostile titan lockdown of a mining operation in the &lt;a href=\"Sulfur%20Wastes\"&gt;Sulfur Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, or investigate an abandoned Zaqali Djaradin ruins in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Overflow\"&gt;Molten Overflow&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt should require many players to defeat the powerful foes that will resist Rannan and his company as they seek to complete their objectives. The area is dangerous and the time the researchers have is limited. Players will be rewarded each week based on the highest number of objectives they complete. Completing more objectives in later scenarios will garner higher item level and greater currency rewards, but helping each time will provide some compensation and a chance for more rewards.\nRewards.\nRewards vary based on how many objectives of 12 have been completed and whether it's the first or repeated clear at that completion level:\nGetting to 12/12 will require an organized raid group of at least 20 players to zerg down all of the adds and turn in all of the gatherables.\nAll containers have a chance at collectables, including a mount (&lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Shalewing%20Subject%2001\"&gt;Flaming Shalewing Subject 01&lt;/a&gt;) and a pet (&lt;a href=\"Devourer%20Lobstrok\"&gt;Devourer Lobstrok&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, they can drop gear up to Champion 1/6 (ilvl 415).\nThere's also a series of achievements:\nTitan Lockdown scenario.\nThe scenario lasts for a maximum of 25 minutes and runs for up to twelve steps.\nFive minutes before the scenario starts:\nStarting With Trouble.\nAt the ruins, Tarasek Fighters and Sundered Flame Cleavers (among others) attack using the three sets of steps to the ruins. This step can largely be soloed, though it will take a large amount of time.\nCleansing the Lockdown.\nThis step (and the next few) have a separate timer that starts counting down from roughly 7:30, regardless of the length of time left in the greater scenario. When that timer runs out, the scenario will skip ahead to &lt;a href=\"%23A%20Titanic%20Counterattack\"&gt;A Titanic Counterattack&lt;/a&gt;.\nHead southwest and defeat titan constructs and defense orbs to fill the bar.\nLockdown Mess.\nAttack the boulders covering the console and look around the area for cylinders and gears and bring them, on foot and one-at-a-time, to the big bucket.\n&lt;a href=\"Acidhide%20Krolusk\"&gt;Acidhide Krolusk&lt;/a&gt;s may pop out when interacting with parts, so be prepared to fend them off.\nHostile Investigators.\nNew packs of wildlife appear including &lt;a href=\"Acidhide%20Krolusk\"&gt;Acidhide Krolusk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Deepstrider%20Alpha\"&gt;Deepstrider Alpha&lt;/a&gt;s. Defeat them.\nCave Cracking.\nThe mouth of the cave at is full of &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Boulder\"&gt;Fallen Boulder&lt;/a&gt;s. AoE them all down and the earth elementals that spawn. Destroy 100 (over the course of several runs of the event) to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Rockin%20Research\"&gt;Rockin Research&lt;/a&gt;.\nBroken Container.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Contaminated%20Titan%20Watcher\"&gt;Contaminated Titan Watcher&lt;/a&gt; pops out of the cave. Pop cooldowns as it stacks a disease that ticks rather hard. Huezeki Windsong's healing can keep up, but only to a point.\nDefeat it to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Lockdown%20Mystery\"&gt;Lockdown Mystery&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeutralizing the Contaminant.\nMuch like the Lockdown Mess stage, bring ore chunks, on foot and one-at-a-time, to the console. Fend off the adds that spawn. Bring back 100 (over the course of many runs) to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"A%20Research%20Sampler\"&gt;A Research Sampler&lt;/a&gt;.\nAffected Wildlife.\nVarious Contaminated varieties of the nearby wildlife spawn. Pull them into the water to ensure they are counted.\nA Violent Reaction.\nAn elemental spawns in the southwest of the water, outside of the cave. Defeat it before time runs out to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Contaminant%20Cleaner\"&gt;Contaminant Cleaner&lt;/a&gt;!\nA Titanic Counterattack.\nWhen the sub-timer runs out, the scenario skips ahead to this point. Clear out more titan constructs, defense orbs, and the &lt;a href=\"Response%20Team%20Overseer\"&gt;Response Team Overseer&lt;/a&gt; that spawns:\nA Clear Sign We Are Not Wanted.\nBack to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Drekazera\"&gt;Ruins of Drekazera&lt;/a&gt; and fend off attackers from three directions at the steps.\nOne of the waves will spawn &lt;a href=\"Lietenant%20Narlena\"&gt;Lietenant Narlena&lt;/a&gt;.\nFend her off:\nLeaders to a Flame.\nReykal spawns to the southeast. Defeat him to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Nothing%20Stops%20the%20Research\"&gt;Nothing Stops the Research&lt;/a&gt;.\nZaqali Djaradin ruins scenario.\nStarting With Trouble.\nAt the ruins, Tarasek Fighters and Sundered Flame Cleavers (among others) attack using the three sets of steps to the ruins. This step can largely be soloed, though it will take a large amount of time.\nRiled Up.\nA fifteen-minute timer starts. When it runs out, the scenario will skip ahead to A Clear Sign We Are Not Wanted.\nFill the bar in the surrounding area. \nCavern Crasher.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20Flayer%20Matriarch\"&gt;Cavern Flayer Matriarch&lt;/a&gt; flies down and lands in the center of the ruins. Take her out.\nOvertaken Monuments.\nHead west to the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Overflow\"&gt;Molten Overflow&lt;/a&gt; and fill the bar by defeating wildlife in the area.\nTowering Pillars.\nPick up Djaradin Pillar Shards from the ground and run them on foot to the four pillars. Each pillar takes eight shards, and when complete, will spawn a pack of elementals.\nPowering up the Pillars.\nDefend the pack attacking Thaelin.\nMonstrous Magma Clacker.\nTake out the magmaclaw. Should players defeat it, they will be awarded the &lt;a href=\"Research%20Mishap\"&gt;Research Mishap&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nA Clear Sign We Are Not Wanted.\nWhen the 15-minute timer runs out, the scenario skips ahead to here.\nBack to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Drekazera\"&gt;Ruins of Drekazera&lt;/a&gt; and fend off attackers from three directions at the steps.\nOne of the waves will spawn &lt;a href=\"Lietenant%20Narlena\"&gt;Lietenant Narlena&lt;/a&gt;.\nFend her off:\nLeaders to a Flame.\nReykal spawns to the southeast.

He is fascinated with the history of &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, the great ancient king of the arakkoa people. Reshad's &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt; companion is &lt;a href=\"Percy\"&gt;Percy&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAt some point after his fall, he was being watched by Adherent &lt;a href=\"Ikiss\"&gt;Ikiss&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted a scroll detailing the true history of king &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;. Ikiss never got it, as he was caught by the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later, &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;Adherent Viryx&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Akraz\"&gt;Veil Akraz&lt;/a&gt; looking for the scroll. Both arakkoa drew blades but Viryx caught and squeezed Reshad's kaliri and the scholar had no other option but to hand it over. He felt like the revelation of the scroll would make a difference between the two groups of the arakkoa.\nModern day.\nAfter the opening of the , Reshad first encounters the adventurers from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skettis%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient refuge built by Terokk for outcast and unwanted arakkoa. Skettis was under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, and Reshad asked that several artifacts of Terokk--including &lt;a href=\"Ragged%20Mask\"&gt;his mask&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weathered%20Wingblades\"&gt;his blades&lt;/a&gt;--be gathered before he fled the city for &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Terokk\"&gt;Veil Terokk&lt;/a&gt;. On his way he met his friend &lt;a href=\"Ornekka\"&gt;Ornekka&lt;/a&gt;, who directed him to the town. He asked her to come with him, but she refused.\nOn the journey through the &lt;a href=\"Undergrowth\"&gt;Undergrowth&lt;/a&gt; on the way to Veil Terokk, Reshad was guided by &lt;a href=\"Syth\"&gt;Syth&lt;/a&gt;'s notes to two important artifacts of the Talon King: &lt;a href=\"The%20Saga%20of%20Terokk\"&gt;The Saga of Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, detailing his story; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;the Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, which he used to commune with the great &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt; god . At Veil Terokk, Reshad reunited with &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Arakkoa Outcasts. From there he sent the adventurers out to gather other relics scattered across the Spires of Arak, including &lt;a href=\"Worn%20Gavel\"&gt;Terokk's gavel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Bangle\"&gt;bangle&lt;/a&gt; crafted by Terokk's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lithic\"&gt;Lithic&lt;/a&gt;. With all of these artifacts, Reshad was able to use the &lt;a href=\"Effigy%20of%20Terokk\"&gt;Effigy of Terokk&lt;/a&gt; to show visions of Terokk's downfall from king to outcast.\nAlthough Iskar wanted to bring Terokk back physically, Reshad was concerned that Terokk would lead the arakkoa further into darkness and did not want to repeat the mistakes of the past. Instead, Terokk imbued an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; with his power in order to face off against .\nWhen the Ravenspeakers called upon &lt;a href=\"Ka%27alu\"&gt;Ka'alu&lt;/a&gt; at 's request, Reshad was the one who convinced her to aid the Arakkoa Outcasts in their battle against the Adherents of Rukhmar. Reshad and the adventurer flew with Ka'alu to do battle in the terraces above.\nReshad later took the adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; astride &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter the fall of Skyreach and the death of &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;High Sage Viryx&lt;/a&gt;, Reshad came to realize that the ancient arakkoa had known that having light and dark in equal measure was natural. Only together would the Outcasts and their winged cousins succeed. However, Iskar vanished and arakkoa were sent looking for him. When two guards--a cursed and a high arakkoa--returned to report no success in finding him, Reshad told them of Iskar's history. Soon after his story was finished, he learned that the scouts looking for Iskar were found dead.\nReshad and other members of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Order of the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; then headed to Tanaan Jungle to search for Iskar themselves. Reshad visited both &lt;a href=\"Vol%27mar\"&gt;Vol'mar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Lion's Watch&lt;/a&gt; to enlist the aid of adventurers in finding Iskar. They tracked the Shadow Sage down to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Kra%27nak\"&gt;Ruins of Kra'nak&lt;/a&gt;, where he was discovered to have allied with the and a faction of High Arakkoa. Reshad witnessed Iskar allying with and drinking demon blood to regain his wings, via a spell using Iskar's Tome of Shadows. Reshad condemned Iskar for this act and encouraged the adventurers to bring Iskar to justice within .\nQuotes.\n&lt;a href=\"Azik\"&gt;Azik&lt;/a&gt; sent you to me for answers, and I promise you will have them.\nBut for now, we need to escape.\nThe past has much to teach us.\nIskar wanted to bring Terokk back with a body of his own. But would the Talon King have saved us, or lead us further into darkness?\nI was not willing to repeat the mistakes of the past.\nIn you, I say a worthy steward of the Talon King's power. Ishaal agreed, and helped me to bind your essences together.\nIskar will not be happy about this, but what's done is done.\nSpeculation.\nHis status in the main timeline is unknown. He may have died during the war against the Adherents."}

{"id": "15239", "revid": "49723770", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15239", "title": "Resist", "text": "The term resist means that a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; was not, or only to a lesser extent, affected by a &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"attack\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt;. \"Full resists\" completely negate the effect and have the same effect as \"&lt;a href=\"Immune\"&gt;Immune&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Partial resists\" only reduce the damage received by a percentage; these can only occur with non-binary spells.\nThere are two sources for spell resists. Firstly, the level difference between the caster and their target determines the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20hit%23How%20spell%20hit%20chance%20is%20calculated\"&gt;spell hit chance&lt;/a&gt;. A spell which misses its target results in a full resist, whereas partial resists cannot occur. &lt;a href=\"Spell%20hit%20rating\"&gt;Spell hit rating&lt;/a&gt; decreases the chance of getting a resist due to this difference. Secondly, &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;s increase the chance to resist a spell. They can cause both full and partial resists, and can be overcome with &lt;a href=\"spell%20penetration\"&gt;spell penetration&lt;/a&gt; (and, limited to &lt;a href=\"binary%20spell\"&gt;binary spell&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit%20rating\"&gt;spell hit rating&lt;/a&gt;). A full resist due to level difference cannot be distinguished from a full resist due to resistances.\nNotes.\nResists are the magical counterpart of \"&lt;a href=\"Miss\"&gt;Miss&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Parry\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt;\". Even though the &lt;a href=\"Attribute%23Armor\"&gt;Armor attribute&lt;/a&gt; generally affects the ability to mitigate physical damage, it is not considered resistance. However, there are some border cases; for example, the Hunter's &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt; can be partially resisted, but a full resist is shown as a miss in the combat log. Some spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bolt\"&gt;Chaos Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be resisted."}

{"id": "19686", "revid": "1649708", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19686", "title": "Resistance", "text": "Resistance is a combat statistic that mitigates incoming &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; damage and effects. Magic spells from the following five &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;s can be resisted from magical resistance: &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Nature\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. There is no resistance stat for &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt;, and as such no players nor NPCs can resist Holy spells. A character's current resistance score to each school is advertised on the character sheet.\nIn &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;, resistance is highly situational and is typically only needed for certain &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; encounters. The first one of this type was &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, famous for requiring significant fire resistance on all raid members. Most recently, in \"Wrath of the Lich King\", &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; is made much easier with Frost resistance gear (although this is not necessary).\nIn &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, resistance is helpful against spellcasters, although &lt;a href=\"resilience\"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt; is generally considered to be a more useful stat when choosing between the two.\nEffective resistance and average mitigation.\nPrior to \"Cataclysm\", a target of higher level than its attacker would gain a kind of hidden, intrinsic spell resistance to all schools of magic.\nThe effective resistance rating of the target was calculated as follows:\n effective resistance rating = Rb + max((Lt - Lc) * 5, 0) - min(P, Rb)\n Rb - target base resistance (as advertised on the character sheet)\n Lt - target level\n Lc - caster level\n P - caster spell penetration\nIn PvE boss fights, the player level is usually equal to or less than the boss level, and no &lt;a href=\"spell%20penetration\"&gt;spell penetration&lt;/a&gt; is in effect. Therefore, in this situation, it's safe to assume that the player's effective resistance was the same as the base resistance (from the character sheet).\nNote that this formula renders level 83 bosses as having had 15 magical resistance against level 80 player attacks. Unlike all other magical resistance in the game, this resistance from level difference could not be overcome by spell penetration.\nThe percentage of magical damage that is mitigated on average is calculated by the following equation (note that this has changed in \"Wrath\"):\n Damage reduction percentage = 100% * effective resistance rating / ( K + effective resistance rating )\nFor level 80 mobs this constant K is 400. For level 83 boss mobs K was believed to be 510.\n\"Note\": Level-based resistance (not to be confused with level-based miss) could play a factor in total resists. For every level that a mob had over the player, there was 8 resist (believed; the exact number may have been higher) added. For boss fights, this means there was 15-24 resistance added. This extra resistance meant there would be partial resists on non-binary spells from the added resistance. However, this resistance had been shown to not apply to binary spells at all.\nBinary and non-binary resist.\nSpell resistance is the second of two rolls to determine whether or not a spell is resisted. (&lt;a href=\"Spell%20hit\"&gt;Spell hit&lt;/a&gt; is the first roll.) The spell resistance roll will calculate in one of two different ways: one way for &lt;a href=\"Binary%20Spell\"&gt;Binary Spell&lt;/a&gt;s, another way for non-Binary spells. Non-binary spells are spells which only deal damage (like &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;Shadow Bolt&lt;/a&gt;). Binary spells are spells which deal a &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; (like &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt;) or, for some other reason, must take full effect or no effect at all.\nResistance reduces the chance for the binary spell to land by a certain percentage. Spell hit will not reduce this chance. It is assumed that this percentage is exactly the damage reduction percentage given above.\nResistance increases the chance to suffer only a fraction of the spell's normal damage. In \"Burning Crusade\", the percent resisted had a chance to be 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%. The probabilities were weighted such that the average damage mitigated worked out to the same percentage as with binary spells. In \"Wrath of the Lich King\", the possible percentages of damage resisted are weighted in sections of 0%, 10%, 20%, ..., 100% averaging to the same overall damage mitigation. However, only the closest three or four sections will ever occur at a given resistance value. This allows a sufficiently high resistance to guarantee a certain resist percentage, even in the worst case. &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; spells are now considered non-binary and the partial resistance calculation is applied on each tick.\nThe probability of an x% resistance is given by the following formula (AR is the average resistance calculated above):\n P(x) = 50% - 250%*|x - AR|\nIf the probability is less than 0, it cannot occur.\nSources.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, Resistance could be obtained from &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, certain class &lt;a href=\"talents\"&gt;talents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt;s and gear.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, player resistances have been removed from all but certain legacy armor items. \nStacking.\nEach resistance can be a stack of the following:\nEffectiveness.\nThe damage absorbed per point of damage/healing/tanking stat lost now decreases as resistance is gained, similar to armor. However guaranteeing a certain resistance percentage can be valuable, especially in fights with a large spike of elemental damage.\nMagical resistances.\nThere is a roll based on \"the level of the caster and the resistance stat of the target\". As with &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, the level of the target is not a factor in this roll.\n Average Resistance = (Target's Resistance / (Caster's Level * 5)) * 0.75\nAverage resistance may be no higher than 75%. Of course, what it takes to reach 75% average resistance depends on the spellcaster's level. One quirk here is that casters below level 20 are treated as if they were level 20 for purposes of calculating the resistance scaling here. So against a spellcaster of level 20 or below, it would take a resistance stat of 100 to get 75% resistance; level 30 would take 150 resistance; level 50 would take 250; level 60 would take 300; and level 63 would take 315.\nWhy is it called \"average resistance\"? For spells that have a non-damage effect\u2014such as slow, root, stun\u2014you'll either take the hit or avoid the hit altogether; these are examples of binary spells. The average resistance is the chance you'll totally avoid the hit. Adding the word \"average\" is a little redundant in this case.\nHowever, when spells do only damage, it's not just a full hit or full miss situation. Pure damage spells can be resisted for 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, etc. (in 10% increments up to 100%) of their regular damage. Your average resistance can still be anywhere between 0% and 75%. If your average resistance is maxed out, then there's a really good chance of having 70% or 80% of the spell's damage be resisted. There's also a fairly good chance of having 100% of the spell's damage be resisted, a slightly lower chance of 50% of its damage being resisted, a small chance of only 30%, and a very small chance of even 0% of the damage being resisted. It's a weighted average. Visualize it as a bell curve around your average resistance."}

Changing to a different form (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt;) or stance will prevent additional Resolve from being gained, but will not cancel the existing stacks of Resolve.

It is illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Gerard\"&gt;Justin Gerard&lt;/a&gt;. The story tells of &lt;a href=\"Taruka%20Beastkiller\"&gt;Taruka&lt;/a&gt;, a young &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; fisherwoman seeking to prove herself to her clanmates.\nSummary.\nThe story opens with &lt;a href=\"Taruka\"&gt;Taruka&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the smallest fisher in her clan\u2014returning to camp with a meager catch, for which her rival &lt;a href=\"Onaaka\"&gt;Onaaka&lt;/a&gt; belittles her and the catch master &lt;a href=\"Kattik%20Sharktasted\"&gt;Kattik&lt;/a&gt; only rewards her one knot (which Taruka is collecting so she can buy kite silk for her sister &lt;a href=\"Unka\"&gt;Unka&lt;/a&gt;). The clan is stocking up on food as they prepare to travel to their regular stopping point of &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt;; the fishers will travel in their boats while the rest of the clan go across the ice on sleds. Taruka talks to her friend &lt;a href=\"Larati\"&gt;Larati&lt;/a&gt;, who is not convinced when the youngling says she will catch more and bigger fish. Taruka reminisces about her father, who died at sea before he could finish teaching her and left her only his boat's mast and a spear.\nThe old fisher &lt;a href=\"Harooka\"&gt;Harooka&lt;/a&gt; warns Taruka that there's a danger in &lt;a href=\"Lyquokk%20Strait\"&gt;Lyquokk Strait&lt;/a&gt; and tells her not to sail there on her way to Kamagua. Taruka gets suspicious and thinks the other fishers want to keep her away from a prime fishing spot. After a sullen evening dinner with her sister and her mother &lt;a href=\"Makusha\"&gt;Makusha&lt;/a&gt;, she walks out to the family sled and looks at her father's spear, only to suddenly receive what seems to be a sign from the goddess &lt;a href=\"Oacha%27noa\"&gt;Oacha'noa&lt;/a&gt; telling her to take the weapon with her.\nThe next morning, Taruka sets out north in her little boat and heads through Lyquokk Strait, but sees no sign of fish. Suddenly a &lt;a href=\"beast%20of%20Lyquokk%20Strait\"&gt;huge sea monster&lt;/a&gt; appears under her boat and causes it to capsize. Taruka ends up clinging to the creature's back and a struggle ensues. When the beast dives into the water again, she slides down its neck and manages to plunge the spear into its eye, killing it. Unable to right her boat, she is at a loss for what do to until she realizes that the monster's buoyant corpse can function as a ship. After attaching parts of her boat to the creature, she steers it north and, after three days, triumphantly arrives in Kamagua, where her family and clan members are waiting. The story ends with Taruka\u2014now called \"Taruka Beastkiller\"\u2014jovially asking Kattik how many knots her latest catch is worth."}

However, after beating the Scarlet Captains, they said that only Archbishop Landgren might have the information.\nConfident that the Archbishop knew where the Grand Admiral was, Lord-Commander Arete sent the adventurer to eliminate the Archbishop, and interrogated his soul to find out that the Grand-Admiral was hiding in a heavily guarded cave behind the cathedral, known as the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Hollow\"&gt;Hidden Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the adventurer came to the cave to eliminate Westwind, but it was then revealed that the Grand Admiral was in fact the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, who fled after being discovered, vowing revenge against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer.\nYears later, following the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; brothers reported that even with their leadership still in disarray, there are still a surprising number of crusaders in the harbor."}

Her breath was capable of melting iron, and her physical attacks were lightning quick and nearly unstoppable.\nSeeking to take control of the Kingdom of Stormwind, Onyxia manipulated a conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; that led to the death of &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. She later had &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; abducted by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; on route to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Prestor subsequently became a royal councilor to his 10-year-old son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and controlled Highlord &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. Onyxia was slain and beheaded in &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;her lair&lt;/a&gt; by King Varian upon his return when her true identity was revealed, thus restoring the line of Stormwind's kings. After the return of her father and the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; that resulted, she was reanimated by her brother Nefarian as an electrical undead monstrosity. Ultimately, she would be destroyed once more, along with Nefarian, in the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnyxia serves as one of the two secondary antagonists (alongside her brother Nefarian) in classic \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and one of the supporting antagonists in \"\".\nBiography.\nChronormu's visage.\nOnyxia believed that &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s were the mortal race that posed the greatest threat to dragonkind. When deciding on her mortal guise, she chose the form of an attractive female human so that she could manipulate their kind and allow her to seize all she wanted from them.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who could not make up his mind on what mortal form to choose during his upcoming &lt;a href=\"Visage%20Day\"&gt;Visage Day&lt;/a&gt; ceremony\u2014sought an audience with Onyxia in &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Neltharion\"&gt;the caverns&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, where the daughter of Deathwing was overseeing &lt;a href=\"black%20drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; laborers and sparring &lt;a href=\"black%20drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt;. Onyxia scoffed at Chronormu's view that dragons chose a visage to better relate to the mortal races, stating that it sounded \"like something &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; would teach his whelps\". She assumed her human form and continued that no visage could change a dragon's nature as a hunter and killer. Like their other abilities, shapeshifting was a tool to take what they wanted from the young races. Though Chronormu protested that this was not how he wanted mortals to see him, Onyxia offered to let him stay by her side and teach him everything he needed to know about mortals and allow him to become the greatest member of his flight, great enough that even Nozdormu would kneel before him. Upset at Onyxia's words and realizing that she was merely toying with him, the bronze fled from the cave, pursued by the sound of Onyxia's laughter. However, the encounter nonetheless caused him to realize that he now knew what he wanted to be.\nOnyxia and her entourage attended Chronormu's Visage Day at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, even though the bronze noted that the black flight was clearly out of favor with the others. After it was revealed that Chronormu had chosen the form of the female &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; Chromie, Onyxia gave her a slight nod before leaving, which Chromie chose to take as a sign of acceptance.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nShortly before &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s departure for &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing commanded Onyxia and &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; to secure orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; as their new force. His children agreed to do so.\nAfter Draenor's destruction, Deathwing returned as Daval Prestor to Lordaeron, sowing chaos. He secretly called on Onyxia to accompany him, also disguised as a human noble. Together, they spread distrust among &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s nations. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, Onyxia was left behind to carry on her father's work and she relished it. As Alliance relations deteriorated, Onyxia decided to spread her influence in the kingdom of Stormwind. After Deathwing's departure, with the aid of his sister Onyxia and the orchestrations of their human personas, Nefarian worked toward replenishing the black dragonflight. Onyxia served as one of her brother's mightiest supporters and was seen traveling to and from his lair in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; on occasion.\nAs Katrana Prestor.\nFor several years, Onyxia masqueraded as one of the highest nobles in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Katrana Prestor, preventing the people there from sending much-needed aid to the areas near the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, where Nefarian, her brother, had great power and influence. Her final goal was to become the ruler of Stormwind, through manipulation and evil schemes.\nKatrana was present in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; during the coronation of King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; after the Second War on his 18th birthday.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;nobles of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. The massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy and stripped the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%27%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons' Guild&lt;/a&gt; of their promised rewards. After spending years toiling to rebuild the glorious city, the Stonemasons were left broke, forgotten by the city's officials. Upon returning from a foray, &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was unable to negotiate a resolution that appeased both parties. Varian agreed that the Stonemasons' fees were excessive, but felt the amount offered by the council of nobles was too stingy. In retrospection, Varian realized that the nobles were unduly influenced by Lady Katrana, and later suspected that half of each side had been ensorcelled by Prestor.\nIndeed, Lady Prestor had secretly meddled with the rebuilding of Stormwind City, causing the nobility to feel unsatisfied with the Stonemasons' Guild's craftsmanship. Meanwhile, the workers were outraged at the nobility's threats to withhold payment for honest work. Lady Prestor had played both sides, encouraging them to dig in their heels and never compromise, until the disagreements escalated into unrest. When the nobility announced that they would not pay the Stonemasons for their work, riots erupted.\nThe civil conflict led to &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s death. Varian entered a profound depression, which Onyxia used to her advantage, using foul sorcery on him while she politically outmaneuvered him during the span of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, she increasingly lost control over Varian as his attachment to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; grew. He started to assert his will and fight off his lethargy, and started to reassert his control over the Stormwind government. Despite Katrana's objections, he still accepted to meet the Horde's leader, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, at Theramore at &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s suggestion, convinced by Anduin. Onyxia thus planned to reassert her control over the king. She made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt; to kidnap him. While their first attempt failed, the second was successful. He was brought to a remote island where the black dragon conducted a ritual to sunder Varian's personality, getting rid of his will, strength, and confidence, which would take the name of &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Gosh\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt;, and leaving behind only Varian, an easily manipulable puppet.\nAbduction.\nSoon after the dust had settled from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Varian journeyed to Theramore to speak with Jaina Proudmoore regarding Horde/Alliance relations. On route, he was abducted by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; hired by Onyxia and brought to &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt;. There, Varian was tied to the ground; cloaked figures casted dark magic causing unbearable pain as Varian desperately tried to break himself free. In a blinding flash of light he awakened to find himself laying next to an exact duplicate. Onyxia unmasked herself intending to kill the strong-willed Varian but was stopped by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Morgala%20Darksquall\"&gt;Morgala Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. The cloaked figures and Onyxia turned into dragonkin and battled the naga while the strong-willed Varian broke himself free and began to fight. He tried to free the other Varian and implored him to find a weapon but discovered his other was too unnerved to properly wield a weapon. The other Varian was knocked off a cliff, fell into the ocean and was captured by the naga. Varian was left alone to fight and tricked Onyxia into believing she had killed him. Pleased, Onyxia left before more naga appeared.\nAfter King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; went missing under suspicious circumstances while en route to a diplomatic summit to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind was believed to be going through a state of disarray. Young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; was given the crown so that order could be preserved within the kingdom of Stormwind, at the behest of the royal councilor, Lady Prestor. &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; acted as Regent Lord of Stormwind or the Supreme Commander of Stormwind's forces on behalf of King Anduin. When &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; gave warnings of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20orc\"&gt;Blackrock orc&lt;/a&gt;s allying with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar was debilitated from sending Stormwind's thinly spread troops to aid &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; without proof. Bolvar sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to Lady Prestor, who knew much of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lady Prestor thought very little of Magistrate Solomon's claims and advised against providing the military aid. Though Bolvar respected Lady Prestor's stance, he could not let Solomon's plight go unheeded and thought of a compromise to appease all parties: Bolvar deputized the Alliance adventurer and empowered them to solve Solomon's problems.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; found evidence of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; being involved in King Varian's disappearance and had a powerful ally in Stormwind, she sent the evidence to Bolvar. With their newfound patronage and apparent role in the king's disappearance, Bolvar saw no choice but to plan a renewed offensive against the Defias. While Bolvar sought to pursue the Defias and their backers until King Varian's return, Lady Prestor tried to belittle the issue as just baseless speculation and a waste of Stormwind's resources. \nOnyxia controlled Highlord &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; through the use of the &lt;a href=\"Drakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. She may also have used the kidnapping to convince Stormwind's nobles (particularly Bolvar) to not send troops to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to increase the strength of the Brotherhood and the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; in those regions, which are both rumored to be allied to the black dragonflight, and cause chaos throughout the human lands.\nAt some point, Onyxia drove the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres from the caves in &lt;a href=\"Dragonmurk\"&gt;Dragonmurk&lt;/a&gt;, a dismal swamp located within &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. She did so in order to procure a place to raise her numerous children, who would then leave to infest the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmbog\"&gt;Wyrmbog&lt;/a&gt;. She and her children became known for terrorizing any travelers who strayed too close to her home.\nReturn of the kings.\nSome time later, a massive ceremony was held in Stormwind to welcome home their king. However, the Varian that returned was arrogant, frivolous, and markedly interested in Katrana Prestor. The people of Stormwind had only been informed that Defias had ransomed the king, a ransom paid with a painful new tax. Upon his return, however, Varian seemed concerned only with spending more of his people's money, leaving affairs of state by the wayside. Anduin Wrynn was distressed by his father's change.\nOne day in Stormwind City, &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was on a visit and was discussing war plans against the orcs and Dark Iron dwarves with King \"Varian\" and Bolvar Fordragon. However, Varian Wrynn was counseled by Lady Katrana Prestor to not send troops to help the dwarves fight against the dark irons. King Magni left disappointed in Varian's subservience to Lady Prestor's wishes and his dishonorable demeanor.\nMeanwhile, a masked man witnessed a gladiator fighting in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;, so he informed Lady Katrana of the event. Lady Katrana subsequently sent &lt;a href=\"Gakca\"&gt;Gakca&lt;/a&gt; to kill the masked man, and then to order &lt;a href=\"Daerion%20the%20Assassin\"&gt;an assassin&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Assassin%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Stormwind Assassin's Guild&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate the gladiator named &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; during his perilous journey to Stormwind. All their attempts to dispatch Lo'Gosh failed however.\nEventually, the other Varian - Lo'Gosh - and his friends arrived in Stormwind and were halted by &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; under the direct jurisdiction of Katrana Prestor, who ordered their immediate arrest and execution as traitors. Marshal &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in convincing Marcus of his loyalty to Stormwind as they had previously served together under &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. Katrana Prestor hastily gathered soldiers only to have the frivolous Varian tell her that she was disobeying the chain of command and was not in charge of Stormwind. Entering Stormwind Keep, Lo'Gosh declared Katrana's masquerade was over and called her by her true name: Onyxia. Revealing her dragon form and transforming multiple guards into dragonspawn, Lo'Gosh and his allies began battle in the great hall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The arrival of Highlord Bolvar Fordragon along with Anduin greatly aided them in securing the keep but Reginald Windsor was killed moments later by Onyxia. Lo'Gosh engaged his doppelganger, claiming he threatened the stability of his kingdom and nearly cost the Alliance Thandol Span, only to have his doppelganger retort he was starting to repress her spells and regain control of his actions. Anduin, surprised by seeing two Varians, urged them to stop fighting each other and face the true threat, the brood mother Onyxia. The great dragon snatched Anduin and teleported them to her lair daring Varian to follow suit. Regrouping with their friends, Varian and Lo'Gosh were left to grieve the loss of their son. Lo'Gosh announced to their friends and allies that the final battle would end in &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorruption ends.\nLeading a mounted charge, both Varians cut bloody swathes into Onyxia's &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; ranks. Jaina disabled the impeding magical barriers while Varian and his allies used steel and magic to slay Onyxia's brood. Eventually, they encountered the brood mother herself, with Anduin imprisoned under her iron grip. Onyxia held Anduin hostage, threatening to kill him if Varian didn't surrender Stormwind over to her. Anduin urged his father not to give in to her threats and Lo'Gosh agreed to fight and die with Anduin if need be. Lo'Gosh threw a knife at the dragon's claw to loosen her hold over Anduin. Anduin fell at a great height but was caught and saved by &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken his raven form to catch him mid air. With Anduin's safety secured, the Stormwind army continued the battle.\nLeading an assault against Onyxia, both Varians engaged her in battle. Weapons and magic clashed with her numerous dragonkin with both sides determined to win. Onyxia cast a fear spell on &lt;a href=\"Broll\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt; and tail swiped Jaina, removing them from the battle after growing agitated by their constant spellcasting. Becoming desperate to end the fight, Onyxia began casting the spell she was going to use on Alcaz Island to kill Lo'Gosh, but Lo'Gosh's double responded by stepping in front of the blast, saying he should die because Lo'Gosh was the embodiment of the true Varian. Not willing to sacrifice his double, Lo'Gosh leapt alongside his other self hoping to save him. The magic spell became disrupted by having the two Varians in the spell, and after a moment of silence Varian emerged, his two halves fused back together. Onyxia desperately tried to incinerate him, but Varian swiftly reached Onyxia's head and impaled her with his newly-fused elven sword, &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt;. With Onyxia dead, Varian reunited with his son and friends, telling them their long and noble deeds would be rewarded and Stormwind has been reborn with a new hope for the future. King Varian then decapitated Onyxia and sent her head to be hung from the ramparts of Stormwind while &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; summoned roots from the ground to seal her lair's entrance and to kill her unhatched progeny.\nCataclysm.\nThis wasn't her end, however. Onyxia's head was retrieved from Stormwind City by Deathwing, and her body was somehow retrieved by Nefarian and both were taken inside &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;. When players engaged Nefarian, as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Victor%20Nefarius\"&gt;Lord Victor Nefarius&lt;/a&gt;, he revealed that he had found a way to raise Onyxia from the dead. A platform then rises from the lava in the middle of the vault with Onyxia's stitched-together form lying on it, and she is restored to a semblance of life via bolts of electricity. The first phase of the Nefarian fight consists of trying to kill Onyxia while also managing Nefarian, who will attack the raid after a brief respite.\nLegacy.\nThe remains of Nefarian and Onyxia remained untouched in Blackwing Descent for several years. When &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; awoke at the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper\"&gt;servants&lt;/a&gt; attempted to raise Nefarian and Onyxia into the Old Gods' service once again. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Inquisitor%20Xanesh\"&gt;Dark Inquisitor Xanesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt; lured &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to Blackwing Descent and intended to use his essence to revive the draconic siblings, but their efforts were thwarted. At Wrathion's command, their remains were completely destroyed, and the last remaining scales used to craft a &lt;a href=\"Ashjra%27kamas%2C%20Shroud%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;cloak&lt;/a&gt; to protect against N'Zoth's corruption.\nYears after her fall, Onyxia's will lingered in the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; that she had used to control the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Nobles of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; during her time as Katrana Prestor. &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt;, who had willingly worked with her during those days, used the amulet to incite a riot in &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;. After he was killed by &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, and Stormwind's champion, a shade of Onyxia appeared from the amulet and battled them.\nWith the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; discussed with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; about the return of the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Although he had faith in &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s intentions, he expressed distrust of the other dragons, citing the 's report of the damage done to the kingdom by Onyxia years ago. In order to protect the Alliance and their past years' efforts to recreate its strength, the Regent of Stormwind ordered the Spymaster to enlist the expertise of the Stormwind mages to create a foolproof method to see through the \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%23Shapeshifting\"&gt;visage&lt;/a&gt;\" that the dragons wear among mortals.\nPolitical influence.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", Onyxia's human alias, Lady Katrana Prestor, was the woman who used to stand immediately to the right of the boy king, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. She could be revealed as a dragonkin by Hunter dragonkin detection, and did not show up as a humanoid when using \"Track Humanoids\".\nShe had significant influence over the following organizations, manipulating them against each other to further her plans and strengthen the black dragonflight:\nDescription.\nA clever, highly intelligent dragon, Onyxia is fond of assuming mortal guises, which she uses to secretly manipulate the affairs of mortal politics and commerce. Though Onyxia is relatively small for a black dragon of her age, she shares the same powers and abilities as the rest of her terrible flight. Her searing breath weapon can melt both stone and iron. Her physical attacks, whether bites, scrapes or tail lashes, are lightning quick and nearly unstoppable. When cornered, Onyxia is fond of taking flight and blasting her troublesome prey from above. \nThough Onyxia has been sighted traveling to and from &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, her main &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt; is located in a fiery cave below the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmurk\"&gt;Dragonmurk&lt;/a&gt;. It's also whispered that her brood of new eggs is hidden within her lair - awaiting maturation. Should anyone ever threaten Onyxia within her lair - within distance of her precious eggs - her wrath would be terrible beyond comprehension.\nApperance.\nIn her true form Onyxia was a smaller dragon than the average dragon, like one of the members of the Black Dragonflight she had black scales and dark purple wings as well as piercing yellow eyes.\nIn her Katrana Prestor costume she looked like a rather beautiful and seductive human woman, with tanned skin, burnt orange eyes, and long thick, shiny black hair.\nQuotes.\nStormwind Keep.\n&lt;Lady Prestor glares at you.&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nAfter carefully calculating her plans for many years, she entered into a pact with her elder brother, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, to take over for their &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;missing father&lt;/a&gt; and gain control of the entire flight. To this end, she had begun manipulating many mortals and dragons alike to her own ends and wielded considerable political power over many groups. Onyxia speaks Common, Darnassian, Draconic, Dwarven, Orcish, Thalassian, and Zandali.\nOnyxia initiates combat using her breath weapon and then moves directly into melee, preferably targeting soft targets such as spellcasters. If given a chance to prepare before battle, she uses defensive spells to augment her fighting ability. When she is damaged too much, Onyxia takes to the air. If she is still sustaining a great deal of damage in the air, she sticks to spells, to make sure she can retreat if badly wounded. If heavily injured she either retreats (if in open air) or descends to the ground to reenter melee (if inside her lair). She attempts to land on her enemies and crush them as she comes down to the ground. When she reaches the ground, she immediately uses Deep Breath against the largest group of opponents within range. At this point, she fights to the death if necessary, retreating only if a chance presents itself. If engaged while in human form, she fights using spells unless her attackers clearly know she is a dragon; if her enemies know her identity, she tries to retreat to her lair.\nLady Katrana Prestor and Lord &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; serve as the king's main advisors, and they pretty much call the shots. However, Bolvar is not one to insult the judgment of an \"educated\" lady like Katrana Prestor. It seems like her advice is pretty much the exact opposite of anything a logical person with half a brain would come up with. As a result of Lady Prestor's intervention, proper human leadership has become impossible. She doesn't seem to think the other races are necessary. Katrana won't even allow the king to send reinforcements to human lands that desperately need it, such as Duskwood and the Redridge Mountains. Every report of enemy activity on those fronts is shot down for lack of \"proof\", despite knowledge of dead men and women. It's unknown what she did to get the prince's ear, but for whatever reason she's managed to keep both the king and Lord Bolvar following her directions (and some of them are clearly nonsense). She's just playing games with the Alliance troops when they have good men and women dying out on the front. Her motivations are unknown; she's certainly either working for something malicious, or she is malicious herself.\nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nOnyxia appears as in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".

It was re-tuned as a level 80 raid dungeon in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.2\"&gt;patch 3.2.2&lt;/a&gt; in honor of \"World of Warcraft's\" 5-year anniversary. Like all other \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" raid dungeons, it has both 10-man and 25-man modes.\nLore.\nOnyxia built the lair. The entrance to the lair was carved to look like the maw of the broodmother herself, with its inner pathway being magma-lined and the ground cracked, glowing with fire from beneath. The arching stone ceiling groans and shifts, creating constant rockfalls. The walls spill lava where the heat can't be contained.\nOnyxia is the daughter of the mighty Black Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, and sister of the scheming &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Blackrock Spire. Whereas her father favors brute force, and her brother creates twisted abominations to carry out his will, Onyxia prefers subtle manipulation, and delights in meddling in the political affairs of mortals, using her charm and power to influence such delicate matters between the different races to her own ends. Some believe that Onyxia has even assumed an alias once used by her father - the title of the royal House Prestor. Most recently, she very nearly succeeded in destroying the political structure of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; in the guise of &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, before being unmasked by &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and fleeing to her lair: a fiery cave below the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmurk\"&gt;Dragonmurk&lt;/a&gt;, a dismal swamp located within Dustwallow Marsh. There she is guarded by her kin, the remaining members of the insidious black dragonflight.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes were able to assault her lair and attack Onyxia. She spewed her magma from the air above and sent her many whelplings at the heroes on the ground. Onyxia was decapitated by Varian himself and her head was brought back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to be hung from the gates. After her death, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; summoned roots from the ground to seal the lair's entrance and to kill her unhatched progeny.\nDays later, &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; reopened the lair.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, although Onyxia was dead, her brood was still at her lair in Dustwallow.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; visited the lair.\nLoot.\nThe level 80 version of Onyxia drops headpieces with similar names and models as the &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; ones the original level 60 version had. (The actual Tier 2 headpieces now drop off &lt;a href=\"Nefarian%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;). She also drops a new version of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Serrar\"&gt;Quel'Serrar&lt;/a&gt; since the questline for the original version has been removed from the game. All of these items have been upgraded to reflect Onyxia's new status as a &lt;a href=\"Tier%209\"&gt;Tier 9&lt;/a&gt;-level boss. There is also an extremely fast mount named &lt;a href=\"Brood%20of%20Onyxia\"&gt;Brood of Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; that drops off her.

They vary depending on the phase of the fight that you are in. The abilities are as follows:\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, two drakes will spawn when Onyxia is pulled. In addition, an &lt;a href=\"Onyxian%20Warder\"&gt;Onyxian Warder&lt;/a&gt; will enter the room at the start of phase 2.\nCombat strategy.\nThe Onyxia fight is made up of three separate phases. Phase One starts when any character enters her chamber. Phase Two starts when she is brought down to 65% health. At this point she walks to the south end of the room and take flight. Phase Three starts when she is brought down to 40% health. She lands and continues the fight from the ground.\nPreparation.\nUpon entering Onyxia's Lair, you will fight through a tunnel containing four Onyxian Warders. These are easy raid monsters. The keys to defeating them are to make sure that only the main tank is close enough to them to get hit by their Fire Nova attack, and to &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt; them carefully, so that you face only one at a time.\nWhen you reach the main chamber at the end of the tunnel, you will see Onyxia resting on the ground. Take this time to &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; everyone and ensure that everyone has full health and mana. If you are using &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Fire%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Fire Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, take them now to start the potion cooldown. Select and put on your equipment for an appropriate mix of fire resistance, armor, healing, mana regeneration, and damage output.\nSet up a healing rotation on the main tank to ensure he stays at full health, and that healers can regenerate mana between rotations.\nEstablish two groups (typically group 7 and group 8) as whelp groups. They will kill whelps during phase two. These groups must have at least one mage for &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; and is best to have another form of AoE as well (either a second mage or a warlock). They also require healers and warriors. There should be no whelps in phase one or phase three, but they sometimes happen anyway. These groups should keep an eye out for whelps in those phases but can focus mainly on Onyxia with the rest of the raid.\nEstablish which groups go where for phase one and phase three. Typically, groups 1, 3, 5, and 7 go left (west), and groups 2, 4, 6, and 8 go right (east).\nPhase One strategies.\nPhase One starts as soon as anyone enters Onyxia's main chamber. There are three main goals for Phase One:\nEntering and positioning.\nWhen everyone is ready, the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Tank\"&gt;Main Tank&lt;/a&gt; charges in with everyone else following about two or three seconds behind. The main tank runs straight past Onyxia, pulling her to the far north side of the room so that she faces the wall. The best positioning takes a little practice and is a few steps in front of the wall. This is so that the main tank's back is to the wall to limit the effectiveness of her Knock Away ability and so that the main tank is the only one in front of her when she breathes fire.\nEveryone else \"must\" charge in two or three seconds after the main tank. If they wait longer, there is a danger of attracting attention from a freshly-spawned Onyxian Warder. If they go sooner, they run the risk of getting hit by Onyxia's Flame Breath attack. Don't get ahead of her!\nEveryone but the main tank splits to the sides to the northeast and northwest \"corners\" of Onyxia's chamber. Each side forms three main groups. Closest to Onyxia is the melee group, roughly at her shoulders. Next is the ranged and healing group, which should be right along the wall. Last, and farthest south, is the whelp group.\nEstablish Main Tank threat and initiate slow damage.\nInitially, nobody attacks Onyxia except the main tank. The main tank is the only one to be fighting Onyxia for at least a minute, or until she drops to 99% health (whichever comes first). \nAt this point, the DPS characters start doing damage while being careful to avoid drawing aggro away from the main tank. This is not a race. Phase One is a slow, steady fight. Do not try to rush. All DPS characters try for about 50-75% of their max &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; output. Anyone with a way to dump &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; does so (e.g. Hunters can &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;, Rogues can &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt;) as often as they can. Mages and warlocks use wands to save mana and generate minimal threat (having over 90% mana going into Phase Two is helpful).\nRemember that Onyxia's Flame Breath can do up to 4000 damage. Remember this, because if anyone draws aggro away from the main tank, she turns sideways and may breathe. If she does, she can kill all cloth wearers (casters and healers) on that side, very likely causing a wipe. Therefore it is \"very\" important to not overdo the damage.\nAlso remember that Onyxia's Knock Away ability reduces her threat on the main tank. The main tank is unable to hold aggro as well as usual, so the DPS classes must hold back on their damage output.\nIf, despite this warning, you pull aggro off of the main tank and Onyxia attacks you, attempt to shake her off of you with &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Protection\"&gt;Divine Protection&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt;. If that doesn't work, run to the tanking spot at the northern end of the chamber and fight her there. You are going to die anyway, and this will keep Onyxia from breathing flame on other characters as she kills you.\nPhase Two strategies.\nPhase Two starts when Onyxia reaches 65% health. She walks towards the south end of her lair and takes flight.\nThere are four basic goals for Phase Two:\nPositioning.\nIn this phase you must ensure that everyone maintains spacing from each other to reduce blast damage from fireballs. Players need to move around to ensure they have range to Onyxia while she is flying. Ideally you want to be to on either side of the line created by her head-tail axis as her breath always flows through it. This will minimize the distance you need to run to avoid a deep breath should it occur. It's also wise to turn on an aggro warning mod to warn you when you're about to be fireballed. There is always a 2\u20135 second delay between her targeting someone and actually shooting the fireball. Once targeted, skilled players can distance themselves from teammates to help avoid collateral damage.\nWhelps.\nWhen Onyxia takes off, each whelp pit will spawn a large group of whelps that need to be dealt with quickly. The raid should help the whelp groups clear this initial spawning as fast as possible before moving on to help with Onyxia. Since the first spawn is quite large and can kill clothies quite easly, it is advised to put a tank right at the entrance to the whelps pit, who will cast &lt;a href=\"Challenging%20Shout\"&gt;Challenging Shout&lt;/a&gt; to aggro the whelps to him. Then the mages can kill those easily. After the initial group is dead the whelps spawn in regular intervals in smaller numbers that can be dealt with fairly easily once you are used to them.\nDodge deep breath attacks.\nDuring Phase Two, Onyxia has six possible positions in her cave and stays in each position long enough to fire five fireballs. After that, she randomly moves clockwise, counterclockwise or across her chamber. If she chooses to move across her chamber, she will perform a Deep Breath attack on the way. She will emote, \"Onyxia takes in a deep breath...\" There are a slew of AddOns which announce this across a player's screen.\nUpon this announcement, everyone must immediately run to a safe position.\nFor each of the six possible positions she moves to there are always two positions in which the raid can stand and be safe from the deep breaths. If she's in a corner position, then the two safe positions are the adjacent corners and if she's in a side position then the two safe positions are the adjacent sides. For example if she's in the top-left corner then the top-right and bottom-left corners are both safe and if she's at the top-center then the two safe positions are the left-center and right-center. Anyone not in a safe position usually dies during a deep breath unless they get lucky with resisting the fire damage.\nIt is useful to have hunters use Track Dragonkin, ping her position on the mini-map, and announce each time she changes position so that everyone can then adjust their position. Ideally, everyone remains fairly close to a safe position at all times during Phase Two.\nMax out damage.\nGet Onyxia down to about 40% health as fast as you can. Ranged damage is the main thing that can hit her while in flight, so it is important to have everyone doing as much ranged DPS as possible. Rogues and other melee can hit her by using special attacks. Track all debuffs and DoTs on her and ensure they are kept up to move through this phase as quickly as possible. Onyxia's targeting does not follow the usual rules during Phase Two, so there is no reason to hold back on damage. The more quickly Phase Two ends the fewer opportunities Onyxia will have to do a Deep Breath.\nPrepare for Phase Three.\nPhase Two ends as Onyxia is brought to 40% health. At the start of Phase Three, she lands at a random point in her chamber and starts her ground attack. She casts a fear spell within seconds of landing, so all players must position themselves away from the whelp caves before she does so. If not, the fear effect may cause some to run into the whelp eggs, spawning a lot of whelps.\nDue to Onyxia's in-flight threat wiping, the main tank will have very little threat as she lands. He must build rage on whelps, then use &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt; and other threat-generating attacks on Onyxia shortly before she lands. Another technique is for the main tank to bandage himself as she is landing due to the large amount of aggro created by the self-healing. Casters stop attacking somewhere between 41% and 44%. Hunters and rogues keep attacking until she starts to land, at which point they Feign Death or Vanish.\nPhase Three strategies.\nPhase Three starts as Onyxia is brought to 40% health. She lands and resumes her attack from the ground. The phase ends when she dies.\nPhase Three tactics are very similar to Phase One, except that fear requires special handling and the raid will take damage from lava spurts. The main goals are as follows:\nPositioning.\nIn Phase Three everyone should move back to their Phase One positioning with some minor changes. Stand in a spot well away from the cracks that erupt lava. While this will not prevent taking damage, it will limit it somewhat. Make sure everyone is spread out and that the main tank is back to the north end of the room.\nThere is a considerably better spot for ranged DPS characters. At the exact center of the room is a medium-sized area with fewer lava cracks (prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.11\"&gt;Patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, these did not spew lava at all). Ranged damage-dealers standing here can avoid all damage from Onyxia and the lava, although they may be attacked by whelps. They must stand back far enough to avoid Onyxia's tail. There are two small spikes of rock that make excellent places to stand.\nHealers who are healing the main tank should stand against the wall in their corners, as far back as possible. This gives them the best chance to avoid both Onyxia's Fire Breath and Tail Swipe attacks when feared.\nMelee must stay well forward of her tail! If you are too far back, she may fear you into her tail, which will toss you into a whelp pit, which will spawn 20 whelps, which will wipe the raid. Also, everyone must stay away from the whelp pits to avoid being feared directly into them. If you do end up spawning a bunch of whelps, call it out so that the whelp groups can kill them quickly. AoE damage is required to have any chance of success.\nAggro control.\nAt beginning of Phase Three, the main tank may have a difficult time re-establishing aggro. Onyxia may attack and kill a half-dozen members of the raid before the main tank finally gets her attention. Getting her attention is a lot faster if, near the end of Phase Two, the main tank applies Sunder Armor and the casters stop attacking. Usually a full 1% health drop (as in Phase One) will ensure complete aggro control for the rest of the fight if people are careful with their DPS.\nAs in Phase One, if you draw aggro from the main tank, either shake it or run to the tanking spot to die. This is very likely to happen at the beginning of Phase Three to all cloth classes, so be ready for it.\nOnyxia's threat at the start of Phase Three is a hot topic of debate. Research in November 2006 strongly indicates that her Phase Two fireball attack, when it scores a targeted (not AoE) hit, is a complete threat wipe. This would go a long way toward explaining the strange behavior at the start of Phase Three.\nDealing with fear.\nOnyxia's fear spell causes a considerable amount of chaos. Aside from disrupting healing and damage-dealing, it causes all characters to lose their positions and to take damage from running through lava spurts. It sometimes causes the main tank to run sideways. When this happens, Onyxia turns to follow him, and may then breathe flame on members of the raid on that side.\nThe cracks spew lava immediately after the fear effect ends. If your character is standing on a crack when the fear effect ends, move him to a safe spot quickly.\nThe fear interrupts long-cast spells, and wastes much of the duration of short-term buffs (such as from trinkets). Use these immediately after a fear effect ends, in order to reduce the chance of disruption from the next fear.\nIt helps to have a Priest be the main healer on the MT during Phase Three. The Priest ability &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt;, when cast on the MT during Phase Three, can prevent the main tank from being feared.\nShamans can plant two &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt;s next to the tank, three seconds apart. These will usually cause the tank to come out of fear quickly. They need to be renewed during the fight.\nBoth Alliance and Horde tanks can avoid the fear somewhat via the &lt;a href=\"Stance%20dancing\"&gt;Stance Dance&lt;/a&gt;, as with &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt;. The shaking screen gives just enough warning to use &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Rage\"&gt;Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt;. However, the reduced threat generation and extra damage taken from &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Stance\"&gt;Berserker Stance&lt;/a&gt; while the healers are feared can be problematic.\nAn advanced tactic is to have two tanks, who must both build threat. The &lt;a href=\"Off-Tank\"&gt;Off-Tank&lt;/a&gt; hits Berserker Rage to avoid the fear, and becomes the main tank until the fear is over. This requires more skill by the healers and tanks, and more fire resistance gear. However, if done properly, it ensures that Onyxia will never turn due to fear effects. The off-tank may be positioned with the main tank, to avoid repositioning, or at her shoulder, to avoid damage.\nIf you are not the tank, you must \"not\" avoid or break the fear effect. Onyxia will always attack un-feared targets before targets that do have the fear effect. What this means is that if you aren't feared, Onyxia may turn, breathe flame on you and many other players, and wipe the raid. Stay away from tremor totems. Don't use Will of the Forsaken or your PvP trinkets to break fear.\nThere is a small chance of resisting the fear. If you resist it, Onyxia will attack you. Run to the tanking spot until the main tank recovers from fear and regains aggro.\nPerform slow DPS.\nThis part of the fight is similar to Phase One. Keep your DPS under control doing about 50-75% of your max and clearing aggro as often as you can.\nDamage-dealing classes can gradually ramp up their damage output as Phase Three progresses and the main tank builds more threat. Hunters can do this more quickly by using Feign Death and Rogues can do so with Vanish. At 10% health, it is usually possible to apply maximum damage. This is a balancing act, as Onyxia must be brought down before attrition from the lava spurts causes the loss of too many players, yet the damage-dealers must not pull aggro from the main tank.\nHints.\nOnyxia is more about long-term patience than all-out DPS and speed. If you follow the strategies laid out here, have patience and practice a little, you should have an easy time beating her. Phase One is very easy if no one pulls aggro off the main tank. Phase Two becomes easy once you figure out how to deal with the whelps, dodge Deep Breath attacks, and keep up ranged DPS and DoTs. Phase Three requires some luck the first several times you do it and a ton of skill on the main tank's part to keep control while being feared and knocked back.\nThe hardest part of the whole fight is the main tank regaining aggro at the end of Phase Two / beginning of Phase Three. Once that part is mastered, the fight goes a lot more smoothly. Once again, the key is for the main tank to apply Sunder Armor to Onyxia while she is still in the air.\nThe next-hardest part of the fight is learning to avoid Deep Breath attacks. Once again, the keys here are to keep your character positioned in or near a safe spot at all times during Phase Two and to damage Onyxia so quickly that she has few chances to perform the attack.\nKeep your tanks alive at all costs. Since Onyxia is immune to taunt, your main tank cannot regain aggro if he dies and is resurrected. If your main tank does die, your raid's only hope is to have another tank take over.\nThis is a scripted fight that takes some practice. No matter how accurate any strategy guide is, nothing can prepare you more than experience. Expect a few wipes and plan for it. Some guilds take 20\u201330 wipes before downing her for the first time, and then continue to have occasional wipes. \n&lt;a href=\"Greater%20Fire%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Fire Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt;s are useful during this fight, especially while learning it. They are better than healing potions in dealing with fire damage. Heal with bandages. Healers will be focused on the main tank, so everyone else must be prepared to take care of themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; gear is important for the MT and OT, but is subject to discussion for everyone else. It increases survivability, but people should pay attention not to gimp themselves too much.\nMost boss mods provide a large, loud warning before Onyxia performs a Deep Breath attack. They also warn when she enters Phases Two and Three as well as providing general raid usefulness.They are generally recommended for use, as well as usually required by guilds.\nThe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow-en.curse-gaming.com/files/details/4204/klhthreatmeter/\"&gt;KLH Threat Meter&lt;/a&gt; mod provides a fairly accurate estimate of monster threat, although nothing beats being aware of how much threat you are putting up. If everyone uses it, it can help avoid loss of aggro by the main tank.\nLoot.\nOnyxia will drop two &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; headpieces, one &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20Hide%20Backpack\"&gt;Onyxia Hide Backpack&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Onyxia%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Head of Onyxia (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, two other items from her loot table, and a number of rare and uncommon world drop items. A skinner with 315 skill can also skin Onyxia to obtain two to four &lt;a href=\"Scale%20of%20Onyxia\"&gt;Scale of Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.2\"&gt;Patch 3.2.2&lt;/a&gt;, these items can now be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;\nQuests.\nKilling Onyxia was part of several epic quest chains.\nBugs.\nBugged heal.\nOnyxia heals herself for 45% over ten seconds. This is extremely rare, but only happens during Phase Three. It appears to happen only in very long fights. Even in long fights, though, it does not usually happen.\nThe healing is due to a bug, instead of a normal ability. It is not the normal \"evade\" healing, as Onyxia never evades and can be attacked normally while she heals. It has been reported that she heals when she targets characters on the walls of the cave, but the heal has also been reported when there were no characters on the walls. There may be multiple triggers for this bug.\nIn a response to a GM ticket posted on the US Staghelm Realm on October 8, 2006, a GM said that after viewing a fight in which Onyxia bug healed, the heal may have been caused by Onyxia being unable to target players who were on the wall causing her to bug out. The GM also stated that this bug is not being considered for correction at this time.\nMelee in phase 2.\nIt seems that in phase 2, Onyxia will now sit down and melee attack people. She can then be tanked and melee damaged like if she wasn't flying. As of Patch 2.3, this bug seems to be fixed now which means you can melee her even while in the air, but Onyxia will not sit down and melee attack anymore.\nWander off.\nSometimes, Onyxia's aggro table disappears and she starts wandering around the room, without attacking any raid member. This seems to happen in either Phase 1 or 3."}

Onyxia is tauntable.\nPhase Two.\nOnyxia takes off at 65%, has no threat table, cannot be attacked from melee, and uses the following abilities: \nPhase Three.\nOnyxia lands at 40% HP. She regains all her phase one abilities and gains some additional abilities.\nStrategy.\nThis is (still) a very simple encounter overall. For strategy videos of both the 10-man and 25-man encounter, look below the loot table on this page.\nYou ideally want 2 tanks, 2 healers, 3 melee DPS, and 3 ranged DPS for 10 man, and 2 tanks, 5 healers, 8 melee DPS, and 10 ranged DPS for 25 man.\nPhase 1.\nThe tank should run slightly ahead of the rest of the raid and grab Onyxia, quickly turning her away from the raid and then backing off to the Northern wall, where the tank will position themselves with their back to the wall to minimise the effect of the knockback from Wing Buffet. Only the tank should be in front of Onyxia, to minimize damage from fire breath and cleaving.\nDuring phase one, the only damage to the raid should be upon the tank.\nRanged DPS and healers need to stay to either side of her, fairly far back.\nMelee DPS need to stay to either side of her, just within range (which is wider than it looks). If melee DPS is too close to her head, they will be killed by Cleave; if they're too close to her tail, they will be tail swiped, possibly into the whelps, usually resulting in a wipe.\nPhase one ends when Onyxia is reduced to 65% health.\nPhase 2.\nDuring this phase, Onyxia takes to the air and moves randomly around the room, casting Fireball on raid members. There are three main things to watch out for:\nDuring this phase of the encounter ranged DPS should be focused on bringing Onyxia down to 40% to start phase 3, although they must interrupt this to AoE the packs of whelps. Melee dps should focus on killing the Onyxian Lair Guards.\nFor raids looking to complete the &lt;a href=\"Many%20Whelps%21%20Handle%20It%21%20%2810%20player%29\"&gt;Many Whelps! Handle It! (10 player)&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Many%20Whelps%21%20Handle%20It%21%20%2825%20player%29\"&gt;Many Whelps! Handle It! (25 player)&lt;/a&gt; achievements, the instant her feet leave the ground, send one player down each entrance of the egg cave. Each player should look to spawn about 25 eggs, then turn around and exit the cave without doing anything that causes aggro. Note that the 40 whelps she normally spawns \"will still spawn\", so it will take some high-level coordination to AoE down roughly 90 whelps. There is no indication that players have spawned enough whelps until Onyxia dies, so don't be afraid to pop more than 50 eggs.\nPhase 3.\nOnyxia will land on the Southern side of the room and immediately cast Bellowing Roar, causing the raid to run in fear for the next 3 seconds. Finish off whatever adds remain while the tank positions Onyxia. Note that, unlike the level 60 encounter, the tank will have retained aggro on Onyxia from phase 1. It's advisable to ensure that the tank is unaffected by the initial fear, so that Onyxia can be positioned correctly (fear ward, berserker rage, tremor totem).\nPhase 3 is essentially the same as phase one aside from periodic fears, some raid damage from eruption and occasional whelp spawns which are not too dangerous.\nDifferences from level 60.\nOnyxia no longer drops threat between phases 1 and 3, and she is no longer immune to fire effects and abilities.Wing buffet no longer lowers aggro. Deep Breath is cast more often, and the cast time has been increased. Onyxian Lair Guards now spawn in phase 2, and melee can no longer hit Onyxia in phase 2. Lava eruptions happen during the Bellowing Roar fear, not just after it.\nSolo strategy.\nOnyxia is easily soloable in 10-player mode. Just nuke her in phase one (to 65%), dragging her to the northern end of the room. Once she hits 65% health, keep nuking her, as she'll run to the south end of the room to take off. Ideally, get her beneath 40% health so she'll land automatically, which requires taking off 1.2M/5.6M health in 10/25-player mode. If she's not beneath 40% health before she takes off, &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; her up and use whatever ranged abilities are available.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Onyxian%20Whelp\"&gt;Onyxian Whelp&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn no matter what, so gather them up and AoE them down. They have 63K/189K health each. If Onyxia is in phase 2 for longer than 15 seconds, she'll summon an &lt;a href=\"Onyxian%20Lair%20Guard\"&gt;Onyxian Lair Guard&lt;/a&gt; with 189K/630K health that will need to be killed as well. Repeat guards are summoned every 30 seconds thereafter, and if she's up for longer than 90 seconds, she'll summon another wave of whelps.\nOnce she lands to start phase 3, clean up any remaining adds, then finish her off.\nLoot.\nIn addition to the items in the tables below, Onyxia is guaranteed to drop the following each time she is killed:\nVery rarely, she may also drop the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Onyxian%20Drake\"&gt;Reins of the Onyxian Drake&lt;/a&gt; in both 10- and 25-player modes.\nRelated achievements.\nTwo of the new achievements are named after famous sentences taken from the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHtvIYRrgZ04\"&gt;Onyxia Wipe Animation&lt;/a&gt;. \"She Deep Breaths More\" is a nod to the common forum complaint that, after every patch, bugs or intentional changes result in Onyxia &lt;a href=\"Why%20does%20Onyxia%20cast%20Deep%20Breath%3F\"&gt;deep breathing&lt;/a&gt; more often.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It overviewed the raid &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; present in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". The original article is no longer available, but it can still be viewed through online archives (see &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Article.\nThe &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; was among the greatest threats to mortal life the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; has ever known. Led by the fallen &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s ravaged and subverted the &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity and &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; for generations. Yet, during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; (nearly fifteen years ago), Deathwing was defeated by his fellow Aspects and thought destroyed. Though some believe the great leviathan is merely hiding in seclusion, it'is clear he has no direct control over his diabolical flight.\nSince Deathwing's departure, his eldest children have arisen to lead their brethren and recoup their failing numbers. Deathwing's eldest son, the malicious and cunning &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed the burning fortress of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; as his aerie. There, aided by his loyal &lt;a href=\"Dragonspawn\"&gt;Dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, he subverted the remaining &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and ensnared the black dragons not already under his control.\nOne of Nefarian's mightiest supporters is his younger sister, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. A clever, highly intelligent dragon, Onyxia is fond of assuming mortal guises, which she uses to secretly manipulate the affairs of mortal politics and commerce. Though Onyxia is relatively small for a black dragon of her age, she shares the same powers and abilities as the rest of her terrible flight.\nHer searing breath weapon can melt both stone and iron. Her physical attacks, whether bites, scrapes or tail lashes, are lightning quick and nearly unstoppable. When cornered, Onyxia is fond of taking flight and blasting her troublesome prey from above.\nThough Onyxia has been sighted traveling to and from &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, it's rumored that she keeps a secret lair somewhere within the &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;murky swamps&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. It's also whispered that her brood of new eggs is hidden within her lair - awaiting maturation. Should anyone ever threaten Onyxia within &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;her lair&lt;/a&gt; - within distance of her precious eggs - her wrath would be terrible beyond comprehension. . ."}

At certain points, barrels of beer will appear and begin rolling from several directions, but always in a line. At your option, you may try to avoid the barrels (they sting a bit), or click on one as it comes near. Clicking on a barrel will enable you to direct it's path (same controls as walking/running/riding), which should be wherever Ook-Ook is standing. Ram the barrel into him, as it does damage and has an effect on him. Wash rinse and repeat FTW."}

From within the temple's ornate halls, the Red Crane wings out to oppose the despair that spread through the murky Krasarang Wilds like a cancer. But, with the recent arrival of Horde occupation forces, the sacred site has become a fortification, and the Crane's servants hostages.\nLeaders of the Alliance, foremost among them Varian Wrynn, are divided on how to deal with the problem. To remove the Horde from the temple without needlessly sacrificing Alliance lives, you\u2019ll need to lure them out and take them down with carefully placed traps.\nOverview.\nThe scenario takes place along the eastern bank of the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20River\"&gt;Krasarang River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde have holed up in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;, and is ready to charge in to root them out. It is up to and a group of adventurers to lure the Horde troops out of the temple and kill . Adventurers are tasked with helping to set up two of five racial traps between the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Predator%27s%20Perch\"&gt;Predator's Perch&lt;/a&gt;, a hastily-built Alliance camp between the &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Wing%20Refuge\"&gt;Crane Wing Refuge&lt;/a&gt; and the river. \nStage Guide.\nStage 1: Prepare the Defenses.\nAssist the two groups of laborers in the construction of their defenses.\nAs the scenario begins, a short cutscene introduces the situation:\nThere are five racial camps that can build traps: dwarves, gnomes, night elves, jinyu, and pandaren. Interact with any named unit to start construction of a trap. At the trap's location, fan out and help gather supplies by killing mobs or looting objects, then using the looted items back at the trap. The looted items will speed up the pace of construction, which is important, as Varian is only willing to wait for 12 minutes once the first named NPC has been interacted with.\nDwarves.\n can be found found at south of Varian and Tyrande, west of the gnomish camp. The dwarves will set up their trap far to the southeast at , on the path leading from the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Dojan\"&gt;Ruins of Dojan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;. On occasion, an elite unit will attack the camp, stopping all progress.\nGnomes.\n can be found at south of Varian and Tyrande, east of the dwarven camp. The gnomes will set up their trap far to the south at on the path leading from the Temple of the Red Crane to &lt;a href=\"Dawnchaser%20Retreat\"&gt;Dawnchaser Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. On occasion, an elite unit will attack the camp, stopping all progress.\nNight elves.\n can be found at southwest of Tyrande and Varian, next to the lake.\nJinyu.\n can be found at across the lake to the west at &lt;a href=\"Fallsong%20Village\"&gt;Fallsong Village&lt;/a&gt;. The jinyu trap is constructed at immediately north of the Temple of the Red Crane. Kor'kron Paratroopers will occasionally drop in to interrupt construction.\nPandaren.\n can be found at southeast of Tyrande and Varian, asleep at &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Wing%20Refuge\"&gt;Crane Wing Refuge&lt;/a&gt;. The pandaren will set up dragon guns further east at between a small bluff and a tree. The pandaren are prone to falling asleep, but &lt;a href=\"Spirit-Kissed%20Water\"&gt;Spirit-Kissed Water&lt;/a&gt;, looted from water spirits, will awaken Master Brownstone.\nFinal Stage: Kill Commander Skargash.\nDefeat Commander Scargash and reclaim the Temple of the Red Crane.\nOnce both traps have been constructed, Scargash calls in the paratroopers:\nThe grunts will run in and be destroyed by the traps. Ignore them. Head south down to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt; at to find two groups of three elites. Take both groups out and Scargash will jump down and become attackable:\nHeal up, buff up, then start the attack:\nScargash is a level 90 elite with 7,090,000 health and the following abilities:\nKite him around when he gains Blood Rage, otherwise he does nothing special.\nOn victory, Varian, Tyrande, and Chi-Ji run in:\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

You're here on behalf of his friend Volcor then I imagine? If Volcor didn't come himself, he must be injured as well. I hope he recovers quickly.\nGrimclaw is too injured to be moved far and he's going to need some immediate treatment.
