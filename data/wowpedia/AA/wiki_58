They inhabit the city of &lt;a href=\"Ymirheim\"&gt;Ymirheim&lt;/a&gt; in the center of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, which is of most significance to vrykul culture. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul fought each other in the pit of &lt;a href=\"Valhalas\"&gt;Valhalas&lt;/a&gt;; the winners of these combats became one of their Ymirjar, while the loser became a cursed &lt;a href=\"vargul\"&gt;vargul&lt;/a&gt;, an undead creature. Had &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; blown the horns and called for all of the leaders of the Ymirjar and &lt;a href=\"mjordin\"&gt;mjordin&lt;/a&gt; alike, the vrykul would've become a force more powerful than any other within the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. This action would've organized the vrykul nation.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the vrykul still challenge each other in Valhalas, but they\u2019ve no death god to serve, at least. They also mentioned that the vrykul of Ymirheim are no ordinary tall and unpleasant people; as they\u2019re the Ymirjar who won their battles in Valhalas.\nCulture.\nThe concept of ascension is communicated to the vrykul through &lt;a href=\"Vrykul%20Scroll%20of%20Ascension%20%28starter%29\"&gt;a huge scroll made from dragon skin&lt;/a&gt;. The scroll depicts a vrykul thane, surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;angelic-looking beings&lt;/a&gt;, ascending into the heavens and transcending death. A mysterious, &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;darkened figure&lt;/a&gt; looms large in the picture's background.\nThe process is very similar to the ascension to become &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, implying that the Lich King created a dark, twisted version of the vrykul's own religion to suit his ends.\nSpeculation.\nWhat \"ascension\" exactly implies is unclear. Some Ymirjar are &lt;a href=\"frost%20vrykul\"&gt;frost vrykul&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; classification, others are frost vrykul with the &lt;a href=\"Humanoid\"&gt;Humanoid&lt;/a&gt; classification, several frost vrykul has been shown not to be Ymirjar at all, and there are also Ymirjar vargul despite vargul being said to be the losers of the challenges for ascension.\nIt is possible that the rewards for ascension are becoming \"good\" undead like the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s are (and in opposition to the flawed vargul), or that the vrykul are cleansed of the flaws of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. It is also possible that simply the honor of being part of the Lich King's elite warrior caste and living in Ymirheim could be considered a reward by the vrykul.\nThere is also the matter of , who is a &lt;a href=\"flesh%20giant\"&gt;flesh giant&lt;/a&gt; despite his title indicating importance to the Ymirjar."}

Millennia later, Yogg-Saron also corrupted the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt;, forcing its &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; creators to cut it down, but not before the Old God secretly managed to open a gateway into the ethereal spirit world known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and plant the seed of corruption that would later grow into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nYogg-Saron made its first appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" as the final &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar raid instance&lt;/a&gt;, which was implemented in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1\"&gt;patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt;. It serves as one of the secondary antagonists in \"\". Yogg-Saron seemingly later returns in , its whispers heard throughout the halls of Ulduar once again.\nBiography.\nOne of the greatly malevolent and ancient entities known only as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, Yogg-Saron held chaotic tyranny over the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the very distant past, and was responsible for the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; to \"facilitate assimilation\" of the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt;' creations. When the Titans waged war against the Old Gods and shattered their citadels, they found that the infestation of the entities had grown so severe that destroying the Old Gods would also lead to the annihilation of Azeroth. Instead, the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; took measures to neutralize the Old Gods' power and bind them within Azeroth for the remainder of its existence. Yogg-Saron was sealed away within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; in the far northern reaches of the infant world, and had six watchers assigned to it who served as wardens for its near-eternal imprisonment; the &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;Titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt;s known as &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;. Although he was imprisoned, it was incompletely; as his black blood runs through the whole continent, crystallizing into &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; and corrupting all it touches. His whispers escaped with the saronite, tempting many to madness, including the keeper Loken.\nIn time Loken would have an affair with &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, the wife of his brother Thorim. Yogg-Saron, from his prison within Ulduar, muddled Loken's thoughts and made him lash out at Sif, scared at the thought of losing her, and he killed her by accident. Horrified at what he had done but too scared to tell Thorim the truth, Loken tricked Thorim into believing that it had been the work of &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;Arngrim&lt;/a&gt;, the king of the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s, turning Thorim against his allies. Loken would stop the war between Thorim's and Arngrim's forces with an army he had created with the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, but unknown to Loken, Yogg-Saron had planted the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; inside the forge, which would slowly convert titan-forged into flesh and could also spread to those forged before the curse was created.\nWith Thorim retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, Loken who was desperate to cover his actions, even if it meant using Yogg-Saron's power to do so, for if &lt;a href=\"Algalon\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt; or the Pantheon ever found out his life would be forfeit. He arranged the death of &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;, making it look like a lab accident, though Mimiron's &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt; followers would create a new mechagnome body to house the Keeper's soul. Loken subdued &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting them into complacency with Yogg-Saron. He convinced the titan-forged &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to imprison &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Designate, within his &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the title of Prime Designate that was rightfully Odyn's in the process. Loken expected &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; to come up from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;the south&lt;/a&gt; and investigate what was going on, but Ra never arrived. This is because he had discovered that the Pantheon was dead, killed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and had locked himself up in the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; in despair. Afterward, Loken exiled all titan-forged from Ulduar and retreated into the depths of the complex.\nFor thousands of years the imprisoned Yogg-Saron was unable to do more than keeping the Keepers, Loken included, quiet and complacent inside Ulduar. His grasp on them was tenuous, and convincing them to directly help the Old God had proven fruitless in the past. It was not until &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; of the Old God-worshiping &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated Ulduar and weakened Yogg-Saron's chains that the entity's influence on the Keepers increased, becoming strong as iron. Yogg-Saron commanded Loken to create a new army from the Forge of Wills. In Loken's hands, the forge churned out legions of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who sought only bloodshed and war.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; discovered the truth about the death of his wife &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, killed by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim brought war to his treacherous brother with the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s serving the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;. However, it turned out to have been an elaborate ruse perpetrated by Loken to lure him out of &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, where proximity to his Yogg-Saron granted him the power to overcome Thorim's attack. Thorim and his &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt;, were then captured and taken to Ulduar, so he could be driven mad by Yogg-Saron.\nYogg-Saron was also the source of the corruption that befell the &lt;a href=\"world%20tree\"&gt;world tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil\"&gt;Vordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, after its roots grew too close to the Old God's prison and allowed it and the other Old Gods to create the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. The ancient &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s growing Vordrassil destroyed the tree immediately upon discovering the sheer power behind Yogg-Saron's corrupting influence, however the taint nonetheless continued to spread to the &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s who came to inhabit the tree's stump ages later. They became murderously insane soon after settling within Vordrassil's remains, and began attempting to regrow the afflicted world tree. The Furbolgs also used the dire power still emanating from the tree's stump to resurrect the bear god &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;, who returned to the world as a viciously twisted reflection of his former self.\nDuring the encounter with the Old God in the Ulduar raid, three visions were shown to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s which represented key moments in the history of Azeroth; strongly implying Yogg-Saron could be directly linked to these events somehow. These three visions included the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; (which resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world), the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; (which caused the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;), and a vision of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; torturing &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; (the man who would become the new Lich King after &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s death). During this last vision, the voice of Yogg-Saron could be heard proclaiming: \"He will learn--no king rules forever! Only death is eternal!\", a prophecy of the Old God that would come to pass with Arthas' defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;, and the words of which are eerily repeated by &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit as his final words to his dying son. The adventurers of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, with some help from &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, then defeated Yogg-Saron.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Ulduar to meet &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, saronite vapors flooded Ulduar's antechamber and faceless ones attacked them as an unknown voice, presumably related to Yogg-Saron given the location and saronite, whispered in their minds.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; declared that Azeroth was made free of the grasp of the Old Gods, suggesting that a future return of Yogg-Saron is unlikely.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that although Yogg-Saron had long been defeated, its influence still lingers in places where it once held power, such as &lt;a href=\"Whisper%20Gulch\"&gt;Whisper Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. Its whispers are still heard around Northrend and throughout Ulduar, though it remains physically imprisoned in Ulduar and its influence seems to be contained.\nSaronite and the Scourge.\nThroughout &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; deposits of an &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Evil%23Notes\"&gt;unnatural&lt;/a&gt; ore named \"&lt;a href=\"Saronite\"&gt;Saronite&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found, which is called the \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Blood%20of%20Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Black Blood of Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;\" by the &lt;a href=\"Tuskarr\"&gt;Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; people and who advise any who will listen to keep their distance from it. Saronite is known to drive any that are repeatedly exposed to it to &lt;a href=\"Deranged%20Explorer\"&gt;violent insanity&lt;/a&gt;, and it appears to be a type of byproduct of the Old God's physical manifestation. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; mine extensively for this dread ore; It is used in their fuel, armament, weapons and most notably in the construction of their buildings, including &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; questing revealed, however, that the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; of the Scourge mysteriously utter the name \"Yogg-Saron\" with tremendous hatred and contempt.\nBlizzard representatives have stated that they feel the connection between Yogg-Saron and the Lich King ended up being poorly expressed in-game, but added that it \"had a lot to do with the ability for mortals to become corrupted.\"\nComposition.\n\"Yogg-Saron\" is a composition of several different NPCs in the Ulduar encounter:\nQuotes.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe whispers heard inside &lt;a href=\"Whisper%20Gulch\"&gt;Whisper Gulch&lt;/a&gt; from \"An Unknown Voice\" are listed in the game files as \"Creature - Yogg-Saron Whisper\". They sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun%23The%20Whispers%20of%20C%27Thun\"&gt;whispers of C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, the first named &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the 5-man &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27kahet\"&gt;Ahn'kahet&lt;/a&gt; instance, which features a desecrated &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt; temple now dedicated to Yogg-Saron, \"A Mysterious Voice\" can sometimes be heard whispering to players at random. This voice most likely is Yogg-Saron's as well:\nCataclysm.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; allows for players to assemble &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20Archaeology%20Fragment\"&gt;fragments&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=\"Puzzle%20Box%20of%20Yogg-Saron\"&gt;ancient Nerubian puzzle box&lt;/a&gt; that is somehow related to Yogg-Saron's dread and mysterious nature. The puzzle appears impossible to solve properly, but with every attempt the player makes the Old God will whisper chilling knowledge to them:\nIn Hearthstone.\nYogg-Saron appears as in the &lt;a href=\"Whispers%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;Whispers of the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Its flavor text reads: \"I spell your doom...

This eldritch creature could have been a manifestation or extension of Yogg Saron, similar to &lt;a href=\"Il%27gynoth\"&gt;Il'gynoth&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisions.\nDuring the encounter in Ulduar, players encounter three visions in Yogg-Saron's mind:\nThe Old God's relation with these events is unknown."}

Periodically portals will appear which grant players access to the Brain of Yogg-Saron, while inside they must dispel illusions in order to escape, before they are afflicted with Induce Madness. When the Brain of Yogg-Saron reaches 30% health remaining, Yogg Saron's Shadowy Barrier will fall and he can be assaulted directly.\nAbilities.\nThe Keepers of Ulduar.\nSpeak to the Keepers of Ulduar and they will join the battle and provide additional buffs and benefits while engaged with Yogg-Saron.\nStage One: The Lucid Dream.\nAs Sara assaults her enemies Guardians of Yogg-Saron will periodically join the battle.\nStage Two: Descent Into Madness.\nYogg-Saron reveals himself and begins his assault on his enemies mind.\nStage Three: True Face of Death.\nWhen the Brain of Yogg-Saron reaches 30% health remaining, Yogg Saron's Shadowy Barrier will fall and he can be assaulted directly.\nHard Mode.\nBattling Yogg-Saron without the aid of some or all of the Keepers of Ulduar for assistance is possible, but extremely dangerous.\nStrategy.\nPhase One: Sara.\nSara cannot be attacked directly, and casts the following spells randomly on the raid and the Guardians:\nSara is stationary in the center of the room. The only way to damage her is the AoE damage from dying Guardians (see below). Green-yellow clouds move in a circular pattern through the room (always the same path at the same speed), but they are faster than it seems. When players (not pets or totems) touch a cloud, a Guardian of Yogg-Saron spawns. This must be avoided at all cost. The golden rule of this phase is to immediately stop everything if a cloud comes close, and move away to a safe spot. 5 seconds DPS / Healing lost doesn't matter at all, while an extra Guardian means a substantial increase in difficulty. As with many such rules, it sounds simple, but actually doing it requires high situational awareness from everybody, and leads to many failures.\nGuardians also spawn automatically at an increasing rate, starting at about one per 40 seconds, increasing up to one per 10 seconds. Since 8 Guardians have to be killed close to Sara in order to end the phase, it may be practical to cause one (or even two) voluntary extra spawns early in the phase - this reduces the number of Guardians left over at the start of phase 2. It is ok to have 2 Guardians up after the transition, 3 is still possible, 4 is a likely wipe.\nGuardians of Yogg-Saron.\nAbilities:\nShadow Nova is the only way to damage Sara. Eight Guardians have to be killed close to her to start the next phase.\nDark Volley should be interrupted.\nFerrying.\nThe safest method is to have one tank in the center of the room, a small ranged group (3-4 damage dealers plus one healer) within range of that tank and the majority of the raid at the outer edge, near the door, where it's safe from clouds. The offtanks bring Guardians to the raid where they are nuked down to about 25% (don't use &lt;a href=\"DOT\"&gt;DOT&lt;/a&gt;s). Then, the offtanks bring the Guardians to the tank near Sara, who taunts them. When the Guardian is close enough to Sara, the small ranged group kills it. It's possible to have the tanks trade places (and not taunt the Guardians). Taunt can be resisted, but it reduces the distance which the tanks have to move through the clouds.\nThis method is fairly safe because only the tanks and the dedicated ranged group must dodge clouds. Unfortunately, DPS output is low. For this reason, it's hardly ever used in 10 player or hard modes, but it's normally used by 25 player groups learning the encounter.\nStandard.\nThe normally used method is to put tanks and melee on top of Sara (tanking and killing Guardians there), while ranged and healers move around the outside. This method increases effective DPS on the Guardians but requires everyone in the raid to dodge clouds.\nPhase Two: Tentacles and the Brain.\nQuickly kill any remaining Guardians from phase 1. \nThere are two areas, outside and inside the &lt;a href=\"Mind%27s%20Eye%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Mind's Eye&lt;/a&gt; (Yogg-Saron's brain). During this phase, Yogg-Saron regularly opens portals to the Mind's Eye. After four portal phases, the spawn rate of the tentacles outside increases substantially. Phase two ends when the Brain of Yogg-Saron's health inside the Mind's Eye hits 30%. Throughout the phase, all raid members not inside should concentrate close together while killing Crusher Tentacles.\nOutside: Tentacles.\nAbilities:\nCrusher Tentacle:\nCorruptor Tentacle:\nConstrictor Tentacles:\nThe tentacles should all be killed as quickly as possible.\nEverybody capable of doing so must dispel the debuffs from the Corruptor Tentacles. They do not deal melee damage and should be interrupted and stunned while being killed by melee.\nMelee damage dealers should generally stay away from Crushers. One melee damage dealer should carefully hit the Crushers regularly, to disrupt their damage reduction cast (but not too frequently, so they don't gain the damage increase buff).\nConstrictor Tentacles randomly pick up players from the raid. Victims may continue to cast and are freed by killing the tentacle. They do not cancel or prevent Druid ShapeShifting anymore. ( 3.2.2 )\nSara hovers above Yogg-Saron's main body and casts various spells:\nShe spams Psychosis without pause on random raid members unless she casts something else. The other three abilities each have a 30-second cooldown and are used randomly when available.\nBrain Linked players get a linking beam between them which is red when they are too far apart and yellow when they are safe. Entering a portal ends Brain Link.\nPortals.\n60 seconds into phase 2, and then regularly after 80 seconds (= 20 seconds after the preceding portal phase), Yogg-Saron emotes: \"MADNESS WILL CONSUME YOU!\" and opens portals into the Mind's Eye (4 for 10 players, 10 for 25). They spawn in equal distances around Yogg-Saron's body. Each portal can be used by only one player, and they despawn after a rather short time. Using all the portals quickly and efficiently is the key to this phase.\nSince ranged are more effective outside, mostly melee DPS should enter. In 25 player, one healer should also join. The assigned players should make sure their sanity is high enough. It's a good idea to pre-assign portals so that players can move to the portal spawn points before they actually appear.\nInside: The Mind's Eye.\nAbilities:\nLaughing Skull:\nInfluence Tentacle:\nBrain of Yogg-Saron\nAfter the portals are open, Yogg-Saron's brain starts a 60-second cast of \"Induce Madness\", which turns everybody in the Mind's Eye insane upon completion.\nAfter passing through the portals, players enter one of three possible illusions. Each of them is a circular room with a door to the brain room right at the spot where players enter. The door is blocked, in order to open it, the Influence Tentacles in the first room need all to be killed. Additionally, laughing skulls float around. Characters looking at one of the skulls are affected by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D64167\"&gt;Lunatic Gaze&lt;/a&gt; (a purple beam) and lose sanity. To avoid this, players should look towards the outside wall of the room, and strafe. Use the camera controls to look around; don't physically turn your character.\nInfluence tentacles are disguised as neutral mobs and always stand along the outer wall around the room. All attackable mobs in the room are tentacles. Depending on the vision, the tentacles are disguised as &lt;a href=\"Deathsworn%20Zealot\"&gt;Deathsworn Zealot&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"Suit%20of%20Armor\"&gt;Suits of Armor&lt;/a&gt;; or &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Consort\"&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Consort\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Consort\"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Consort\"&gt;Ruby Consort&lt;/a&gt;s. Damage dealers should take one quick tour around the room (along the wall), and hit each Influence tentacle once or twice. After moving a full circle, all tentacles should be dead, and players are back at the door.\nKilling all influence tentacles has several positive effects. Inside, the door to the brain room opens. Outside, all tentacles are stunned, Sara stops casting and no additional tentacles spawn until the Induce Madness cast is finished. It's essential to kill the influence tentacles very quickly.\nAfter entering the brain room, players should look for the portal back outside near the rear wall. It's a good idea to stand next to that portal before nuking the brain. When about 5 seconds are left on the Induce Madness cast timer, quickly use it.\nPhase Three: The Head of the Beast.\nAbilities:\nHeroic 3 Keepers or Less Only:\nNote: the epic music and voicework that begin when the phase is initiated are worth turning on game sounds at least once.\nWhen phase 3 starts all tentacles left over from phase 2 remain active. Therefore, no Crushers must be up - some communication is needed, don't kill the brain until all Crushers are dead. A few Corruptor Tentacles can be ignored as long as the debuffs are dispelled.\nPhase 3 ends when Yogg-Saron dies. Yogg-Saron has no aggro list and is unable to move.\nPlayers should stand near the green pillars if &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29%23Keepers%27%20powers\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; is helping to be able to restore sanity. All healers should face away from Yogg-Saron at all times. The caster camp is best located about 20 yards away from the melee camp. Melee DPS can get knocked back by Yogg-Saron if they run into his body.\nLunatic Gaze is used every 12 seconds, it creates purple beams between Yogg-Saron and the players facing it. Healers should turn away the whole time, while tanks and DPS should get into the habit of regularly turning away.\nYogg-Saron spawns (and heals) increasing numbers of Immortal Guardians, which eventually kills the raid. Ranged DPS should focus on Yogg-Saron through the whole phase, while melee and tanks deal with the Guardians, although melee may require help from ranged on the Guardians.\nIf the raid is using three or fewer Keepers in 25 player mode Yogg-Saron emotes, \"Yogg-Saron opens his mouth wide!\" while casting Deafening Roar (about once per minute). This is the cue to throw the into Yogg-Saron's maw to recover the upon his defeat. Deafening Roar is best dealt with by Holy Paladins rotating &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Mastery\"&gt;Aura Mastery&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Concentration%20Aura\"&gt;Concentration Aura&lt;/a&gt; up.\nImmortal Guardians.\nAbilities:\nYogg-Saron spawns Immortal Guardians every 10\u201315 seconds. These have to be picked up by the tanks and DPSed down quickly. At full health, they hit a well-geared tank for 25k. When their health deceases, so does their damage output.\nImmortal Guardians can only be killed if Thorim is helping. Without him, they need to be tanked through the whole phase. Every 45 seconds, Yogg-Saron marks one or more Guardians with Shadow Beacons. 10 seconds later, it launches shadow missiles at the marked Guardians. Upon impact, the missiles explode and give the \"Empowering Shadows\" buff to all Guardians and Yogg-Saron within 20 yards. This means that at the moment when the missiles are launched, all marked Guardians must be 20 yards away from Yogg-Saron, else it gets healed. The healing Guardians receive can be reduced by a rogue with &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fan%20of%20Knives\"&gt;Fan of Knives&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo keep the Guardians at low health (and thus at low damage output), they should be tanked in a tight group near Yogg-Saron, so that one or two ranged DPS can AoE the Guardians and Yogg-Saron. When the Guardians get beacons, they must be quickly dragged away until the missiles explode, then they can be brought back.\nSolo strategy.\nIn order to be able to solo this encounter, players must have an ability that does not have a facing requirement (like a paladin's &lt;a href=\"Judgment\"&gt;Judgment&lt;/a&gt;), or an area-of-effect spell to handle the Constrictor Tentacles in phase two. If that requirement is met, the encounter is a race to do enough damage before the character's sanity is lost.\nThe first time soloing the encounter, consider having at least Freya active, as her Sanity Well will help make the encounter go much smoother while learning it. However, to have a chance at getting &lt;a href=\"Mimiron%27s%20Head\"&gt;Mimiron's Head&lt;/a&gt;, players must run the encounter in &lt;a href=\"Alone%20in%20the%20Darkness%20%2825%20player%29\"&gt;Alone in the Darkness (25 player)&lt;/a&gt; mode. To deactivate a keeper after activating it, exit Ulduar and reset the instance.\nIn the Sara phase, run around through gas clouds to force-spawn Guardians of Yogg-Saron in addition to the guardians that spawn naturally. Gather eight, then stand underneath Sara and AoE all the adds to get their Shadow Nova ability to kill her.\nIn phase two, start killing tentacles, as Yogg-Saron's body is immune to damage until phase three starts. When a Constrictor Tentacle inevitably grabs the character, target the tentacle, and use any ability that does not have a facing requirement on it or target the ground under it with an AoE. Druids may wish to keep a &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; up and stand in it.\nAs soon as a portal to the Mind's Eye opens up (after 60 seconds and every 80 seconds after that), enter it. Face away from the Laughing Skull's Lunatic Gaze and kill all of the Influence Tentacles in the main room with quick attacks. Once they're all dead, enter the second room (the door of which is right where the player spawns) and start attacking the Brain of Yogg-Saron. As soon as the outside portals to enter mind's eye open, the brain begins a 60-second Induce Madness cast, which will instantly cause all players still in the mind's eye to lose what's left of their sanity. Do as much damage to the brain as possible and exit the room using the portals to the surface with a few seconds before the cast completes. Getting the brain to 30% will start phase three.\nIn phase three, focus on Yogg-Saron and kill it as quickly as possible. Every 12 seconds the body will cast Lunatic Gaze, so be sure to physically phase away from the body while the cast is in progress to retain what little sanity the character has left.\nQuotes.\nSound Files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The Skalaxi leader, Yonzi, learned of a critical cache of Apexis artifacts buried beneath the ruins of an Apexis settlement on the northwest coast of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, now occupied by the brutish &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; slaves. Ogron were too violent to barter and bargain with, but the ogres were more intelligent than the ogron and, more importantly, angered by their enslavement.\nThe arakkoa approached the ogres in secret and began to teach them the ways of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. Because the ogres were descendants of &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, who had in turn been a creation of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, they were naturally attuned to the arcane. The arakkoa had never seen new spellcasting techniques developed so effortlessly and were delighted. One of the first ogres to master the power was &lt;a href=\"Gorgog%20the%20Gronnslayer\"&gt;Gog&lt;/a&gt;, who the arakkoa believed to be the perfect leader to incite rebellion. Gog did rebel, but not against the ogron: he targeted the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, whom the ogron and ogres revered and feared as gods. Though stunned, the arakkoa could not argue with the results. Gog did not only kill one gronn with his magic, but several. By his fifth, stories of his deeds were known to all captive ogres on Draenor, erasing their fear of both gronn and ogron. Under Gog, the ogres rose up against their ogron warlords, igniting a bloody war.\nAfter the ogres had won their freedom, the Skalaxi quietly moved in, searching for Apexis relics in the ruins of the city. Gog quickly put an end to it. As a sorcerer himself, he had no interest in giving away any potential source of power. Gog declared himself \"Gorgog\" (\"King Gog\") and renamed the city to &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt; (\"Throne of the King\"), and commanded Yonzi and the Skalaxi to leave on pain of death. The arakkoa did leave, but not for long. Yonzi and his arakkoa were infuriated and they decided to take the land by force. They launched a surprise attack on Goria in the dead of night, but Gorgog and his apprentice arcanists, as well as the countless newly freed ogres, fought back. The arakkoa were defeated while Yonzi was captured and suffered a slow, gruesome death. Despite the promise of undiscovered Apexis crystals, further arakkoa incursions into Gorian lands were few and far between afterward. In the slowly expanding &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Apexis crystals became highly prized and eagerly sought out by ogre sorcerers."}

Their numbers are endless and their power is beyond reckoning, and Yor'sahj intends to reap a grim reward for his faithful service.\"\nStrategy.\nSince the colors of the mounds in the environment correspond to the oozes that spawn from them, it may make coordinating the encounter easier by placing &lt;a href=\"World%20Marker\"&gt;World Marker&lt;/a&gt;s in front of the ooze spawn points.\nBeginners should use two tanks who take turns to let the Void Bolt stacks fall off. Raids with more powerful healers and tanks can use a single tank if they can survive eight or nine stacks of Void Bolt.\nWhen the oozes spawn, the raid leader can call out a single ooze so the raid can target and destroy it quickly. When one ooze dies, the remaining two become invulnerable and give the boss a buff or ability.\nGlobule Combinations and Kill Priority.\nThe simplest kill priority is:\nIf your healers have nerves of steel and your tanks know their cooldowns, you can use:\nTypically, a single healer is designated as the Purple healer. This healer is chosen for his ability to land very large direct heals while avoiding overhealing.\nWith five colors of oozes, there are a theoretical 20 combinations. Not all combinations have been observed, however. The ones that have, are:\nWith this shortened list, a kill priority of Purple &gt; Green &gt; Yellow will suffice for normal difficulty and Purple &gt; Yellow &gt; Black covers the Raid Finder difficulty.\nThere are special cases of Purple, Blue, and a third color, that can be handled differently if the healers think they can handle the Deep Corruption without blowing up the raid:\nThis alternate strategy is a little dangerous, because as the Void Bolt DoT stacks on the tank, keeping him alive might trigger enough detonations to wipe the raid.\nHeroic.\nThe biggest difference in Heroic difficulty is that four globules spawn each time instead of three. The raid kills one and has to survive the effects of three globule enhancements.\nA tactical change is that you should not kill the first &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Void\"&gt;Mana Void&lt;/a&gt; that spawns. This &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Void\"&gt;Mana Void&lt;/a&gt; is treated as a battery to shorten the time necessary between the fabrication of a new &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Void\"&gt;Mana Void&lt;/a&gt; and the restoration of mana. When you know a Blue phase is coming, do some damage to the old Mana Void in preparation but do not kill it. When Yor'sahj actually creates a new &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Void\"&gt;Mana Void&lt;/a&gt;, destroy the old one quickly to restore the mana of all nearby players. The new &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Void\"&gt;Mana Void&lt;/a&gt; becomes the next mana battery.\nIt is common to use one tank and three healers in Heroic mode. As the healers' gear improves you can switch to two healers.\nHealing in this fight can be very taxing. The single tank gets up to eight stacks of Void Bolt, and during Black phases, the Forgotten Ones are beating on the rest of the raid. Yellow and Black together results in two waves of adds, and it is important for the raid to be powerful enough to destroy the remaining adds \"and\" destroy one of the incoming bloods simultaneously. Your tank will be using survival cooldowns quite often, and timing can often be the difference between success and failure (although luck is usually a larger factor for beginners).\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nTrivia.\nYor'sahj is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Corey%20Smith\"&gt;Christopher Corey Smith&lt;/a&gt;."}

He holds great respect amongst his people as well as his fellow Alliance members. He is glad to help the Alliance and his dwarven brethren in any way he can, although he seems to be a little troubled with allowing &lt;a href=\"frost%20dwarf\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt; into others' affairs that might cost their lives.\nYorg resides in &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, but leaves as soon as a player finishes the quest line, where he is involved, and he is actually revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, who was long-thought to have been killed by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Velog%20Icebellow\"&gt;Velog Icebellow&lt;/a&gt; takes Yorg's place while he is gone.\nHistory.\nYorg's past is unknown according to &lt;a href=\"Velog%20Icebellow\"&gt;Velog Icebellow&lt;/a&gt;. Years ago, he was actually found by a party of &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;Frostborn&lt;/a&gt; that Velog's father was a part of, as they returned from a trek across the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; during an extremely harsh blizzard. They followed a trail of blood-soaked snow and found a lone dwarf wandering that spoke a dialect they could not understand. He was a strange dwarf, something they never had seen before, a &lt;a href=\"mountain%20dwarf\"&gt;mountain dwarf&lt;/a&gt;. Not about to let their new-found cousin freeze to death, they took him along with them and continued on.\nNot long after, an extremely large &lt;a href=\"jormungar\"&gt;jormungar&lt;/a&gt; burst out of the snow. It came out of nowhere and swallowed one of the Frostborn before they could react. Velog's father thought they were all doomed before he heard a furious roar behind him, and turned to see the mountain dwarf &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20avatar\"&gt;growing in size, his skin getting a stone-like texture and his hands sizzling with lightning&lt;/a&gt;.\nYorg had smashed the beast's head with a &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt; in his powerful state, the jormungar's head barely connected to its body as it collapsed dead. The Frostborn were in wonder and awe, and Velog's father named him Yorg, a name reserved for heroes of the Frostborn, as he had no name when they encountered him and he had earned this title.\nYorg eventually became King of the Frostborn years later, as he had trained the Frostborn into even greater warriors than they could have boasted during &lt;a href=\"Thunderfall\"&gt;their war&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s. The defeat of the huge jormungar at his hands became an example for all Frostborn as their hardest test of strength for warriors of the Frostborn is to defeat something much larger then them, such as a giant, a dragon, or a jormungar as a testament that their size is not their weakness.\nMuradin Bronzebeard.\nIt is ultimately revealed that Yorg Stormheart is in fact &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, long thought to have been killed when &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; took up the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, Muradin was merely wounded and had lost his memory, and so was willing to take on the persona of Yorg Stormheart.\nTrivia.\nHe may be named after Yor from \"\". He is also a proud warrior like Yorg and doesn't know anything about his heritage."}

He is a &lt;a href=\"Pandarian%20champion\"&gt;Pandarian champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nYorik may really be &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Smite\"&gt;Mr. Smite&lt;/a&gt; in disguise. Yorik's aggro quote \"You! What are you doing here?\" implies he has met the player before, and in &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;a different place&lt;/a&gt;. Yorik also has a very similar voice to Mr. Smite, and his clothing and coloration also appear very similar. Most notably of all, Yorik drops &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Smite%27s%20Brass%20Compass\"&gt;Mr. Smite's Brass Compass&lt;/a&gt;, his possession of which is otherwise hard to explain. Yorik is also found near a treasure chest and a miniature boat, both of which may be references to Mr. Smite being on the Defias juggernaught in the Deadmines.\nDespite sharing abilities with yaungol champions, Yorik also appears to be a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and not a &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt;. Key differences include Yorik's lack of the large upward-pointing horns possessed by yaungol champions, as well as other features such their large nose rings and hairy manes on their shoulders, arms, and legs. He also sports very simple bracers similar to those of Mr. Smite, as opposed to the large, chunky bracers worn by yaungol.\nYorik's name may be inspired by the deceased character 'Yorick' from 's \"\", the discovery of whose skull evokes the well-known monologue beginning \"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio.\" This choice of name may in itself be referring to Yorik's \"previous life\" as Mr. Smite.\nIf Yorik is indeed Mr. Smite, this leaves a significant amount of room for speculation as to how he arrived in Pandaria in his current incarnation. Apparently slain by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Smite's re-appearance suggests that he somehow survived the encounter, and managed to find his way to the new continent - as early, if not earlier, than the Alliance and Horde adventurers. It can be speculated that his possession of yaungol abilities suggests some connection with the yaungol, perhaps involving training with or even adoption into a yaungol tribe. Nonetheless, Yorik is found alone in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, far from the nearest yaungol settlements. Yorik is also neutral when encountered, unlike almost all yaungol in the game, suggesting he may not share their sha-infested rage. Regarding his change of name, it is possible that Yorik Sharpeye is in fact Mr. Smite's true and original tauren name, with the latter merely a nickname taken on when joining the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;; alternatively, Mr. Smite may simply have invented the new name in order to escape his past. Regardless of whatever long and arduous travels may have led Mr. Smite to his new home in Pandaria, it is sadly not long before adventurers find him again, once more determined to prise his precious booty from his cold, dead hands.\n's flavor text in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" references the issue.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Bardu%20Sharpeye\"&gt;Bardu Sharpeye&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Hark%20Sharpeye\"&gt;Hark Sharpeye&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is the keeper of the &lt;a href=\"Aggramar%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Vault of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; and the objective of the Trial of Might, one of the three trials required to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and claim the mythic &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; completed his trial, he used his &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;ill-begotten&lt;/a&gt; powers to sunder Yotnar's physical body, enter the Vault, and gain knowledge of the other trials without the watcher's blessing. A &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; would however retrieve Yotnar's pieces and make him whole again, before gaining his blessing and passing the trial.\nBackground.\nWatcher Yotnar was a fickle one. Challengers came from far and wide seeking the trials, but the watcher chose not to see. To catch his eye, one needed to show him they were worth being seen. Some of these challengers continuously await in camps throughout the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Sword\"&gt;Valley of the Sword&lt;/a&gt;, and brought with them offerings. The &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; brought the heads of the most powerful challengers to Yotnar as well as their offerings and tributes, so that he may see them. But as they approached the Vault's entrance, they witnessed God-King Skovald holding Yotnar's decapitated head and throwing it away, claiming that his ancient rites and rituals meant nothing to him and that he would conquer the trials and take the Aegis for his own.\nYotnar appreciated the outsider's gifts and offerings, as it demonstrated that they showed great respect to the trials. Yotnar explained the hero that to seek Aggramar's Aegis, a champion had to complete three great trials before riding into glorious battle through the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. Here at the Vault they would find the knowledge of the trials. Yotnat thus sent them to find the archives for the Trial of Valor and the Trial of Will, and learn about them.\nHowever, the watcher still couldn't allow the next contender, the champion, to pass through the Vault while he remained unwhole. In addition, Skovald's forces had scattered Yotnar's pieces through the plateau which they were desecrating.\nThe champion thus retrieved both of Yotnar's arms, legs and feet, as well as his hand. Once whole again, he offered his gratitude to the outsider, and deemed them worthy to take on the trials. He told the champion to go into the Vault and find the last archive for the trial they had to undertake, the Trial of Might. Once within, Yotnar revealed that he was in fact the trial himself: as the keeper of the vault, it was his duty to test the might of those who wished to proceed. The titanic watcher was eventually beaten, again, to his great surprise. Decades of waiting without a worthy challenger, only to be beaten twice in the same day. The champion, having thus passed the Trial of Might, and for having shown true valor, received the Blessing of the Watchers. The hero held aloft their weapon, which was additionally blessed with the power of the Vault's keeper himself."}

Here, take this controller. I want you to activate it and give my newly-invented Scrap Reaver X6000 a spin.\nJust stay nearby! The controller is tied to my console here, and if you get too far away, the robot will cease to function.\nTry out everything... I'll be watching and calibrating its servos based upon your test run.\nProgress.\nWhat did you think? Still needs some tweaking, eh?\nCompletion.\nWell, my boy that certainly was exciting!

After all, you just saved Area 52 and the X-52 Nether-Rocket from certain doom!\nDefeating Negatron.\nWhile this is a three man group quest, it can be soloed or two-manned. It is preferable to have a healer or be a healing class as it is hard to get bandages to get past more than a few ticks. Melee classes can DPS &lt;a href=\"Negatron\"&gt;Negatron&lt;/a&gt; to help the fight go faster.\n&lt;a href=\"Negatron\"&gt;Negatron&lt;/a&gt; will automatically aggro on you once he becomes fightable so you'll want to attack with the &lt;a href=\"Scrap%20Reaver%20X6000\"&gt;Scrap Reaver X6000&lt;/a&gt; and use the Reaver's ability that does 3000-5000 damage and produces ~4500 threat. If you are a healer or you have one in your group, it is imperative to keep the Reaver's threat up. Each of the Reaver's abilities have a 10 second cooldown on them.\nEvery 20\u201325 seconds &lt;a href=\"Negatron\"&gt;Negatron&lt;/a&gt; will do an Earthquake. Earthquake does ~550 damage per second to everyone in melee range. To stop this, use the &lt;a href=\"Scrap%20Reaver%20X6000\"&gt;Scrap Reaver X6000&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Slam\" ability to stun him for 2 seconds and stop the earthquake damage. Your own stuns will not affect him. Close to the end of the fight, &lt;a href=\"Negatron\"&gt;Negatron&lt;/a&gt; will enrage, upping damage done to the Reaver.\nMake sure to keep the &lt;a href=\"Scrap%20Reaver%20X6000\"&gt;Scrap Reaver X6000&lt;/a&gt; healed up and give it some buffs. This fight shouldn't be too hard once you have the rotation down of doing 3000-5000 damage/4500 threat, stunning during earthquake, and attacking. Druids should have little to no problems soloing this quest.\nTrivia.\nThe quest name is a reference to Isaac Asimov's \"I, Robot\" short story."}

{"id": "512422", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=512422", "title": "The best reason to play Paladin", "text": "The best reason to play Paladin was originally a humorous player-made post on the official forums.\nPost.\nI've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.\nPaladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit \"1\", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.\nBecause a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.\nDPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.\nAs for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.\nIn addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.\nIt saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins."}

Armed with his trusty arsenal, Woo Ping rushed to face the beast. A great battle commenced between dragon and man. Buildings were torched and crushed, and civilians ran for cover the best they could while Woo Ping and Deathwing exchanged blows.\nWoo Ping, being the great Weapon Master that he is, took polearm in hand and thrusted it to Deathwing for leverage. He then reached for his trusty sword and with a great leap, launched himself off the lodged polearm and stuck his sword into Deathwing's ribs.\nDeathwing, clearly now infuriated, started to fly while Woo Ping was still grasping his sword to flee from Stormwind. Woo Ping clung on for dear life as the two vacated the city. His location is now unknown.\nIf not for the valiant efforts of Master Woo Ping, Stormwind would be in far greater ruin."}

There is seven of them in total, each having its own name, and seem to somehow protect &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; who is sleeping in &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%27%20Lair\"&gt;his lair&lt;/a&gt;. They are the key to summoning Ragnaros as a boss.\nNotice that the name \"the runes of warding\" is mentioned only once (by &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt;).\nDetails.\nEach rune only appears in one location, and the runes never swap places. Each rune is also guarded by one of Ragnaros' lieutenants, namely &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gehennas\"&gt;Gehennas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shazzrah\"&gt;Shazzrah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Harbinger\"&gt;Sulfuron Harbinger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Golemagg%20the%20Incinerator\"&gt;Golemagg the Incinerator&lt;/a&gt;. The runes are initially active and deactivates one by one when their respective guardians are killed. When all the runes are deactivated, &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt; will spawn. When he is defeated, he will surrender to the player(s) and offer to summon Ragnaros.\nChanges.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, each rune had to be deactivated by \"dousing\" it with either &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Quintessence\"&gt;Eternal Quintessence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aqual%20Quintessence\"&gt;Aqual Quintessence&lt;/a&gt;. These liquids were sold by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther appearances.\nThe runes of warding can also be found on the walls in &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%27%20Lair\"&gt;Ragnaros' Lair&lt;/a&gt;. Game-mechanics-wise, unlike the guarded versions, they do not seem to hold any purpose other than being decorative. Their presence do however indicate, lore-wise, that the runes of warding are connected to Ragnaros. They also appear in the &lt;a href=\"TCG\"&gt;TCG&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core%20%28TCG%29\"&gt;Molten Core Raid Deck&lt;/a&gt;), as well in the as letters.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Lucifron\"&gt;Lucifron&lt;/a&gt; is unique as he is the only boss in the Molten Core which seemingly has no connection (other than being an ally of Ragnaros) to the runes of warding. Although initially present in the instance, he doesn't guard any runes, and it's possible to summon &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt; without killing him. A possible explanation may be that he is actually watching over both Magmadar and the Rune of Kress, as Magmadar is an animal and therefore doesn't possess any real zeal to protect the rune. This theory matches how Lucifron and Magmadar is found on the same location and the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;Tome of Tranquilizing Shot&lt;/a&gt; (given that Lucifron was given the book as a means to keep Magmadar in check). Oddly enough, it is however still possible to kill Magmadar without killing - or even alerting - Lucifron."}

He is part of several gladiators which he participates along with in the arena.\nBackground.\nTheldren was apparently once a member of the mercenary-company &lt;a href=\"The%20Veiled%20Blade\"&gt;The Veiled Blade&lt;/a&gt;. After the failed attempt at (completely) killing &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt;, Theldren left the company with a piece of Lord Valthalak's amulet and became a gladiator for the Dark Iron dwarfs in Blackrock Depths. According to &lt;a href=\"Anthion%20Harmon\"&gt;Anthion Harmon&lt;/a&gt;, another of the former members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Veiled%20Blade\"&gt;The Veiled Blade&lt;/a&gt;, Theldren beat him to an inch of his life when Anthion tried to retrieve Theldren's amulet-piece as Anthion had realized the curse behind it. As such, Theldren is a very violent and egoistic dwarf. Not either concerned with honor and good sportsmanship, he is unwilling to participate in a fair fight. Still, he is a bit of a hot-head and will rush into a fight if his family's honor is being mocked.\nIt is unknown if the gladiators Theldren fight alongside with are also former members of The Veiled Blade. It is however implied that Theldren is their leader by how the refers to them as \"his goons\" (see &lt;a href=\"Theldren%23Trivia\"&gt;#Trivia&lt;/a&gt;), as well as how the &lt;a href=\"Banner%20of%20Provocation\"&gt;Banner of Provocation&lt;/a&gt; is specifically designed for luring him out.\nStrategy.\nTheldren and his fellow gladiators can be summoned using a &lt;a href=\"Banner%20of%20Provocation\"&gt;Banner of Provocation&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Spoils\"&gt;Arena Spoils&lt;/a&gt; will be lootable after their defeat.\nTheldren's team of gladiators includes:\nNotice that not all his gladiators can join him at the same time. He is always accompanied by four of them, and it is random which of them it is. If a player wish to fight all of them, it will require at minimum 2 fights with Theldren (only one fight may be fought each Blackrock Depths-run, thus instance will have to be reset).\nThe fight with Theldren and his gladiators is unique compared to many other boss-fights. While most bosses found in 5-man instances know on average 2-3 abilities, the members of Theldren's group know about 6-7 each. Many of the abilities are also used by player-controlled &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt;, rather than being unique abilities specific to a unique NPC as with most other bosses. This makes the members of Theldren's group similar to real players. Furthermore, the varying purposes of their abilities (some are &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20control\"&gt;CC&lt;/a&gt;, some are &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and the apparent class-roles of the members both in visual looks and acting (Va'jashni is a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, Volida is a ranged &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) makes Theldren's group resemble a organized group of real enemy players, almost as when in an &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, some players claim that the fight is more &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;-like than &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;. This may be intended as Theldren and all his gladiators are also immune to &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;taunts&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the most basic features of PvE while almost nonexistent in PvP.\nThis style of encounter was later repeated in ' with &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Delrissa\"&gt;Priestess Delrissa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, and in ' with the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Champions\"&gt;Faction Champions&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nAggro:\nTrivia.\n\"As a side note, because I know that you'll be interested in knowing, the Banner of Provocation can be used in similar fashion at the arena in Blackrock Depths. Be sure to teach Theldren and his goons a lesson for me every time you get a chance when you're there.\""}

{"id": "48399", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=48399", "title": "Theorycraft", "text": "Theorycraft is the attempt to mathematically analyze game mechanics in order to gain a better understanding of the inner workings of the game. The term originated in the &lt;a href=\"Starcraft\"&gt;Starcraft&lt;/a&gt; community as composite colloquialism between the name &lt;a href=\"Starcraft\"&gt;Starcraft&lt;/a&gt; and Game Theory. For clarification, Game Theory is the analysis of circumstantial and general factors in order to understand the decision making process of individualized and group players for the purposes of creating generally more favorable predictions, behaviors, and overall outcomes.\nUnderstanding theorycraft.\nMany of the terms that we have come to know today have in some way been a result of theorycraft. The term DPS, itself, was one of the first advents of theorycraft as it applies to real-time games. Gearscore is another highly used, yet still incredibly controversial, result of theorycraft. Theorycraft has an impact upon everything from User Interface setup and customization, to build and rotation discussions, to event recording. In general, as a player becomes more involved in the game, they also become (wittingly or unwittingly) more involved with theorycraft and the effects of its practice. This being said, theorycraft as a practice can be both healthy and unhealthy for a player depending on a number of factors.\nMany players get involved in theorycraft as a direct result of playing the game. This is often ultimately because they want to be a better player at what it is they already do. This often requires analyzing what they are doing correctly or incorrectly, and then realigning the behaviors to match their new desires. Often some research and experimentation goes into this process and there tend to be verifiable results.\nScope of theorycraft.\nTheorycraft, while being a game-specific term, is actually an extremely common process to most games. In chess, theorists analyze openings, advanced concepts, frequent occurances, and general game practice. Until relatively recently, game theorists were few and only performed within the scope of the game they were active enthusiasts in. During the collectible card game boom, game theory started being applied by more and more players, and individual theorists began expanding their practices to multiple games as it was recognized that many similar games utilized similar factors and aspects of play. Today, game theory is so prevalently used by developers and players alike, in all games, that it leads to many conflicts between game authors and players.\nBenefits of proper theorycraft.\nTheorycraft has a wide range of applications, including but not limited to: innovations in thought and expanded game theory; macros, scripts and mods for UI customization; rotations, build and practice analysis; and even goal and class specific guides. It is important to note that such innovations are only beneficial when the theories have been appropriately researched, disclosed and explained so that further applications may be understood, found and researched.\nMacros.\nMacros come in a wide variety of flavors. Some macros are simply for variety of play, such as a macro which picks a random mount or pet. Others are communication macros while others are for minimizing negative factors or maximizing positive specific aspects of play. When macros optimize game play, these are strongly influenced by Theorycraft. \nFor further information and examples, see:\nMods.\nSeveral mods are direct extensions of some theorycraft. For theories illustrated by highly complex formulae, these mods can perform the analysis, comparisons and results in a smooth, non-intrustive interface. There are also several mods that provide access to more or specific information based on group role dynamics. Finally, some mods simply fine tune behavior by extending the capabilities of a single button. Listed below are just a couple of commonly used mods.\nGuides.\nMost guides are written is such a way that they often maximize on a fundamental concept. For instance, Leveling Guides are geared toward Resource Management of time as a resource. Gold Guides are the same, but for inventory and profit. As a further extension, class guides are often biased toward the currently accepted roles and practices of the class. The real issue with so many of these guides is that they fail to explain the concepts that build them. The best guides are recycled and reused, and essentially teach the reader how to understand the concepts so that they may be applied as circumstances change.\nBehaviors and Practices.\nEver wonder why somebody says \"use X spell instead of Y spell\". Often, it has its foundations in theory. Now, what is important to note is that just because somebody tells you this, does not mean that they understand (or even know) the theory that makes it true or the circumstances under which the statement applies. Furthermore, nearly every spell in World of Warcraft has some use. Without the explanation, this is simply propaganda for the social gaming engine. However, contrary to many critics, it is not merely subjective. Below are a couple practices that have become common, with and without the understanding, as a result of theorycraft.\nDangers of Improper Theorycraft.\nTheorycraft is only as useful as the number of people and concepts that can apply it. This requires that specific circumstances regarding the experiments and, hence, the overall theory be disclosed. Many of the spreadsheets that analyze rotations, for instance, do not advise the reader that the results may be contingent upon a particular UI placement, or that the players involved use hotkeys, rather than mouse-clicks, both of which can dramatically influence the numbers. The can create inflated views of importance on particular builds or practices, without the proper fundamental backing for which to properly interpret the results.\nLack of Understanding.\nDPS is a fairly common and understood term within the World of Warcraft and MMORPG community. However, for many players, World of Warcraft is their first MMORPG. A new player who hears DPS, might understand the definition itself, but not understand what raises or lowers it. This can lead to many levels (and even characters) of randomly picking and choosing gear and abilities that have bigger numbers, but are actually the wrong numbers.\nImproper Emphasis.\nPlayer2 is most definitely the more effective (notice I didn't say stronger) player, because their character will always be active. Something will always be happening. This \"weaker\" build is seemingly stronger to unassuming players because of his play style and not the actual build or rotation dynamics. \nIn contrast, Player1 will generally have .75 seconds of inactivity between casts (without accounting for large lag spikes) because they have to react to the completion. For instant spells and 1.5 seconds casting times, that is approximately 33% ineffective time, dramatically weakening the potency of their \"powerful\" build.\nSituations like the above occur frequently within amateur game theorists and casually game enthusiasts just entering the theoretical gaming world. Most of this is due to the lack of disclosure by more experienced theoreticians. Sometimes it is simply that a \"basic\" principle of play is assumed when no such assumption is valid. Because the play experience is so subjective, this leads to theories that are too general and lack the primary components to be useful.\nFurthermore, such theories can cause players to believe that the game world is entirely inconsistent, with little cohesion: a sequence of random rolls. This is ever to far from the truth. This feeling, however, is justified when veterans of the game purport to educate the masses, while failing to provide the necessary information.\nBeginning your own theorycraft.\nWhen starting your foray into game theory, it is important to understand some basic concepts. Keeping these in mind at all times will further your process. Read the list below and their descriptions."}

He is located in &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. Duke Theotar is a staunch ally of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; and an avid fan of tea parties and noble gatherings. While thoroughly maddened by his experiences in the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;, Theotar continues to serve his prince with loyal tenacity, in his own (slightly insane) way.\nHe is always accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Tubbins\"&gt;Tubbins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gubbins\"&gt;Gubbins&lt;/a&gt;.

While Renathal and a few of his allies, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt;, were cast into &lt;a href=\"the%20Maw\"&gt;the Maw&lt;/a&gt;, Theotar was instead banished to the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;. Despite losing much of his sanity to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, Theotar and his two &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt; servants, &lt;a href=\"Gubbins\"&gt;Gubbins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tubbins\"&gt;Tubbins&lt;/a&gt;, adapted surprisingly well to the tortures of the Ember Ward. They used a special type of &lt;a href=\"tea\"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; created with local ingredients and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadows&lt;/a&gt; to keep their minds and bodies from withering into &lt;a href=\"ash%20ghoul\"&gt;ash ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s. They also received help from &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Sybille\"&gt;Lost Sybille&lt;/a&gt;, though it is unclear whether she was also part of Renathal's rebellion or if she had already been in the Ember Ward when Theotar arrived.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the Ember Ward, Sybille led them to Theotar, who had recently been mugged by \"&lt;a href=\"Marquis%20Pummeler\"&gt;Marquis Pummeler&lt;/a&gt;.\" After helping him, Theotar is pained by exposure to the burning Light and Sybille once again takes the lead, guiding them to Tubbins and Gubbins. After a relaxing tea party, Theotar is able to compose himself. With his parasol and assistants in-tow, he is able to show the adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;, where he last saw Prince Renathal. Once the adventurer got rid of the massive mirrors reflecting the light towards Sinfall, he met with &lt;a href=\"the%20Accuser\"&gt;the Accuser&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the rebellion forces there.\nOnce the prince returned from the Maw, Theotar and Renathal were overjoyed to see each other again, each noting that the other looked good without a shirt on, as he gladly rejoined the rebellion. \nVenthyr Covenant storyline.\nTheotar decides to reclaim his old estate: &lt;a href=\"Thornhill%20Manor\"&gt;Thornhill Manor&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of his old butler, &lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;, and his staff of &lt;a href=\"Dumitra\"&gt;Dumitra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elena\"&gt;Elena&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Florin\"&gt;Florin&lt;/a&gt;, and murdering &lt;a href=\"Viscount%20Nicolae\"&gt;Viscount Nicolae&lt;/a&gt;, the current paramour of &lt;a href=\"The%20Countess\"&gt;The Countess&lt;/a&gt;, Thornhill Manor is retaken.\nHowever his plan to sneak into the Countess's bedroom and steal the &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Desire\"&gt;:Medallion of Desire&lt;/a&gt; failed, and the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; was caught by the Countess. Luckily, she recognized mutual interest between her and Prince Renathal after demonstrating for us her power lies beyond the Medallion of Desire, and willingly chose to give us her Medallion.\nAfterwards, Theotar and &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt; are tasked by the Prince to commission an object that could channel all seven of the Medallions of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. After atoning for past sins that both were party to under orders of &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, that led to the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; being able to easily seize the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Forge\"&gt;Eternal Forge&lt;/a&gt;, Mikanikos was eager to help. The &lt;a href=\"%3ACrown%20of%20the%20Harvesters\"&gt;:Crown of the Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; was created.\nHowever, because the Medallions contain the essence of &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, his influence threatens to overcome any who wield it. They traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Citadel of Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; to purge the Crown of the Echo of Denathrius using the power of the Temple of Loyalty that is capable of cleansing of any disloyalty to the Shadowlands. With that, the Crown of the Harvesters was perfected and given to Prince Renathal.\nSoulbind traits.\n&lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt; members can &lt;a href=\"soulbind\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt; with Theotar after completing &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Spirits%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Kindred Spirits (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nI am most pleased to see you again, dear &lt;Name&gt;.

After mating with &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, Theradras became the mother of the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. She was aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, and Zaetar's relatives considered her to be a creature of evil and chaos.\nBiography.\nBirth of the centaur.\nThough most of the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s were sequestered in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, Theradras, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;, evaded capture and hid below the earth, eventually falling into a long slumber. Many millennia later\u20141,100 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; accidentally awakened Theradras, having mistaken her faint whisperings for their voice of their benevolent deity, the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. The years of slumber had weakened Theradras' form, and she reached out to the verdant lands around her, draining their life energies to restore her power. In that moment, the fertile grassland of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Mashan'she&lt;/a&gt; was transformed into a barren desert which would later be renamed \"Desolace\" by the horrified tauren.\nThe monumental loss of life sent ripples throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, the first son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, emerged from the Dream to investigate and eventually discovered Theradras in heir lair. However, instead of imprisoning the elemental, he became enticed by her stolen life energies and fell in love with her. Theradras realized the influence she had over the half-stag being, and\u2014as she found Zaetar beautiful as well\u2014claimed that together the two could restore the land's beauty. From their forbidden union, the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; race was born. The first centaur were &lt;a href=\"Kolk\"&gt;Kolk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelk\"&gt;Gelk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magra\"&gt;Magra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraudos\"&gt;Maraudos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Veng\"&gt;Veng&lt;/a&gt;, who became the first five &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s. The centaur saw the disgust in their father's eyes and brutally killed Zaetar, but Theradras harshly chastised them for their actions. Realizing that they had broken their beloved mother's heart, the centaur begged for forgiveness and promised to honor Zaetar's memory. Fearful of Cenarius' wrath, Theradras entombed Zaetar's spirit in her lair, which the centaur would later name &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; and treat as holy ground, and sequestered herself with her dead lover's body in her secret sanctuary, the Crystal Caverns of &lt;a href=\"Terramok\"&gt;Terramok&lt;/a&gt;. Influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, she used the energies of Zaetar's spirit to transform her home into a den of corruption and suffering.\nThe &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vyletongue\"&gt;Lord Vyletongue&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Putridus\"&gt;Putridus&lt;/a&gt; followers journeyed into Maraudon after hearing of its corruption. Theradras was wary of the demon at first, but Vyletongue proved his worth by creating various minions, such as &lt;a href=\"Noxxion\"&gt;Noxxion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Razorlash\"&gt;Razorlash&lt;/a&gt;, to act as servants for the princess and ease her loneliness.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTheradras loved the centaur, and she was worried that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power might eventually drive them to extinction. After years of hostilities with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies, she acted to save her progeny. She infused the centaur with her power, driving them to make war and claim new territories outside Desolace. Most centaur were deeply loyal to Theradras, yet the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt; had no such loyalty and thus were perfect allies for the Horde. The Horde helped suppress the other, violent tribes and then its champions turned their attention to Maraudon itself. They journeyed into the depths of the burial ground and slaughtered every creature inside it, including Theradras. Their victory halted the spreading corruption in Desolace and stopped the violent bloodlust in the centaur. With the Horde's blessing, the Magram became the leaders of the united centaur and led them to an age of tranquility. Yet none knew how long they would stay on the path of peace.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, Theradras returned as &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Crown Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, one of four lieutenants aiding &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult. Despite Cho'gall's encouragement, she refused to leave &lt;a href=\"Terramok\"&gt;Terramok&lt;/a&gt;; since it housed the remains of her beloved Zaetar, she considered the place to be her home and intended to stay there forever.

Theramore Keep, Theramore City or simply Theramore) was a human city and port town located in a rocky island east of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and was the capital of the &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;. Before its &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt;, it was considered the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s most martial presence in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Since its destruction, it is simply known as the Ruins of Theramore\"'.\nThe importance of Theramore was emphasized in-game by the fact that many class and profession trainers resided here. A &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; with sufficient skill can even use &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; and open &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28spell%29\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt; into this city, although they will now be teleported midair over the crater where Jaina's &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt; once stood.\n&lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; allows adventurers to see how the area appeared in the past and return to the present when asked. She is located at the end of the bridge west of the isle. Dustwallow Marsh quests are still doable in the past Theramore.\nHistory.\nThird War.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina Proudmoore took as many &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;survivors&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; she could find and sailed west to the forgotten shores of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, all surviving &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of Jaina's expedition settled along the coast of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, where they erected the island citadel of Theramore to safeguard the ragtag remnants of the failing Alliance.\nBetween both Theramore and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; a tension arose. At one point, Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; held the city when &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; came to speak with Jaina. The admiral started a &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The result of this war was a final battle in Theramore ending with Daelin's death.\nCycle of Hatred.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina had built and taken the role of ruler in Theramore. &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde were at peace for three years. While all was peaceful, the citizens were not satisfied. They complained about the orc lands having better wood to build ships with which they wouldn't trade for. Others even complained about them having better fishing spots and special treatment from the local neutral port: &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Jaina left for &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; to help Thrall with the &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt; was left in charge and under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; he rounded an army to attack and annihilate the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for good. Before another war could start, Lady Jaina Proudmoore and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; returned to Theramore to confront Kristoff. Jaina exorcised Zmodlor's influence with a bolt of lightning, which had killed Kristoff in the process.\nAfter all the commotion, Aegwynn had taken the role of adviser and replaced Kristoff.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTheramore Isle is the home of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining Alliance forces who followed &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh's&lt;/a&gt; advice before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion's&lt;/a&gt; invasion and evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Theramore soldiers can also be found guarding &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the people of Theramore have managed to secure a livelihood within the borders of their city, the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; plotted the demise of any Theramore citizen who ventured outside the safety of the city's walls. One such victim was &lt;a href=\"James%20Hyal\"&gt;James \"Smiling Jim\" Hyal&lt;/a&gt;, who constructed the &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Rest%20Inn\"&gt;Shady Rest Inn&lt;/a&gt; at the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. However, Theramore lost control of the roads in the marsh when the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt; took over and cut off from the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt;, Shady Rest Inn and James Hyal's family were terminated by the Grimtotem tauren of &lt;a href=\"Direhorn%20Post\"&gt;Direhorn Post&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; later discovered this treachery and brought the Grimtotem to justice.\nIt appears that despite Jaina's efforts, some people in Theramore continue to desire ill upon the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. They have attacked &lt;a href=\"Balandar%20Brightstar\"&gt;Balandar Brightstar&lt;/a&gt;'s ships and stolen his cargo and his first mate. &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Caldwell\"&gt;Lieutenant Caldwell&lt;/a&gt; also displays a hatred for Horde and executed &lt;a href=\"Paval%20Reethe\"&gt;Paval Reethe&lt;/a&gt; for alleged involvement with the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Gavis%20Greyshield\"&gt;Gavis Greyshield&lt;/a&gt;, a former lieutenant of the Theramore militia, believes it was wrong of them to turn against Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and has been leading Theramore deserters in trying to denounce Lady Jaina Proudmoore's rule via a propaganda war.\nBut despite these feelings, the people of Theramore, regardless of race, are deeply loyal to Jaina Proudmoore; especially those who fought under her in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and would not act on their opinions. As seen in the novel, \"&lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cycle of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\", a single comment of speaking ill about the lady would have led to a fight.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Theramore was very busy. At first, a person who was, in fact, the long-missing &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; visited the city. Later, the split personas of two Varians arrived to Theramore from which they went to save Anduin in Onyxia's Lair. After the personas were fused, and Varian took his place as king of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Theramore became the neutral ground for a meeting between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. However, the meeting was interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult as they attacked the city and its visitors.\nLater on, a series of attacks occurred in the city. During the second &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20%28Theramore%29\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; Theramore Isle. It was successfully defended by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and Theramore's defenders. As the archmage destroyed the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Herald of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; mocked her to come to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Following the battle, a lot of fighters were wounded, and &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; used the diversion to escape from Theramore. Later on, it was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, but thanks to &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, the attacks were successfully repelled.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; was forced to flee his homeland, he saw that the best course of action was to travel to Theramore and ask Jaina for help. The mage welcomed the young Chieftain with open arms and the isle soon became Baine's meeting place. Along with &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; he would meet up with Jaina and discuss the best course of action. On one such meeting, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; appeared at Jaina's tower by using her &lt;a href=\"hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, the one she gave him to visit her whenever he wanted. While hesitant at first, Baine began to enjoy the prince's company for in him he saw himself. (A prince who has a crown to bare). On one meeting sometime before the assault to retake his city, Anduin presented him &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; to use in the upcoming battle. While small for a tauren Baine believed it was special because like it did with Anduin it glowed, meaning that it liked him.\nCataclysm.\nAccording to Jaina, the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; damaged the city but was quickly rebuilt.\nSince Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; wants to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and conquer the whole of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, offensives into the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; have been sent in response and secured territory once belonging to the Horde for &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt;. The humans of Theramore have sent their army and tried to establish a military line between night elf territory and Theramore. Theramore had a &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Highway\"&gt;highway&lt;/a&gt; constructed that connects Theramore to Dustwallow Marsh; allowing the Alliance to move more quickly and send supplies and troops from Theramore to Alliance military bases in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. After the Horde's surprise invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance forces streamed out of Theramore to attack the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nDuring the events of , Theramore becomes fortified and received the aid of top Alliance commanders following the fall of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Soon afterwards, the city itself comes under a three tongued assault from the Horde, with attacks coming from the harbor, the west gate, and the north gate. While the Horde navy fails to gain control of the harbor, the West Gate being assaulted by Horde forces under the command of &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; remains strong. The north gate is not so fortunate. Due to the treachery of &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, the northern gate was weakened and Horde forces under &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt; command was able to storm into the city. However, the Alliance, with assistance from the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, were able able to force the Horde to retreat.\nThinking they had won, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; each took a small force of their own warriors, west and north respectively, to find the traitor Songweaver, who was rescued by Horde adventurers during the end of the battle. Those who remained within the city were taken completely by surprise when a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, empowered by the stolen &lt;a href=\"The%20Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;focusing iris&lt;/a&gt;, was used to destroy Theramore. The only survivors of Theramore's destruction were those looking for Songweaver, Jaina Proudmoore (due to the actions of &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;), Kalecgos (who was thrown out to sea from the explosion), and a ship full of civilians, mostly children, who evacuated Theramore before the fighting started.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt; scenario, which leads the game into \"\", Theramore is destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, outraged at this matter, completely devote themselves into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Theramore's Fall &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt; was opened to level 85 characters on September 17, 2012. When \"Mists\" launched on September 25, it became a level 90 scenario. Completing the scenario results in Theramore appearing in ruins on the player's world map via &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt;, with a large graveyard set up opposite the existing one just outside the city. It was planned that in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.1.0\"&gt;patch 5.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, Theramore will appear in ruins regardless of whether players have completed the scenario or not, but this change was not implemented, likely since it is still a questing zone for the Alliance. Adventurers that have completed the scenario will see the outcome unless they speak to Zidormi. The only known survivors of the attack are Jaina, Vereesa, and a handful of night elf Sentinels led by Shandris; all of them were outside the city at the moment of the explosion. \nSome &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Citizen\"&gt;citizens&lt;/a&gt; (including children) survived the destruction of the city, and were captured and tortured by Garrosh's Horde - possibly from the ship full of Theramore civilians sent to &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; by Jaina thanks to Baine Bloodhoof's warning, and captured after the Horde's naval victories near the region. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; wanted to establish a garrison near the ruins of Theramore.\nJaina's return.\nAfter Jaina Proudmoore left the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, she returned to the ruins of Theramore to collect her thoughts. There, she opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe later returned here again to collect Daelin Proudmoore's pendant.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nAlliance and Horde forces scouted the ruins of Theramore to assess its viability as a base. Among them were &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Duskwalker\"&gt;Instructor Duskwalker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zaedana\"&gt;Magister Zaedana&lt;/a&gt;. The effects of the mana bomb still lingered.\nTides of Vengeance.\nFeeling that Sylvanas has gone too far Baine, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;, sought to liberate the resurrected &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from her and return him to his family. Sailing from &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Swift%20Vengeance\"&gt;The Swift Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;\", Baine personally delivered Derek to Jaina off the coast of the ruins of Theramore, one of the few places &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had spies stationed almost everywhere, was apparently not actively watching.\nSeeking to prevent Sylvanas from realizing what they had done Zelling took their stolen ship from the coast of Theramore to the &lt;a href=\"Chandlery%20Wharf\"&gt;Chandlery Wharf&lt;/a&gt;, which had been recently been taken by &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s in order to make it seem as if the ship was taken in a pirate raid gone wrong. While Zelling covered his and Baine's tracks, Jaina, after finally reuniting with her older brother, vowed to help Derek by bringing him to &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; who could help him.\nRise of Azshara.\n&lt;a href=\"Commander%20Sharp\"&gt;General Sharp&lt;/a&gt; was carrying vital information on a Worldvein location to Theramore for transport to Stormwind. The Horde went to stage a raid on the Southern Barrens as a pretense to steal the information. They ultimately faced Sharp in Theramore.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; reported that &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s were present at the ruins. The pair also visited the place, and the ghosts reminded Rexxar that war breaks Azeroth and what stays is never whole again.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a sect of &lt;a href=\"Hedge%20wizard\"&gt;rogue mages&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Sullied%20Banner\"&gt;Sullied Banner&lt;/a&gt; made their way to the ruins. Under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Turi%20Flickerflame\"&gt;Turi Flickerflame&lt;/a&gt;, a former apprentice of the late &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Archmage Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, they were seen clearing the rubbles, putting down the fires, and empowering their prototype &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;s. Their presence drew the attention of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Surigosa\"&gt;Surigosa&lt;/a&gt;, who was soon joined by &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than a bloody conflict, the rogue mages were captured along with their leader by the adventurer, and Kalecgos managed to convince them to cease their dangerous actions. Turi and her fellow mages then left the ruins to discuss their future with the Aspect of Magic.\nDescription.\nPlaces.\nThe city was made up of a roughly rectangular wall dotted by &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s encircling most of the isle perimeter, save the harbor, which was protected by two &lt;a href=\"scout%20tower\"&gt;scout tower&lt;/a&gt;s. An inner fortification composed of a wall encircling Jaina's Tower was located in the center of the isle. The rest of the buildings surrounded this complex.\nAlso known as the Guard Quarters, was the city's military center. People trained at the Training Grounds at its doors: the guards against practice dummies and the young recruits against each other. There were always priests watching carefully, ready to call upon the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; for healing the instant anyone was injured. &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; died in battle in what would have had to have been this keep.\nMany merchants and their families dwelt in one of the city's major inns. Built on a slight hill it was a perfect place to sit by a fire, enjoying a brew and conversation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Demonsbane%20Inn%20and%20Tavern\"&gt;Demonsbane Inn and Tavern&lt;/a&gt; was another establishment of considerably lower reputation, a filthy building that was only ever frequented by locals.\nAlso known as the Citadel, this &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt; was Theramore's tallest structure. The building had wooden floors on its many stories, which were connected by long, winding stairs. It had many rooms, including Jaina's private quarters (which probably housed dozens of books), her extensive library (which housed hundreds of books) and Theramore's little throne room (which had a window with a view). There was a magically concealed secret entrance to the tower. With walls warded with all kind of protective magics, it was a solid fortress against such attacks.\nTheramore's local &lt;a href=\"harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Mehley\"&gt;The Lady Mehley&lt;/a&gt;\" has a ship route from Theramore to &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and vice versa. The docks has a harbor crane to unload cargo from friendly vessels. For defenses, it has numerous &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e and &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s to sink enemy naval vessels. It has two &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s constantly docked there: one being the \"&lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Sparrow\"&gt;Bleeding Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;\", and the other unnamed.\nThe cobblestone streets that formed a lattice amid the buildings of Theramore were designed to provide reinforced ground for people, mounts, and wheeled conveyances to travel without risking getting mired in the swampy ground the city had been built on. Most people walked on them rather than the muck and grass on either side.\nA &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; and several houses can be found in the streets of Theramore. Theramore is linked to the mainland through its north gate and its west gate, this one having a &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Highway\"&gt;highway&lt;/a&gt; leading out of the city.\nPeople.\nThe population of the city was never stated, but it is known that &lt;a href=\"Foothold%20Citadel\"&gt;Foothold Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Inn and Jaina's Tower could house everyone who lived in Theramore. The population was not only made up of &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; veterans, but also of people from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; who came after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; for political or economical reasons.\nTheramore's citizens formed a closed community: everyone knew most everyone else, and if they didn't, they knew someone else who did. Because of that, crime was not a major concern as criminal acts were rare. The Lady's soldiers generally punished crime in a quick and brutal way.\nTheramore exported a type of beer called &lt;a href=\"Cask%20of%20Theramore%20Pale%20Ale\"&gt;Theramore Pale Ale&lt;/a&gt; (TPA), which was said to receive its distinctive aroma from being made with genuine swampwater. Theramore's citizens also drank \"&lt;a href=\"boar%27s%20grog\"&gt;boar's grog&lt;/a&gt;\" brewed up north by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, corn whiskey, ale and wine.\nLeadership.\nDuring the first years of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership, the Lady was aided by her secretary &lt;a href=\"Duree\"&gt;Duree&lt;/a&gt; and her chamberlain &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt;. The man was left in charge of the city and sat on its throne whenever Jaina was absent. When it came to military advice, Jaina trusted in &lt;a href=\"Lorena\"&gt;Colonel Lorena&lt;/a&gt; more than on her other officers. Kristoff was eventually replaced in his role as chamberlain by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; after his death.\nThe &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt; acted both as Jaina's bodyguard and the leader of Theramore's spy network.\nOrganizations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt; is the military organization protecting the city.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Guard\"&gt;Elite Guard&lt;/a&gt; was the official protection and personal guard of Lady Jaina Proudmoore. At one occasion, &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt; sent them to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; to face the Horde.\nThere were two training teams - &lt;a href=\"Red%20Team\"&gt;Red Team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Team\"&gt;Blue Team&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthwatch Hold and its &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;expeditionary unit&lt;/a&gt; are under the command of Theramore.\nResources.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow&lt;/a&gt; were considered to be \"marshy garbage\" by the sailors and shipwrights of Theramore, who were jealous of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' access to good oaks from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;the mountains&lt;/a&gt; above &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe marshy territory was not good for farming either. The humans of Theramore used to trade with the orcs up north for surplus Durotarian crops, in exchange for fish.\nBanner of Theramore.\nThe anchor device on Theramore's banner perhaps has a double meaning: most obviously that Theramore is a port city; and that Theramore is a kind of anchor for the Alliance in Kalimdor and will not waver. The banner also displays a solar disk with rays and three stars appear below the anchor. The meaning for those are not certain. Some banners also display the \"L\"-like symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, clearly indicating the city's roots. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; - the ruler of Theramore - is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, former leader of the merchant nation of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. The similarity between Theramore's banner and the flag of Kul Tiras stems from this relationship.\nThe tabard that Theramore guards wear bear the anchor device only. It appears only on the front, and instead of using blue, on the tabard it is gold.\nNPCs.\nAfter doing &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, in-game NPCs will only be available in Theramore's past by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle%23Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria section&lt;/a&gt; above).\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"\", Theramore Isle was a minor map of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hatreds%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;Old Hatreds&lt;/a&gt; mission and the main map of the next and final one, &lt;a href=\"A%20Blaze%20of%20Glory%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;A Blaze of Glory&lt;/a&gt;. In both cases it appeared as a grand city, with several &lt;a href=\"cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;s, parks, military districts and a &lt;a href=\"harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; able to house many &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; landing party was made up of &lt;a href=\"Navy%20Swordsman\"&gt;swordsmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Navy%20Sniper\"&gt;snipers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Chaplain\"&gt;chaplains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Hydromancer\"&gt;hydromancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;crusaders&lt;/a&gt; and contained a &lt;a href=\"mountain%20king\"&gt;mountain king&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;archmagi&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe isle was defended by the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt;, the infrastructures of which were overtaken by the Kul Tiran forces during &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s coup. The city was also threatened by a group of &lt;a href=\"Bandit\"&gt;criminals&lt;/a&gt; led by a &lt;a href=\"bandit%20lord\"&gt;bandit lord&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city housed buildings such as the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Marketplace\"&gt;Theramore Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20and%20Staff%20Emporium\"&gt;Wand and Staff Emporium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Theed%27s%20Discount%20Potion%20Shop\"&gt;Theed's Discount Potion Shop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helbrim%27s%20Potions\"&gt;Helbrim's Potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Rings%20and%20Things\"&gt;Magic Rings and Things&lt;/a&gt;, and an aviary with several &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Cage\"&gt;Eagle Cage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nIt was built primarily as a military fortress, but has grown somewhat to serve as a trading &lt;a href=\"harbor\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;. Approach from the sea is extremely difficult due to the jagged rocks jutting out of Dustwallow Bay, leaving travelers to journey on foot through the marsh to one of the villages that run ferries out to the island. Fearful of pirates from &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere, the cannons of Theramore will fire without warning on any ship approaching the island unannounced.\nInside the thick walls of Theramore, the people have labored hard to recreate a piece of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Graceful towers rise high above clean, cobblestone streets lined with shops and homes. At the eastern part of the city lies the &lt;a href=\"Foothold%20Citadel\"&gt;Foothold Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, a squat keep housing the chambers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Assembly\"&gt;Alliance Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. Its population is 9,500 people.\nPeople and culture.\nThough the streets recall the quiet serenity of the Alliance of Lordaeron, the meetings of the Assembly reveal the considerable strain among the city's residents. After years of near-paternal guidance of the humans of Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; resent being forced to rely on the hospitality of the younger race since arriving on Kalimdor. As humans hold five of the seven seats on the Alliance Assembly, both the elves (with two seats) and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; (with none) feel under-represented in the leadership of both Theramore and the Alliance in general. As the dwarves continue to accumulate more evidence of their Titan heritage that they want to present to their King in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, their protests that the Alliance does little to return across the sea grow louder and louder. Also, diplomatic relationship between the humans on Kalimdor and their brethren in the Eastern Kingdoms \u2014 especially the people of Stormwind, whose leadership wants to challenge Theramore on its new role as the Alliance's capital \u2014 have been getting worse in the past, with each side accusing the other of fatal mistakes during the last war. While the people of Theramore hold a grudge against their relatives for triggering the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s counterattack on the city, the humans on the other side of the ocean feel they have a right to get more support from Theramore.\nDespite this internal debate, the Alliance places a high value on law and order in Theramore, and city guards make regular patrols to maintain the peace. When skirmishes break out between high elves and night elves or a dwarf gets too rowdy, the guards are quick to round up the offenders for a speedy trial at the Foothold Citadel and imprisonment in &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Prison\"&gt;Ironclad Prison&lt;/a&gt;, the dungeons of which are along tunnels dug deep into the rock of the island. Sentences for fighting and disturbing the peace tend to be light (usually only a few days' incarceration), but sentences for more serious violations of the Alliance's code of law, such as high robbery or murder, can be much more severe.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, who traveled to Kalimdor together with Jaina Proudmoore, also have a small paladin lodge in the city.\nHome of the western Alliance.\nTheramore is described as the official home of the newer, western Alliance in Kalimdor, insinuating that there are two governmental bodies maintaining order in the Alliance."}

{"id": "19366", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19366", "title": "Therazane", "text": "Therazane the Stonemother is the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; of earth, and formerly one of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s. As the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; and mother of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Lords\"&gt;Stone Lords&lt;/a&gt;, she is the master of all &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. She takes the form of a massive female figure made of brown rocks and violet gemstones that are always seen floating just above the ground. Despite her general disinterest in mortal affairs, Therazane has worked with the mortals of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; several times against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt;, having shown nothing but contempt for her former masters and their servants. She also rallied her forces to aid the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAncient history.\nIn the beginning, the world that would become known as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. A nascent &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; maturing within the world's core had consumed much of the fifth element, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, and without this primordial force to create balance, the elements were thrown into chaos. The four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, who each ruled over innumerable lesser spirits, constantly clashed with one another on the surface of the primordial world during the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20wars\"&gt;elemental wars&lt;/a&gt;. Therazane the Stonemother was the most reclusive of the elemental rulers, raising great mountain ranges to protect her children from her enemies' assaults. Only after they had worn themselves thin against her barriers would the Stonemother emerge, wrenching open giant chasms to swallow entire elemental armies whole and sending her most powerful servants, giants of crystal and stone, to crush those who survived.\nWhen the entities known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; arrived from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; and established their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Elemental Lords saw the invaders as a threat to their dominion. For the first time in Azeroth's history, the native spirits of the world worked together against a common enemy. Therazane raised walls of jagged rock to corral and shatter the temple cities of the Black Empire, before Neptulon would sweep in with his minions and crush the Old Gods' forces with tidal waves. Ultimately, however, they were overwhelmed by the endless armies of the Old Gods and enslaved to their malign will.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Azeroth to battle the Black Empire, the Old Gods sent their enslaved Elemental Lord lieutenants to face them. &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; were charged with facing the Stonemother, who retreated into her towering stone spire. Archaedas used his earth magic to weaken the tower's foundations and destroy the giants guarding it, before Freya called up enormous roots to entangle and destroy the spire, bringing it down upon the Stonemother's head. Therazane and her children were thereafter imprisoned in the crystalline caverns of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, a region of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter witnessing the devastation &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his followers caused her realm, Therazane treats all outsiders with open hostility.\nTherazane, also known as the Stonemother, is the elemental lord of earth, an ancient and immensely powerful counterpart of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the realms of Al'Akir and Ragnaros, however, her domain - that of the earth, rock, and mountains - has put her in immediate conflict with Deathwing, whose emergence from Deepholm has pushed her stony realm to the point of collapse.\nThough Therazane has no love for mortals, she recognizes the role that these races might play in restoring Deepholm and evicting the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, who have flocked to her kingdom to bask in the glory of Deathwing's former sanctum. Heroes who seek the aid of the Stonemother will find that her favor can confer many blessings; among them are powerful augmenting stones borne up from Deepholm itself to strengthen the armor of those who serve Therazane's will.\nTherazane is a quest giver in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, residing at &lt;a href=\"Therazane%27s%20Throne\"&gt;Therazane's Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Her questline is in a similar experience to the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;'s questline in &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile she offers quests to adventurers in Deepholm, Therazane makes it clear she has no love for the mortals who killed &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, and warns those who speak to her that they will eventually outlive their usefulness.\nAfter the heroes convinced Therazane that they will indeed leave Deepholm once the World Pillar has been repaired, a battle takes place between the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s and Therazane's forces. Therazane picks out the most dangerous foes, smashing them into pieces before moving on to the next. Ultimately with the help of the elementals of the earth, the World Pillar is repaired.\nElemental Bonds.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit became bound to the earth of Deepholm players along with &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; visit Therazane to gain her blessing in searching for him. Though she finds Thrall's spirit fascinating and is at first unwilling to part with him she states she can still hear the cry of a lover's heart and that she has not forgotten what it was to love. She grants her blessing to Aggra and the player but warns that even with it Thrall himself may not wish to leave.\nLegion.\nIn order to rally the Elemental Lords against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; travels to Deepholm. Therazane and her forces are under attack by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, which is rallying an army to conquer her realm, and Therazane cannot offer her aid until the threat has been dealt with. The forces led by &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia's&lt;/a&gt; spirit are defeated, and Therazane pledges to fight alongside the Earthen Ring. She sends &lt;a href=\"Avalanchion\"&gt;Avalanchion&lt;/a&gt; to join the shamans at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lords\"&gt;Elemental Lords&lt;/a&gt; were united under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Therazane joined &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; to commemorate this occasion.\nTherazane was not initially aware of what the Legion or demons even were. This makes sense when one considers that she was locked in Deepholm long before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the demons' first time on Azeroth.\nDuring the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, Therazane joined the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt; to take vengeance on the demons twisting Azeroth's earth.\nTherazane seems to greatly favor the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt;, referring to them affectionately as her \"new favorite fleshling\" and a \"true friend of the Earthmother.\"\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ormhun%20Stonehammer\"&gt;Ormhun Stonehammer&lt;/a&gt; created a &lt;a href=\"%3AKhazgorian%20Anvil\"&gt;:Khazgorian Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, Therazane appeared and captured both the anvil and Ormhun, voicing great displeasure that Ormhun would share such secrets with outsiders. She also demanded what the adventurer had to say for their self in the matter.\nThe blacksmith adventurer explained that they'd been unaware of the sensitive nature of the anvil, to which Therazane offered a choice: They could take the anvil and leave Ormhun to his fate, or forgo the anvil and have Ormhun spared his life. If the adventurer chose the anvil, Therazane called them a \"typical surface dweller\" while releasing the anvil and that Ormhun would be punished someplace else. If the adventurer chose Ormhun, Therazane released Ormhun while voicing that she'd felt the adventurer had some virtue in them. She would also give the anvil back as a reward for valuing life over possessions. She then warned the adventurer that they were not to share the secret of creating the Khazgorian anvil with anyone, else they would find their next visit to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; \"unpleasant\".\nDragonflight.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"time%20travel\"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt;ling with &lt;a href=\"Andantenormu\"&gt;Andantenormu&lt;/a&gt;, Therazane is briefly seen in the past of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Along with her earth elementals, she is fighting the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nTherazane is a monstrous humanoid covered with stones, earth, and clinging plants. She has squat legs and four powerful arms. Her unblinking eyes of gold-flecked &lt;a href=\"agate\"&gt;agate&lt;/a&gt; look out into the world from her one head, but there are two other faces to be seen as well.\nTherazane the Stonemother is ruler over the earth, dirt, rock, and mountains. She is revered by all &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and creatures that dwell underneath the ground. Some &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20wild\"&gt;druids of the wild&lt;/a&gt; see her as the embodiment of all that is peaceful and calm about the world. Some sages believe she feels pain whenever the ground is sundered and weeps at the destruction wrought by Deathwing and his ilk. If so, however, she has done nothing specific to oppose the great dragon. Therazane is the most peaceful of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s. She is a patient, loving, motherly type who encourages growing things and loves simply to spend long periods of time relaxing with those creatures that make their homes upon her. She often feels as though she is always at war with the other &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; erodes her surface with winds, &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; beats his waves constantly upon her shores, and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; is a blazing furnace that churns at her fiery core. She would be perfectly happy if the three of them would just go away. Therazane is slow to anger and attempts to avoid combat whenever possible. If roused to battle, however, she can be a fearsome, powerful opponent. She typically drives toward the most dangerous foe, smashing her target into tiny red pieces before moving on to the next. Should she be seriously challenged, she simply sinks into the earth and retreats.\nAppearance.\n\"As you watch, the earth ahead seems to rise up, forming into a monstrous humanoid covered with stones, earth, and clinging plants. It has squat legs and four powerful arms, and the suggestion of large, saggy breasts and wide hips indicate that this creature is undeniably female. Unblinking eyes of gold-flecked agate stare at you from a face that seems curious, inquisitive\u2026 and you see what appear to be two other faces beside the one that regards you now, one of anger and fury, the other of perhaps sorrow and longing.\"\nIn Cataclysm, she appears as a spherical, obese, floating woman with only one visible face and only two arms. Two vestigial legs hang beneath her, treading the air. Like her daughter, she uses her hair to cover her breasts. A number of purple crystals grow on her, and some are also used by her as jewelry.\nMemorable quotes.\nDeepholm.\n&lt;The Stonemother stares down at you. Through you. As if she's peering into your soul.&gt;\nMy daughter, &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, sequestered herself deep within the Crystal Caverns of &lt;a href=\"Terramok\"&gt;Terramok&lt;/a&gt; to grieve for her lost love, &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;. There, heartless, stoneless beings invaded and slaughtered her amidst her mourning.\nIf I had any reason to trust a creature afflicted by the curse of flesh, it was stripped from me that day. And yet in your arrogance, you persist.\nOne day, you will outlive your usefulness.\nLegion.\nTroubles on the surface don't belong down here, shaman. I hope you intend to put this right.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Or is there?\nAs a saying.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; has, for years, been denying allegations of hiding secret \"cow levels\" in their games, especially the original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", where the rumors first began. (If you clicked a mysteriously-spawned cow several times, it supposedly opened a portal that led to a secret area, hence the name.) Descriptions vary from report to report of what exactly a \"cow level\" is, but they are generally accepted to be secret areas that contain significant numbers of bovines (sometimes including powerful, magic-wielding bovines) and little else. So prevalent were claims by fans to have found the \"secret cow level\" in any number of Blizzard's games that their repeated, pithy response became a common utterance for fans:\n\"There is no cow level.\"\nThe fact that, taken out of context, this comment just sounds bizarre and practically invites one to look for a cow level because someone felt it was important enough to deny something so bizarre has probably contributed a large part to its spreading as a saying among fans. And it's just damn funny to blurt out.\nNot helping rumors is the fact that there actually \"is\" a Cow Level in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, and there have also been numerous other cow jokes and \"there is no cow level\" jokes hidden in Blizzard's other games. For example, it was the cheat code in &lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt; used to skip the current level. The line lives on in the hearts of long-time Blizzard fans and as an occasional &lt;a href=\"loading%20screen%20tips\"&gt;loading screen tip&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;, players were able to access a secret level by locating a number of flaming sheep and killing them.\nCuriously, the phrase bears resemblance to a famous quote in the movie \"The Matrix\". When the protagonist of the movie, Neo, meets a young boy with telekinetic abilities bending a spoon with his mind, the boy explains \"There is no spoon.\" This is also a cheat in &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;. This phrase in turn has been interpreted as a reference to the Buddhist concept of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_origination\"&gt;dependent origination&lt;/a&gt;. There is no spoon: what exists is only Neo's idea of the spoon.\nIn the hit PC shooter games &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_duty\"&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_2\"&gt;Call of Duty 2&lt;/a&gt;, to enable cheats one must use the command console to set the value of the variable 'ThereIsACow' to 1337.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;-only band &lt;a href=\"L80ETC\"&gt;L80ETC&lt;/a&gt; has composed a &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;-inspired song named \"&lt;a href=\"Raise%20Some%20Hell\"&gt;Raise Some Hell&lt;/a&gt;\", which features the phrase \"There's no cow level\".\nIn Diablo III, there is another secret level that is very hard to get to, requiring multiple playthroughs, several rare items, a schematic, an ultra rare item that drops from an even more rare mob, and many more items. When all of the items are obtained, you must go to Tristram and find the cow from Diablo that exploded and it will resurrect into none other than the Cow King's ghost. After asking about the Cow level, he denies its existence with several bad cow puns and opens a portal to the secret level, Whimsyshire, the pony level, with aesthetics similar to \"My Little Pony\".\nDuring Diablo III's 3-year anniversary, May 15 to May 21 2015, the secret cow level was unleashed once again, with strange portals to the area opening.\nDespite Blizzard's continued insistence that there is no cow level, it only seems to have increased the incidence of rumors, as seen below.\nTributes to the cow level.\n\"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" contains several tributes and references to the cow level:"}

Over time, he gradually starved in the wilds, until he became a raging &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;Withered&lt;/a&gt;. However, after finding a seed of an &lt;a href=\"Arcan%27dor\"&gt;Arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falanaar\"&gt;Falanaar&lt;/a&gt;, his mind was given peace from the inherent rage that withering bestowed.\nEventually, he was found by &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Kel%27danath\"&gt;Arcanist Kel'danath&lt;/a&gt;, his sixteenth test subject in a bid to study and perhaps communicate with the withered. The ultimate goal was to see if the condition could be reversed. It was Kel'danath who gave him the name Theryn. Finding his arcane essence to be much more soothed than his other subjects, Kel'danath drew from Theryn to craft a spellstone that managed to calm the withered, most of the time. Unfortunately, Kel'danath eventually withered himself, but Theryn remained bound by his spell. Shortly afterward, he was found by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;outlanders&lt;/a&gt; working with &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and brought back to &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nDetermined to discover what had touched Theryn to calm him, Thalyssra delved into his mind, finding memories of his exile, his time in the wilds of Suramar, his withering, and eventually the seed of the Arcan'dor. Using this information, Thalyssra sent the outlanders to find the seed.\nAlthough the person Theryn once was is lost forever, his experiences as a withered led to the growth of a new Arcan'dor, and in turn the salvation of the entire Nightborne race.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Theryn can be found in the uninstanced &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, being watched over by a &lt;a href=\"Nighthold%20Retainer\"&gt;Nighthold Retainer&lt;/a&gt; who says he seems happy enough to wander around the gardens."}

This watertight vessel could submerge beneath the waves and surreptitiously keep watch on enemy forces above the surface. The &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; submarine was visible only to &lt;a href=\"tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;s, aerial forces, and other vessels that moved beneath the waves. Using cunning and craft to carry out surprise attacks on more powerful enemies made the submarine an invaluable part of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; armada.\nGoblin giant turtles.\nThese &lt;a href=\"Giant%20turtle\"&gt;giant sea turtles&lt;/a&gt; were native to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;southern seas&lt;/a&gt; and were captured by the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;. Pacified by potent spells of control, these lumbering monstrosities were fitted with watertight canopies strapped onto the backs of their shells and were used as submersible &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish craft. By submerging under the waves, the giant turtles could steal upon unsuspecting enemy craft and report their position to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fleet as they were visible solely to &lt;a href=\"tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;s, creatures of the air, and other submersible vessels. The daring &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s who controlled them were dedicated to destroying enemy ships by launching hazardous, steam-driven canisters containing highly volatile liquids that could shred even the strongest of armor.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s stopped using &lt;a href=\"giant%20turtle\"&gt;giant turtle&lt;/a&gt;s and started to also create their own submarines, like their old rivals. One appears at &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Bay\"&gt;Venture Bay&lt;/a&gt;, resembling the &lt;a href=\"X-52%20Nether-Rocket\"&gt;X-52 Nether-Rocket&lt;/a&gt;, but lying on its side, and with a periscope on top. It was built by &lt;a href=\"Bubb%20Lazarr\"&gt;Bubb Lazarr&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to study and thwart icebergs. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; a more sophisticated, squid-like model was created by the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; in order to tackle the dangers of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe gnomes didn't stay behind, creating the \"&lt;a href=\"M.A.C.%20Diver\"&gt;M.A.C.

They are good against &lt;a href=\"carrier\"&gt;carrier&lt;/a&gt;s and weak against &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStarting in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance had begun to deploy miniature versions of their gnomish submarines that house only a handful of people.\nNotable submarines.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;:\n, Alliance:\n, Horde:\n, Iron Horde:\n, &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s:\nIn the RPG.\nDetermined to not let the mysteries of the sea elude their curious minds, &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s created these vessels that can travel under the waves. &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;Gnome inventors&lt;/a&gt; took their resourcefulness to the seas and created these amazing watertight vessels. The submarines have proved themselves to be a powerful threat to not only ships, but also coastal targets within range of the submarine's battery of rockets.\nIt moves at 20 miles per hour on the surface and 10 miles per hour underwater and has a crew of 2 (1 pilot and 1 gunner).\nGnomish submarine torpedo launcher.\nThese paired launchers are placed at both sides of the sub.

Each synthesis matrix is used to achieve the Titans' goals. Typically, the Titans apparently use a \" construction foundation\" in a subterranean being matrix (likely meaning flesh).\nFor &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a subterranean being matrix was to be modified to create a prototype with increased durability with an affinity for deep region shaping. Their design intent was an attempt at improving the survivability paradigm of the standard subterranean being matrix. Through study and research of Azeroth's planetary crust, the Titans discovered that Azeroth has a inherently resilient composition. They then theorized that if they used a cross-section of the crust as the foundation, a subterranean being could be made that would epitomize the resiliency of the planet's essence. Thus, they used a blend of Azeroth's various stone core compounds to synthesize a lifeform that satisfied the design parameters they had set out. The new race and the product of this modification was appropriately named &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;\"Earthen\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nWell into the Earthen's primary service cycle for their Creators, unforeseen anomalies were discovered which affected their synthesis matrix's destabilization due to high-stress environments. The Titans began work on post-synthesis modification, rather than recall and re-synthesis. (Since the Earthen's only downside was the destabilization of their matrix, the Titans prefered to perfect their matrix rather than start over from scratch.) The first series of experiments resulted in &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe second resultant variance of the Earthen matrix are &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; retains many desired elements when compared to the standard subterranean matrix. They are a reversion to a default biomass composition as seen in the standard subterranean matrix.\nFurther experiments conducted in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the \"high-stress environments\" was the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; purposely affecting matrix destabilization, which the Titans termed as the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;\"Curse of Flesh\"&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Old Gods where neutralized and contained within Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; and other systems were instituted to create new Earthen. As the Titans now knew the cause of the Curse of Flesh, the new Earthen were able to be created with immunity to it. Even as the old Earthen would become troggs and dwarves, the new Earthen remained unaffected and still continue to exist in modern Azeroth."}

{"id": "177074", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=177074", "title": "Subversive", "text": "Subversives are militant defenders of the wild who use guerilla tactics and sabotage to safeguard the land. While their methods may be morally questionable, subversives dedicate their lives to defending nature and its inhabitants. They believe that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth's&lt;/a&gt; welfare and survival depend on the state of the wilderness and the creatures populating it. When nature is destabilized, everything in the world is thrown into anarchy \u2014 and everyone suffers.\nRecent history strengthens this belief, as many men and women already closely tied to nature \u2014 such as &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 bore witness to the havoc magic and warfare bring. Although subversives have existed for a long time, they are now more convinced than ever that their cause is essential to the future and that the path they walk is the only one worth traveling. Because of their unwavering convictions, subversives strive to defend the fragile balance of nature and protect animals, plants, magical beasts and other creatures that live in the wilderness. Subversives do anything to reach that goal.\nA subversive spends most of his time in the wild, honing his knowledge of nature and survival skills and testing his mettle against anyone who would harm nature. Subversives are great trackers and survival experts. They are also competent combatants who take full advantage of terrain and positioning when engaged in battle. They often use guerilla tactics, striking at their enemies when they least expect it. Furthermore, subversives know how to build a variety of dangerous, magical traps using natural materials they collect in the wild. These skills, combined with their unwavering dedication, make subversives dangerous opponents.\nSubversives in the world.\nSubversives spend most of their time in the wilderness and seldom travel to towns, fortresses or similar settlements, preferring instead to remain close to nature. When they need to journey to a humanoid settlement, they take short trips and stay no longer than is necessary. Almost everyone shuns subversives due to their violent and cruel natures, so subversives know not to overstay their welcomes.\nThough they may not always agree with their tactics or morals, druids, hunters and scouts view subversives as dedicated members of society \u2014 some may even see subversives as necessary. Those who respect nature hold subversives\u2019 ideals in some esteem, though many despise their tactics. The &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; disapprove of subversives, and consequently most subversives are loners.\nAlthough subversives do not presume to know everything, they believe that the cause they defend is righteous. They often seem more concerned about the well-being of plant and animal life than about the safety of their compatriots. In truth, however, this is rarely the case. Subversives are determined to save nature because they believe that doing so is the only way to protect the people who share the world with the creatures living in it.\nScholars disagree on subversives\u2019 origins. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; sages believe that subversives developed ages ago in night elf society \u2014 though the night elves deny this assertion. Regardless of the race actually responsible for its development, the calling of the subversive is widely spread among both night elf and tauren societies, as heroes from both races frequently come to the same conclusions and harbor the same desires to defend nature. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; share their beliefs and knowledge with their allies, and today some &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s also learn the subversive\u2019s mysteries."}

After Ragnaros was reborn in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, and the heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; defeated him once again, his weapon now reflects the same loss as the Extinguished Hand. &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; believes that in this lies proof that Ragnaros is dead.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nSmaller versions of Sulfuras (suitable for mortals to wield) are available in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Hand of Ragnaros.\n&lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; is a legendary weapon for level 60 characters. It is created by combining a &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Hammer\"&gt;Sulfuron Hammer&lt;/a&gt; (crafted by a blacksmith) with an &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sulfuras\"&gt;Eye of Sulfuras&lt;/a&gt; (which drops from &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Extinguished Hand.\n&lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20the%20Extinguished%20Hand\"&gt;Sulfuras, the Extinguished Hand&lt;/a&gt; is an epic weapon for level 85 characters. It drops from &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28Firelands%20tactics%29\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nSulfuras is the mighty weapon of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon never leaves his grasp. It is composed of flaming red elementium and etched from end to end with intricate runes that seem to move like flowing lava across the weapons surface. Sulfuras is covered with many vicious pikes of varying sizes, each white hot and surrounded by the distortion of shimmering heat.\nWhen a creature is slain by Sulfuras, its body is consumed by intense flame and effectively disintegrated, leaving behind only a pile of ash. The heat and pressure of this effect solidifies the ash into a hard, dark, crystal. This crystal is known as an Eye of Sulfuras and is used by Ragnaros' followers in ancient rituals or to craft special weapons such as sulfuron hammers.\nSulfuron Hammers.\nSulfuras is incredibly massive. Far too massive, in fact, for most mortals to even dream of wielding, even if they could somehow defeat the elemental Firelord. However, fanatical followers of Ragnaros found a way to craft hammers in its image. Each requires an Eye of Sulfuras, and these lesser weapons are known as sulfuron hammers. A sulfuron hammer appears to be a smaller version of Sulfuras. It is a spiked, flaming red warhammer. The hammer is crafted entirely from elementium, with an Eye of Sulfuras embedded deep in the hammer\u2019s head."}

It was named for the forces of its former master, the demented &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, who wrested the keep from &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Son%20of%20Arugal\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;\" and held it until he was defeated by a group of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; heroes. The keep was then occupied by the Scourge remnants and followers of the renegade &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; nobleman &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Vincent Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, traitor to both his homeland and to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; who returned him from death.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the keep was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, who captured it and were using it as a bio-weapons facility to wage war against Gilneas. By the end of the war, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; had taken control of the keep, moving most of its artifacts to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; to be guarded closely.\nHistory.\nShadowfang Keep was previously a part of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. It was the home to the lords of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;, who answered to &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;'s family. The lord of the castle was &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; and his forces were led by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Springvale\"&gt;Commander Springvale&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Stilwell\"&gt;Jordan Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Stilwell\"&gt;Daphne Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; used to live and work here before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Landen%20Stilwell\"&gt;Landen Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; was still here years later.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; washed over Lordaeron, the Gilnean Archmage, &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, investigated the research of the mage &lt;a href=\"Ur\"&gt;Ur&lt;/a&gt;. With the sorcerer's knowledge, Arugal summoned the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; with the blessings of &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and against the advice of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. The worgen successfully turned the tide against the Scourge, but became uncontrollable, attacking the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20military\"&gt;Gilnean military&lt;/a&gt;. After this, Arugal's worgen ran rampant through Silverpine, eventually overwhelming the keep, killing Baron Silverlaine and his family. Distraught and broken, Arugal accepted the worgen as his &lt;a href=\"Son%20of%20Arugal\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; and retreated into the keep and named the place Shadowfang Keep. Communing with &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;, he became a key servant of the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;, converting the humans of Silverpine into worgen, namely the &lt;a href=\"Moonrage\"&gt;Moonrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20pack\"&gt;Shadowfang packs&lt;/a&gt;. Protected by his worgen minions as well as the ghosts of the fallen Baron and his household, Arugal served his master in converting most of the forest's remaining denizens to the curse, with locations such as &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elem%20Mine\"&gt;Deep Elem Mine&lt;/a&gt; falling as well as Pyrewood.\nAfter sometime, the entire &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; was turned to the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;, turning into the beasts at night. During the day, they were human and willing to provide supplies to &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; travelers, though the keep was never friendly to these adventurers. They were led by the &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Council\"&gt;Pyrewood Council&lt;/a&gt;, who were all servants of Arugal. The Forsaken became increasingly suspicious of their activities, especially after the disappearance of one of their apothecaries, &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Berard\"&gt;Apothecary Berard&lt;/a&gt;. After it was discovered that Arugal had transformed him into a worgen, the Forsaken assassinated the council.\nArugal was eventually defeated and beheaded by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, the only denizens of the keep in the years to follow were the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Chemical%20Co.\"&gt;Crown Chemical Co.&lt;/a&gt;, who used the location as a base of operations for their schemes.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Lich King saw it fit to bring Arugal back as one of his puppets, so several &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; blood princes arrived at Shadowfang Keep and found Arugal's grave, raising the Archmage as a shade to serve the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinuing his work converting humans to a wolf cult, the now undead archmage makes his home in a tower built and named for the keep, &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Tower\"&gt;Shadowfang Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he and his new wolf cult were defeated as well.\nCataclysm.\nAfter betraying both Gilneas and the Forsaken, &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Vincent Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Baron Ashbury&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Walden\"&gt;Lord Walden&lt;/a&gt; converted the abandoned keep into their holdfast against their enemies. The keep became a battleground between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; vying for Godfrey's head, with both groups aiming to slaughter the man as well as claim the keep for their respective factions.

Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; troops march towards Shadowfang in order to prevent its deployment.\nExploring Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; embarked on their journey to explore Azeroth as well as catalogue the locations of various artifacts, they visited Silverpine forest.\nShaw noted his main contact in the area as Ivar Bloodfang, stating that the packleader was his contact within Shadowfang Keep. The pack has apparently claimed it, alongside Fenris Isle, and has taken most of the artifacts within the Shadowfang to Fenris Keep to be guarded closely.\nDragonflight.\nWhile Shadowfang Keep is never visited during it; the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heritage%20armor\"&gt;heritage armor&lt;/a&gt; questline establishes that, somehow, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; has taken command of &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of said questline, the keep is taken over by the Forsaken. This leaves Shadowfang as the last known major holding of the Bloodfang pack in Silverpine.\nDungeon Journals.\nWoW Dungeon Journal.\n\"During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the wizards of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; battled against the undead armies of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. When the wizards of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; died in battle, they would rise soon after - adding their former might to the growing Scourge. Frustrated by their lack of progress (and against the advice of his peers) the &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; elected to summon extra-dimensional entities to bolster Dalaran's diminishing ranks. Arugal's summoning brought the ravenous worgen into the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The feral wolf-men slaughtered not only the Scourge, but quickly turned on the wizards themselves. The worgen sieged the keep of the noble, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt;. Situated above the tiny hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt;, the keep quickly fell into shadow and ruin. Driven mad with guilt, Arugal adopted the worgen as his children and retreated to the newly dubbed 'Shadowfang Keep'. It's said he still resides there, protected by his massive pet, Fenrus - and haunted by the vengeful ghost of Baron Silverlaine.\"\nCataclysm Dungeon Journal.\n\"Looming over Pyrewood Village from the southern bluffs of Silverpine Forest, Shadowfang Keep casts a shadow as dark as its legacy. Sinister forces occupy these ruins, formerly the dwelling of the mad archmage Arugal's worgen. The restless shade of Baron Silverlaine lingers while Lord Godfrey and his cabal of erstwhile Gilnean noblemen plot against their enemies both living and undead.\"\nOverview.\nThe quests and storyline for Alliance players and Horde players are different. The quest giver for Alliance players is &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, and the Horde quest giver is &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt;.

The quests for each faction (&lt;a href=\"Fury%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Fury of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sweet%2C%20Merciless%20Revenge\"&gt;Sweet, Merciless Revenge&lt;/a&gt;) end with their respective faction taking Shadowfang Keep.\nLove is in the Air.\nPart of the &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; event takes place in Shadowfang Keep. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s are sent by the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; to investigate &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Chemical%20Company\"&gt;Crown Chemical Company&lt;/a&gt; inside Shadowfang Keep.

It is the base of operations for the evil &lt;a href=\"archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; progeny.\nHistory.\nPyrewood Village is shadowed to the north by Shadowfang Keep, once a bastion of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; power but now the dark residence of a mad former &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, named Arugal. The worgen that stalk the Keep, as well as the cursed villagers of Pyrewood, are the doings of this madman. During the Third War, Arugal made these worgen as allies but they could not be controlled and turned on him and the other soldiers. He went mad after this and now accepts them as his \"children.\" His worgen run rampant throughout much of the forest.\n&lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Stilwell\"&gt;Jordan Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Stilwell\"&gt;Daphne Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; used to live and work here before the Third War. &lt;a href=\"Landen%20Stilwell\"&gt;Landen Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; was still here years later.\nDuring the events of World of Warcraft, agents of the Banshee Queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; were dispatched to both solve the mystery of the enigmatic worgen and ultimately terminate the source of the creatures' infestation in Silverpine. Eventually they were able to discover that the mad archmage, Arugal, was behind the worgen's presence, and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; command ordered him slain.\nOverview.\nSFK is the first vaguely challenging instance that players are likely to encounter. In addition to the volume of mobs present, several of the mobs here cast various curses, nearly every type of Worgen has some sort of special ability (active or passive) that affects a group's ability to deal with them, and the undead humans make use of Silence, which means that a tank can be caught without healing in some fights if the healer(s) get hit with it. \nHowever, since the nerfing of SFK's mobs, the caution previously required is no longer vital to success here.\nFor the level, the loot here is highly desirable, with a few different items that can sell well via the twink market. Several bind-on-pickup blue items are also to be found here, primarily for Mages and Warriors in particular. Although the level is still low enough that cash isn't hugely abundant, there is still some silver dropped.\nMobs.\n\"Shadowfang Worgen\"\n\"Worg\"\n\"Tormented Souls\"\nSpeculation.\nShadowfang Keep probably earned its name from the rumors of the worgen that guard it; before that, it may have been called \"Silverlaine Keep\" or \"Pyrewood Keep.\""}

Neltharion believed he could control the forces of shadowflame, which festered until it corrupted him, and as a result, nearly the entire &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Experiments on the potency of shadowflame were conducted in &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;'s secret laboratory of &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt;, creating the &lt;a href=\"Amalgamation%20Chamber\"&gt;Amalgamation Chamber&lt;/a&gt;. Shadowflame deteriorates both mind and body with insidious haste, as when injured with it, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; was given very little time as the corruption spread. Shadowflame seems to connect those corrupted to the void, as Sabellian states he could hear it speaking. &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;primal incarnate&lt;/a&gt; of fire, believed he could succeed where Neltharion failed by absorbing the shadowflame in the &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Caldera\"&gt;Zaqali Caldera&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; believes this will ultimately corrupt the incarnate, and speculates on the intentions of &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; by leading Fyrakk to it.\nIt manifests as purple or purple-red fire, and aside from incineration can be used to animate &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; constructs. Many &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014including Deathwing himself, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; after her reanimation\u2014breathe shadowflame, as do some &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Mortal &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shadowmage\"&gt;shadowmage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists, and some &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s all make use of it as well. Following Fyrakk's absorption of shadowflame, it can be seen being used by some of his &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, and is made liberal use of by the &lt;a href=\"Zaqali\"&gt;Zaqali&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowflame is not limited to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be found on the world of &lt;a href=\"Riftworld%20Codex\"&gt;Ruvaraad&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s (mainly &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s) are also infused with or use it.\nAs a spell school.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", shadowflame is a &lt;a href=\"multi-school\"&gt;multi-school&lt;/a&gt;, combining the Fire and Shadow &lt;a href=\"magic%20schools\"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt;. Multi-school abilities benefit from bonuses that affect any of their schools, use the lowest resistance value among their schools, ignore absorption and immunity effects that apply to only some of their schools, and can be used even when one or more of their schools have been locked with an &lt;a href=\"interrupt%20effect\"&gt;interrupt effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nNefarian's breath, known as shadow flame, is among the deadliest of any dragon's attacks. Nefarian uses his shadow flame breath to incinerate anyone who is not properly protected. He uses his corrupted power ability to incapacitate whatever characters he feels are the greatest threat. If badly wounded, Nefarian uses his powerful magic to retreat. If prevented from retreating, he uses his most powerful spells and abilities to turn his enemies against each other, and to drain their health and spells while restoring his own. Any living target affected by Nefarian's breath is set afire with shadowflame, taking terrible damage. The only protection from this attack is the &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20Scale%20Cloak\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; of another powerful black dragon."}

They work to create living stone warriors to take the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; for themselves and their fiery master. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20elemental\"&gt;Fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s are also patrolling the streets of the city.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAfter the Dark Iron Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, summoned &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Irons became the new servants of the Firelord. Summoning Ragnaros destroyed the northern regions of the Redridge Range including the former capital of the Dark Iron dwarves, the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;city of Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. In the need of a new capital, the Dark Iron dwarves constructed the magnificent Shadowforge City deep within the recently-formed &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=\"Kharan%27s%20Tale\"&gt;kidnapped on her way to Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and brought to &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; in Shadowforge City. Rather than simply being a prisoner, Thaurissan showed her the respect her father did not give her, listening to her when she spoke and expressed the belief that she could rule just as well as any man. Thus, Moira fell in love with the Emperor and married him. &lt;a href=\"Kharan%20Mighthammer\"&gt;Kharan Mighthammer&lt;/a&gt;, the only escorting guard to survive the kidnapping, came to believe that the Princess was presumably ensorcelled, reporting this to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s that came to rescue him.\nKing Magni, upset that Moira was with an arch enemy of his family, sent a covert team of Alliance champions to Shadowforge City to kill Emperor Thaurissan and retrieve the presumably ensorcelled Moira back to Ironforge. However, Moira refused to come home and announced that she was pregnant; additionally, the death of her husband left a terrible, fiery rage within her heart.\nCataclysm.\nIn the wake of King Magni's petrification, Moira returned to Ironforge from Shadowforge City with her infant son &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt; to claim the throne. Backed by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, Moira ruled Ironforge arrogantly and with an iron fist. This didn't last as King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; went to Ironforge to rescue his son, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, that was held captive. In the end, Anduin convinced his father not to kill Moira eventually leading into the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the creation of the council, Moira has been leading her people from Ironforge instead of Shadowforge City. The home of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; is currently in flux. Queen-Regent &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; is preoccupied with maintaining the alliance with her former enemies. She hasn't had the chance to ensure the security of her son's future kingdom, as her \"allies\" on the Council relentlessly seek out any signs of treachery.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter repelling an attack of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining Dark Irons join the Alliance under Moira, and the Regent Queen travels to Shadowforge. It serves as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; capital, with accessible areas being the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Guzzler\"&gt;Grim Guzzler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Vault\"&gt;Black Vault&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Crafting\"&gt;Hall of Crafting&lt;/a&gt;, and the central area of the city. The city has been slightly modified with a bridge to remove the convoluted path from the Grim Guzzler to the Domicile area.\nDark Iron adventurers can get back to Shadowforge City using their &lt;a href=\"Mole%20Machine%20%28racial%29\"&gt;Mole Machine (racial)&lt;/a&gt; racial ability or by using the &lt;a href=\"mole%20machine\"&gt;mole machine&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "183562", "revid": "53858360", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=183562", "title": "Shadowlands", "text": "The Shadowlands (&lt;a href=\"%23Other%20names\"&gt;see below for other names and denotations&lt;/a&gt;) are the realm of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;, an infinite &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of deceased mortals go to be reborn, serve, find peace, do battle, or endure endless torment. The Shadowlands exist on the edge of reality, separated from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;physical universe&lt;/a&gt; by a barrier known as the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt;, and consist of an infinite number of diverse afterlives sustained by the flow of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from the recently dead. Mortal souls who cross the Veil between life and death arrive at the Eternal City of &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; and are judged by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, who then assigns them to the afterlife that suits them most, the largest and most significant of which are ruled by a pantheon of &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; and powerful orders known as &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s, each with its own unique role in maintaining the ecosystem of the afterlife.\nThe Shadowlands serve as the main setting of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\"'s .\nDescription.\nUntil recently, the nature of the Shadowlands was obscure, with the living knowing the realm only as a cold and nightmarish place of labyrinthine spiritual planes. While many believe that souls of the dead languish in the Shadowlands forever, others hope their souls will go on to a brighter place. &lt;a href=\"Kyrian\"&gt;Kyrian&lt;/a&gt; Watchers known as &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;spirit healers&lt;/a&gt; decide when it's time for a mortal &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; to pass into the Shadowlands. When a soul crosses the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; between life and death, it is shepherded by the kyrian to the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; so that they can be judged by the impassive &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. All of the soul's contents\u2014deeds, misdeeds, thoughts, accomplishments, and failures\u2014are laid bare before the Arbiter, who then judges in a mere instant and sends the soul through one of the gateways in her chamber to one of the infinite realms of the Shadowlands, the largest of which are ruled over by powerful &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014powerful orders who have existed since the Shadowlands were shaped long ago, and who bear sacred duties to help maintain the afterlife's ecosystem. Each of the primary afterlives is overseen by one of the immensely powerful &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; who together make up the Pantheon of Death. Each soul brings with it a vital force known as &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;, the product of all of the soul's experiences and actions in life. Anima is the lifeblood of the Shadowlands, making trees grow and rivers flow and is the source that's drawn upon to conduct the magic of death. Great souls\u2014both good and evil\u2014have a lot of anima, while those who have lived humbler lives have less.\nFour of the realms\u2014&lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;\u2014are especially vital to the functioning of the Shadowlands. However, there could be infinite afterlives, some small and tailored to a single person while others are vast and full of either splendor or torment. All interpretations of the afterlife held by mortal cultures are possible somewhere within the Shadowlands. All of the realms of Death were created from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;' realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, tucked away in the fabric of the Shadowlands itself.\nBecause souls are constantly crossing over from the mortal plane, new afterlives are manifested by Zereth Mortis' &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt; to meet the needs of the Shadowlands.\nBetween each realm is a cloudy space known as the &lt;a href=\"In-Between\"&gt;In-Between&lt;/a&gt; which was once rich with streams of anima connecting the different domains, but the current anima drought has caused the realms to become cut off from one another, breeding fear and mistrust among the inhabitants.\nSouls are not necessarily permanently stuck in their assigned afterlives. When the machinery of Death functioned the way it was supposed to, souls who had completed obligations in one realm sometimes had the opportunity to travel to some of the other realms of the Shadowlands. For example, romantic partners who are initially sent to different realms may eventually find an afterlife they can share together.\nThe Shadowlands transcend all worlds and realities, as evidenced with &lt;a href=\"Soulbinder%20Nyami\"&gt;Soulbinder Nyami&lt;/a&gt; and the loa being able to use their power on &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. All alternate versions of the same mortal are more or less part of the same being, such as in the case with &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, using an analogy of a rope with different threads which can be pulled off, but which \"at some time come together to make that rope\" and eventually come together as one being in the Shadowlands.\nWhen a soul is called from the afterlife, it is free to roam the material realm if it is not restrained within moments of its arrival. Mortal souls that cross over and are brought back do not appear, however, to retain defined memories of what they experienced in the Shadowlands. A spirit in the Shadowlands can, with enough power over other souls, tear a hole into the living world once they are strong enough. This is how &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; returned to Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; is perceived differently in the Shadowlands. Time and Death are not related, as Death is about eternity and not linear time. Time is a construct of order and structure, but circumstances in the Shadowlands are more chaotic. To a soul in the Shadowlands, it can therefore feel like eons have passed since their arrival whereas only a few months or years have elapsed in the world of the living, much like a dream in which a significant period of time can seem to pass even though one has only slept for a few hours. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; leaders who were imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; felt as if they were trapped for weeks or longer, enough for them to make countless escape attempts and for &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to feel as if time had lost all meaning, whereas far less time elapsed in the mortal world. Nevertheless, time of some kind seems to exist, as the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, before leaving his realm and disappearing, had an ally able to peer into the timeways to see every possible outcome for his military and its various tactics in order to determine the best possible ones.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; serves as an anchor to the Shadowlands. During the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, the Shadowlands draw closer to Azeroth.\nThe border between the Shadowlands and the living world is the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like the living world in greyscale.\nOther planes like &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt; are connected to the Shadowlands but not contained inside it.\nEven after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; is still an uncertainty to most citizens of Azeroth, as they didn't come to the Shadowlands with the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and not everyone came back from the realm of the dead.\nHistory.\nThe Shadowlands were created by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and have existed ever since &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; life first arose in the physical universe. Everything in the realms of Death was made by the First Ones and their &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; servants from their realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, the Eternal One &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt; served as the Arbiter of mortal souls. However, when he sought to unmake the balance of the cosmos, the rest of the Pantheon of Death banished him to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to make him its Jailer and constructed a &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;new Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to replace him.\n&lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Keeper Odyn&lt;/a&gt; used knowledge he gleaned from the Shadowlands to create the first &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, and tasked her with bringing the souls of worthy &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; killed herself in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, she found herself in the darkness where she encountered nine Val'kyr that remained in service to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. While there, the partnership between Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; started.\nShadowlands in disarray.\nThe Shadowlands are in a state of disarray. In the natural order of things, souls are sorted and sent on to an afterlife realm appropriate to the lives they lived, but since around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion's third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and some time after &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;'s death in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; has gone mysteriously dormant, and all souls who have perished\u2014including the innocents slain at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;\u2014are now being funneled directly into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadowlands are starving for &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; even as the Maw continues to grow from the glut of fresh souls. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; has been seemingly perpetrating acts to bring about great amounts of death and destruction. In partnership with &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, they have been working toward a common end for some time.\nMembers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; will manage to enter the Shadowlands with the help of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, and will directly be sent into the Maw. Thanks to the connection some of the heroes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; have to their &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, a number of them will be able to leave the Maw and travel the realms of the dead, being the first to do this kind of feat, and become known as the Maw Walkers.\nGeography.\nAlthough the world map for the Shadowlands (pictured right) depicts the realms of Death on a flat plane, this is only a top-down view. In reality, the Shadowlands are an infinite three-dimensional space, and &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; is the zone that is lowest down and closest to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, while &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; appears to be adjacent to the Maw, it's not being directly affected by it in the same way that Revendreth is. The Eternal City of &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; stands at the heart of the realms of Death, while &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; is tucked away within the fabric of the Shadowlands itself.\nInhabitants.\nBeings of death are ancient and powerful, and it is dangerous to meddle in their realm. When &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; peered into the Shadowlands, he saw some of its inhabitants: souls in torment, the husks of the dead, ghostly wraiths with no face, and others with no form, all made of death itself. This was enough to frighten even him.\nMany beings in the Shadowlands are souls of deceased mortals, some of which have been transformed to serve a new purpose, such as the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Other creatures\u2014such as &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"faerie\"&gt;faerie&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014are endemic to the Shadowlands and are naturally born from the magic of Death to serve the different realms and help facilitate the process of the afterlife.\nAside from intelligent mortal races, the souls of animals are also sent to the Shadowlands. For example, all &lt;a href=\"house%20cat\"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt; are sent to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; when they die, and the steeds of dark souls may be sent to Revendreth to become &lt;a href=\"sinrunner\"&gt;sinrunner&lt;/a&gt;s due to either their own sins or their masters' sins.\nIf a being of Death is killed on the mortal plane, their essence returns to the Shadowlands to be reformed, similar to how &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s reform in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. However, if such a being\u2014either the soul of a former mortal or a native being of the Shadowlands\u2014is destroyed in the Shadowlands, they die permanently and their soul is lost forever. Their energy then disperses and joins the greater whole of the magic of Death. If a \"workforce\" creature like a dredger or steward dies, another member of the same race will eventually manifest to take the place of the one that was killed. Interestingly, &lt;a href=\"Thanikos\"&gt;Thanikos&lt;/a&gt; ordered to blast the corpses and sunder the souls of &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent them from being raised by death magic to fight again. A person that is still alive when they cross the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; into the Shadowlands, however, has a tether to their homeworld that might nudge them back to life when killed there.\nOther afterlives.\nIn some situations, souls may be taken to other places besides the Shadowlands:\n&lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; can be trapped from going to an afterlife.\nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\nThe final destination of the spirits of the deceased remains a mystery to the priests and philosophers of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. However, as spells such as &lt;a href=\"resurrection\"&gt;resurrection&lt;/a&gt; can reunite a dead body with its spirit, and a majority of living creatures from the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; to the troll &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s claim they can communicate with and call upon the power of the spirits, a widely held belief is that the &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s of the dead remain on the &lt;a href=\"Plane%23Material%20Plane\"&gt;Material Plane&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in an immaterial state that can only be altered or contacted through the use of magic."}

Now you must investigate a conspiracy to unmake the cosmos, and help Warcraft legends journey back... or fulfill their ultimate destiny.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nThe Shadowlands.\nNew World\nWhat lies beyond the world you know? The Shadowlands, resting place for every mortal soul\u2014virtuous or vile\u2014that has ever lived. Journey through planes of torment and imprisonment to those of rebirth and eternal reward.\nBastion.\nThose who have lived a life of service are frawn to Bastion to assume the highest duty of all\u2014carrying souls to the Shadowlands. Amongst Bastion's gleaming spires and sweeping vistas await challenges to test the mettle of the steadfast kyrians.\nArdenweald.\nA vibrant afterlife for those closely connected to the wild, Ardenweald is a domain of endless restoration tended by the mystic night fae. Within this eternal forest, massive dream trees draw in precious anima\u2014soul essence\u2014to feed the spirits of nature awaiting rebirth.\nMaldraxxus.\nWithin war-torn Maldraxxus, might\u2014of all kinds\u2014makes right. Here, in the birthplace of necromantic magic, those who master the powers of death turn legions of ambitious souls into relentless undead armies.\nRevendreth.\nA realm of looming keeps and gothic villages, Revendreth is home to the venthyr, the harvesters of sin. The wretched souls who arrive here may find penance for their misdeeds... or merely indulge the appetites of their keepers.\nThe Maw.\nTo be cast into the Maw is to be doomed to a bleak eternity. It is a tumultuous, hopeless land where the vilest souls in the cosmos are imprisoned forever. Should the ancient evil chained here break free, all of reality will be consumed.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nOribos, The Eternal City.\nNew Player Hub\nOribos is the arrival point for all souls who enter the Shadowlands. At this crossroads, the dead are judged by the impassive Arbiter before being sent to their final destinations, and Oribos\u2019 denizens swap gossip and anima\u2014soulstuff that serves as both power and currency. \n&lt;hr&gt;\nCovenants.\nNew Feature\nAlign yourself with one of four Covenants\u2014mysterious sects, each with their own ambition for the Shadowlands\u2014to restore balance to the hereafter.\nYou\u2019ll gain access to your Covenant\u2019s Sanctum, where you\u2019ll accept unique quests, undertake a sprawling covenant campaign, and call upon your allies to embark on important missions. You\u2018ll also earn unique abilities based on your Covenant and class, acquire a unique mount and visual appearance, and forge bonds with powerful souls, drawing on their essence to further customize your skills.\n&lt;a href=\"/Covenants\"&gt;Visit Covenants&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\nTorghast, Tower of the Damned.\nNew Feature - Infinite Dungeon\nOnce, the Jailer kept only the most dangerous souls in the cosmos confined in this eternal prison. Now, some of Azeroth\u2019s greatest heroes are trapped here, and you\u2019ll need to rescue them from the Jailer\u2019s tower before he expends their very souls.\nTorghast is an endlessly replayable, ever-changing dungeon that you can challenge alone or in a group. Your runs will differ each time, but you\u2019ll need to explore cautiously. Death comes at a terrible cost. Defeat enough of Torghast\u2019s unpredictable challenges, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with unique abilities and items to ensure your present survival or bolster your next run. The further you progress, the greater your likelihood of retrieving materials to craft the legendary weapons and armor that will help you restore balance to the Shadowlands.\nOther secrets lie within the tower\u2026 but they\u2019re yet to be revealed.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nLeveled-Up Leveling.\nGame Updates\nWorld of Warcraft: Shadowlands will smooth out the leveling experience and better prepare new adventurers for what\u2019s to come. Players will level up to 50 before heading to the Shadowlands (new level cap: 60). \nWe\u2019ve adjusted the experience curve to make it faster than ever to prepare for the newest challenges, and each level along the way will provide more meaningful increases in progress and power. All expansion zones are getting more flexible, too; they\u2019ll be able* to scale to you and your friends while you level to 50, so it\u2019s easy to try a zone you\u2019ve never played.\n\"*\"You can still outlevel dungeons and crush them for transmogs or fulfillment.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nNew Character Customization.\nIn World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, you will be able to become the hero you're meant to be. All-new customization options for characters will be available, from varied skin tones to facial features, new tattoos, hairstyles, earrings, and more. Just visit your friendly appearance agitator in Oribos, or the local barber shop back on Azeroth. It's time to give your main a makeover."}

It overviewed the new &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenants&lt;/a&gt; added in .\nKyrian.\nSteadfast guardians who carry the souls of the dead.\nLiving beings have wished to become something greater than themselves since time immemorial. Souls deemed noble enough can prove themselves in Bastion, land of pristine spires and crystalline skies, where those who surpass their trials earn the honor of ascension to a higher calling beside the Archon, first among the winged kyrians.\nThe kyrians are eternal beings who draw only the most accomplished, principled, and pure into their ranks. But, as souls plunge into the Maw and upheaval rocks the Shadowlands, scores of aspiring kyrians find that they are unable to continue their journey to ascension. With the number of kyrians dwindling, their charge to ferry souls to eternity is in jeopardy. Will the Archon\u2019s devoted stand together, or will this test of faith sunder their shining kingdom?\nVenthyr.\nEaters of sin who harvest anima from wicked souls.\nThe venthyr have a good thing going. They lord over Revendreth\u2019s castles and ceaseless twilight while arrogant souls are delivered to their tables. The harvesters\u2019 otherworldly punishments strip the pride from their thralls, sparing them an even worse fate: eternal torment in the Maw.\nBut souls thus drained can\u2019t just leave Revendreth for a better place. They have years of penance to slog through while they reflect on the precarity of their afterlives. And, after eons of service, the venthyr are increasingly ruled by their decadence and pride. The very purpose of the plane may be flawed\u2026 and those who were once accusers have become gluttonous and corrupt.\nRevendreth must always have a master, and rumor suggests that Denathrius, foremost among the venthyr, may no longer be fit for the role. Crowning a new Sire could return the plane to its former glory\u2026 or leave Revendreth mired in the same decadence and sin it is charged with cleansing.\nNight Fae.\nDefenders of nature who uphold the cycle of rebirth.\nIf the Emerald Dream mirrors the spring and summer of life, then the star-hued plane of Ardenweald reflects life in its twilight.\nThose who pass on with a deep connection to nature are tended here by the mystic night fae, who retrieve anima from mortal souls and infuse it into slumbering spirits, rejuvenating their lives with the remnants of the old.\nArdenweald has suffered more keenly from soul-drought than any other realm in the Shadowlands. For the first time in endless ages, the night fae's Winter Queen must choose which of the land\u2019s formerly lush groves\u2014and which souls\u2014will be fed the last precious drops of anima\u2026 and which will fade away forever.\nNecrolord.\nNecrotic soldiers who wage war throughout the cosmos.\nIn the skull-and-bone laboratories of Maldraxxus, strength is rewarded, and weakness cast aside. Necromancers experiment on the souls of the ambitious and contentious, reforming only the greatest into undead soldiers who protect the Shadowlands. Those who are determined rise to positions of power. The less-promising become fuel for Maldraxxus\u2019 malign weapons.\nMaldraxxus\u2019 brutal selection process has built a vast and capable militia\u2026 but its hierarchy is wobbling. The longtime leader of the realm has vanished. In his absence, five of the most eminent necrolords vie for the position, and the responsibility to advance the cause of death throughout the cosmos. Each bids on newly-arrived souls, filling their personal guard with capable soldiers and building armies larger than any yet known.\nWhen they march, will it be towards one another\u2026 or the realms they swore to defend?"}

Realizing that Sylvanas has also kidnapped several leaders of the Alliance and Horde, the remaining faction leaders call on the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to help the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to stop the rampaging &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; to go on a suicide mission to recover the leaders from the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and the forces of &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving met up with the kidnapped leaders, and a brief run-in with Sylvanas, but having lost track of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, the party moves to make their escape from the Maw. As the Jailer's forces closed in, the adventurer touched the Waystone and, for the first time, managed to escape, leaving the leaders behind. The adventurer winds up in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, the eternal city, home to the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; and center of the main realms of the Shadowlands.\nThe threads of fate.\nAlts of players who have already completed the level-up campaign, earned the &lt;a href=\"Choosing%20Your%20Purpose%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Choosing Your Purpose (achievement)&lt;/a&gt; achievement, and completed the first chapter of their covenant campaign will be offered a choice by &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Tahl\"&gt;Fatescribe Roh-Tahl&lt;/a&gt;, once they make it out of the Maw and land in Oribos. Players can choose to play through the level-up campaign again, or twist the threads of fate: immediately choose a covenant, start working on renown, and level through world quests/side quests/bonus objectives, and dungeons.\nIf alts choose to go down this road they will be locked in and cannot play through the level-up campaign. However, alts on the level-up campaign can choose to speak to the fatescribe at any time.\nThe four covenants.\nFirst-time characters (or alts who elected not to twist the threads of fate) will play through a linear storyline, working their way through the four zones.\nBastion.\nUnsettled by the adventurer's talk of &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;winged creatures&lt;/a&gt; absconding with mortals and throwing them into the Maw, the attendants of Oribos ask the adventurer to travel to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and gather more information. At first glance, an idyllic and peaceful realm, though stuck in its ways, the facade quickly crumbles as an opposing faction, the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; strike out at one of the seven temples.\nFinally managing to gain an audience with the &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer is tasked to check on the wards protecting the remaining temples, and having found the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt; unprotected, heads that direction. The &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; have obliterated the temple, turning what's left of it into the &lt;a href=\"Necrotic%20Wake\"&gt;Necrotic Wake&lt;/a&gt;. As the kyrian are about to go to war, the adventurer heads back to Oribos to spread the news.\nMaldraxxus.\nThe adventurer opens the gate to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and immediately themself in the middle of a civil war between the remaining houses of power. A familiar face, &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, snags the champion from the ambush and heads to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;. Treachery and misdirection are afoot in the seat of military power of the Shadowlands.\nReturning to the House of the Chosen after making allies of some of the other houses, the adventurer finds the leader of the house dead. &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;, one of the sub-leaders of the house alongside Draka, asks the adventurer, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; for having escaped the Maw, to return to find one of the other barons. Checking in with &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, he hands over an amulet that should help the Maw Walker locate &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, who was left behind after the initial assault on the Maw.\nThe Maw Walker locates Darion, and &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; who has set up shop in the Maw. The party locates the baron, none other than Darion's father, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, the Ashbringer. Turns out Baron Vyraz is a traitor, and sent Alexandros and the Maw Walker to die in an attempt to usurp power. Ve'nari helps the Mograines and the adventurer escape back to Oribos, and the party immediately returns to Maldraxxus to enact revenge on Vyraz. Though Vyraz manages to escape, the Maw Walker gains access to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, the missing leader of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;.\nArdenweald.\nThe Primus left a warning for the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, so the adventurer is tasked to deliver it to her. Home to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt;, Ardenweald is the afterlife of souls tightly bound to Nature, and has keenly felt the effects of the anima drought. In an attempt to consolidate and save as many of the &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s as possible, the adventurer helps move a wildseed beset by terrible nightmares to protect it from the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the help of some of the Night Fae, the adventurer completes a ritual to delve into the memories of that wildseed. After reliving her origin, her betrayal, and her end, the Maw Walker realizes that the wildseed is that of the Dreamer herself, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;, the night fae awaken Ysera. Now that the adventurer has the Winter Queen's attention, they provide her with the Primus's message. Much more anima is needed to hold &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt; in the Maw, so she asks the Maw Walker to reach out to the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; for help.\nRevendreth.\n&lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; is undergoing a rebellion, as the forces under &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; are pushing back against those belonging to &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, Denathrius would be happy to supply &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; and the other covenants if he wasn't so occupied tamping out the rebellion, so could the Maw Walker deign to assist him in his efforts? Since &lt;a href=\"The%20Accuser\"&gt;The Accuser&lt;/a&gt; has been such a thorn in Denathrius's side, he tasks the adventurer to capture her Sinstone and turn the Accuser over to &lt;a href=\"the%20Fearstalker\"&gt;the Fearstalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot all is at it appears, as the Accuser shows the Maw Walker a conversation between Denathrius and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Inerva%20Darkvein\"&gt;Lady Inerva Darkvein&lt;/a&gt;, revealing Denathrius's actual goal: he has been siphoning anima to the Maw! After escaping &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt; and defeating the Fearstalker, the adventurer sets out to gather allies, reclaim &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;, and recover Prince Renathal from the Maw. Renathal gives the Maw Walker their first taste of &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; to free additional allies, and then what's left of Renathal's forces launch an attack on Denathrius at Castle Nathria.\nThe looming dark.\nHaving failed to stop &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; from leeching untold amounts of Anima to the Maw, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; directs the Maw Walker back to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to implore &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt;, the Honored Voice of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to action. The adventurer must make a choice: which &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; will they choose to join?\nThe covenant campaigns.\nAfter making their selection, the Maw Walker is welcomed to their chosen covenant, and a max-level campaign plays out. Each campaign is eight chapters long, and each chapter is gated behind &lt;a href=\"%3ARenown\"&gt;:Renown&lt;/a&gt;, levels 5, 8, 11, 13, 17, 20, and 22.\nKyrian.\nThe noble kyrian of Bastion face dire circumstances with the impending Forsworn forces threatening to unravel their realm. They will need the Maw Walker's aid if they are to reclaim Bastion and save the Shadowlands.\nNecrolords.\nThe ambitious Necrolords face a threat of extinction at their own hand. The Maw Walker's presence will force disparate fragments into an army capable of challenging fate itself.\nNight Fae.\nThe groves of Ardenweald are dying. As each great celestial tree falls, the Winter Queen's desperation grows. The Queen and her Court of Night need the Maw Walker's help to restore balance to the forest.\nVenthyr.\nThe road to redemption for Revendreth is a long one, and the Dark Prince of Sinfall is ready to walk it. He will need the Maw Walker's aid if he is to wrest control of Revendreth from the clutches of his Master and the loyalists.\nThe Maw and Torghast.\nAfter completing the first chapter of their chosen covenant's campaign, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; reaches out to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to return to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to enter &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; to start freeing &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong the way they will gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;, who can craft equipment.\nOnce started, the Torghast campaign will ask the Maw Walker to enter the Torghast wings several times. During the process, the Maw Walker will uncover clues of the captured leaders and rescue Baine, Jaina and Thrall. Eventually, they will be able to enter the twisting corridors and explore it in order to collect clues to find Anduin. During the process, they discovered Sylvanas and the Jailer's plans with Anduin. In the end, however, the Maw Walker can't find the exact location of Anduin, thus can't rescue him.\nAfter defeating &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; and discovering Sylvanas's and the Jailer's plans with Anduin in the Twisting Corridors, Bolvar starts a final quest chain where Anduin turns Sylvanas's demand back at her.\nThe Chains of Domination.\nBolvar reaches out to the Maw Walker, apprising them of the attack on &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia the Firstborne&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt; is on the move, and the covenants plan their counterattack. This campaign continues where the Covenant campaigns left off, and is gated behind &lt;a href=\"%3ARenown\"&gt;:Renown&lt;/a&gt; starting with chapter three: at levels 44, 47, 50, 52, 56, and 58.\nZereth Mortis.\nAfter the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and the ending of the Chains of Domination campaign, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; summons the Maw Walker to put in motion the plan to pursue the Jailer to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; and stop him before he uses the secrets in the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; to rewrite reality.\nEpilogue.\nAfter the main campaign, there are a few odds-and-ends side quests to wrap up some other stories."}

All of their arcana are different.\nWhile most warlocks specialize in conjuration and demonic pacts, some focus on other areas of the dark arts. Shadowmages eschew summoning in favor of the destructive power of raw entropy. Some say shadowmages developed the shadow bolt spell, and it encapsulates their magical style. As well as &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; evocations, shadowmages enjoy spells that weaken other's minds and bodies and those that create darkness. With their connection to shadow, &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s are shadow mages' preferred fel &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;s.

Its vile inhabitants, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s, have pledged their savage hearts and frenzied minds to the Blood God &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. They must destroy the last functioning &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; disc, a relic that lies at the very heart of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, to free their master from eons of confinement within the titan facility of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOnce the shining heart of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; civilization, Nazmir is now a bleak swamp riddled with ruined reminders of its former greatness. The first king, &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, led the trolls out of the muck and mire, fleeing south because of the Old God &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, where they built &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenturies ago, Nazmir used to be a place of worship for the loa of death &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; which had several temples, at the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Terrace of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. Many Zandalari trolls used to be there, until &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20a%20Heretical%20Nazmani\"&gt;heretics&lt;/a&gt; started to appear among them, corrupting, killing or defiling the old worshippers of the loa, later joining &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt; society.\nIn the current troll capital of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, stories are passed down from generation to generation cautioning children to behave, lest these twisted practitioners of &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; come to snatch them from their beds. And those who dare brave the swamp have a terrible habit of disappearing, never to return. The blood trolls of Nazmir are the monsters that haunt every Zandalari child's nightmares \u2014 and for good reason, as they are dedicated to the worship of the Blood God G'huun and to a single-minded purpose: the destruction of the last functioning titan disc within the city of Zuldazar. Should the trolls shatter this seal, G'huun will be freed from its eons-long confinement to rule the world. Upon arriving in Nazmir, you will meet Princess Talanji, who will ask you to escort her as you look for signs of blood troll activity in the area.\nIt harbors ancient &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; secrets in a &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;top security facility&lt;/a&gt; to study the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a tool to destroy all life on the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; covered Nazmir in a thick fog using the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt; in order to create a diversion for their army.\nAfter Bwonsamdi brought the defeated &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; to the Necropolis, &lt;a href=\"Zel%27han%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Zel'han the Summoner&lt;/a&gt;, servant of the defeated loa, was drawing the undead of Nazmir to the Necropolis.\nGeography.\nNazmir is a primordial swampland, replete with a diverse ecology of insects and dangerous beasts. Many of the once grand temples and buildings now lay in ruins, scattered throughout the region like broken teeth. Vegetation has encroached upon the stone walls and buildings, reclaiming the land piece by piece. Sodden marshes and tributaries mark the landscape of Nazmir, fed by the grand waterfalls spilling from the cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; high above. The &lt;a href=\"Razorjaw%20River\"&gt;Razorjaw River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20River\"&gt;Shattered River&lt;/a&gt; both wind through Nazmir as well, contributing to the marshes and wetlands that dominate the region. A vast coastline surrounds Nazmir to the north and east, with the Shattered River demarking the southern border along Zuldazar. To the west you'll find the bubbling &lt;a href=\"Shoaljai%20Tar%20Pits\"&gt;Shoaljai Tar Pits&lt;/a&gt;, where the cloying scent of smoke drifts up from vents within the earth, choking the air with a haze of ash and dust. Just west of the tar pits on the westernmost border, the pathway into the arid desert of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; awaits.\nPortal.\n &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; (activated with &lt;a href=\"Something%20Extra%20for%20the%20Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Something Extra for the Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;)\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

As such, the existence of a near-human race on Draenor was required in order to keep Garona's background coherent.\nThe final, canon story is that before Garona's heritage as a &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt; was revealed, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; deceived her into believing that she was &lt;a href=\"half-human\"&gt;half-human&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", Garona makes various statements that there was a different group of humans living on Draenor than those the orcs later discovered on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, who were possibly rendered extinct some time before. When first explaining this to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh surmised that her homeland had \"humans, or near-humans, or at least had them within living memory.\" Later on, Khadgar saw a vision of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s quarters on Draenor, in which he kept \"preserved things, some of which might have once belonged to human or humanish creatures\" inside one of the cabinets along his walls. They were similar enough physically, mentally, and culturally for them to give Garona insight on humans of Azeroth, discovered through the newly opened Dark Portal.\nGarona believed that she was half-orc and had half-human heritage from these Draenor-born humans. According to her, it was Medivh who \"made [her] feel human. And [she hadn't] felt human in a long, long time.\" She specifically stated that she was \"of both Orc and Human lineage\" and \"neither.\" Orcs only \"[saw] the parts of [her] that [were] human;\" they said her \"human hand\" was \"too slender to be really useful, [did] not [have] enough muscle to hold an ax or bash a skull in properly\u2014too pale, too weak, and too ugly.\""}

Each bids on newly-arrived souls, filling their personal guard with capable soldiers and building armies larger than any yet known.\"\n\"When they march, will it be towards one another\u2026 or the realms they swore to defend?\"\n\"Among the necrolords, strength is rewarded and weakness cast aside. The souls of the ambitious and contentious are forged into an immortal army charged with the defense of the Shadowlands\".\nAs the forces of Maldraxxus are the defenders of the Shadowlands, they are often brought into conflict with external entities such as &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s.

As such, they sometimes overlap with &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s in their depiction.\nOrigins.\nThe first necrolyte to walk the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt;, was given the scythe known as &lt;a href=\"%3AUlthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;:Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself. Sataiel is also sometimes just described as the first necrolyte in other sources.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s help, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; has formed a group of orcs called necrolytes. They dedicated themselves to learning the dark arts of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Through it, they would be able to spread plagues to the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and raised the dead to fight at the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde's&lt;/a&gt; side.\nFirst War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the main purpose of the necrolytes was to bolster the orcish forces with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; troops, similar to the necromancers of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; decades later. While necrolytes did possess other magical abilities, they were quite paltry when compared to those of the other orcish &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt;. Their spells included &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte%20%28Warcraft%20I%29%23Spells\"&gt;Shadow Spear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Dead\"&gt;Raise Dead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte%20%28Warcraft%20I%29%23Spells\"&gt;Dark Vision&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Armor\"&gt;Unholy Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nUnfortunately for the necrolytes, the rise of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; was a precursor to their downfall. Doomhammer slaughtered the majority of the necrolytes while Gul'dan was in a psychic coma. Once Gul'dan awoke, he begged Doomhammer to spare his life, promising him to create a host of spellcasting undead riders capable of combating the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. The remaining necrolytes, led by &lt;a href=\"Rakmar%20Sharpfang\"&gt;Rakmar Sharpfang&lt;/a&gt;, proved themselves incapable of imbuing corpses with consciousness, which frustrated Gul'dan. He did nevertheless see potential in them, but not while they were among the living. Gul'dan and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; ritually sacrificed almost all of them.\nGul'dan and Cho'gall went on to create the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;. Each newly-risen death knight was given a jeweled truncheon through which it could better focus its powers. Into these jewels were infused the raw, necromantic powers of the freshly slain necrolytes.\nThird War.\nOrcish necrolytes were not gone for good, as some remained within the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;, surviving their ordeals on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. An unknown warlock coven in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20Necrolyte\"&gt;Stormreaver necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s were a part of, stole an ancient artifact from &lt;a href=\"Morg%20Wolfsong\"&gt;Morg Wolfsong&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s but was eventually destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; employ many necrolytes but also &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;necrolords&lt;/a&gt;, who could be advanced forms of necrolytes. In the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; the is also depicted as having several masters of the necromantic arts, including necrolytes, a reference to their original description as \"practitioners of the Orcish religions\".\n&lt;a href=\"Warlock%23Affliction\"&gt;Affliction&lt;/a&gt; warlocks are also shown as having abilities like &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20the%20Necrolyte\"&gt;Secrets of the Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt; while also being able to use &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft I.\nNecrolytes first appeared as a unit of the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s in \"\".

Linked into the dominions of the lower plains, Necrolytes have power over all things dark and evil, including the raising of fallen warriors to create armies of the undead.

Through ceremonies performed at their &lt;a href=\"Temple%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;Temples&lt;/a&gt;, they learn to warp the essence of shadow to use for their advantage.\nInformation.\nThe basic spell casters of an army, Necrolytes are quite weak and vulnerable, so they must be protected. Their spell Dark Vision can make up for a scout by removing the fog of war from previously undiscovered areas, mainly to find a new gold mine. Their spell Raise Dead is quite useful, as &lt;a href=\"The%20Dead\"&gt;The Dead&lt;/a&gt; can prove to be a good distraction of enemy units, but should only be used if there is enough mana to be spared. The Necrolyte's most powerful spell is Unholy Armor as it renders a unit immortal for an allotted time; it is most useful on a &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;.\nNecrolytes use mana to cast spells. Mana will slowly regenerate over time, up to a maximum of 255.\nSpells.\nBy commanding the powers of darkness and death, tendrils of blackness stretch across the land to envelop the unwary and careless. It is upon these fools that the Necrolytes prey, filling their temples with fresh sacrifices and our armies with undead warriors.\nThis is a spear of energy culled from the evils of the Orcish clans. When an Orc dies, his soul descends into Hades for judgment, and his essence is divided into good and evil. The Orcish Necrolytes have learned to siphon the black energies from this plane and use it for their own purposes. This weapon of darkness is the manifestation of those black souls, and causes excruciating pain to those it strikes. \nThe Necrolytes have close ties to the dark forces of Hell, and in consequence study the forbidden arts of the dead. They have gained the ability to bind the bodies of the dead to this domain, creating armies of soulless creatures. With no minds to speak of, they will disdain the use of weapons, seeking to rend the flesh of those they are directed to attack with their bare boned hands.\nWherever there is light, there is shadow, and it is this shadow that the Orc Necrolyte uses to see into places he cannot travel. Wherever the slightest shadow is cast, the sight of the Necrolyte can enter and view. The effects of this spell are limited in size, for too much knowldege of the confines of shadow has been known to forever trap the caster within the realm of darkness.\nThis ritual invokes the recipient with a mystic armor of invulnerability. Weapons will have their effects dissipated when striking the wearer. This armor is constructed from the souls of the damned, and they absorb the pain that any blows would normally inflict upon the wearer. The price that is exacted from those who are bestowed with this invulnerability is a high one, however, for they must sacrifice a portion of their soul to act as a magnet to bind these lost souls to themselves. After some time, this binding will weaken, and those who make up the armor will be released back into their eternal torment."}

As the masters of this tainted field of magic, they can conjure festering diseases, harness the shadows into &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;bolts of incendiary energy&lt;/a&gt;, and chill the living with &lt;a href=\"Death%20Coil\"&gt;the power of death&lt;/a&gt;. Necromancers are the enemies of life itself, and all hands are raised against them. Some of the worst evils in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history have been perpetrated by necromancers, and they deserve their malevolent reputation. Few things are as abhorrent and horrifying as necromancy.\nBackground.\nShadowlands.\nUnder the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, creator of the arts of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; is home to the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi%20necromancer\"&gt;Maldraxxi necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, who are in charge of creating the bodies and preparing the souls of the undead that will defend the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; from external forces and wage war on the enemies of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;. Among the five houses that rule Maldraxxus, the purpose of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; is the creation of necrotic constructs to populate Maldraxxus's armies. Among their ranks, the house employs many Maldraxxi necromancers to insert Maldraxxian souls in the bodies they created, or alternatively, to separate body and soul from already existing constructions.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; army employed &lt;a href=\"Maw%20necromancer\"&gt;Maw necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, as &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; knew that there is great power in the dark art of necromancy.\nAzeroth.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Magocracy of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, any practitioner of necromancy is the enemy of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. For the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, necromantic magic is highly illegal, should be avoided at all costs, and they only discussed to have a basic understanding of its use. Researching into banned fields of magic such as necromancy is expressly forbidden by laws almost as old as the Kirin Tor itself, and those who persist are censored, stripped of their power and influence, and banned from the kingdom. As necromantic magic is considered to be a dark and corruptive energy, its use was made illegal in the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the original &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s created by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; were not battle-hardened warriors; unlike modern death knights of the Scourge, they were insidious necromancers who possessed a superior intellect and tremendous magical power. Further empowered with magical energies culled from the slain &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, the death knights wielded an arsenal of necromantic and elemental spells that mete out all but certain death to the enemies of the Horde.\nAmong the necromancers of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the former archmage &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; is the most notable example of a modern necromancer, who greatly contributed to the initial spread of the Scourge and the fall of Lordaeron. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; granted these malevolent sorcerers true power over the dead in exchange for their loyalty and obedience. The &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; of living beings who served the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and was formed years before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. These necromancers and &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s aspire to become &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and remain alive because undeath is considered an honor one must earn, and because living beings are useful for their ability to spy, and recruit powerful individuals from among the living. Many modern necromancers were trained by Kel'Thuzad and his agents in the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;. An elite branch of necromancers, under the command of the dark master &lt;a href=\"Maleki%20the%20Pallid\"&gt;Maleki the Pallid&lt;/a&gt;, refer to themselves as the &lt;a href=\"Thuzadin\"&gt;Thuzadin&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of their lord and first of their kind, Kel'Thuzad.\nDraenor.\nDuring his pursuit of furthering the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;'s magical resources, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; opened a new school of magical discipline that became known as necromancy. The Shadow Council began training young &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s in the arcane mysteries of life and death. Again, with tutelage from the demon &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, these necromancers, named &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, delved into the dark arts and eventually gaining power enough to animate and control the bodies of the newly dead.\nPowers and effects.\nWhile necromantic magic is mainly used to perform &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, necromancers can also bestow a number of dark enchantments upon their fellow undead warriors, and greatly accelerate an undead's movement and attack rates, however, those under the influence of this spell find themselves moving so quickly that their bodies begin to burn and ache, slowly dying from the effects of their unholy frenzy. They can cause their enemies' muscles to suddenly spasm and quake, leaving them immobile and effectively helpless.\nThose who practice death magic gradually become undead, and thus don't need to be killed and brought back from the dead. Necromancers end up losing their soul, if they haven't already sold it, and their bodies bear the marks of decay. In the Scourge, they receive a &lt;a href=\"Scourgestone\"&gt;Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt; upon their \"birth\", like all the other undead who are \"created\".\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, it is believed that if necromancers are not perfectly precise in their magical workings, or if they are killed, then they are subject to begin to rot immediately. A rumor that was confirmed after &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, as the necromancer's body decomposition, which should have taken days, occurred in just a few seconds.\nIn the RPG.\nNecromancers are spellcasters whose magics manipulate the power of death. In calling upon this power, necromancers risk being consumed by it \u2014 until eventually they join the ranks of the undead. Necromancers twist arcane magic to manipulate the power of death. Commanding the undead, generally in the service of the Scourge, they gradually take on the characteristics of the dead \u2014 hollow eyes, shambling gaits, pallid and sunken skin, foul odors, and so forth. A few necromancers are &lt;a href=\"Uncorrupted%20necromancer\"&gt;uncorrupted&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dark Lady, , realized how valuable necromancy was to their cause. Though &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; heal naturally, many go to the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; for \"repairs\". Necromancers can also free enslaved, mindless undead and research powerful spells that might one day return the Forsaken to life. Sylvanas knew she needed necromancers to heal, strengthen and replace her people, and she set about wooing necromancers away from the Scourge, mainly by force.\nThe necromancer was a &lt;a href=\"prestige%20class\"&gt;prestige class&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\" and an early part of the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;World of Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\", but was changed to a &lt;a href=\"core%20class\"&gt;core class&lt;/a&gt; in the later part of the \"World of Warcraft RPG\".\nEpic necromancer.\nThe epic necromancer is a dark champion of the dead and vile bane of the living. Their undead creations terrorize the land while they ravage their opposition with twisted magic. The living fear their name and the dead flock to it. The epic necromancer lives and dies by their spellcasting powers and their ability to command, create, summon and control &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. They improve these abilities even further, making sure their minions can defend them. They use most of their ability increases on their primary spellcasting ability \u2014 intelligence or charisma. Dexterity and constitution are their second choices.\nUncorrupted necromancer.\nThe Uncorrupted necromancers are rare necromancers who do not suffer from arcane corruption: their alignments remain inviolate, unless they cast evil spells, and do evil deeds. Most young necromancers claim they know what they're getting into. They know about the seductive whisper of power and the strength of the Nether. They know of the crushing will of the demon lords and, most of all they know of the corruptive influence of necromantic magic. They say it will not happen to them; they will not fall to evil, as have so many before them. Most of them are wrong. Most of them join the dark ranks of the creature with which they traffic. Some few, though, are right. Some are strong enough to resist the will of the dark powers they wield; they, in turn, bend their wills to mastering necromantic secrets while remaining immune to their taint. These are the uncorrupted necromancers, and they spread both distrust and hope wherever they go. Some few even announce themselves openly in the cities of the Horde or, rarer, the Alliance, and make their unique talents available to their affiliation."}

She was described by &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; as a human or former human dressed in a hooded gray robe with tangled black hair. Her eyes glowed green and her face was sunken and discolored as if she were dead, but Flynn somehow didn't think she was. Her voice was hollow and wherever she tread, the grass rotted under her feet.\nAfter the necromancer stole the Torch of Holy Flame from &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Rowe\"&gt;Forlorn Rowe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Sarah Ladimore&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;\u2014tried to search for the missing artifact but was struck with a rotting disease. Upon arriving in Duskwood and learning of the threat posed by the undead, Flynn Fairwind and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; pursued the necromancer into the deepest level of the &lt;a href=\"Dawning%20Wood%20Catacombs\"&gt;Dawning Wood Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, where they found her attempting to corrupt the torch with dark magic. She noticed the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s' presence, prompting Shaw to reveal himself and ask about her purpose while Flynn remained hidden and used his rum to wash away the bone powder making up her ritual circle. The necromancer claimed that she had no interest in &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt;, the area's former resident, and that her vision was much grander than his: she had seen visions of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;upcoming attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and intended to prepare for &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival. She referred to Duskwood as one of her \"old haunts\" and claimed that her goal was to eventually move on to attacking &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself. After Flynn finished destroying the circle, Mathias attacked the necromancer and managed to wound her throat while Flynn grabbed the torch. The necromancer cursed Mathias with the same disease she had inflicted on Ladimore, but the two rogues managed to escape the catacomb and headed for the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;back in order to remove the torch's corruption by bathing it in a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;. The necromancer pursued them on her mount\u2014a grotesque, winged undead &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and blasted them off their gryphon as it came down to land in the grove.\nWhile Flynn took the torch to the moonwell, the necromancer began fighting Shaw. She demoralized her foe by revealing that &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;dark wings&lt;/a&gt; would come to &lt;a href=\"Cause%20for%20Distraction\"&gt;take away&lt;/a&gt; what the spymaster held most dear. Moments later, however, Flynn plunged the torch into the moonwell, reigniting it and allowing him to set the necromancer's cloak aflame. As the fire consumed her flesh, Shaw plunged his daggers into her throat, killing her.\nWith her death, the unnatural illness afflicting Shaw and Ladimore vanished, and the Night Watch subsequently recovered the Torch of Holy Flame to once again keep Duskwood's undead at bay.\nSpeculation.\nTheories as to her identity include:\nIn both cases, the character would've had sufficient knowledge of the region to know where the Torch would have been, as well as general geography and where to go."}
{"id": "232663", "revid": "1487011", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=232663", "title": "Necromancer (Warcraft III)", "text": "Though they retained their &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;ity after making a pact with death, Necromancers became the most terrifying agents of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. These dark, insidious men were once thought to be aspiring geniuses by the Magocracy of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. However, their insatiable lust to delve into the secrets of the dark arts drove them to forsake their very souls. &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, granted these malevolent &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s true power over the dead in exchange for their loyalty and obedience. The shadowy Necromancers have the power to command various types of &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; and even spread the foul &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;undead plague&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nInformation.\nNecromancers are very popular among experienced undead players as they can raise lots of Skeletons to support your existing troops. If the enemy doesn't have &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Destroyers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Dragon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Faerie Dragons&lt;/a&gt; (the latter of which can be fatal to Necromancers) then the sheer amount of skeletons can overwhelm enemies, though it is also important to take note of the massive collision as a result.\nNecromancers work well with 3-4 &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Wagon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Meat Wagons&lt;/a&gt; and 2 &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Statue%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Obsidian Statues&lt;/a&gt;. The Meat Wagons provide fresh corpses for the Necromancers to use, while the Obsidian Statues allow them to contribute to the battle for as long as possible. You may want to add more or less Meat Wagons depending on the amount of Necromancers you use, however. \nKeep Necromancers in the back and well protected. Good microing skills can allow Necromancers to survive, especially if they get targeted by heavy air or artillery units, who can easily kill them. Skilled players should instead use Necromancers for the purposes of Unholy Frenzy and Cripple, as these are very powerful when used correctly (and also gives more versatility in the player's army), even moreso with an Orc ally using &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shamans&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells and abilities.\naise Dead (Autocast).\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"%23Upgrades\"&gt;Skeletal Mastery&lt;/a&gt; upgrade is researched, Raise Dead will raise 1 Skeleton Warrior and 1 Skeletal Mage per corpse. There's a cap to the amount of skeletons that can be summoned, and excess skeletons will automatically die if it goes over this amount, with the oldest ones taking priority.\nThis spell is not on by default. This is to prevent the Necromancer from raising Skeletons from the Graveyard after he is created wasting his mana if you happen to build your Graveyard next to the Temple of the Damned. It's recommended to keep the spell set off so he can reserve mana for his more powerful spells.\nSkeletons initially last 45 seconds. Research Skeletal Mastery to increase their duration by 20 seconds for a total of 65 seconds.\nTip: Raise Dead yields the same result regardless of what type of corpse it is cast on. If you have a Death Knight on your team, save powerful corpses for Animate Dead. You can kill a critter and get the same result from Raise Dead on its corpse as you would on, say, a Tauren, or an Abomination. Raise Dead prioritizes lower-ranked corpses first; for example, a critter corpse will take priority over a Ghoul's.\nUse Dispel. If not available, target the Necromancers if they can't be reached, or use AoE abilities and skills to clear the skeletons.\nnholy Frenzy.\nUnholy Frenzy is very helpful on Heroes (whose health regeneration can make up for the loss of hit points), Abominations, Frost Wyrms, Tauren, Knights, and Bears. For some units, such as low hit point units, it is not a good idea to cast Unholy Frenzy on them because it will make them so weak they will be easily killed. If an ally has brought shamans into the fray, try to stack Unholy Frenzy on bloodlusted units. This makes them attack slightly over twice as fast, and is particularly vital for the slower but more damaging units.\nUnholy Frenzy works very well in combination with the Dread Lord's Vampiric Aura on Abominations and other advanced melee units and on melee heroes such as the Dread Lord. The Vampiric Aura will help heal the damage of the Unholy Frenzy.\nCast Unholy Frenzy on retreating enemy Heroes, or even units that are about to die. It may kill them off.\nUse Dispel.\nripple.\nCripple is the uber slow spell with a significant damage reduction added on top of it. It also requires a lot of mana. You should pick your targets carefully when casting Cripple. Cast it on powerful normal units such as Knights, Tauren, Abominations, Frost Wyrms, or Druids of the Claw. Use it on enemy heroes to prevent them from fleeing or to reduce their damage output.\nUse Dispel."}

In the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, necromantic magic (or necrotic and death magic) is the manifestation of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;, and the main source of magic used to practice necromancy. This art of \"animating unliving flesh\" may also be empowered by the magic of any &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;cosmic forces&lt;/a&gt;, and can be used to reconstruct the flesh and bones of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures, allowing them to function again even after the foul monsters have been destroyed. The most common practitioners of necromancy are known as &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and others include &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necrolord%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins and characteristics.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; is the birthplace of necromantic magic, where necromancy was developed by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. He is responsible for the creation of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rune%20magic\"&gt;rune magic&lt;/a&gt;, who devised this unique language of intricate symbols, each individually representing a specific word tied to the very foundations of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and the might of the five houses, from simple commands, to necromantic energy manipulation. In order to imprison his brother, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, the Primus invented an even more potent death runic language: &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;. Its sole purpose was to be the utter suppression of another.\nIn the Shadowlands, &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; is the source that is drawn upon when using death magic, and is comparable to the &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; used in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Primus established the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es to constantly innovate and advance the art of necromancy with new incantations and formulae.\nNecromantic magic is considered to be a dark, corruptive energy and its use was made illegal in the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Magocracy of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, researching into banned fields of magic such as necromancy is expressly forbidden by laws almost as old as the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; itself. For the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, necromantic magic is highly illegal, should be avoided at all costs, and they only discussed to have a basic understanding of its use, as any practitioner of necromancy is the enemy of the Kirin Tor. Those who persist are censored, stripped of their power and influence, and banned from the kingdom.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;, necromancy is just the art of animating unliving flesh, which is mainly performed through the magic of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be empowered by the magic of any &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;cosmic forces&lt;/a&gt;. Raised by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; is an example of someone brought back to undeath through the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; used magic to temporarily resurrect a dead &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;, citing himself as a servant of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; raised himself as an undead through &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragons &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; were raised through &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magic by &lt;a href=\"cultist\"&gt;cultist&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, raised the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;annihilan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;Fel&lt;/a&gt; magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;Blood magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voodoo\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to perform necromantic rituals, notably to enslave &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; and raise the dead.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the first known examples of necromancy were the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;, undead &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s raised by &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; through unknown means after having &lt;a href=\"Cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalized&lt;/a&gt; them. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the studies of necromancy took an important role and were used heavily by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, which spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, resurrecting its denizens under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nUses.\nWhile necromantic magic is mainly used to perform necromancy, in order to raise and control the dead, &lt;a href=\"necromancers\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; can also bestow a number of dark enchantments upon their fellow undead warriors, and greatly accelerate an undead's movement and attack rates, however, those under the influence of this spell find themselves moving so quickly that their bodies begin to burn and ache, slowly dying from the effects of their unholy frenzy. They can cause their enemies' muscles to suddenly spasm and quake, leaving them immobile and effectively helpless.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20organizations%23Of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; were able to channel their necromantic powers to create a field of dark energy that drains the life-force from any who come in contact with it, replenishing their strength with the life force consumed. By enveloping their truncheons with their dark essence, they depleted vital energies from those they lash out against. They were also able to transform a portion of a being's life force into an unearthly, phantasmal suit of armor that would absorb the damage from any attack for a limited amount of time.\nThrough their necromantic powers, modern &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s can call upon the forces of darkness at will, causing bolts of death to issue from their hands. They can absorb the unholy energies of their minions to heal themselves, and also exude a dark and raging battle aura, which causes the near undead to move and regenerate faster. They can spread infection, channel runic power and corrupt life energy to sustain themself, but also &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay%20%28death%20knight%20ability%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;draw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strangulate\"&gt;strangulate&lt;/a&gt; their target, fire &lt;a href=\"Death%20Coil\"&gt;blast of unholy energy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Freeze\"&gt;attack the mind&lt;/a&gt;. To gain the advantage in battle, they can &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Advance%20%28death%20knight%20ability%29\"&gt;increase their speed&lt;/a&gt;, use an aura that &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Frost\"&gt;create ice beneath their feet&lt;/a&gt;, protect themselves with an &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;anti-magic shell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Control%20Undead\"&gt;dominate an undead&lt;/a&gt;, controlling it for a period of time.\nThe swirling negative energies known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay\"&gt;Death and Decay&lt;/a&gt;\" spell are favored by the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es for their power to decompose, rot and destroy everything. They can also destroy their minions, in order to absorb their energies to replenish their dark magical powers. By melding the powers of necromancy and the warped music of their screams, &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s can form protective shells around any creatures, which makes them impervious to all magics for a short period of time. They can also channel the powers of their unholy screams, which cause their enemies to temporarily lose their honed combat skills.\nThe necromantic &lt;a href=\"Rune%20magic\"&gt;runic language&lt;/a&gt;, which serves to manipulate necromantic energy, is notably used through the runes found on the &lt;a href=\"runeforge\"&gt;runeforged&lt;/a&gt; weaponry of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Their runeblades are emblazoned with words of power set in runes, each with translations such as \"Razorice\" and \"Fallen Crusader\". The rune \"Taam\", known as \"the mark of the Lich\", is used in various death magic rituals, such as the creation of &lt;a href=\"aberration\"&gt;aberration&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bone%20golem\"&gt;bone golem&lt;/a&gt;s, but can be employed in many rituals requiring powerful death magics. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Depths%20Necrolyte\"&gt;necrolytes&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Neltharion\"&gt;Maw of Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; also used &lt;a href=\"Necromantic%20Rune\"&gt;necromantic rune&lt;/a&gt;s to deposit the power they've drained from dead dragons.\nNecrotic magic can also be used to bind and restrain individuals. While it can hold &lt;a href=\"lightspawn\"&gt;lightspawn&lt;/a&gt; captured, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; can dispel the binding necrotic energies. It can also be used to summon magical shields and portals.\nEffects on beings.\nThose who practice death magic gradually become undead, and thus don't need to be killed and brought back from the dead. They end up losing their soul, if they haven't already sold it, and their bodies bear the marks of decay. In the Scourge, they receive a &lt;a href=\"Scourgestone\"&gt;Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt; upon their \"birth\", like all the other undead who are \"created\". Without being killed, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; ends up becoming an undead after he took &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and became a death knight in the service of the Lich King.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, it is believed that if &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s are not perfectly precise in their magical workings, or if they are killed, then they are subject to begin to rot immediately. A rumor that was confirmed after Arthas killed &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, as the necromancer's body decomposition, which should have taken days, occurred in just a few seconds.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; was created by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, in order for those who die from it to be only lying \"dormant\" in their graves, awaiting one skillful in necromancy to awaken them. According to &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, the long-term affliction of the plague causes a certain reanimation of activity in the dead, as if the corpse is waiting for further commands.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the undead are imperfectly attached to their bodies; the necromantic magic that sustains them is a buffer that prevents their souls from properly joining with their bodies. This is why undead feel only faint sensations of pain or discomfort from most physical stimuli, and why the Light is so painful to their existence.\nAt some point in the ancient past, the &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; infused the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;titan world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; with death magic, turning him into a resurrection engine that would allow the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s armies to resurrect instantaneously. In truth, they transformed him into a weapon able to neutralize the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, the being responsible for judging mortal souls in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; was tainted by Arthas' ritual to resurrect Kel'Thuzad, corrupting it with necromantic energies. Afterward, the corrupted powers of the well permeated not only the elves, but all that they had built. Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; soon learned this and surmised that the energies would kill the elves and cause a catastrophe. Kael'thas painfully concluded that the Sunwell had to be destroyed.\nPractitioners.\nNecromancers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s are the most known practitioners of necromancy. As the masters of this tainted field of magic, they can conjure festering diseases, harness the shadows into &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;bolts of incendiary energy&lt;/a&gt;, and chill the living with &lt;a href=\"Death%20Coil\"&gt;the power of death&lt;/a&gt;. Necromancers are the enemies of life itself, and all hands are raised against them. Some of the worst evils in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history have been perpetrated by necromancers, and they deserve their malevolent reputation. Few things are as abhorrent and horrifying as necromancy.\nDeath knights.\nThe original &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s were created for &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as powerful soldiers of the Horde. These death knights were created by placing the souls of the slain &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; into the corpses of fallen &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike modern death knights of the Scourge, these ghoulish fiends were not battle-hardened warriors; they were insidious necromancers who possessed a superior intellect and tremendous magical power. Further empowered with magical energies culled from the slain &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, the death knights wielded an arsenal of necromantic and elemental spells that mete out all but certain death to the enemies of the Horde.\nThe modern death knights were the former champions of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. While they managed to free themselves from the Lich King\u2019s grasp, some death knights still embody the ever-corrupting nature of the Scourge plague that once threatened to consume Azeroth. They fortify their bodies and drain life energy itself with the power of blood, sharpen their blades and strike powerfully with the power of frost, and raise the dead while striking with the unholy fervor granted by undeath. No matter their allegiance or cause, they remain defilers of life; and nowhere is their callousness more on display than when threatened. Inflictors of the most aggressive of diseases\u2014and masters of raising unhallowed minions from the ground\u2014these unholy death knights are vicious melee combatants, capable of striking with the force of an undead legion and unleashing pestilence that would bring their foes to ruin. Under the Lich King, the death knight Arthas wielded necromantic magic and used it to raise &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;.\nNecrolytes.\nIn pursuit of furthering the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;'s magical resources, Gul'dan opened a new school of magical discipline that became known as necromancy. The Shadow Council began training young warlocks in the arcane mysteries of life and death. Again, with tutelage from the demon &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, these &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s delved into the dark arts, eventually gaining power enough to animate and control the bodies of the newly dead.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; would still have necromancers among their ranks.\nOn the , the warlocks of the were desecrating the dead in the &lt;a href=\"Icescar%20Boneyard\"&gt;Icescar Boneyard&lt;/a&gt;, summoning demons to inhabit the bones of the dead. After sacrificed the heart and soul of his tribe in an attempt to join the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the formed &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s who employed necromancy by using the power of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nScourge.\nAmong the necromancers of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the former archmage &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; is the most notable example of a modern necromancer. He greatly contributed to the initial spread of the Scourge and the fall of Lordaeron. Many modern necromancers were trained by Kel'Thuzad and his agents in the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as the School of Necromancy. The school contains notable figures such as the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the headmaster of the facility, &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; granted these malevolent sorcerers true power over the dead in exchange for their loyalty and obedience.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; of living beings who served the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and was formed years before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. They aspire to become &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and remain alive because undeath is considered an honor one must earn, and because living beings are useful for their ability to spy, and recruit powerful individuals from among the living. An elite branch of necromancers, under the command of the dark master &lt;a href=\"Maleki%20the%20Pallid\"&gt;Maleki the Pallid&lt;/a&gt;, refer to themselves as the &lt;a href=\"Thuzadin\"&gt;Thuzadin&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of their lord and first of their kind, Kel'Thuzad.\nMaldraxxi.\nThe Maldraxxi are the undead that inhabit the eponymous realm of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and make up the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Undying%20Army\"&gt;Undying Army&lt;/a&gt;. They are an immortal army charged with the defense of the Shadowlands, with masters of the powers of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; turning legions of ambitious souls into relentless immortal armies, and necrotic soldiers being forged by an eternity of war or are made from the bodies taken as spoils of war. All &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;necrolords&lt;/a&gt; receive a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;' power in order to carry out their duty of defending the Shadowlands from external forces.\nDemons.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; started to experiment with creating an army of unliving, but &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was probably not the only place that they've been attempting this. When &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; found out that the &lt;a href=\"eredar%20warlock\"&gt;eredar warlock&lt;/a&gt;s could raise the dead, he admired the audacity of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. During the raid on the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;annihilan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brutallus\"&gt;Brutallus&lt;/a&gt; raised the skeletal remains of blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Madrigosa\"&gt;Madrigosa&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Felmyst\"&gt;Felmyst&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"fel%20dragon\"&gt;fel dragon&lt;/a&gt;. The demons &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Guardians\"&gt;guarding&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; also knew necromancy and raised many orcs into undeath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; used his necromantic power to raise the humans of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; as vile undead slaves known as the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;.\nMogu.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; found necromancy. Powerful mogu &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;necro-lords&lt;/a&gt; ruled their &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s from crypts dug deep beneath the surface.\nThe mogu appear to have abandoned the practice of necromancy at some point before the reign of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;, but have resumed it in recent times. Among them, the magically gifted mogu race practice \"spirit-capture magic\", allowing them to capture and bind willing or unwilling spirits in &lt;a href=\"Terracotta%20warrior\"&gt;constructs&lt;/a&gt;, bend them to their will, and even summon spirits from beyond the grave. While the schools of magic practiced by the mogu do not fall within the ordinary &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; categories, the &lt;a href=\"Shan%27ze%20Deathspeaker\"&gt;deathspeakers&lt;/a&gt; and possibly the &lt;a href=\"Shan%27ze%20Spiritbinder\"&gt;spiritbinders&lt;/a&gt; can be referred to as necromancers. The &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt; openly call this magic necromancy, which they call forbidden and disgraceful arts.\nOgres.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt; were originally a small band of extremely loyal &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; enforcers, transformed by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; into scheming and malicious &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s. By warping and twisting the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;-magiks of the &lt;a href=\"Runestone\"&gt;Runestone&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan was able to infuse the magical abilities of long dead &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s into the bodies of these unsuspecting hosts. Once hulking simpletons, the transformed ogre-magi can direct their death magiks as easily as their lesser cousins would deliver a crushing blow to any foolish enough to stand in their path.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gor%27vosh%20clan\"&gt;Gor'vosh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s found on practiced necromancy as well, where they raised the dead in the &lt;a href=\"Ashmaul%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Ashmaul Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Their connection to the and the is unknown, so it is not known if they were influenced by either group or if these ogres discovered necromancy on their own.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkmaul\"&gt;Darkmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres spread necrotic energies on &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt; and created a massive undead army. Their end goal was to sacrifice enough souls to raise the dragon &lt;a href=\"Ravnyr\"&gt;Ravnyr&lt;/a&gt; into undeath.\nTrolls.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; taught the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s necromancy for their unwavering loyalty. Centuries later, the troll &lt;a href=\"Zanzil\"&gt;Zanzil&lt;/a&gt; was exiled from the &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter tribe&lt;/a&gt; for using his necromantic poisons on several of his unsuspecting fellow trolls, but his exile has not been the punishment that his kindred had hoped. Indeed, since that time, several witch doctors have joined Zanzil. With their assistance, he has built up an undead army that is loyal to him alone. It is well-known that his toxic elixirs can even rouse the dead from their graves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s practice necromancy with &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shadowpine%20tribe\"&gt;Shadowpine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s tried to bolster their numbers through necromantic means, as they were raising &lt;a href=\"mummy\"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Maltendis\"&gt;Deathstalker Maltendis&lt;/a&gt; believed that Shadowpine troll priests used the &lt;a href=\"Juju\"&gt;unknown power&lt;/a&gt; unknown power source within &lt;a href=\"%3ATroll%20Juju\"&gt;:Troll Juju&lt;/a&gt; to animate the dead.\nIn the aftermath of the Lich King's defeat, the &lt;a href=\"Icetusk%20tribe\"&gt;Icetusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s was formed by &lt;a href=\"Drakani%20Death-Defiler\"&gt;Drakani Death-Defiler&lt;/a&gt;s. The group settled upon a chain of islands known as the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Chain\"&gt;Dread Chain&lt;/a&gt;. In order to survive, the Icetusk turned to necromancy, with many of their dead having been risen as servants. They mined &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; along the isles, and came into conflict with adventurers looking to do the same.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20troll\"&gt;Blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s fuel their voodoo with profane &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood rituals&lt;/a&gt;, harnessing undead monstrosities to do their bidding. They have necromancer in their ranks such as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfire%20Necromancer\"&gt;Bloodfire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazmani%20Necromancer\"&gt;Nazmani Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVrykul.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; naturally know little magic, some have been trained in necromancy by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the vrykul in his service, the Lich King learned of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; and their ability to corral spirits and even delve into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of the death, and managed to create some at his service. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; Val'kyr are sisters who chose to continue their service in death, and were created from the female vrykul of &lt;a href=\"Valkyrion\"&gt;Valkyrion&lt;/a&gt;, who fought and trained to receive the Lich King's unusual gift. During competitions for the chance to become powerful undead servants of the Lich King, these winged spirits with vast necromantic powers were charged with raising the elite vrykul warriors into powerful undead known as the &lt;a href=\"Ymirjar\"&gt;Ymirjar&lt;/a&gt;; while those who were not successful were turned into &lt;a href=\"vargul\"&gt;vargul&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nOthers.\nAs they are the servants of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has some knowledge of necromancy as well. They are able to raise the dead as animated corpses for a short amount of time, though they take no joy in it.

Operating a Maldraxxi necropolis requires a well-coordinated crew, including a helmsman who must pilot the structure using a particular kind of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a mechanic to repair it and keep it airborne.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; was personally involved in the design of at least one necropolis, the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;, which he shaped with his bare hands. Prior to his disappearance, he maintained a network of portals that linked the necropoli of Maldraxxus directly to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought and the recent destruction of many of the necropoli have rendered those connections inactive, however.\nScourge.\nOriginally an ancient &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; ziggurat, the necropolis &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; was conquered by Scourge forces years ago, and was subsequently transformed into a potent war machine. The Scourge architect &lt;a href=\"Obrahiim%2C%20the%20Traveler\"&gt;Obrahiim, the Traveler&lt;/a&gt; was pivotal in Naxxramas' conception. He also created , taking inspiration from nerubian architecture and warlock magic. Necropolises can be summoned by &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s and serve as the central command structures of the Scourge army. Even when unattended, the vengeful spirits of the dead protect the necropolis from enemy attackers. As the presence of the undead in the living world grows stronger, necropolises can be further modified into &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;halls of the dead&lt;/a&gt; and finally into &lt;a href=\"Black%20Citadel%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;black citadels&lt;/a&gt;, giving the Scourge the power to raise more ancient structures and operate more efficiently.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", generic types could be seen during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, and the mighty Naxxramas could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, multiple necropolises appeared in the skies of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, transmitting communications and other assistance to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s ground forces. While the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; dealt with curing the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; pledged itself to destroy the necropolises. Using the concentration of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; energy from the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and the shared benedictions from its faithful, the Church created holy artifacts able to strike down the flying structures.\nThe Comic.\nDuring the second &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; theorized that the crystals attached under certain necropolis served as an amplifier for the Scourge spellcasting. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s in their &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt;s as reinforcements, and who theorized that they were stabilizers during their flight. In both cases, destroying the chains that held the crystals to the flying structure caused them to explode and crash into the ocean.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe necropolis of was used to train new &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s and lead the assault against the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. It was stated to be even more powerful than Naxxramas. However, Acherus was taken from the Lich King by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; moved to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where many other necropoli can be found, notably in the Borean Tundra and Zul'Drak. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; had also begun construction of in Icecrown, as a replacement to Acherus. Being made entirely of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;, it would have been even more difficult to destroy, but its construction was interrupted before completion."}
