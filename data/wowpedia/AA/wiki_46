He can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmbreaker%27s%20Rookery\"&gt;Wyrmbreaker's Rookery&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking a lava pit and facing his guardian, the &lt;a href=\"Proto-Behemoth\"&gt;Proto-Behemoth&lt;/a&gt;. He is considered a fairly easy fight.\nHalfus was beaten along with the other bosses in the first week of 's release, but the &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt;s proved more difficult. The world first kills came on Wednesday, 15 December 2010.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Imbued with unnatural power and stamina by Cho'gall, the ettin Halfus Wyrmbreaker captures &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s for use as fodder in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;'s rituals. To this end, he has enslaved a behemoth &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in hunting down his winged prey.\"\nAbilities.\nHalfus Wyrmbreaker.\nEach week a random three of Halfus's five captured &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; awaken. Each awakened dragonkin empowers Halfus and his enslaved Proto-Behemoth with an ability. On &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, all five dragonkin awaken and empower Halfus and his enslaved Proto-Behemoth with all possible abilities.\nImprisoned Dragonkin.\nHalfus has imprisoned a Slate Dragon, a Nether Scion, a Storm Rider, a Time Warden, and a pack of Orphaned Emerald Whelps. They surround him on his platform, wearing bonds of servitude. If freed they will each turn on their master and weaken him, but Halfus then dominates the dragonkin and forces them to fight against the players. In Normal Difficulty three random dragonkin awaken each week, while the other two slumber. Only the awakened dragonkin may be freed.\nOverview.\nHalfus Wyrmbreaker is a tank and spank fight with some interesting &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; mechanics added in. He has one add, the &lt;a href=\"Proto-Behemoth\"&gt;Proto-Behemoth&lt;/a&gt;, that will spit fireballs at raid members and do an &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; flame breath. It is best to ignore this drake and concentrate on killing Halfus, as it has a large health pool and its damage can be either dodged or healed through.\nFour friendly &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s and a pack of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; are imprisoned in the area where Wyrmbreaker is engaged, but in normal mode 2 are unavailable each week. When freed, each drake or whelp pack will put a debuff on Halfus or his Proto-Behemoth pet. It will initially attack Halfus and give him its debuff, but after a couple seconds, the boss emotes, \"Halfus Wyrmbreaker binds the &lt;drake type&gt; to his will!\" The drake or pack then becomes mind controlled and must be tanked (and possibly killed depending on your tactic for the week).\nBelow 50% he periodically casts an unavoidable AoE ability called Furious Roar which is a raid wide aoe and stun which hits for around 10,000 three times.\nDrakes.\nThe drake composition of the fight is selected per week and, like classic &lt;a href=\"Nefarian%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, getting a difficult combination of adds might mean you have to wait until next week.\nA drake being active means that Halfus has a buff that that drake can counter to some degree when it is released. A drake being unavailable (which only happens in Normal mode) means Halfus simply does not have that ability needing to be countered for the week. In heroic mode, Halfus has all abilities active, and you need to choose which abilities you want to counter (which drakes to release, and in which order).\nStrategy.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s are recommended for Halfus Wyrmbreaker, as additional drakes have to be tanked and, if the Slate Dragon is active, his hits apply a debuff that reduces healing received by 4% to a max of 15 (90% of healing negated) and stacks up rather quickly. Halfus Wyrmbreaker is tauntable until his enrage.\nHalfus Wyrmbreaker has a 6-minute(?) hard enrage timer.\nStrategy will depend on the drake combination of the fight. Usually two drakes will be awaken at the same time and then taken down consecutively. Once they are dead, DPS will switch to the boss. Sometimes, the raid will have to deal with two mechanics:\n- If the Slate Dragon is active, the boss will get Malevolent Strikes, a Mortal Strike-like ability. Tanks must switch Halfus every N stacks (usually about 10) of Malevolent Strikes: otherwise, the tank will become unhealable. If the off-tank is busy tanking the drakes, it is handy to use a bubble or Hand of Protection on the main tank on the first 15 stacks; then the tank will retaunt Halfus.\n- If the Storm Rider is active, Halfus will cast a Shadow Nova that *must* be interrupted (very hard unless the Storm Rider is released, see below). If it is not interrupted, the raid will take about 30k damage per member and suffer a knockback, making the encounter unhealable. Halfus will almost always Cast shadow nova During the 3rd stun tick of Furious Roar, while it is possible for the raid to eat this nova without too much concern if healers are keeping up it will make your healer more comfortable to interrupt and the best way to do that is to either have a mage blink the last stun and counter spell or it is possible for any other interrupt to be used at the last bit of the cast but is a little more risky.\nChoosing which drakes to release can be tricky. The raid should take several considerations into account:\nSolo strategy.\nIn ten-player mode, it's generally not worth it to deal with the mechanics of the encounter. Just blow Halfus up.\nNotes.\nWorld first \"heroic\" kill on 25-man achieved 15.12.2010 by .\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Her sisters considered her very pretty, with her coral-like scales and hair the deep green color of kelp or algae, but also rather flighty and stupid. Her main sin was that she loved watching &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; ships go by, having done so ever since &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; was first built, and she was saddened by the sailors' hatred of mermaids. Her sisters called her a fool for playing in the wakes of the ships, but she insisted that she had to watch over the humans to see if she could get an opportunity to help them.\nHalia's favorite ship was the \"&lt;a href=\"Windward\"&gt;Windward&lt;/a&gt;\". She fell in love with the ship's &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ery\"&gt;Ery&lt;/a&gt;, and began swimming near the \"Windward\" when it was in port so she could admire the sea priest. The crew of the \"Windward\" begged the captain to let them scare off or kill the mermaid, but Ery forbade them and instead made Halia a mascot of sorts: she never failed to give the mermaid a salute when the \"Windward\" arrived to Boralus or bid her goodbye when the ship left. When the ship was anchored in Boralus and Ery went swimming in &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;the harbor&lt;/a&gt;, Halia left gifts for her in the form of half-dead fish or (when the fishing was poor) pearls. Because Ery was as sensible as she was serious, she dumped the pearls back into the water weeds, and Halia grew to assume that humans considered pearls as worthless as mermaids did. According to the tale, this is why Boralus Harbor has so much bubble seaweed: it is all of Halia's discarded pearls.\nHalia was too shy to address the human woman, but by observing her she unknowingly grew more familiar with Ery than anyone else. Ery, in turn, was touched and amused by the mermaid's gifts and grew attracted to Halia's beauty. Upon returning to the harbor after a voyage, she called for Halia in the harbor and gifted her with a knife. The shy mermaid and the grave tidesage kissed and confirmed their feelings for each other. Halia then asked Ery to come live with her underwater, explaining that if she slit her feet and walked into the harbor, the &lt;a href=\"Mother%20%28mermaids%29\"&gt;Mother&lt;/a&gt; would take pity on her and turn her into a mermaid. Ery refused, citing her duties as a tidesage. In response, Halia instead begged Ery to make a house by the shore and let her swim alongside her ship on voyages, but the tidesage replied that they had to keep their relationship secret or else her crew would reject her, which would be the death of them. Halia wept at this but agreed out of her love for Boralus and the \"Windward\". From that day onward, mermaid and sea priest met in secret coves and waterways, growing more dear to each other in the process.\nOne day, when the \"Windward\" was in dock, a great storm came to Boralus and threatened to destroy the town. Ery and a handful of other tidesages gathered in tiny boats at the river's mouth to divert the water. Meanwhile, Halia tried to help men and women who fell in. She wanted to use her magic to shore up the town's crumbling edges but was afraid of getting spotted and blamed for the storm, and of straying too far from Ery. On the fifth day, when Ery was the only tidesage left who had not faltered from exhaustion, Halia begged her to slit her feet and save herself. Ery replied that there was still a chance if she could hold back a large waving coming toward them. Halia decided to help her, and while the priest parted the waters with one blow, the mermaid held the water back from the other side so that they together ripped the seas in twain. Ery stated that their work was not yet done, and Halia declared that she would build a wall while her beloved held the water.\nThe mermaid began churning up mud and stone from the seabed, a task she poured more and more of herself into even though the water kept breaking apart her work and the effort threatened to kill her. This brave intention caused a crest of the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt;'s magic to sweep through the harbor and jolt all of her sisters awake. Halia only paused to check on Ery every so often, but the tidesage always said that the work was not yet done. Halia's sisters shouted at her to stop, but when they could not convince her, they threw themselves into her labor and were soon joined by other mermaids who did the same. Together they built the wall higher and higher with rocks, mud, ship debris, and sailors' bones until it broke the surface and continued to rise under Ery's feet. Some of the older mermaids died from exhaustion, and the rest only stopped once the seawall towered over the harbor. Halia returned over and over to ask Ery if the work was done, but when the tidesage finally turned around to answer, she collapsed from exhaustion and fell into the water. Halia immediately dived after Ery and pulled her to the surface, but the priest was neither breathing nor moving. The crew of the \"Windward\"\u2014who had watched the events unfold\u2014hauled the two onto their deck and tried to revive Ery without any luck. Eventually, Halia drew a knife, slit open her lover's feet, and cried for the sailors to push the two of them over the railing and into the harbor. The crew did so, and after a long wait, Ery broke the surface, alive and transformed into a mermaid. Halia held her arms around her beloved's neck, alternately weeping and laughing with joy.\nAll of Kul Tiras now knows Ery's story, and as long as Boralus' seawall has stood, its people now swear on mermaids as symbols of honor and good luck. On certain calm sunsets when the red is deeply reflected on the surface of Boralus Harbor, old sailors call it \"Ery's blood\", which presages good weather, in remembrance of the dutiful tidesage and the mermaid who loved her so faithfully."}

It is advantageous to have a balanced mix of ranged and melee DPS.\nIt takes place in two places, the physical and the twilight realm. During Phase 1 everyone is in the physical realm. At 75%, Halion shifts to the twilight realm and opens a permanent portal so the raid can follow for Phase 2. At 50%, the Dragon is present in both realms at the same time. During Phase 3, the raid must split and maintain balanced DPS in both realms.\nLike many dragons, Halion has a frontal cone breath attack, a tail swipe and a cleave. The tail swipe stuns. He retains these abilities over all three phases. Unlike many dragons, he does not use fear and can be taunted.\nHeroism/Bloodlust.\nWith only one shaman in the raid, this buff should be used in Phase 2. Otherwise, when using it in Phase 3, it's highly probable that the realm where Bloodlust was used deals a lot more damage than the other, forcing that realm to stop DPS until the other catches up, basically wasting the buff.\nIf two shamans are present it's possible to use the buff in Phase 3. The shamans must go to different realms and coordinate so they both use it at the same time.\nPhase 1: Physical realm.\nA few seconds after the pull, a circle of flames appears around the boss, closing off any players not in the stage. In the physical realms, two special effects must be taken care of.\nMark of Combustion is a debuff which is put on a random player. It gains one stack every few seconds and expires after 10 (?) stacks. When it expires or is dispelled, it places a circular AoE centered on the player the diameter of which depends on the number of stacks (more stacks = larger). This AoE deals damage to players in it, and also knocks away players inside when it forms.\nIn order to deal with Mark of Combustion, affected players must run towards the outer edge of the battle area and be dispelled there quickly. Failing to react fast means a larger or badly positoined AoE, which usually hampers melee DPS.\nThe second effect in the physical realm are random fireballs, which fall from the sky and hit for AoE fire damage, leaving a patch of flame where it hit, plus four flames going in different directions. The location where the fireball hits is indicated by a hellfire graphic. Players must move away from the point of impact and the residual flames.\nPhase 2: Twilight realm.\nAfter the dragon has vanished to the twilight realm, it's important that a tank enters the portal first, other classes die too fast when alone. The rest of the raid should follow quickly, the tank should pull the dragon away from the entrance point, else the raid may die from breath. It is usually a good idea to leave a healer and a tank in the physical realm in preparation of phase 3. These two just wait out phase 2.\nIn the twilight realm, Mark of Combustion is replaced by Mark of Consumption, which behaves quite similar, but pulls players into its AoE instead of knocking them away.\nThe fireballs are replaced by Shadow Cutter. Two shadow orbs circle clockwise around the outer edge of the area opposite to each other. Every 20 seconds, a beam connects the orbs for 10 seconds. This beam (= Shadow Cutter) deals very high damage to everybody who touches it. All players (including the tank) must move on a circular path to avoid this beam.\nShadow Cutter Positioning.\nOne possible positioning is to tank the boss in the center of the area. The tank waits until an orb is near his right side, and then strafes to the left, so that the orb stays right of the tank at all times. If the beam appears, it should be in the area right of the tank, but pretty close to him (so that the beam runs nearly lengthwise through the dragon). This allows players to stand on both sides of Halion, although the dragon's left side (right of the tank) is a little safer. On that side, the only danger is a tail swipe, while on the other side (right of the dragon, left of the tank) people may get hit by breath or cleave, which is more dangerous. It's still advantageous to stand on both sides to minimize confusion from Mark of Consumption.\nWhen learning the encounter (or with small groups) it may be helpful to instruct everyone to stand on the dragon's left side, and to move to avoid the tail. While explaining the encounter this situation can be simulated with a mounted raid member posing as the dragon.\nPlayer Deaths in the Shadow Realm.\nDead characters appear in the physical realm, so it's rather difficult to battle rez them. If all characters die in the twilight realm, characters still alive in the normal realm are still in combat, but can not be attacked by Halion. To end the encounter, they either must enter the twilight realm and die, or get out of combat using some ability (like &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Intervention\"&gt;Divine Intervention&lt;/a&gt;).\nPhase 3: Both realms.\nAt the start of Phase 3, two portals appear in the twilight realm which lead back to the physical realm. If no tank was left behind, the tank must use that portal first.\nUntil the end of combat, Halion exists in both realms, and the raid must split in two. The encounter mechanics in both realms remain the same, that is Shadow Cutter in the twilight and Fireballs in the physical. When a Fireball spawns on the melee group it may force them to move out of melee range, while the constant movement required by Shadow Cutter hampers ranged DPS more than melee. For this reason melee prefer the shadow realm, while ranged do better in the physical.\nThe new element in Phase 3 is that Halion receives a buff called Corporeality. It starts at 50%, and it's advantageous to keep it close to 50%. It changes when Halion takes more damage in one realm than in the other. 100% corporality means that Halion is present only in the realm player is in, 0% means he's only in the other realm. When he takes more damage in one realm, he moves towards the realm where he takes less. Depending on the value of Corporality, Halion also deals and takes more damage in one realm than the other. Changes to corporeality are signified by the warning: \"Your (or your companion's) efforts have forced Halion further &lt;into/out of&gt; the &lt;Twilight/Physical&gt; realm!\" If no damage is dealt in one realm, Halion rapidly regenerates health.\nThe following table summarizes the stat differences depending on corporeality:\nAs an example, if Halion had way too much DPS on him in the Physical realm, his corporeality might be down to 20% in that realm. This means Halion takes 50% less damage and deals 30% less damage in the Physical realm. However in the Twilight realm, Halion's corporeality is 80% and he takes double damage and deals 60% more damage. The problem is the increase of damage dealt by Halion, tanks die too quickly if Corporality is too far from 50%.\nIf DPS in both realms is fairly balanced, the corporeality buff does the fine-tuning by itself, since in the realm where less damage is dealt, the damage taken is increased. Stopping DPS in either realm should not normally be necessary.\nDPS numbers of individual players should be used when determining who goes where, rather than splitting the DPS 50/50 between both realms.\nHeroic Mode Changes.\nIn phase 1, Fireballs cause a blast wave upon landing.\nFireballs also spawns a Living Inferno and some Living Embers on 25-man.\nThe zones that appear after a Combustion put a dot on anyone inside them that does increasing damage per stack rather than flat damage.\nIn phase 2, four shadow orbs circle the stage instead of two, so that players can be caught behind or in front of Halion during a Death Beam, and therefore get hit by a tail swipe, cleave, or dark breath.\nThe zones that appear after a Consumption put a slow on anyone stood in them - the slow lasts for 2 seconds and is applied every 1 second, so it can't easily be removed except by Hand of Freedom - this will cause difficulties running from the cutter unless the zones are placed very carefully.\nIn all phases, the void zones from combustion/consumption appear and affect both the Twilight and Physical realms, not just one. This gives the raid less space in both realms to move around, and is mostly an issue in Phase 3. A single misplaced zone in phase 3 can very easily cause a wipe.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nTrivia.\nHalion is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Mercer\"&gt;Matthew Mercer&lt;/a&gt;."}

There were several smaller festivals leading up to Hallow's End. One was somber, one was celebratory, and this one was a bit of both. It was believed to be a time when the barrier between the living and the dead was thin, and those who had passed on could be sensed by those still alive. Tradition had it that at the end of the harvest season, before the winds of winter began to blow, that a straw effigy would be erected right outside the palace. At sunset on the night of the ceremony, it would\nbe lit on fire. It was an awesome sight\u2014a giant flaming wicker man, burning bright against the encroaching night. Anyone who wished could approach the fiery effigy, toss a branch into the cracking flames, and in so doing metaphorically \u201cburn away\u201d anything he did not wish to carry into the quiet, deep reflection time provided by winter's enforced inactivity, such as emotions (fears, sorrows, old loves, new hates). It was a &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt; ritual, sprung up from time immemorial. Once, the effigy was burned by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Hallow's End in Year 24, the &lt;a href=\"Headless%20Horseman\"&gt;Headless Horseman&lt;/a&gt; was created in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies over the dead body of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHallow's End marks the day the group of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, who would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, broke free of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s dominance and once again regained their free will. They celebrate this occasion by setting fire to a &lt;a href=\"wickerman\"&gt;wickerman&lt;/a&gt; after a short speech from &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; herself and smearing the ashes across their faces.\nCataclysm.\nThe humans of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; have continued their traditional Hallow's End celebrations, even though they didn't quite understand the reasons for doing so, in the hopes of a brighter future despite the losses of the three great wars against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Cataclysm, the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; have brought with them a deeper understanding of the origins of Hallow's End back to their old and new allies in the Alliance, and in particular, reintroduced the practice of burning a wickerman. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; was invited to speak for the length of Hallow's End to celebrants just outside Stormwind's city gates, just as Sylvanas now does near the inner entrance to the Undercity.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nCoincidentally, at this same time of year on there is a strange surge of spiritual energy. Beckoned by this phenomenon, a ghastly fleet of undead &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; pirates called the &lt;a href=\"Bonefleet\"&gt;Bonefleet&lt;/a&gt; emerges from the mist. The Bonefleet is led by a savage pirate known as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Bonerender\"&gt;Captain Bonerender&lt;/a&gt;. He seeks nothing more than the complete destruction of all of the living of Draenor.\nLegion.\nAn adventurer by the name of &lt;a href=\"Duroc%20Ironjaw\"&gt;Duroc Ironjaw&lt;/a&gt; travelled through &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; and came across the Crooked Tree of &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Bradensbrook&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing that it was of evil nature, he warned people not to approach it.\nThe story behind the tree is linked to four sisters who had been accused of many crimes. As punishment, they were sentenced to death by hanging at the Crooked Tree. The &lt;a href=\"Hag%20of%20the%20Crooked%20Tree\"&gt;youngest&lt;/a&gt; managed to escape when the noose around her neck loosened. She returned many years later, to put her sisters' souls at peace.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nA strange occurrence is happening in Dalaran. The adventurer sends his troops to see what can be done. The soldiers encounter a &lt;a href=\"crone\"&gt;crone&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Crone%27s%20Broom\"&gt;broom&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoliday boss: Headless Horseman.\nAvailable in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; like other holiday bosses, the &lt;a href=\"Headless%20Horseman\"&gt;Headless Horseman&lt;/a&gt; can be queued for players from levels 10-.\nOnce per day, he drops the &lt;a href=\"Loot-Filled%20Pumpkin\"&gt;Loot-Filled Pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; for levels 50 and above, which can contain:\nHe always directly drops a piece or two of loot, which scales the ilvl appropriate for the player's level when it dropped:\nFor levels 49 and below, he drops the &lt;a href=\"Loot-Stuffed%20Pumpkin\"&gt;Loot-Stuffed Pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollectables.\nHallow's End offers a decent amount of &lt;a href=\"toy\"&gt;toy&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;s, and other holiday-themed consumables.\nToys.\nToys are available for purchase with &lt;a href=\"Tricky%20Treat\"&gt;Tricky Treat&lt;/a&gt;s for each:\nOne toy is a drop from holiday-themed mobs on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Isle of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; on Draenor's :\nOne toy is a drop from a mob spawned in the player's level 3 mine in their garrison after purchasing and using &lt;a href=\"Creepy%20Crawlers\"&gt;Creepy Crawlers&lt;/a&gt;:\nCompanion pets.\nMost pets are available for purchase with &lt;a href=\"Tricky%20Treat\"&gt;Tricky Treat&lt;/a&gt;s for each:\nOne pet is a quest reward from an eight-step quest chain:\nOther pets can be captured in the player's &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; after purchasing and using &lt;a href=\"Creepy%20Crawlers\"&gt;Creepy Crawlers&lt;/a&gt;:\nMounts.\nOne permanent mount rarely is found inside the &lt;a href=\"Loot-Filled%20Pumpkin\"&gt;Loot-Filled Pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;:\nA holiday-limited mount is available for purchase for :\nCosmetic armor, costume sets, and pet disguises.\nOne cosmetic helm costs :\nFour cosmetic helms can be found inside the &lt;a href=\"Hag%27s%20Belongings\"&gt;Hag's Belongings&lt;/a&gt; from the daily quest &lt;a href=\"Under%20the%20Crooked%20Tree\"&gt;Under the Crooked Tree&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;:\nCostume sets cost each:\nPet disguises cost each except for the Yipp-Saron costume, which requires :\nGarrison decorations.\nSpecial vendors in &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; sell various garrison decorations for each:\nQuests.\nIntro and emotes.\nThis one-time quest awards and involves emoting to innkeepers in various capital cities.

They were once a pinnacle of redemption for the most prideful of souls. However, due to recent events they've fallen into darkness and succumbed to forbidden magics.\nThe members of the Halls of Atonement perform rituals of inquisition, of absolution, and of Judgment. The Ritual of Absolution, also called the ritual of extraction, requires a venthyr robe, dagger, and tome, and is usually be performed at a reliquary where four &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s may be absolved at a time. The Ritual of Judgment requires four venthyr to pass judgment upon a soul, either recognizing its redemption, upon which the soul would either choose to become a venthyr or to be re-judged by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, or the venthyr may condemn it to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. For a soul to become a venthyr, another venthyr must choose to sire them, which can present a weakness for the sire in question. &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20%28occupation%29%23Venthyr\"&gt;Inquisitors&lt;/a&gt; are seen to oversee the Rituals, serving under the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pride%20%28Revendreth%29\"&gt;Pride&lt;/a&gt;. The ritual of inquisition allows venthyr to see every sin by peering directly into a soul.\nAfter a Ritual of Absolution, souls are placed in Atonement Crypts where they are sealed away for an extended period of time to contemplate on their lives after being unburdened of their pride. &lt;a href=\"Cryptkeeper%20Kassir\"&gt;Cryptkeeper Kassir&lt;/a&gt; watches over the Atonement Crypts. The most stubborn souls are also forced to endure the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20of%20Rebuke\"&gt;Bell of Rebuke&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most punitive tools of the venthyr. When you ring the bell, you first rebuke yourself, but you also make yourself more vulnerable to rebuke from others. Each bell demands something from the soul who rings it.\nThe Halls of Atonement also contain the Sinstone Archive, the collection of every &lt;a href=\"sinstone\"&gt;sinstone&lt;/a&gt; of every formerly-mortal venthyr that passes through the Halls and the rituals, however, sinstones of powerful venthyr tend to go \"missing\" and their owners hide them. They are overseen by &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Fane\"&gt;Archivist Fane&lt;/a&gt;. This is important as sinstones contain a venthyr's true name as well as their sins, which gives you power over them. &lt;a href=\"Archivam\"&gt;Archivam&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20Ward\"&gt;Catacombs Ward&lt;/a&gt; to the north, where the Harvester of &lt;a href=\"Avarice%20%28Revendreth%29\"&gt;Avarice&lt;/a&gt; normally resides, also contains the Sinstone Archives. The Catacombs hold souls until they are less arrogant and they are sent to the Halls of Atonement. Likewise the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Ward\"&gt;Forest Ward&lt;/a&gt; puts their souls on the Penitent Hunt until they are defenseless toward the process.\nSince the dawn of Revendreth, the small &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Temel\"&gt;Temel&lt;/a&gt; has been charged with proclaiming the sins of souls for all to hear.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrives in Revendreth, &lt;a href=\"The%20Accuser\"&gt;The Accuser&lt;/a&gt; is the Harvester of Pride.\nThe northeastern elevator that connects to the &lt;a href=\"Trench%20of%20the%20Enders\"&gt;Trench of the Enders&lt;/a&gt; also contains a &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt; Transportation Network mirror. The southern elevator connects with the &lt;a href=\"Edge%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Edge of Sin&lt;/a&gt;."}

Completing the quest line simply involves one fight after another.\nRing of Blood.\nThe enterprising Gurgthock has turned an area of the ruins into a pit for some good old-fashioned deathmatches. The player starts off as an inexperienced newbie, and finds him or herself steadily pitted against more powerful foes as they win their matches. The fight only ends when one side is a red stain on the ground! Since the enemies encountered in the Ring of Blood are very powerful, this must be done in a group, preferably with a proper &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, and lots of dps.\nOnly one group can be doing a Ring of Blood fight at a time. After each fight everyone in your party must talk to the NPC to turn the quest in, and then one of you talks to the NPC to start the next fight. The NPC is not available during fights. The result can be frustrating if several groups are trying to do the Ring of Blood at the same time, as everyone is madly trying to talk to the NPC at the same time and start their next fight. (Note: As soon as you drop one of the opponents, another group can start their quest. This does not interfere with your progress. After the other group has finished off their mob, you can trigger your groups next encounter.) Your entire group MUST stay within the ring for the duration of the fight, although if you have any non-party members helping, they can stay on the sidelines (the quest cannot be raided, but other players can help out). If any party member dies within the ring, they should not release until they get quest credit for a kill."}

The entrance to the ring is closed, and High Justice Grimstone appears in the ring. This dark iron dwarf is flagged red, but cannot be attacked; his purpose is to explain what is about to happen.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"There is only one punishment for crimes committed against the Dark Iron dwarves: death. Ancient tradition calls for the guilty to pay the blood price in the Ring of the Law by battling savage creatures gathered from across Azeroth. To date, it is unknown if anyone has ever survived this brutal crucible.\"\nAlternate Ring of Law battle.\n\"NOTE: Only players who completed the requisite quest prior to its removal in &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and did not destroy their Banner of Provocation are still able to initiate this alternate encounter.\"\nThe alternate boss-fight was a quest in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon_Set_2\"&gt;Dungeon 2 set upgrade questline&lt;/a&gt; which asks the player to kill a dwarf named &lt;a href=\"Theldren\"&gt;Theldren&lt;/a&gt; and his gladiators in order to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Top%20Piece%20of%20Lord%20Valthalak%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Top Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, just go in the arena, use the &lt;a href=\"Banner%20of%20Provocation\"&gt;Banner of Provocation&lt;/a&gt; (must be placed near the center of the arena) while High Justice Grimstone is \"sentencing\" you, and destroy all the mobs that come out of the gates. On the second wave, where a boss should have arrived, Theldren and some random gladiators will appear instead. \nDo not forget to get the Top Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet from Theldren.\nThese mobs behave like a PvP group which may include mages, healers, a hunter with a pet, rogues, a dynamite tossing goblin and always Theldren himself, who is a warrior. For more information, see &lt;a href=\"Theldren\"&gt;Theldren&lt;/a&gt;'s page. They are immune to taunts, so they will likely go for any healers in the player's group. &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20control\"&gt;Crowd control&lt;/a&gt; is a must in order to win this battle unless the group have a high-level player to help them.\nThe completion of the event spawns a box of loot. In addition, you get to keep the banner in case you want to get the loot again in the future.\nLoot of note.\nIf Theldren is killed, an &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Spoils\"&gt;Arena Spoils&lt;/a&gt; chest appears. One of these items will be inside it:"}

It no longer serves as an arena.\nArena layout.\nThe arena is large and oval formed with players starting on each side. There are four roughly circular platforms at that rise and lower, two at a time throughout the match, obstructing movement and blocking line of sight when raised. Because they are essentially temporary pillars, they create an ever-changing dynamic of line-of-sight and kiting opportunities.\nPre-4.2.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2.0\"&gt;patch 4.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the staging areas were in the middle of the map and would slowly rise out of the ground until they emerged at ground level, mere yards apart. Players were hidden during the waiting period, but started 10 yards next to each other.\nThere were only two pillars, moving up and down like they do today. There were also two sets of spikes on triggers for when the pillars moved, which dealt damage and blocked line of sight. On either side of the staging platforms was an intermittent fire wall that blast from the ground. The two fire walls triggered at the same time and inflict damage equal to a percentage of total health per second to anyone passing through or standing within the flames. The walls did not otherwise break line of sight or inhibit player movement.\nOriginal.\nEarlier in the game, the arena was an in-game zone in Orgrimmar. It looked quite different and only the spectator area was accessible. It was going to be a &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; location that also had events, possibly similar to the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena&lt;/a&gt;, but this never happened. The only purpose the old Ring of Valor ever served was a duel between &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt; prior to \"\".\nLore.\nIt was also used to train some of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;s. Here, the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; was officially formed by &lt;a href=\"Battlemaster%20Br%C3%B6ng\"&gt;Battlemaster Br\u00f6ng&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; the arena took heavy damage and is currently being repaired. The interior has been closed off to the general public.\n&lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; and the pandaren adventurer fought here against captured beasts.\nThe inside of the ring was later refurbished as the &lt;a href=\"Brawl%27gar%20Arena\"&gt;Brawl'gar Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nHere warriors fight to honor the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, not for the amusement of bloodthirsty crowds. Young &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s practice here with blunted weapons, but occasionally fight to severe injury or death."}

{"id": "69541", "revid": "41339159", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69541", "title": "Potion doc", "text": "The potion doc takes brewing and &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; to a different level, operating in a different way than a basic alchemist or witch doctor. They combine science and magic in their unique art. They know how to overcome the restrictions inherit in potion-making, and can create potions - bubbling, unstable concoctions that fizzle and spit vapors - that contain powerful magic. Perhaps they are best known for brewing potion bombs - toss one of these beakers and watch the explosions. They can put together potions with little effort or cost on their own part, and can even do so on the fly, with just a few seconds of preparation.\nThe potion doc is a valuable member of any adventuring party, as she continues to develop her unusual magic potential, as she concentrates on her &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s. She cannot cast spells like she once could, as her focus is entirely on her creations, but her brews provide excellent support for her companions. Her strange skills - and the arsenal of concoctions at her disposal - help make up for the versatility she lacks in spellcasting. Hers is a strange world - a world of bubbling beakers, of colored liquids burbling with magic, of hissing tubes and lists of mixtures and combinations that are felt instinctively and subconsciously rather than memorized.\nThe potion docs place is behind the lines, casting spells, tossing potions, creating them with surpassing quickness, and taking pride when their allies down their drinks. One of the potion doc\u2019s more\u2026 obvious talents is the ability to create potion bombs. Whereas normal potions take effect when a character drinks them, a potion bomb takes effect when its container shatters. Whenever one of the potion doc\u2019s potions breaks open, the spell effect occurs at that location. Usually, the potion doc (or another character) throws such a potion. In melee combat, a character can simply splash an opponent with a potion or crush it against him.\nThe potion doc knows shortcuts to create potions with less strain on herself. She also knows of all sorts of strange, common (and not so common) ingredients for potions, and grabs these as she passes them in her adventures. Most potion docs have large satchels full of clinking vials, small pouches, and tiny boxes of esoteric items red dust, caterpillar legs, maybe a little brains from a defeated opponent. These ingredients help her offset the cost of her creations. The potion doc can whip up some brews with little effort at all. The potion doc carries all the tools she needs with her, or she can find them or can even use only her own hands to create potions and brews. She does not need a lab to create potions, nor does she need an alchemist\u2019s kit or alchemist\u2019s lab to create alchemical items. The potion doc can brew potions with surpassing speed. Grab a beaker already full of some blue liquid, toss in a handful of rummaged ingredients, mutter a spell\u2026 and suddenly it\u2019s a potion. The potion doc develops new techniques to create potions on the cheap, both in terms of money and effort. A Highly skilled potion doc\u2019s extensive study of magic and brewing allows her to create potions of many different kinds that she previously thought were impossible.\nThe potion doc knows how to brew a different kind of potion. This potion bubbles and fizzes, leaping as if to escape the container. The idea is for the potion doc (or another character) to remove the stopper, put her thumb over the opening, and shake vigorously. The potion hisses and turns pale and frothy, filling the container and rumbling against its confines. The character then aims the potion at her enemies, removes her thumb, and the potion sprays out in a 15-foot cone. All creatures in the cone are affected as though they had drunk the potion. Only potions that target a creature or creatures can become spray potions. A spray potion is like five potions in one. It uses a larger container than normal, and it requires five times as much effort to create. The potion doc can create spray potions that affect a larger area.\nA skilled potion doc can create potions and brews that incorporate a delay before they take effect. Two possible methods exist for these delays: time delays and command delays. A potion crafted with a time delay takes effect a certain amount of time after it is drunk (or thrown, or sprayed, or whatever). When she brews the potion, the potion doc decides how many rounds will pass before the potion takes effect. The delay can be any length of time up to ten minutes. Both magic potions and alchemical concoctions can be created with time delays. A potion with a command delay is inert in the drinker\u2019s system (or lying in a puddle on the floor, or splashed on an enemy\u2019s skin, or whatever) until the potion doc commands it to take effect. Doing so requires the potion doc to mutter some words and wave her hands around it is, in fact, like casting a spell. A potion with a command delay remains potent for an hour, if the potion doc does not command it to activate within that time frame, it becomes a nonmagic puddle of liquid (or part of the drinker\u2019s anatomy, or whatever).\nThe Highly skilled potion doc\u2019s extensive experimentation and experience with potions mean that she is a walking alchemy lab. Potions and brews course through her system, intermingling with her blood and other vital fluids. The potion doc knows this and further, she knows how to use it to her advantage, for she can create small, innocuous draughts that trigger the latent potions inside her. The potion doc chooses five spells and/or alchemical draughts or philters. These spells and brews are latent within her body. The potion doc has a number of small vials that she can drink (like drinking a potion) to activate her potion blood. Creating these vials takes no effort or time, the potion doc is assumed to always have some on hand if she has her equipment with her. Drinking a vial activates the spell or alchemical brew the potion doc chooses. Only one such latent potion or brew can be active at a time, and at least a minute must pass between their durations. When the potion doc chooses which five spells and/or brews exist in her system, she can choose the same spell or brew more than once in order to activate it more frequently.\nPotion docs in the world.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; have mystic and unfathomable connotations to most people, and the combination of these two disciplines in the potion doc is disconcerting. Her mind operates on a different level than others'. She walks along with her adventuring party muttering to herself (and seemingly unaware of it), absently snatching bits of leaves, dirt and squirming beetles from the environs and adding them to a vast stock of \"ingredients\" she keeps in innumerable pockets. She produces vials and beakers from clinking packs, tosses something in and squints as it changes color, then either nods in satisfaction or frowns and adds something else, or shakes it, or taps it with a knuckle. Sometimes she discards her creations, tossing them behind her with a crash-and-shatter - with a fiery bang! Of course, not all potion docs match this stereotype. Some are genial and pleasant and talk at length about their art. They keep disciplined and orderly labs. Whatever the case, though, potion docs are unnerving for they possess an odd combination of powers.\nPotion docs are uncommon. Few individuals possess both the magical and scientific acumen to take up the path, and most who wish to focus on potions become &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; and/or true alchemists. Some few among these go on to become potion docs. Their studies whet their appetites for more, as they see that they can push their potions to do more, to hold ever greater spells, to be capable of things besides just being gulped.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s - particularly &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s - are the most likely to become potion docs, as they have a strong witch doctor tradition. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; apothecaries, with their interest in dark alchemy, and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, with their scientific interests, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, some of Azeroth's premier alchemists, are also likely candidates. Potion docs among other races are rare."}

Collie\nAmid the rocks and rich soil of the crater floor can be found all manner of colorful crystals, each as fragile as glass. Held to a light, they seem to flicker and glow like flames... They seem to have no useful purpose, or so I believed at first, until I found the first Crystal Pylon. Located in the east, guarded by the pterrodax, this humming pillar holds the same sort of runes found on the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guardian\"&gt;Stone Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s as well as the hovering pylons that guard the entrance to the crater. All my attempts to decipher this ancient tongue have met with failure. And yet \u2014 the pictographs clearly show power crystals being used for something. A ritual, a spell, I do not yet know...\nAlthough the crystals come in all shapes and sizes, I have classified them in four main colors: red, blue, green and yellow. I've never found anything truly in between these shades, so there are no orange or brown ones, for example. Anyone who isn't color-blind can tell them apart by a glance. What's more, I\u2019m fairly certain the crystals can be employed by the Crystal Pylons. If I could figure out the right pattern \u2014 but how? How?\n\"Much later in the text.\"\nI've done it! I found one of the patterns! Or at least I\u2019m pretty sure I have. I need to make\nanother trip to the western Crystal Pylon to see. If this works, the crystals I've collected should coalesce into a single mega-crystal infused with the combined powers of all the shards! I can't wait to report on the results when I get back!\n\"The text ends.\"\nNorthrend.\nSholazar Basin.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, there are some strange devices on top of several pillars, on these pillars grow crystals which resemble the ones in the &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. Their purpose is yet unknown, but the power of the pillars is readily apparent.\nList of pillars:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; has been shown responsible for the destruction of the Lifeblood Pillar, and is also active on top of the Glimmering Pillar.\nConservatory of Life.\nThere are three pylons located at the &lt;a href=\"Conservatory%20of%20Life\"&gt;Conservatory of Life&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, their purpose is yet unknown. It should be noted that they are unlike the pylons in the &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; which all share the same coloured crystal.\nMastery of the Crystals.\nDuring the quest &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20of%20the%20Crystals\"&gt;Mastery of the Crystals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightningcaller%20Soo-met\"&gt;Lightningcaller Soo-met&lt;/a&gt; gets the player to use crystals to defend the &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt; faction, the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt;. They may be in connection with the Sholazar Basin power crystals. The crystals are gotten out of a &lt;a href=\"Sparktouched%20Crystal%20Defenses\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThe ones in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; are also called crystal pylons."}

Unfortunately, the best power sources are usually the oldest and the hardest to get. It's neat how fate likes to take a bite out of you sometimes, isn't it?\nSo you're going to need to go to &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sentinel\"&gt;obsidian sentinel&lt;/a&gt; there.

As a class quest, it may have been the designer's intention to teach mages some creative strategies.

{"id": "14819", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14819", "title": "Power leveling", "text": "Power leveling is the term used to describe the process of leveling a character as rapidly as possible with the least amount of play time. It can be used from any level up to the maximum level in the game which is currently 85. Contrary to what many believe, efficient power leveling does not require endless hours of grinding. The best methods of power leveling involve doing many &lt;a href=\"quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; in an orderly fashion. \nThe goal of these guides is to help you level a character, whether your first on the server or not, to the level of your choice as quickly and efficiently as possible. At the same the quests will be ordered in such fashion to ensure you gain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with each of the 3 major factions on either the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; side. \nCommon methods of power leveling include doing only those quests which are most efficient in terms of experience over time, and analyzing the quests in a given zone so as to do them in the most efficient order possible. Remember, the idea of power leveling is speed and efficiency--you may wish to obtain an addon that will show you how much experience per hour you are gaining to test your techniques. Additionally, ensure your character's talent build is crafted for maximum endurance. You want as little downtime (walking, drinking, eating, crafting, typing, etc.) as possible.\nWith regard to &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s, an example would be for a &lt;a href=\"tailoring\"&gt;tailor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; or purchase large quantities of &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt;, then identify and repeat the cheapest tailoring recipes so as to maximize skill point gain compared to cost.\n&lt;a href=\"Twink\"&gt;Twink&lt;/a&gt;ing is distinct from power leveling. A twink is usually intended to remain at its current level for an extended period of time, thus providing some justification for the large investment into its gear. A character being power leveled is often equipped with inexpensive gear, since the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; will be planning on outleveling it quickly.\nAlso note that power leveling is sometimes used to refer to paying someone else to level your character to 85 as fast as possible (i.e. they power level for you); a distinction used by Blizzard is to refer to the paid leveling as \"power leveling service.\" This behavior is against Blizzard's &lt;a href=\"Terms%20of%20Service\"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Power leveling yourself, which this article covers, is perfectly acceptable.\nTradeskills.\nWith the goal of obtaining levels as quickly as possible it is recommended that if you decide to pursue tradeskills you choose those which will support the process. \nGuides.\nThere are some guides available which you can buy. See a full list at &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20commercial%20WoW%20guides\"&gt;List of commercial WoW guides&lt;/a&gt;. Whether these guides are more useful than the content you can find here or elsewhere on the web for free is left up to you.\nRelated comments from Blizzard.\nSome power levelers have hoped for a day when you could use real money to buy individual items in-game, some times called \"micro-transactions.\" At a 2008, &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Pardo\"&gt;Rob Pardo&lt;/a&gt; gave a strong indication, &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard would not ever go this route with World of Warcraft."}

It is a great, white monolith that dominates the landscape, but instead of being jagged and irregular like other mountains, it is smooth and triangular - it is said to be the largest diamond in the known &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Gezhe\"&gt;Gezhe&lt;/a&gt;. It was being harvested by a faction of &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt;. Deep within the massive crystal dwells the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Orc%20Ancestor\"&gt;ancient orc ancestors&lt;/a&gt;, the spirits of orcs who have passed on.\nIn reality, however, Oshu'gun is a naaru &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional fortress&lt;/a&gt; known as the Genedar. The &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; fled their homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; in it before the ship crashed on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; millenia later.\nBackground.\nArrival.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; tried to flee &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; from their corrupted brethren, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt; came to the &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%27s%20End\"&gt;highest mountain&lt;/a&gt; of Argus to save them aboard the \"Genedar\". At some point after its departure, the ship split into two separate vessels, with the most elite of the draenei's warriors boarding the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" with the naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; and consequently forming the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the draenei visited dozens of worlds aboard the \"Genedar\", before crash-landing on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; approximately two centuries before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the \"Genedars crash, the naaru &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt; was injured, which caused it to enter the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; state of the naaru lifecycle. K'ara's final act was to convince the draenei to eject it from the vessel, but this was easier said than done. The Void energy instinctively caused K'ara to go to war against the other naaru aboard the vessel, &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; and K'ure. Their violent clash of Light and Void threatened to kill any draenei who interfered, yet Velen stepped forward nonetheless. He used the Light to shield the other naaru and cast K'ara out of the vessel. But the battle sapped his strength, physically and mentally, and his visions of the future became unreliable. K'ara was ejected from the \"Genedar\" in the chaos of the crash, and came to be known as the Dark Star to the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. D'ore was all but killed in the crash. His remains were laid to rest by Velen and the draenei in the first crypt of what would become &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;. In the intervening centuries, he had slowly been regenerating. As D'ore lay dormant, the pull of his void energy brought the spirits of the deceased to Auchindoun.\nThe same thing was then happening with K'ure at Oshu'gun. Unfortunately, the naaru had been weakened by the ship's crash and was left trapped there for centuries. As his &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; energies bled away over time, a &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; slowly grew in his place \u2014 devouring the souls of those nearby. K'ure watched helplessly as generations of orc spirits were attracted by this vortex. Due to K'ure's effect on their ancestors' souls, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s came to revere the \"Genedar\"'s wreckage, calling it Oshu'gun, \"Mountain of Spirits\". The enormous gem became a sacred place for them, and every year after the orcs would gather there to celebrate their &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; spring and autumn festival. The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; would commune with their honored ancestors who, unknown to the shaman, came to dwell within Oshu'gun because of K'ure.\nThe Kosh'harg festivals were held in a flat river valley at the foot of Oshu'gun. The ground of the valley itself was also considered sacred, a place so holy that any fights that broke out would be halted immediately, the combatants ordered to make peace or to depart. Shaman would enter Oshu'gun and add blessed water to a small pool within the crystal itself as a ritual to speak with their ancestors. Unknown to those shaman was the fact that the blessed water also helped to sustain K'ure by allowing him to heal himself enough to slow down his dying process. With the help of its energies, the ancient orc ancestors could communicate with living shaman via dreams and visions.\nRise of the Horde.\nDuring all this time, the draenei had recognized the orcish reverence for Oshu'gun and had retreated from the mountain despite also considering it holy. But after the start of the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, Velen tried to explain the true purpose of Oshu'gun to the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and his chief shaman, &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, grew angered by what they perceived as &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt;, as they considered it the home of their beloved dead and their spirits.\nAfter the start of the war, the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s fell silent and rejected the nascent &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; visited Oshu'gun to seek guidance from his own ancestral spirits, &lt;a href=\"Rulkan\"&gt;Rulkan&lt;/a&gt; appeared and revealed that she had been impersonated, and that he had been deceived and manipulated into rallying the orcs against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Ner'zhul realized with a heavy heart as she and the others turned her back to him, that there was nothing he could ever do to redeem himself in their eyes.\nThe Kosh'harg festival grounds were later used by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate the efficiency of his new &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. The spellcasters summoned &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and executed draenei prisoners on soil once considered sacred and peaceful by the orcs. Durotan grew disgusted that no one seemed to mind seeing the festival grounds violated in such a way.\nLater, in order to make sure there would be no coming back for the orcs, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; had a barrier put around the mountain which prevented the ancestral spirits and K'ure from making contact with the outside world. Orcs were also forbidden on &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s orders to ever return to the mountain, to make sure none could realize the deception. To make sure the order was properly enforced, Kil'jaeden even had &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s guarding Oshu'gun against would-be visitors.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Oshu'gun was populated by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Kil%27sorrow%20Fortress\"&gt;Kil'sorrow Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. These included &lt;a href=\"terrorfiend\"&gt;terrorfiend&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s torturing the spirits of orc ancestors, and a &lt;a href=\"shivarra\"&gt;shivarra&lt;/a&gt; along with her warlocks draining the naaru K'ure at the center.\nRecently, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; harnessed this vortex in order to draw countless &lt;a href=\"Voidspawn\"&gt;voidspawn&lt;/a&gt; to increase their own ranks, until they were stopped by an adventurer with the aid of &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Merchant\"&gt;traders&lt;/a&gt; and smugglers, were planning on harvesting Oshu'gun when word from their leader, &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt;, brought the operation to a halt. The nexus-prince mentioned \"political situations\" in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. It seems the Consortium did not wish to upset the naaru."}

On , it was notable for being one of the few empires on the world, but lost its former dominance after the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which forced to align himself with the orcs to ensure his empire's continued survival. He would have, however, turned himself against the orcs if the situation was favorable.\nThey are referred to as high ogres.\nHistory.\nFounding.\n&lt;a href=\"Gorgog%20the%20Gronnslayer\"&gt;Gorgog the Gronnslayer&lt;/a&gt; was the first Imperator of the Gorian Empire, which he founded after showing the ogres it was possible to kill the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, thus proving that they weren't gods. Gog - as he was known at the time - lived one thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yonzi\"&gt;Yonzi&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of a small group of remnants from the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; that had been destroyed two hundred years before, learned of a critical cache of Apexis artifacts buried beneath the ruins of an Apexis settlement on the northwest coast of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; now occupied by the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; slaves. Ogron were too violent to barter and bargain with, but the ogres were more intelligent than the ogron, and more importantly, angered by their enslavement.\nThe arakkoa approached the ogres in secret and began to teach them the ways of the arcane. Because the ogres were descendants of &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt; who was, in turn, a creation of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, they were naturally attuned to the arcane. The arakkoa had never seen new spellcasting techniques developed so effortlessly and were delighted. One of the first ogres to master the power was Gog, who the arakkoa believed to be the perfect leader to incite rebellion. Gog did rebel, but not against the ogron: he targeted the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, whom the ogron and ogres revered and feared as gods. Though stunned, the arakkoa could not argue with the results. Gog did not only kill one gronn with his magic but several. By his fifth, stories of his deeds were known to all captive ogres on Draenor, erasing their fear of both gronn and ogron. Under Gog, the ogres rose up against their ogron warlords and Gog was renamed Gorgog: \"King Gog\". The city became &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;, \"Throne of the King\".\nThe arakkoa quickly moved into Goria to search for &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s and artifacts in the ruins Goria was built on, but Gorgog quickly put an end to it. As a sorcerer himself, he had no interest in giving away any potential source of power. The arakkoa left, but not for long. Yonzi and his arakkoa were infuriated and they decided to take the land by force. They launched a surprise attack on Goria in the dead of night, but Gorgog and his apprentice arcanists, as well as the countless newly freed ogres, fought back. The arakkoa were defeated and Yonzi was captured. His death was slow and gruesome. Despite the promise of undiscovered Apexis crystals, further arakkoa incursions into Gorian lands were few and far between afterward. In the slowly expanding Gorian Empire Apexis crystals became highly prized and eagerly sought out by ogre sorcerers.\nDestruction of Goria.\nThe ogres ruled from Goria for six hundred years. This was until &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Molok\"&gt;Imperator Molok&lt;/a&gt; attempted to claim the Throne of the Elements, and the elements themselves, for the empire. His attempts to subjugate both resulted in the near destruction of the former, and the 'wounding' (in a sense) of the latter. This ignited a great war between the ogres and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, as the latter came to the defense of the spirits and eventually laid siege to Goria. Seeing no reason to waste countless lives in an attempt to break down the city's significant fortifications, the orcs were content to keep their distance on the surrounding hills and starve out their enemies. The Gorians believed they could outlast any siege thanks to their ocean port. Due to the tumultuous state of the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;, the orcish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; were not as effective in calling on their powers as they once had been.\nHowever, as the months passed, the ogres found themselves unable to maintain their empire. Trade via the ocean was not enough; the ogres needed access to their network of land-based trade routes, which the orcs had severed. Imperator Molok and his &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s revisited their &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; crystals, searching for a way to break the siege. In time, they discovered the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n legend about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt; and began experimenting with ways to create a similar affliction among the orcs. They succeeded, and soon the so-called &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; spread like wildfire through the orcs' encampments, culling vast amounts of the orcish combatants.\nThe orc &lt;a href=\"Nelgarm\"&gt;Nelgarm&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow shaman, realizing that the pox was an unseen attack from the ogres and that the siege was now doomed to fail, beseeched the elements to destroy Goria. The orcs and the elemental spirits both understood that Molok would resume meddling with the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; if the orcs failed, and so the elements agreed to unleash their fury upon Goria. The shaman gathered outside the ogre city's mighty walls and witnessed the fury of the spirits. What happened next would never be forgotten. A roaring storm churned above the city as the ground groaned and trembled. Over several hours, lightning, fire, and earthquakes ravaged the city, bringing down every wall and building, sealing off the escape routes and burning the ships in the harbor. When nothing but ash and rubble remained, the earth itself wrenched open like a giant maw to swallow Molok and the remains of his great city whole.\nUntold thousands of ogres died that day; none were left alive by the elementals. Only whispers of the event would reach the other Gorian cities and outposts, but those whispers would be enough to discourage any further tampering with the elements. The orcs were victorious, but they had suffered massive losses and witnessed a destructive power they never wanted to see again. Nelgarm and the other shaman were particularly frightened by the elementals' wrath and said that the need for a unified orc army had passed. There was little argument, and the clans returned to their lands.\nTwo hundred years after Goria was destroyed, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; arrived and built &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; in the location where the city once stood.\nLater years.\nAt some point after the fall of Goria, the Nagrand city of Highmaul became the new capital of the Empire. Despite the loss of their original capital, the ogre sorcerer kings continued to maintain an iron grip over their empire using a variety of artifacts, enough that the nation would ultimately last for a thousand years. Trusted lieutenants were given &lt;a href=\"Abrogator%20Stone\"&gt;magical gems&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to enforce the emperor's will out in the field. The ogre civilization ruled for generations until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Their seat of power is &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, a massive city that belies the ogre reputation for brutish stupidity, full of bustling markets and wealthy nobles, and the roar of the Coliseum crowd echoes through the streets of the slums.\nAfter a period , chieftain of the , leading raids deeper and deeper into Gorian lands, the ogres retaliated by nearly destroying the clan and mortally wounding Grom's mate, &lt;a href=\"Golka\"&gt;Golka&lt;/a&gt;. When Grommash called upon his forces to hunt the ogres down, most of his warriors were executed and Grommash himself captured, bound to a tree in a desert by the &lt;a href=\"Unidentified%20ogre%20imperator\"&gt;ogre warlord&lt;/a&gt;. However, Grommash managed to escape by slipping through his bonds and devouring the warlord.\nAround that time, a brutal slave uprising erupted within the ogre Gorian Empire's capital of Highmaul, which claimed the life of many Highmaul citizens and officials. Their emperor was decapitated by , who then declared the birth of a clan of his own, the Shattered Hand clan, comprised of liberated slaves. Like him, the slaves severed their own chained hands and proceeded to \"drown Draenor in ogre blood.\"\nThe empire was eventually destroyed during the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. During the orcs' war against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, most ogres joined the Horde. That is, except for the ogres of their capital Highmaul, and &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; wanted the last holdouts dead. After the orcs destroyed &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; went to Highmaul, with their chieftains &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; (the latter an ogre himself, exiled from Highmaul) also part of the siege. Eager to exact vengeance, Cho'gall personally killed Imperator Mar'gok. With the powers of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, he bound Mar'gok to his throne and burned him alive.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nIn an alternate universe, with the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Gorian Empire lost its dominance on Draenor. The last emperor, Imperator Mar'gok, reluctantly aligned the empire with the orcs to ensure its continued survival, although he would gladly turn against the orcs if the situation was favorable.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloodmaul clan made use of vast slave labor in order to extract ores and gemstones from the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul%20Slag%20Mines\"&gt;Bloodmaul Slag Mines&lt;/a&gt;, for the Gorian Empire.\nThe are known to value &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s, the fragments of lost artifacts from the ancient ogre empire of &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, used as currency by the Alliance and Horde on the island.\nDuring the excavation in , &lt;a href=\"Ko%27ragh\"&gt;Ko'ragh&lt;/a&gt; was the only ogre to survive direct exposure to a mysterious relic and was left with a near-complete immunity to all magic. Despite of this gift, he remained under the orders of Sorcerer King.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Mar%27gok%27s%20Overwatch\"&gt;Mar'gok's Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, the Gorian arcanists are investigating ways to enchant weapons and armor to create and improve &lt;a href=\"Magic%20breaker\"&gt;Felbreaker&lt;/a&gt; armor. The project is led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Reglakk\"&gt;Grand Magister Reglakk&lt;/a&gt;. Infusing armor with Felbreaker magic allows immunity to all forms of magic, even &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. \nUltimately, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; launched an assault upon the capital of Highmaul in order to defeat the Gorian Empire once and for all. Amid the first assault, however, reveals his presence, as well as his intentions to overthrow the Sorcerer-King and destroy Highmaul. After much fighting, Highmaul's defenses were broken, and Alliance and Horde forces confronted Imperator Mar'gok himself atop his citadel. Following a vicious battle (in which Cho'gall takes part but is also defeated), Mar'gok was slain. Much of the King's secrets, especially the Felbreaker knowledge, was subsequently taken following his death, to be used by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; in his hunt for .\nThe death of Imperator Mar'gok, as well as the fall of Highmaul, marked the end of the empire's power."}

When the planet's ogres rose from their humble conditions and formed the Gorian Empire thousands of years in the past, they became the dominant race on Draenor. Doing so, however, brought them into direct conflict with the disparate orc clans scattered across the world. \nThe Gorian Empire fought the orc clans for centuries, killing many in retaliatory actions and enslaving countless more. Eventually, however, following a determined campaign by several orc clans, as well as a brutal slave uprising in &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; itself and the subsequent death of the emperor, the Gorian Empire became markedly weakened. \nUltimately, the orcs on the alternate world formed the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, whose rise signaled the empire's loss of dominance on Draenor. Hostilities between the two races formally ceased with a truce, although the ogres had suffered a grave blow to their power. The specifics about the main-universe empire are currently unknown.\nHistory.\nRise of the Gorian Empire.\nThousands of years before the first opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the ogres inhabiting the primordial world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in breaking free of the influence of the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, a large race of creatures whom the ogres had previously believed to be gods. With this turn of events, the ogres began to organize themselves as they continued to increase in power and relevance on the world. Eventually, as they became the most powerful race on the planet, they formed the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, led by magically gifted Sorcerer-Kings who acted as the ogres' emperors. \nAs the Gorian Empire established itself, it began an extensive tradition of capturing and enslaving prisoners from other races, most notably the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The ogres had come into conflict with the many orc clans that were scattered around the world. Many of those captured by the ogres were either used as cheap labor throughout the empire, or brought back to the capital of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; to serve as gladiators in the coliseum.\nInsurrection.\nThe orcs eventually responded to the Gorian Empire's actions by launching brutal raids deeper and deeper into Gorian lands. In response to raids on ogre possessions, such as slave caravans, the ogres were known to raze entire orc villages to the ground and slaughter or capture their inhabitants. \n&lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, was responsible for many of the orcs' more ferocious raids into Gorian territory. In retaliation, the Gorian ogres assaulted the Warsong lands, nearly destroying the clan and badly injuring Grommash's mate, &lt;a href=\"Golka\"&gt;Golka&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged, Grommash ordered a large offensive against the Gorian Empire although it ultimately ended in disaster when the ogres set a trap for them, with many of the chieftain's warriors executed and Grommash himself captured.\nTied up in a desert and taunted by the &lt;a href=\"Unidentified%20ogre%20imperator\"&gt;ogre warlord&lt;/a&gt;, Grommash refused to be broken and succeeded in slaying his captor. Upon his escape, the chieftain rallied and inspired his remaining clansmen, encouraging a new war against their ogre oppressors and renewing their will.\nSomewhere around this time period, meanwhile, a savage slave uprising occurred within the Gorian Empire's towering capital of Highmaul in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. The instigator of the revolt, &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, personally decapitated the ogres' emperor. At the uprising's conclusion, which killed many of Highmaul's citizens and officials, Kargath declared the establishment of a new clan: the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt;. Consisting of other freed gladiators who had intentionally severed their own hands to mimic Kargath, this new clan rose with the stated intention to \"drown Draenor in ogre blood\".\nAlternate timeline.\nAt some point, the Gorian ogres attacked the orc fortress of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt;. Though the orcs were surprised by the initial attack, , with the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; in his hands, led a counterattack and won.\nFor many years, the wars continued between the two races, although the Gorian Empire had gradually begun to decline to a state where it was a shadow of its former self. When the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; began and the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; (a combined faction of most of the orc clans) rose to power, the empire was forced to agree to a truce. Too weakened to stand up against the formidable power that this new horde represented, the Gorian Empire's last leader, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt;, aligned his nation with that of the orcs', formally ending the Gorian wars.

They are typically to any travelers that come across them despite the fact that they are herbivores. An enormous gorilla named &lt;a href=\"King%20Mukla\"&gt;King Mukla&lt;/a&gt; dwells on &lt;a href=\"Jaguero%20Island\"&gt;Jaguero Island&lt;/a&gt; in southeast &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, holding a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Poobah\"&gt;Princess Poobah&lt;/a&gt; captive.\nYoung apes quickly learn to hang from branches with their feet, leaving both hands free to fling objects at interlopers. The gorillas at &lt;a href=\"Gorilla%20Gorge\"&gt;Gorilla Gorge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; are highly intelligent due to the presence of &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a hunter pet.\nGorillas are a family of &lt;a href=\"Pet_abilities%23Tenacity_abilities\"&gt;Tenacity pets&lt;/a&gt; and are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s starting at level 28. Gorillas, through use of their &lt;a href=\"Pummel\"&gt;Pummel&lt;/a&gt; ability, interrupt spellcasting, preventing any spell in that school from being cast for 2 sec. This is great in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; and also has uses in &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;, especially for interrupting bosses in 5-player dungeons.\nThere are five different skins available for gorilla pets - the white model being the rarest by far. Gorillas became very popular for a time because they were the only pet with access to the &lt;a href=\"Thunderstomp\"&gt;Thunderstomp&lt;/a&gt; skill. With Thunderstomp now available to any Tenacity pet, they have become uncommon."}

Most gorlocs are members of tribes that battle the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The Borean gorlocs appear to be as hostile and primitive as average murlocs. The Sholazar gorlocs, the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt;, were given intelligence and awareness by exposure to &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; technology. They are an advanced group of gorloc tribes who have formed their own faction, and are fighting the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt; in Sholazar. They are allegedly the next evolution of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;, but murlocs apparently evolved from gorlocs, not the other way around. If they have a progenitor &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;, it was frog-based.\nThey are derogatorily referred to as big-tongues by the wolvar.\nCulture.\nThe gorlocs that inhabit the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; act similar to their &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; descendants: hostile and primitive. Those that inhabit &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; have a more complex culture. These gorlocs revere the &lt;a href=\"White%20Tickbird%20Hatchling\"&gt;rare albino tickbird&lt;/a&gt; as a sign of heavy rainstorms, good grub harvests and hibernating &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt;. Above all however, they revere the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; technology and crystals that granted them true sentience, though they don't really have an understanding of the artifacts they are guarding. The crystals have tangible effects on Sholazar's environment and weather. The Oracles see themselves as guardians of these powers and go to great lengths to ensure they are safe from those that would misuse it, such as the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough they are the sworn enemies of the wolvar, the oracles seem to have a nearly identical social system. Grunt work is done by the warriors, but their cultural leaders are nearly always great &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic practitioners.\nGorlocs prepare their foods with noxious spices which would sicken any other creature.\nThe gorlocs have a saying that the more gnarled a &lt;a href=\"roc\"&gt;roc&lt;/a&gt;'s talon, the more power it holds.\nTribes.\n&lt;a href=\"Blindlight%20tribe\"&gt;Blindlight tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nA tribe that consists of murlocs, deep sea murlocs and gorlocs.\nOracles.\nThe following tribes, although separate, have formed some sort of alliance calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt;:\nSpeculation.\nIf Brann is correct about a frog Wild God creating the gorlocs, it may have been &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt;."}

Their purpose is to devour discarded &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s, and unused parts of the forest, allowing new life to grow there. Expended wildseeds are thrown to &lt;a href=\"Gormhive\"&gt;Gormhive&lt;/a&gt; for the gorm to consume.This is done through their digestive juices that dissipate the anima in their food. They are drawn to consume anything that is lacking &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. The gorm only know to consume, and normally the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; keep them under control. &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s use bits of anima-less detritus tied to the end of sticks to steer the gorm they use as mounts.\nHowever, with the Night Fae busy responding to the anima drought, there aren't enough resources to keep the gorm in check and they've started growing out of control, becoming a threat to Ardenweald instead of one of its natural mechanisms. Due to the anima drought, even the land has become a source of food for them, and they have begun chewing at the edges of Ardenweald itself. This can cause parts of the land to collapse or break away from Ardenweald. A few gorm have found and consumed &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s that still contain ancient nature spirits\u2014an act that grants them the spirits' strength and intelligence. Gorm who have consumed such wildseeds can gain the ability to speak.\nThe parts of gorm are used for a variety of purposes by the crafters and artisans of Ardenweald. Gorm gris, a type of that a gorm may regurgitate after eating, is used in construction, mending, crafts, and even as an addition to rations. Gorm husks that have been soaked in running water for several days can be shaped into high-quality armor, while gorm claws and stingers can be made into sharp-edged weapons that never break. A person who creates equipment out of gorm parts is known as a gormsmith. In the absence of a matriarch, the fae egg-tenders are able to control the hive. Gorm can be rounded up with lures made from culexwood, which requires an offering, usually song, for the tree to willingly give its wood.\nWhile some gorm (usually gormlings) are kept domesticated, wild gorm grow in hives across Ardenweald, including the &lt;a href=\"Creeping%20Hive\"&gt;Creeping Hive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gormhive\"&gt;Gormhive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crumbled%20Ridge\"&gt;Crumbled Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Burrows\"&gt;Dusty Burrows&lt;/a&gt;, and likely previously &lt;a href=\"Blackthorn%20Grove\"&gt;Blackthorn Grove&lt;/a&gt;. In the absence of a matriarch, gorm egg-tenders are the leaders of a hive, and they can turn into queens. The wild gorm encroach across the land and have invaded both &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Scithe\"&gt;Tirna Scithe&lt;/a&gt; and the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Noch\"&gt;Tirna Noch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sting of a flying gorm is incredibly painful and can cause temporary paralysis, even to creatures much larger than the gorm itself.\nAs a hunter pet.\nGorm are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of two different pet families.

{"id": "232349", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=232349", "title": "Gormok the Impaler", "text": "Gormok the Impaler is the first boss of the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, released in in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2\"&gt;patch 3.2&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\n25-man.\nTypically, two tanks are used to deal with the Impale debuff. As soon as the first tank gets its third Impale, the second tank will taunt. Gormok impales the tank every 10 seconds, and the debuff lasts 30 seconds. Thus, the debuff on one tank will wear off just as the other tank is receiving its third impale. Each stack of the impale debuff does about 2k damage every 2 seconds. With three debuffs, that's roughly 6k damage every 2 seconds. Gormok's attacks hit hard (~15k every 2 seconds). Healers should be prepared for when the next tank taunts, so that they can immediately start healing.\nGormok hits hard, so there should be healers assigned to the tanks. Because of the constant damage to the off tank, Pallies work great: put Light's Beacon on one tank and heal the other tank. If one of the tank healers gets a Snobold, another healer needs to take over. Snobolds interrupt spell casting and stun their victims. Also, when healers run in range so melee can kill the Snobold, Gormok's stomp will also interrupt their casts.\nThe first Snobold appears ~20 seconds into the fight. The person with the Snobold should run into melee range of the boss, so melee can easily switch to the Snobold, and range can simply tab-target. A common mistake is to be in range of the melee players, but outside melee range of the boss, which can cause a Fire Bomb to hit the melee players. The best place to stand is in the middle of the boss, so that melee players do not have to move at all to target the Snobold. After all five Snobolds are dead, there are no more Fire Bombs.\nSnobolds can be marked with raid icons (skull), as well as hunter marks. \nExcept when they have a Snobold on their back, casters should stay at least 15 yards away to prevent their spells from being interrupted by Staggering Stomp.\nAfter Gormok dies, the Impale debuff can be removed from tanks through various means, such as Dwarf racial or a Pally bubble. The tank needs to quickly click off the bubble before engaging Acidmaw/Dreadscale.\nSome groups use three tanks, switching after two Impale debuffs to the next tank in line.\n10-man.\nEvery 10 secs a debuff will appear on the main tank called Impale; tanks need to switch before 5 stack, 3-4 is ideal. (If the two tanks taunt when their debuff is at 8\u20139 seconds remaining, tanks should be able to maintain only a two-stack of the debuff throughout the fight.) Stacks wear off after 30 seconds, however Hand of Protection will removes the debuff entirely.\nSnobold Vassals will also occasionally be thrown out to the raid by Gormok. The Snobolds will latch onto particular players, attacking them for a fair amount of damage and interrupting spell casting. The Snowbolds also throw Fire Bombs; all ranged DPS and healers must be on guard to immediately move out of the flames to reduce damage, as the fire hits for approximately 4,000 Fire damage per second.\nEvery so often Gormok will do a nasty stomp attack (Staggering Stomp)that may hit from anywhere from 9,000~ damage to 13,000~ to raid members within 15 yards and interrupting spell casting for 5 seconds. He seems to melee for approximately 13,000-17,000 damage on plate.\nIssues.\nOn 25 player heroic mode, some players are currently experiencing disconnects shortly after the start of the fight when the first Fire Bomb is cast.

Since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; he can be found in &lt;a href=\"New%20Kargath\"&gt;New Kargath&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nGorn, a &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; warlord at Kargath in the Badlands. The old orc Gorn runs the enclave, located in the northwestern area of the Badlands. Gorn and his warriors keep tabs on the renegade orcs in the eastern lands \u2014 remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrocks&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;) clans. He aims to wipe out the remaining &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;evil orcs&lt;/a&gt; and bolster the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s confidence in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He is large, even for one of his kind, and easily hefts a massive greataxe in one of his mighty fists. He wears no armor and is dressed in only a fur-covered leather wrap twisted around his waist, leaving his broad, well-muscled frame on display for all to see. From the wealth of battle scars that are visible, the orc is no stranger to combat; and, despite his savage appearance, he carries himself in an almost regal manner.\nGorn is a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; of simple tactics, having risen swiftly through the ranks of the Horde thanks to his unmatched ability to strike hard and fast. He never offers mercy to opponents, preferring instead to grant them the honor of dying in combat. If there are any obvious spellcasters among his enemies, Gorn begins the fight by using his mirror image ability to create decoy targets for their spells. Otherwise, he prefers to rage and then close into melee combat immediately. If possible, Gorn charges the most fearsome warrior first, attacking him until he falls, and reserves mirror image for use only if the tide of battle goes against him.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Horde%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Horde Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\", Gorn is mentioned in a story. He is the son of &lt;a href=\"Luhk%20the%20Keen-eyed\"&gt;Luhk the Keen-eyed&lt;/a&gt; and grandson of &lt;a href=\"Dharl%20of%20the%20Thrice-Bloodied%20Blade\"&gt;Dharl of the Thrice-Bloodied Blade&lt;/a&gt;. When he met an enemy in the Barrens who had \"plagued\" his people, it turned out to be his brother, &lt;a href=\"Sesk\"&gt;Sesk&lt;/a&gt;. Sesk was bald, had scars, and had crimson eyes. Gorn thought he had been dead, but Sesk told him that he is just \"reborn\". He had drunk demon blood. They were last seen charging at each other."}

The surviving Dragonmaw were not happy about the dwarves taking their stuff and attacked them but the Wildhammers dealt with the orcs quickly.\nBefore coming here, the dwarves had sent some scouts to the area including &lt;a href=\"Ella%20Forgehammer\"&gt;Ella Forgehammer&lt;/a&gt;'s brother &lt;a href=\"Bahrum%20Forgehammer\"&gt;Bahrum&lt;/a&gt;.

Ashamed of losing the pants, which were made by his sister, Bahrum wanted to recover them, and so he sent the adventurer to the keep where the &lt;a href=\"Gorosh%20the%20Pant%20Stealer\"&gt;orc who had taken them&lt;/a&gt; was.

King Ymiron displays the frozen magnataur's cruel countenance as a reminder that even the most savage beasts are mere decorations for vrykul halls. This living statue will sow destruction if liberated, unleashing his wrath indiscriminately.\"\nStrategies.\nPalehoof is unfrozen as part of an event. The Trophy Hall contains four creatures plus Gortok Palehoof. (A Furbolg, a Worgen, a Rhino and a Jormunger)\nYou begin the event by clicking on the \"stasis controller\" in his room. The stasis controller spawns an orb that will unfreeze two of the four creatures at random then unfreeze Palehoof. \nPalehoof himself is a relatively simple tank and spank. His arcing smash does substantial damage in front of him so the tank needs to turn him away from the party. Occasionally he will target a random party member and throw a spear at them, stunning them and dealing ~2k damage every 3 seconds for 10 seconds. \nHe also casts \"withering roar\" about every 10 seconds which reduces all party member's health by 500 for each cast, and stacks up to 50 times. This provides a de facto enrage timer as your tank and other party members will eventually be one shotted. In regular this is not a substantial problem. \nHeroic - One mob gets unfrozen at once randomly, like in Normal, but all 4 are unfrozen before Palehoof. Palehoof has substantially more health and does substantially more DPS. The withering roar in this case is a barrier and fairly high DPS is needed to kill him before too many stacks accumulate.\nTrivia.\nGortok is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Mallow\"&gt;Dave Mallow&lt;/a&gt;."}

His many victories were fueled by his cunning and collection of powerful artifacts from the older ages.

After venturing to forgotten battlefields in the north, Gorvold learned that the champion went south with Tyr, fleeing the crumbling empire of the titans behind. Gorvold built a mighty ship and began his journey south as well. Gorvold braves sea beast and storm alike, following the harrowing trail south. With guile, he tracked the barest scraps of a trail across a continent to find a long-forgotten battle. He found &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;stunted vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, the castoffs of &lt;a href=\"Ymiron\"&gt;Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;'s edict, both worshiping and avoiding the site of a fallen titan keeper and his great foe. From ruins Gorvold discovered the trail did not end here. After the great battle, Tyr's champion moved on. So too did Gorvold.\nNo one knows where Gorvold went or what he found, only that he returned empty-handed, forever maddened by his failure. His only words were of how he failed the test of &lt;a href=\"Yrgrim\"&gt;Yrgrim&lt;/a&gt;. Gorvold threw himself into battle with near berserk rage. His cunning was replaced with reckless abandon and ultimately fell in battle, taking his secrets with him to the grave. \nThe End of the Saga.\nHis spirit is contacted by a group of priest and paladin in order to locate &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; ultimately lays his spirit to rest at last, wiping away the pain of disgrace from him after he has answered the questions of &lt;a href=\"Orik%20Trueheart\"&gt;Orik Trueheart&lt;/a&gt;."}

When the &lt;a href=\"Provincial%20Settler\"&gt;Provincials&lt;/a&gt; saw him, they immediately charged into battle. They expected him to fight back but Gory didn't even care about them. Gory's dream was never to be a weapon but rather a farmer. According to &lt;a href=\"Thurman%20Grant\"&gt;Thurman Grant&lt;/a&gt; he only wants to help out on the farm and so he puts his abilities to use. He used him as a combatant to help train the farmers that came with him from &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;.

During this phase, he will sometimes come across a Glutinous Geist devouring one of the corpses. If this happens, he will cause the geist to explode and proceed to raise a ghoul from the scarlet corpse.\nSummary.\nAt the start of the encounter, the gate dividing the two rooms will close. Adds will spawn on the \"living\" side of the gate, and then when killed will be reborn on the \"undead\" side. After several waves of adds, Gothik will become attackable and begin teleporting between the two rooms. Finally the gate will open and everyone will be able to swarm the boss at once.\nMost strategies involve dividing the raid between the two rooms to take care of the waves of adds, and controlling the rate at which the \"living\" adds are killed so their stronger undead counterparts do not overwhelm the group on the other side.\n25-man abilities.\nPhase One.\nGothik the Harvester is invulnerable. Through the first four minutes and thirty-four seconds of the fight adds will spawn on the left side of Gothik's room. These are:\nLiving Side.\nUnrelenting Trainee\nUnrelenting Death Knight\nUnrelenting Rider\nUndead Side.\nWhenever a living mob is slain on the live side its spirit will transfer to the undead side and spawn a corresponding undead mob there. Unrelenting Riders will spawn both a Spectral Rider and a Spectral Horse.\nSpectral Trainee\nSpectral Deathknight\nSpectral Rider\nSpectral Horse\n10-man Abilities.\nPhase One.\nGothik the Harvester is invulnerable. Through the first four minutes and thirty-four seconds of the fight adds will spawn on the left side of Gothik's room. These are:\nLiving Side.\nUnrelenting Trainee\nNon Elite Humanoid, Can not be CC'd\nUnrelenting Deathknight\nElite Humanoid, Can not be CC'd, but susceptible to snares\nUnrelenting Rider\nElite Humanoid, Can't be CC'd\nUndead Side.\nWhenever a living mob is slain on the live side its spirit will transfer to the undead side and spawn a corresponding undead mob there. Unrelenting Riders will spawn both a Spectral Rider and a Spectral Horse.\nSpectral Trainee\nSpectral Deathknight\nSpectral Rider\nElite Undead, cannot be CCed\nSpectral Horse\nElite Undead, cannot be CCed.\n25-man strategy.\nGothik the Harvester is mainly a DPS race and a test to see if you can keep everyone alive until phase 2. It is do-able with two tanks though more are helpful.\nSplitting.\nYou will need to split the raid into two, with half your healers and tanks on each side and the DPS classes split between the living and undead sides.\nStart the encounter by shooting something at Gothik. Rogues can also Shadowstep to Gothik. Unrelenting Trainees do not have to be tanked and die very quickly. Death Knights are not terribly dangerous but do have to be tanked. Riders are very dangerous and should be prioritized.\nThe main trick to this encounter is pacing living side DPS such that you do not kill so fast the Undead side is overwhelmed, remember that Riders will spawn both a Rider and a Horse on the undead side when killed. Do not kill a second rider until the undead side is finished with the first one. Should you be overwhelmed Death Knights and Trainees are CC-able. \nShould you make it to phase 2 with everyone alive it is mainly a formality. Heal, Shadowbolt, and kill Gothik before 10 Harvest Soul stacks. He has very little HP.\nNot Splitting.\nThis strategy is different in that you do not split the raid between the two sides. You will need at least three tanks, preferable one that is able to pick up multiple mobs simultaneously.\nBegin the encounter normally by attacking Gothik. When the gate closes have your best geared tank stand near it with your AoE friendly tank but not to close while the rest of the group focuses on the newly spawning adds of phase one.\nBetween two and two and half minutes into the fight Gothik will open the gates early releasing all of the adds of the dead side onto the living. The tanks near the gate must pick them up immediately while using any preferred cooldown to lower oncoming damage or increase total health. Healers must also be prepare to keep the tanks alive while Ranged DPS AoEs the group down. Melee should stay away from the gates when they open as the AoE from the mass of mobs can and will kill you.\nWhile this is happening you must remember that mobs will continue to spawn on the living side until phase 2 but in no greater quantity. Once the initial rush of mobs are dead continue the encounter by picking up spawning adds and killing them.\nShould you make it to phase 2 with everyone alive it is mainly a formality of DPSing the little health Gothik has made easier as the gates will stay open. Gothik will still teleport between the two side though.\n10-man strategy.\nSplit the team in two half on living side half on the undead side. At the start of the fight, make sure you DPS mobs on the living side slowly. Each mob that dies spawns on the undead side and the undead side has harder mobs, so its easy to overrun your other team if you kill the living side mobs too quickly. You may want to stack an extra DPS on the undead side for a 4-6 split. Typically tank, healer, dps, dps on living side and tank, healer, healer, dps, dps, dps on undead side.\nRemember that you can more easily crowd control (CC) the living mobs (poly, sap, and frost nova) than you can with the undead mobs, as only non-elite undead can be shackled. You will also want to put logical classes on each side; for example retribution paladins should be on the undead side as they deal added damage and priests can shackle. Mages and rogues should be on the living side for their CC'ing abilities. Note that a good group should have no problem DPSing either side down, and so CCing often becomes ignored unless necessary for stopping trash from attacking healers. If this is your first time here, split your group like this: Undead - Best tank, best healer, best DPS. This is because the mobs are harder to pick up and harder to kill on Undead side. Also if your weaker group is on the living side, then it becomes easier for the undead side, as the mobs are coming in slower.\nSince trainees and their undead equivalent are so weak (10k health), you should ignore them when worrying about slowing down DPS. Riders are especially important to fight correctly, because when they die they spawn two enemies on the other side (this second mob has 16k health and deals a significant amount of damage). Communication is vital once wave 9 hits; you should not be killing the stronger mobs on the living side if the undead side is overrun.\nIf anyone dies, it will probably be a wipe as DPS won't be high enough to fight off the final waves and take Gothik down far enough for the center gate to open. If the players on the undead side go down, the living side will have to take on the remaining undead mobs when the gate opens. Although you may be able to clear the undead, your DPS will probably not be strong enough to take down Gothik.\nGothik will teleport down to the middle of the living side, and after about 10 seconds he will teleport to the undead side. During this time, all remaining adds must be killed on both sides. Gothik will continue to go back and forth between the two sides until he reaches 30%, at which point the gate in the middle will open up. Players on the opposite side of Gothik can now join with the other group. DPS Gothik as fast as you can, as the Harvest Soul debuff will be stacking (even at 10 stacks, a full party should have no problem surviving to get him down).\nQuotes.\nAt Death's Breach.\nWhen retrieving &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Ghoul\"&gt;Scarlet Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

Since the mana return is based on the damage done by the Lightning Bolt, the talent returns more mana as the shaman's &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; improves, making it much better at very high gear levels. At current endgame gear levels, the talent will return roughly twice the cost of Lightning Bolt.\nNotes.\nThe mana returned is based entirely on damage done, meaning that anything that increases damage - such as &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; strikes - will result in increased mana gain. Similarly, anything that reduces damage taken by the target will reduce the amount of mana you gain, and if your spell &lt;a href=\"miss\"&gt;miss&lt;/a&gt;es you will gain no mana at all. Since Lightning Bolt still costs mana to use, this means that this spell can drain your mana if you're very unlucky or not careful about what you attack, although in most circumstances it will restore more mana than you expended.\nThe talent is generally considered to be optional for normal mode &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;ing, and mostly useless for five man healing. The potential mana gain is very valuable in &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; raids, however. The way the talent scales with &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; is also a contributing factor in this, as the talent is worth more the better your gear is."}

The city was located in the middle of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; country and made invisible by a protective spell using &lt;a href=\"%3ALeafshadow\"&gt;:Leafshadow&lt;/a&gt;, a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city's leadership resided in the magister's seat, a building that also welcomed &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; whenever he visited.\nHistory.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Restalaan\"&gt;Restalaan&lt;/a&gt; and his draenei party had rescued the young &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt; who were under attack by an ogre, they were escorted to Telmor and Durotan witnessed the incantation that deactivated Leafshadow's concealing spell.\nLater, when the orcs started a &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;war against the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, Durotan was forced by the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; to lead a war party of over a hundred mounted &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s to Telmor, among them &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; orcs. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guthor\"&gt;Guthor&lt;/a&gt; were the other leaders beyond Durotan. Unfortunately, Durotan had an excellent memory and was able to recall how to remove the invisibility spell from Telmor, leaving the nearly undefended city open to attack. As a result, the city was taken over and completely destroyed, and Restalaan was killed.\nAfter this, the city was offered to Durotan and his clan but he refused, so Blackhand and his Blackrock orcs gained control of the city. This led to the Blackrocks temporarily relocating to the city, with Blackhand appropriating the magister's seat for his family and the clan members starting to use draenei tools and wear draenei clothing for a brief period instead of their own tribal garments.\nSpeculation.\nThe depicted the ruins of the Ango'rosh ogres nearby, so it is likely that the &lt;a href=\"Ango%27rosh%20tribe\"&gt;Ango'rosh tribe&lt;/a&gt; were the ogres originally in control of the area.\nGiven Telmor's position south of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, it was presumably lost when Draenor was destroyed and became Outland."}

This is where the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; have taken residence, but unchecked Void energies ravage the floating islands, forming a growing &lt;a href=\"Voidstorm\"&gt;Voidstorm&lt;/a&gt; that might one day even consume the big island entirely.\nHistory.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian to discover the existence of Telogrus Rift was the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; through his studies of the Void, believing the rift held an ancient object of unspeakable might. Despite his extensive research, however, Drathir was never able to access the shattered world.\nAround the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; exiles, banished from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; for their Void experiments and led by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded in reaching Telogrus Rift after finding the work done by Dar'Khan Drathir. They entered the world in search of the powerful item that eluded Drathir and hoped to use it to harness the powers of the Void. There, joined by the legendary &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;ally&lt;/a&gt;, the elves began trying to open an unspeakably ancient and mysterious cube they discovered in the area. Doing so, however, opened the way for &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt;, who overwhelmed those gathered and began a ritual to transform them into servants of the Void.\nAlleria and her ally, however, managed to defeat Durzaan and his forces, including the Void monstrosity &lt;a href=\"Nhr%27ghesh\"&gt;Nhr'ghesh&lt;/a&gt;, and free Umbric and the other elves. Though Durzaan's ritual was not completed, the process had permanently changed Umbric's blood elves, turning them into void elves. In the aftermath of these events, these \"ren'dorei\" decided to make Telogrus Rift their new base of operations, and pledged their loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; through Alleria. She remained on Telogrus to teach her kin how to use and control their newfound powers.\nMany void elves, as well as individuals from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, conduct research and studies in Telogrus Rift, with a focus on better understanding and harnessing the powers of the Void.\nGeography.\nLittle to nothing is known of Telogrus or its geography prior to its destruction.\nCurrently, the Telogrus Rift consists of six major islands suspended in space, with numerous other fragments floating in the immediate area. The landscape is rocky, and is almost devoid of life apart from the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; themselves, though a breed of &lt;a href=\"warp%20stalker\"&gt;warp stalker&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Curious%20Voidstalker\"&gt;voidstalker&lt;/a&gt; does appear to inhabit the area; the void elves have since succeeded in taming these animals, turning them into &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s. The land itself is largely soaked in &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; energies that can often be seen emanating from the surface of the planet.\nSpeculation.\nBased on Nether-Prince Durzaan describing Telogrus Rift as a place echoing with \"the whispers of the great ones who were slain... and the hatred of he who broke this world\", and Locus-Walker confirming it is a \"very old place\" and \"broken by rage, yet sculpted by the threads of fate\", it is speculated that Telogrus was likely to have been the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted planet destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the Old Gods present from turning the &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20world-soul\"&gt;local world-soul&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt;."}

He helped Thermaplugg engineer the plan that led to the fall of Gnomeregan and the genocide of the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; race, his motivation being that he wanted to get \"recognition\". Instead, however, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;High Tinker Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as Telzo saw it\u2014swept in and reaped the rewards of all of his and Sicco's work.\nNo one heard from Sparkspanner for many years after the Gnomeregan incident. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he suddenly returned to enact his revenge on Mekkatorque's followers and decimate gnomanity using an army of &lt;a href=\"Ironbound\"&gt;Ironbound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, he took control of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;'s exterior defenses. Sparkspanner sent a number of Ironbound led by &lt;a href=\"Krugg%20the%20Smart\"&gt;Krugg the Smart&lt;/a&gt; to attack the &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Airstrip\"&gt;Fizzcrank Airstrip&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Elite%20Aerial%20Rangers\"&gt;Gnomish Elite Aerial Rangers&lt;/a&gt; subsequently arrived to help defend the airstrip, with &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;G.E.A.R.'s Commander&lt;/a&gt; killing Krugg and retrieving his &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Communication%20Device\"&gt;communication device&lt;/a&gt;, which sparked a hologram revealing that Sparkspanner was the one in control of the troggs and allowed the rangers to track the signal to the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. While the rangers were flying to the mountains, Sparkspanner contacted the squadron to taunt them. G.E.A.R. later confirmed that Sparkspanner was in the Halls of Stone and used one of their &lt;a href=\"First%20Squadron%20Prototype\"&gt;prototype bomber planes&lt;/a&gt; to clear out his army outside the walls of Ulduar before heading into the halls to find Telzo waiting at the Forge of Wills, piloting a &lt;a href=\"clockwork%20giant\"&gt;clockwork giant&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Smasher%20X900\"&gt;Smasher X900&lt;/a&gt;. The rangers managed to defeat the clockwork giant, and although Telzo ejected from the mech, its torso subsequently fell on top of him, crushing him. Gnomanity and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were thereby saved from a threat they didn't even know about, and &lt;a href=\"Herk%20Winklespring\"&gt;Herk Winklespring&lt;/a&gt; hoped that this would be the last time the gnomes would ever hear from any of Thermaplugg's old minions."}

This crystalline fortress is now ruled by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the lord of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, and dominated by scores of his brethren. The structure is divided into three wings - satellites of the gigantic structure - with the fourth wing, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", now in the world of Azeroth as the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; capital. The three remaining wings are differentiated by the different color themes: &lt;a href=\"Botanica\"&gt;Botanica&lt;/a&gt; (Light blue), &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt; (Red) and &lt;a href=\"Mechanar\"&gt;Mechanar&lt;/a&gt; (Light purple).\nHistory.\nThe mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, sapient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As a base of operations for the Naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye.\nRight before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; reached out to the naaru independently, both seeking aid against the dark forces amassing on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; heard their pleas but the Army's battles with the Legion were costly and ceaseless, so they could not spare soldiers to protect Outland. Instead &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to help the people of Outland and arrived with Tempest Keep.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; serving as the strategic battlefront in the ongoing Burning Crusade, the Naaru used Tempest Keep to reach the shattered land. However, when the Naaru set out from their stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elves quickly raided the dimensional fortress and assumed control over its satellite structures. Guided by some unknown purpose, Kael'thas manipulates the keep\u2019s otherworldly technologies, using them to harness the chaotic energies of the Netherstorm itself. Pieces of Tempest Keep were harvested and reused to create the &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThough Kael'thas and his minions maintain a tight hold on the keep, a band of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; hijacked one of its satellite structures, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", and used it to escape Outland. In seeking out other worlds, the draenei, led by the ancient prophet, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, hoped to find allies who would stand with them against the Legion and its nihilistic Crusade. The \"Exodar\" was damaged in the escape, and eventually crash-landed on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctioning.\nTempest Keep can be accurately described as an enchanted fortress. It has the ability to Travel along the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; - a realm of intense energy that links all the worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; together. This is where the term \"inter-dimensional\" comes from. A \"space ship\" would simply traverse the distance of the great dark from point A to point B. Tempest Keep uses the Twisting Nether to travel almost instantaneously from place to place. In essence, it is a self-contained &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; which operates on the same principle.\nEvolution of the concept.\nTempest Keep was originally stated to be the \"Dimensional Ship\" which the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt; provided for the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s flight from &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. When the orcs were corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, it was believed that many draenei hid away in the Keep for many decades.\nMetzen: \"The draenei nether-ship you've been hearing about is far more than it seems. It's part of a larger dimension-traveling fortress called Tempest Keep that essentially teleports through alternate realities. It doesn't bank and roll or shoot photon torpedoes (not yet, anyway).\".\nIn a direct contradiction to the previous information about Tempest Keep, it was revealed in \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Rise of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" that &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, the gigantic crystal in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; revered by the orcs as their \"Mountain of Spirits,\" was in fact the vessel that provided &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and the draenei their escape from Argus, not Tempest Keep. It was also revealed in the Blizzard short \"&lt;a href=\"Unbroken%20%28short%20story%29\"&gt;Unbroken&lt;/a&gt;\" that Velen and the survivors did not flock to Tempest Keep to hide, but rather hid somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; (possibly the hidden &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt; on the border with the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;). The story regarding Tempest Keep was changed accordingly; in , Tempest Keep was described as a naaru dimensional fortress that did not arrive on Draenor until \"after\" its destruction/transformation into Outland. The portion referring to Velen and the draenei raid on the \"Exodar\" in order to escape Outland was only slightly modified to fit the changed situation."}

They are not only the most skilled in battle, but also the most righteous in their demeanor. Strength of arms and purity of mind are strict requirements. In the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, they act as officers.\nThey are also present in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; where some of them fought in the first battle for the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, templar of various races were trained from Silver Hand &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s and recruited into the Silver Hand by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Born\"&gt;Commander Born&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnown.\nThe following characters use Templar's Verdict ability:\nIn the RPG.\nArgent Dawn templar.\nArgent Dawn Templars (or simply Templars) are devoted followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; who have chosen to cast away the traditions of the past to find the best ways possible to fight the growing forces of darkness in the world. Like &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, Argent Dawn Templars often oppose &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, but Templars learn to use the Holy Light to strike against other forms of evil with equal potency.\nAbilities.\nTo aid in the seemingly impossible struggles against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Templars study all forms of combat, and they find powerful and unique uses for the Holy Light. These unique abilities carry a price, however. As an Argent Dawn Templar delves deeper into studies of the Light, he abandons his old teachings and connections to the world. Many Templars sacrifice much of their wealth in their continuing battle against the forces of darkness in the world, but the greatest are more greatly transformed. Former Paladins cast off their plate armor or even abandon their old powers in favor of the new secrets they uncover. Some observers claim that the eldest Templars require such sacrifices from their disciples; others believe that the secrets these &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;s discover somehow drives them away from their former lives and powers.\nThese few who know of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; Templars speak of strange and mysterious rituals the knights perform in search of new and greater powers. While a few of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;'s most traditional Paladins and &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s condemn this unusual behavior, none can dispute the Templar's effectiveness. Rumors abound of &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;s powerful enough to shield themselves from any form of harm, or to banish a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in a single strike.\nThe Argent Dawn Templar gains the ability to change divine spell energy into holy lightning, manifesting it as a blast of silvery light. In addition, the Argent Dawn Templar may also gain a distinguishing mark. Examples of distinctive marks are runic tattoos, glowing eyes (usually a metallic color), or the loss of all hair on the body.\nIn the world.\nAll Argent Dawn Templars are members of the Argent Dawn, an unaffiliated organization that combats the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Burning Legion, and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other sources of corruption. The majority of the Argent Dawn Templars are Paladins, although some &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s also take up the Templar's mantle. While the Argent Dawn itself allows all races in its ranks, typically only &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;High Elve&lt;/a&gt;s have become Templars (this does not mean other races cannot become templars, &lt;a href=\"Saria%20Nightwatcher\"&gt;Saria Nightwatcher&lt;/a&gt; being an example).\nArgent Dawn Templars see their group as a small silver light shining in the darkness of the world around them. Templars see corruption in their homes and many other organizations, including the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. While the Templars see Paladins as allies and vice versa, Templars feel that the Silver Hand overemphasizes tradition and order over general goodness and other values of the Light. Templars are virtually unknown in the world as a whole, although the Argent Dawn itself is widespread. The few Templars form a close-knit and elite group, often serving as leaders for groups of Paladins and Priests without revealing their unusual paths.\nHigh-ranking Argent Dawn Templars initiate all new members, typically after the aspirant completes a difficult quest or achieves a considerable goal. The Argent Dawn's leaders study and train potentials carefully before they accept them into the elite section of the Argent Dawn."}

Thus empowered, he was charged with judging the purity of those who enter the facility.\"\nStrategy.\nHealer and ranged needs to spread out to avoid Divine Reckoning hitting more than one target.\nEveryone must watch for Searing Light and move if it targets you.\nAbout every minute, he gains Shield of Light and begins to channel Reverberating Hymn. Two players must jump down into the pit and hit a switch on the left and right to disable Shield of Light. Then, someone must interrupt Reverberating Hymn. The two player down in the pit will aggro Pit Vipers, and will bring them up to the boss when running back. When the Viper come, everyone should AOE them down. It may help for healer to heal the player down in the pit or the tank to taunt off them to get the Viper to run up without attacking the people in the pit the whole way back up.\nStrategy Heroic.\nTemple Guardian Anhuur is very similar on Heroic when compared to normal difficulty. The channeled Reverberating Hymn will cause much more damage on heroic.\nEngage the boss and tank him facing away from the rest of the group so that it is easier for melee to see and then move out of beams(Searing Light). Everyone needs to move out of the beams quickly. \nStay spread out and remove the Divine Reckoning debuff quickly.\nWhen Anhuur gains Shield of Light he will begin to cast Reverberating Hymn. You must jump down into the pit and toggle the two switches one on each side. \nOn Heroic all but one dps should jump down into the pit on the same side. One dps should remain up top to interrupt Reverberating Hymn immediately. The DPS to remain up-top should be able to heal themselves in some fashion. \nIn the pit everyone should move together and stay within LOS of your healer. Toggle the switch on the left or right side then move together to toggle the other switch. Kill the snakes as you are moving up top and the tank can be picking them up while flipping the switches. When the shield goes down your DPS up-top will interrupt the Hymn and the boss will move toward the stairs to get to the tank. Tank him where you meet he will port back on the next shield phase. \nRinse and repeat.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He also instructed the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Council\"&gt;Illidari Council&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Command\"&gt;Chamber of Command&lt;/a&gt; to defend the way into the summit while the Betrayer himself went to cast a spell. As the council fell, &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Udalo\"&gt;Seer Udalo&lt;/a&gt; broke a spell cast on a door leading to the Summit. With the path clear, Akama and his companions attacked Illidan. Illidan summoned &lt;a href=\"Parasitic%20Shadowfiend\"&gt;Parasitic Shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Flames of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt; and used his magic against his attackers. He was slowly gaining upper hand and called for reinforcements. Akama turned to dispatch them in order for the Azeroth's heroes to remain fighting Illidan. Soon, however, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; appeared and Azeroth's heroes attacked anew until, finally, he succumbed and died. As he lied dead, Maiev thought of his final words towards her. Distressed, she briefly contemplated attacking the heroes, but quickly dismissed the thought and simply left. As she left, Akama returned to see Illidan's corpse. The summit itself had stone melted and flowing like lava. After Akama left the summit, Maiev returned there with her wardens and encased Illidan's body into a crystal. Suddenly, a portal opened and the group of demon hunters Illidan had sent emerged from it. They charged to attack the wardens, but they were trapped and encased in crystals as well. From there, they were transported into the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears later, &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the Black Temple and went to the Summit. There, Kanrethad opened a massive portal and absorbed &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy. A &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; adventurer then entered the temple summit, summoned, and attacked Kanrethad. After defeating his demons and weakening Kanrethad, the fel-empowered warlock stunned the adventurer, but soon Jubeka arrived and banished Kanrethad for his betrayal.\nAs a result of this breach, Akama had a holy barrier erected around the Temple. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Illidari demon hunters pierced holy barriers around the Black Temple which allowed them to teleport to the summit. &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Malevolence\"&gt;Matron Mother Malevolence&lt;/a&gt; enchanted and held the door while the demon hunters went to confront Akama atop the summit. After Akama was defeated, he was either convinced to assist the Illidari by &lt;a href=\"Altruis%20the%20Sufferer\"&gt;Altruis the Sufferer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; recreated the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;Shade of Akama&lt;/a&gt;, before leaving for the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

It was released with &lt;a href=\"patch%201.9\"&gt;patch 1.9&lt;/a&gt; during a massive server-dependent event called the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesciption.\nAt the heart of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; lies an ancient temple complex. Built in the time before recorded history, it is both a monument to unspeakable gods and a massive breeding ground for the qiraji army. Since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; ended a thousand years ago, the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Twin Emperors&lt;/a&gt; of the qiraji empire have been trapped inside their temple, barely contained behind the magical barrier erected by the bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves.\nNow that the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; has been reassembled and the seal has been broken, the way into the inner sanctum of Ahn'Qiraj is open. Beyond the crawling madness of the hives, beneath the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj, legions of qiraji prepare for invasion. They must be stopped at all costs before they can unleash their voracious insectoid armies on Kalimdor once again, and a second War of the Shifting Sands breaks loose!\nDungeon Companion.\nDark whispers ride on the winds of Silithus desert. An old god stirs in his wretched lair and the entire world shall soon be the target of his wrath. After thousands of years of slumber, the old god, C'thun has awakened and is quickly regenerating his power. Once he has reached full potential nothing will be able to stop him. The dragons that so humbly sacrificed themselves so long ago to imprison C'thun are weakened or enslaved in the temple, so the charge of protecting the land falls to other heroes.\nHeroes must enter Temple of Ahn'Qiraj, challenge C'thun's most wicked servants, and slay a god. The road will not be easy and it is wrought with peril at every turn. Will the heroes turn back now or face C'thun in his mighty lair and put an end to him once and for all?\nAhn'Qiraj War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Temple and killed &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. Their march through the area was described as a path of madness. Some of the soldiers who survived that day escaped with only minor wounds to their bodies, but with damage to their minds. One of their greatest challenges was against the twin emperors, Vek'lor and Vek'nilash.\nSeason of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, a &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;coffin&lt;/a&gt; can be found shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Skeram\"&gt;Prophet Skeram&lt;/a&gt;. Interacting with this coffin will allow players to increase the difficulty level of the raid by causing C'Thun's tentacles to spawn during boss fights; the higher a player's &lt;a href=\"Brood%20of%20Nozdormu\"&gt;Brood of Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; reputation, the more difficulty options they can select. Increasing the difficulty makes the fights more challenging, but will also increase the rewards.\nPreparation.\nThe Temple of Ahn'Qiraj scales more in difficulty than other instances. The first few bosses are on par with the harder bosses in &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; and the last bosses are harder than anything you find in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nNature resistance is particularly important in this instance for a few bosses. Equipment is important, but the earlier encounters will be possible to beat with sheer wits and strategy. Nature Protection potions are clearly of use here.\nThere is no key required to enter the Ahn'Qiraj temple instance. Upon going through the Scarab Wall gate in southern Silithus, follow the path to the right to the instance portal.\nLoot.\nThe loot in AQ40 comes from:\nLoot-quest system.\nTemple of Ahn'Qiraj uses a Loot-quest system like &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers must collect ten scarab items of a certain type, two stone idols of a certain type, and a single Qiraji item. When a player has the appropriate collection for a particular item and a certain level of reputation with the Brood of Nozdormu, they can turn them in for the item. \nThe idols and scarabs can be found on mobs within the instance and in Greater Scarab Coffers, which can be opened with Greater Scarab Coffer Keys, which are White quality, not soulbound and as of 1.10 no longer zone-bound.\nSee: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20quest%20loot\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj quest loot&lt;/a&gt; for a full list."}

The temple welcomes &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; exiles who seek sanctuary from the dangers of Vol'dun. Through a sacred ritual, Akunda enters the minds of his followers and removes the memories that cause them pain. His followers then all rename themselves Akunda and start a new life at the temple. Immediately northwest of the temple lies the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Spring\"&gt;Eternal Spring&lt;/a&gt;. Akunda's power over storms allows the spring to never run empty, ensuring that his followers never know thirst. &lt;a href=\"Redrock%20Mesa\"&gt;Redrock Mesa&lt;/a&gt; stretches north of the temple toward the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Valley of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, where Akunda stores the unwanted painful memories he takes from his followers.\n&lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorak\"&gt;Jorak&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; travel to the temple in search of the missing &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt;.

Meijani and the adventurer eventually discover that Akunda the Exalted poisoned the Eternal Spring, stole Akunda's own memories from him, and used the loa's power to wipe the minds of his followers. With the help of Akunda's powers of the storm, the adventurer kills Akunda the Exalted, freeing the loa and allowing him to restore the memories of his followers. Following this, all of the trolls at the temple abandon the name \"Akunda\" and resume their true names, while Kaja, Meerah, the adventurer, and the restored Rakera continue their journey to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt;."}

Believing that this was the intended site for Hakkar's reentry into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the great &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; sunk the temple into the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. However, this actually helped the Atal'ai by ensuring their efforts to summon Hakkar went on undisturbed.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nOver a thousand years ago, the powerful &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart by a massive civil war. An influential group of &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, known as the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to bring back an ancient blood god named &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Though the priests were defeated and ultimately exiled, the great troll empire buckled in upon itself. The exiled priests fled far to the north, into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. There they erected a great temple to Hakkar - where they could prepare for his arrival into the physical world. The great &lt;a href=\"dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, learned of the Atal'ai's plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's drowned ruins are guarded by the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s who prevent anyone from getting in or out. However, it is believed that some of the fanatical Atal'ai may have survived Ysera's wrath - and recommitted themselves to the dark service of Hakkar.\nModern times.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marvon%20Rivetseeker\"&gt;Marvon Rivetseeker&lt;/a&gt; entered the temple and barely escaped. &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; was also interested in its tablets, and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; sent a group of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to investigate the strange happenings at the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.\nThe green dragon watch was subtly being affected by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. The descendants of the Atal'ai trolls returned to the Sunken Temple and found its guardians disoriented and vulnerable. Both the Nightmare and trolls dragged the dragons down into the depths of madness and corruption. In firm control of the temple, the Atal'ai began their gruesome rituals to summon Hakkar into Azeroth again. &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Itharius&lt;/a&gt; asked the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; for help, and they sent an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; force to cleanse the temple. These champions slaughtered many Atal'ai adherents and put an end to their rituals. The &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lelior\"&gt;Lelior&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ciarin\"&gt;Ciarin&lt;/a&gt; once fought against Atal'ai priests, and it might have been during the Alliance raid.\nWalkthrough.\nEntering the dungeon.\nSwim through the flooded depths of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Hall\"&gt;Broken Hall&lt;/a&gt;, then follow the passageway to the right to find the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Masks\"&gt;Hall of Masks&lt;/a&gt;. The instance portal is here. In the passageway outside this room, the hallway proceeds to the left and the right. To the right, it goes down to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Chamber of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. To the left is &lt;a href=\"The%20Butchery\"&gt;The Butchery&lt;/a&gt;. Proceeding through the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20the%20Caller\"&gt;Den of the Caller&lt;/a&gt;, to the left through the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Ritual\"&gt;Hall of Ritual&lt;/a&gt;, then down, you will find the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Hall of Bones&lt;/a&gt;.

The whole room must be cleared before engaging the boss, or they will join in the fight. These packs may fear, so pull them into a corner. Each of these mobs, when killed, will create an aggressive spirit that is immune to all damage and abilities; however each will die automatically after a few seconds. These spirits have very high melee damage, so move away from them until they disappear. After clearing the entire room, you can take on &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ogom%20the%20Wretched\"&gt;Ogom the Wretched&lt;/a&gt;. Kill Jammal'an first, as he has the ability to turn one party member against the rest.\nWardens of the Dream.\nBefore awakening the final boss, you'll have to defeat his children, four large green dragons. If not killed, they will join the fight later on. First, take out &lt;a href=\"Dreamscythe\"&gt;Dreamscythe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weaver\"&gt;Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, pulling them back to a spot away from other dragonkin. Keep these drakes turned away from the group, as they have acid spit that can spread across all five members. Through hallway to the south, the final boss is protected by two more large drakes, &lt;a href=\"Hazzas\"&gt;Hazzas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morphaz\"&gt;Morphaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dreamer.\n&lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; is sitting alone in a large room. Simply tank Shade like any other dragon, to one side so melee DPS is standing at his stomach and ranged is safely away from his face and tail. This fight may be tricky as the boss casts two stuns. The first, Deep Slumber, makes the target invulnerable and stunned for 8 seconds. The second is &lt;a href=\"War%20Stomp\"&gt;War Stomp&lt;/a&gt; which will stun all enemies in melee range for 4 seconds. When the tank becomes stunned, it is helpful for a melee to taunt or to take aggro on the boss so he does not destroy the rest of the group.\nAvatar of Hakkar.\nThe Avatar of Hakkar is an optional boss which may be taken in any order the party wishes. A party member must have the &lt;a href=\"Egg%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Egg of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; to summon this boss, from the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Blood%20God%20Hakkar\"&gt;The Blood God Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. After completion of this quest, the player keeps the egg, so that the Avatar may be summoned in the future any number of times. Head to the west wing of the dungeon, known as the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Fallen%20God\"&gt;Sanctum of the Fallen God&lt;/a&gt;. Click the Shrine of the Soulflayer to summon the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Avatar of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. Once summoned, gates at each side of the room will fall, and remain until the boss is killed.\nIn the RPG.\nThe area is known as the Lost Temple. This temple is located underneath the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, where the monsters are the thickest. Also known as the Sunken Temple, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s built it many centuries ago, using it to focus demonic arcane magic. They fell to its corrupting influences and since the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has taken over the area. They are attempting to cleanse the temple, but the dragons frequently fail and lose some of their number in the attempt. Now they see it as their duty to guard the temple from others who may be controlled by the power inside.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s have explored this area while keeping clear of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s on watch. Some were even able to question surreptitiously the less intelligent of the green dragons and pull some information about the area from them. Long ago, the trolls here attempted to summon and control &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, an old god of theirs. &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus the Green&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful dragon, was sent in to contain Hakkar's evil and cleanse the temple. Although he sunk the temple below the waters, over time Eranikus went crazy. That's the story, anyway, but no one has come close enough to the temple to verify it."}
