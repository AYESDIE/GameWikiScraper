Recognized in PvP situations such as arenas, this maneuver is often necessary to reduce to uptime of a specific threat such as a healer. In a situation like this, taking down the healer is of upmost importance because chances are a victory will be impossible with constant heals supporting other members of his or her team. So an effective tactic is to CC the other teammates and focus all damage and forms of CC on the healer until he or she is killed. Although Focus Fire is a well known term in PvP, there are countless examples of it being a required method to successfully complete an encounter in a PvE scenario. In some cases, a specific add spawning or receiving a particularly dangerous buff will require the raids damage to be focused on the target until the buff is removed or the target is dead (i.e. Overcharged Tempest Minions in the Emalon encounter in Vault of Archavon). Also, many raid bosses have a soft enrage timer in which the raid must perform actions to increase their damage output such as Heroism/Bloodlust to kill the boss before it enrages and kills them. Few encounters have multiple adds to worry about during the chance of an enrage; however, chances are that Focus Fire will be necessary to successfully complete the encounters that do have this mechanic (i.e. Heroic Lady Deathwhisper).\nFocus Fire frequently refers to damaging a target until something has been achieved (such as bringing it to a certain percent, removing a buff, killing it, etc); however, the tactic applys to more than just damage. It can be broken down into different categories which may make the term easier to understand."}

The focus may be used jointly with the manual targeting system to manage targets and coordinate attacks or heals. The focus also acts as sort of \"target memory\" meaning that the focus can be set then recalled, either by &lt;a href=\"hotkey\"&gt;hotkey&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Focus Unit Frame.\nWhenever a player has a focus, the user interface creates a new &lt;a href=\"Unit%20frame\"&gt;Unit Frame&lt;/a&gt; for the focus. The Unit Frame, unlike some other unit frames, when unlocked, may be moved to any desirable position on the screen. Additionally, to make it stand out further, there is an interface option to have a smaller frame for the focus. \nThe user interface treats the focus as if it were a party unit frame in nearly all respects. This means that it supplies full real-time updates for the currently stored focus, including health and mana updates and &lt;a href=\"casting%20bar\"&gt;casting bar&lt;/a&gt;s. It may also show the focus' target and potentially their casting bar. It may be accessed with a mouse-click, hotkey, or macro. In the default user interface, the target unit frame will be highlighted in white if it is also the focus.\nHow to Set the Focus.\nBy Hotkey.\nFirst, you have to set the Set Focus key in the Customize Keys menu. Then you simply have to target a character and press the key that you have assigned.\nBy Console or Macro.\ncodice_1 - Set the current target as the focus.\nHow to Get the Focus.\nBy Mouse.\nSimply click on the Focus &lt;a href=\"Unit%20frame\"&gt;Unit Frame&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy Hotkey.\nFirst, you have to set the Target Focus key in the Customize Keys menu. Then you simply have to press the key that you have assigned.\nBy Console or Macro.\ncodice_2 - Targets the current focus.\nUsing the Focus Target.\nThe Focus may be used for a variety of purposes depending on how it is implemented in the player's user interface.\nIn &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s, \"focus\" works as a generic unit name in macros, similar to \"player\", \"target\", or \"pet\". This means it can be passed to UI functions that take a unit name, or used in modifiers in macros. For example codice_3 would attempt to cast &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; on the focus. A mage using this macro simply has to set his focus to the mob he wants to sheep, and can re-sheep with one button without having to manually click the mob again.\nSome additional notes:"}

Because of this, Focused Aim has limited value for hunters who have a lot of hit rating on their gear, as they are likely to reach the point where they cannot miss even without this talent (see &lt;a href=\"hit%20cap\"&gt;hit cap&lt;/a&gt; for more information)."}

It is an upgraded model of the &lt;a href=\"Foe%20Reaper%204000\"&gt;Foe Reaper 4000&lt;/a&gt; golem that can be found roaming &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Defias engineers have spent many long days perfecting a new harvester model based on the Foe Reaper 4000 unit. Once it is completed, the brotherhood believes this mechanized terror will be able to slice through &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s armored soldiers like a scythe through wheat.\"\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt;s, it seems the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reconstructed%20Fel%20Reaper%205000\"&gt;reconstructed&lt;/a&gt; it.\nIn , its remains are found at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Foundry\"&gt;Goblin Foundry&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nFoe Reaper 5000 will occasionally cast Overdrive. This works a bit like &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Marrowgar\"&gt;Lord Marrowgar&lt;/a&gt;'s Bone Storm: It runs to a random position while dealing AoE damage. It will also cast Harvest, which works somewhat similarly to &lt;a href=\"Ick\"&gt;Ick&lt;/a&gt;'s Pursuit. It will target a random unit (who may or may not be the tank), wind up a five-second cast, and start running to that player's location when the cast is complete. The Foe Reaper will do some damage to units between its location and the marked spot on the ground. Any players at the marked location when the Foe Reaper gets there will take large amounts of damage, so run away! Melee DPS should stay behind the boss to avoid Reaper Strike. At roughly 40% health, the Foe Reaper will enrage, gaining &lt;a href=\"Safety%20Restrictions%20Off-Line\"&gt;Safety Restrictions Off-Line&lt;/a&gt;, which increases its damage dealt by 100%\nHeroic Mode.\nThe boss should be tanked to the near top of the ramp, so that casters can DPS him from a range. Before you start this fight, one of the DPS should control the &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20Reaper\"&gt;Prototype Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, which is at the top of the room. The one inside the reaper then must stay at the bottom of the ramp during the boss fight and stay aggroing the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Slag\"&gt;Molten Slag&lt;/a&gt;s that appear. The best rotation to do this is Reaper Strike, Reaper Strike, Reaper Charge, that way the mobs are always stunned and you have a good amount of energy. If no one goes in the reaper, the adds will climb to the top of the ramp and start dealing massive AoE damage to the party and it will be hard not to wipe. If you want, you can keep the reaper at mid-way up the ramp so that he can tank the adds while occasionally dealing some damage to the boss. It is not necessary to kill the adds before the boss dies."}

The gray areas covered by Fog of War indicate certain parts of the map that have been explored at some point during the game but only the terrain and any buildings standing at the time are known in these locations. Any units or newly placed buildings may still be hidden in the Fog of War area since the last time it was explored there. To reveal any new units or buildings, the player must once again explore the areas covered by Fog of War.\nFog of War is different from areas of the map which remain unexplored and are represented by a blackened shroud.\nIn Warcraft II.\nThe Fog of War covers everything that is not within the sight range of units or buildings. When viewing the map, black areas have not yet been explored, while grayed areas have been explored but are not currently within sight range of owned or allied units or buildings. Although terrain can be seen through the grayed areas, enemy troop movements are hidden.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn ' and ', the Fog of War is affected by the Day and Night cycle that exists in-game.\nThe Day/Night Cycle affects the sight range of units and buildings. Units and buildings see more during the day and less at night. This makes scouting during the day and troop movement during the night ideal. The Night Elves can research &lt;a href=\"Ultravision\"&gt;Ultravision&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to see just as well during the Night.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nNew tech was created for the &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%20%28Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20tactics%29\"&gt;Kil'jaeden Tomb of Sargeras encounter&lt;/a&gt;, called Fog of War internally. The players have limited vision so they have to use the help of their allies to make their way through that phase.\nFog of War later arrived as part of &lt;a href=\"Island%20expedition\"&gt;Island expedition&lt;/a&gt;s. The mechanic allowed for teams of three players to compete at PvE objectives, with reduced awareness of the other team's progress across the map until they came upon each other."}

This, in turn, created a schism within the Fogsail Freebooters with those &lt;a href=\"Rhenik%20Loyalist\"&gt;agreeing&lt;/a&gt; with their captain and those who sought their freedom above all else. During this time, First Mate Owings came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Ty%27jin\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Ty'jin&lt;/a&gt; who sought to establish a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; outpost within &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;. The pair entered into an agreement with each other, Owings would allow the Horde use of Plunder Harbor on the condition that they aided her overthrowing Rhenik.\nAfter tensions among the pirates were stroked, the Fogsail Freebooters descended into a civil war. Amidst the fighting, &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Killian\"&gt;Quartermaster Killian&lt;/a&gt; sided with Owings, &lt;a href=\"Boatswain%20Taryn\"&gt;Boatswain Taryn&lt;/a&gt; with Rhenik, and &lt;a href=\"Navigator%20Swink\"&gt;Navigator Swink&lt;/a&gt;'s sheer refusal to work with the Horde caused him to attack the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Honorbound\"&gt;Honorbound&lt;/a&gt;, Owings's forces prevailed and Captain Rhenik was killed. With his death Owings emerged as the new leader of the Fogsail Freebooters and opened Plunder Harbor up for Horde usage.\nAs part of a gambit to claim the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20M.%20Valentine\"&gt;word&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde was in possession of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;her son's corpse&lt;/a&gt; which was located at Plunder Harbor. The Kul Tirans subsequently attacked the harbor causing the Fogsail Freebooters to fight to defend their home and freedom. After the Abyssal Scepter was acquired by the Speaker of the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;, the Scepter was used against the Kul Tiran forces which ended the siege of Plunder Harbor and ensured the continued freedom of the Fogsail Freebooters.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Faction Assault on Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, the Fogsail Freebooters aided their Horde allies in striking against the Alliance."}

The command is typed as \"/follow\", \"/fol\" or simply \"/f\", followed by the name of the intended target. If no name is provided, the current target will be followed.\nTact.\nThis is a very useful thing to have in the game, as it lets a player keep up with a group as they go &lt;a href=\"AFK\"&gt;AFK&lt;/a&gt;, etc. However it should be used sparingly and not simply for a free tow on strangers whenever you are feeling lazy.\nPet command.\nFollow is a &lt;a href=\"Pet_Commands\"&gt;pet command&lt;/a&gt;. The two pet movement commands Follow and &lt;a href=\"Move%20To\"&gt;Move To&lt;/a&gt; are mutually exclusive, and one is always active on a pet at any given time. Follow is the normal mode for pets, and is switched on by default. \nOutside of combat, a pet set to Follow will stay close to its master, and follow it as it moves. Giving the Follow command to a pet currently set to Move To will cause it to return to its master. Pets set to Follow will still follow normal behaviour rules set by their stance (&lt;a href=\"Assist\"&gt;Assist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defensive\"&gt;Defensive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Passive\"&gt;Passive&lt;/a&gt;) and respond to the &lt;a href=\"Attack\"&gt;Attack&lt;/a&gt; command; after combat ends they will return to their master and resume following. Mounting automatically sets pets to Follow, although the icon is de-illuminated while mounted."}

The cave system was dug out by the Briarback, but it has been taken over by lichen. Five &lt;a href=\"Stormcap%20Warrior\"&gt;Stormcap Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are guarding a &lt;a href=\"Lichen-Covered%20Chest\"&gt;Lichen-Covered Chest&lt;/a&gt; at in the bottom of the cave.

{"id": "14524", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14524", "title": "Food", "text": "Food is a type of &lt;a href=\"consumable\"&gt;consumable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; that can be eaten, either by a &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; or by a &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pet&lt;/a&gt;. There are several types of food, and hundreds of different foods. Food is mainly consumed to restore &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, although it may also be used to restore &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; or grant &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s. Food may be bought, created by &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooks&lt;/a&gt;, fished by &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Refreshment\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, and is frequently found as &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s, getting enough food to feed their soldiers was a priority for the various participating commanders. Without an adequate supply of &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;, new soldiers couldn't be deployed.\n&lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Meat\"&gt;Kor'kron Meat&lt;/a&gt; was a cornerstone of the conflict between &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; loyalists and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse of food.\nEating.\nThe main use of food is for player characters to consume it, restoring &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; over a period of time. Some foods may also restore &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, and/or grant various temporary &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s if enough time is spent eating. Players frequently use food to restore health and/or mana between encounters, especially if their class is unable to self-heal. Food is also used before encounters (especially in end-game &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raiding&lt;/a&gt;) to gain useful buffs. Eating is generally unnecessary at lower levels, as low level players and their pets recover health and mana quickly without eating.\nYou eat food by 'using' it - right clicking on it. This will cause your character to sit down (you must be seated in order to eat or drink), consuming one charge of the stack of food items (most, but not all, food has one charge per food item) to grant the player an 'eating' buff with an appropriate duration. This buff will restore your health over a specified time period, during which you must remain seated and cannot engage in most other activities. Moving, standing up or using abilities will remove the buff, cancelling the consumption of the food. \nYou can eat and drink at the same time (&lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;s are similar to food, but restore &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; rather than health). You can eat additional food while seated, but will only be in the process of eating the last food item eaten; the previous ones are lost, so it is best to wait for the eating timer to run out. However, attempting to eat food that has lesser amounts of heals than the food currently being consumed will result in a failure to eat the new food. This can be avoided by either right clicking on the Eating icon on the top of the screen (just as cancelling a buff) or simply moving (which automatically makes the player stops eating).\nSome foods in addition to their restorative properties also provide various &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s for a short period of time (typically 5\u201315 minutes from pre-Burning Crusade foods, 30 min from Outland food, and 60 min from food from WotLK and beyond). The most common food buff you will encounter early in the game is a slight increase to &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;. Later, there are foods that buff other stats as well. Foods that buff key stats are generally in high demand. In order to receive the buff, you must remain seated during most of the food timer for that food item, until you see the buff appear. These are called '&lt;a href=\"Well%20Fed\"&gt;Well Fed&lt;/a&gt; buffs'. They do not stack; you can have only one at a time. Buff foods are primarily cooked foods.\nThe restorative power of the food increases with item level. Across the vended samples, the food type does not matter; they all have the same restorative power at a given level. Player characters can eat food of a much lower level, but derive less benefit. The benefits are scaled to provide restorative effect comparable to the scale of the health of characters at that level. The presence of a buff does not correlate specifically to an increase in level, but higher level foods that have a buff will provide better buffs. The buffs are scaled to provide stat increases comparable to how bonuses on equipment scale.\nFeeding your pet.\nUpon completing the pet taming quest sequence which becomes available at level 10 (taming three specific beast mobs, varies by racial trainer), &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s receive the ability to tame pets and receive a final quest in the sequence to see another hunter trainer. The final trainer grants a couple of pet related abilities, including the ability to feed your pet. \nYou &lt;a href=\"Feed%20Pet\"&gt;feed your active pet&lt;/a&gt; by dragging the food item out of the bag slot toward the pet's mouth. Food restores the health of the pet (less important at lower levels). Feeding a pet requires much less time than eating. \nHunter pets generally need food of around their level. Down to a food item level 9 levels below the pet's level, the pet gets full satisfaction from the food. Food of an even lower item level provides diminishing pet satisfaction, about half lost (multiplicative) each 10 levels. If the food's item level is too low, 30 levels less than the pet's level, they will refuse to eat it. Unlike player characters, pets can consume food of a much higher level than they are, but they get no additional satisfaction out of it, the (rather costly) extra levels are wasted.\nPet treats.\n&lt;a href=\"Kibler%27s%20Bits\"&gt;Kibler's Bits&lt;/a&gt; are food for hunter pets, but are used differently than 'feeding your pet' and to different ends. Pet treats are \"used\" (by right clicking), just like you would eat food.\nTypes of food.\nThere are six main types of food: &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;. It is not always clear which type of food a food item is. The food type is not explicitly stated in the item tooltip. The best indication is the item name and the graphic icon representing the item, then using common sense to figure out which food category a food item belongs to. If the item is vended, the type of vendor often explicitly states the food type, but this is not generally true for seasonal items. Beyond that, it boils down to trial and error.\nFor meat and fish, there is also a distinction between food that is ready to eat, which is a consumable, and food ingredients, using in &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; food, which are trade goods. Player characters can only eat consumable food, but hunter pets can often eat food ingredients. \nFood ingredients are merely trade items with little description. Consumable food will have a description of the food benefits in the item tooltip, clearly indicating consumable food status, and will appear in the consumables, food and drink section when browsing the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. Food ingredients will appear in the trade goods, meat section when browsing the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. This includes eggs and fish ingredients. \nSome ingredient fish is consumable as food by a player character even though it is an ingredient, not a consumable. It will have a consumable style tooltip, will typically have the name Raw Fish-name, and will have less restorative power than its cooked counterpart.\nSome food consumable by a player character will not satisfy any pet. There appears to be an additional category of untyped food. Some food ingredients appear to no longer satisfy pets when cooked into a consumable food item (whose type is not as clear). You may experience this with soup and stew items. &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Herb\"&gt;Healing Herb&lt;/a&gt;, a quest reward, appears to be an example. Various kinds of &lt;a href=\"candy\"&gt;candy&lt;/a&gt;, frequently acquired during &lt;a href=\"event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;s, appear to work like this. \nSome inventory items are 'food' and use food graphics for their icon, but are not food in the game. These will usually be quest items. Many of the beginning quests are a 'hunt for food' quest that use this type of object. (Similarly, many of the beginning quests are a 'hunt for hides' quest that use hides that are not leather trade goods items.) There are meat and fish &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;s in the game, and there are food &lt;a href=\"vendor%20trash\"&gt;vendor trash&lt;/a&gt; items as well, although, see 'Raw food types' below.\nThere are also non-food items, such as &lt;a href=\"trophy%20fish\"&gt;trophy fish&lt;/a&gt;es, which can be used as pet food, so the boundaries are not always distinct.\nThere are also items, such as the &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Fish\"&gt;Deviate Fish&lt;/a&gt;, that can be 'used' (presumably ingested) that are not food in any other way, acting more like a potion. These do not require the sitting and remain seated process and any buffs they confer are not 'well fed' buffs (and thus can be applied in addition to a well fed buff).\nRaw food types.\n&lt;a href=\"Raw%20food%20types\"&gt;Raw food types&lt;/a&gt; were removed in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;.\nRequired level.\nAll food has a required level, and players below this level cannot consume it. A food's required level is generally correlated with the overall properties and benefit of the item; the 'power' of the item. \nEach food item also has an &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;. The vended food items are a basic framework for all other food items. For edible food items, there are eight basic increments of item level from 5 to 75 in steps of 10. These can be consumed by player characters ten levels lower that the item level or above (obviously, the minimum is character level 1). The six basic food types are represented by one vended example of each food item level, (with seasonal additions that do not change the basic structure.) Food items are not tied to these specific levels, but will follow the overall rough progression of this framework. \nThere are also foods that restore a \"percentage\" of the character's health and/or mana. All characters will derive the same percentage benefit from consuming these foods, although these with larger health and/or mana pools will gain a larger actual amount. These foods can therefore be consumed by characters of any level, as opposed to most foods which become far less useful once the character is above a certain level. &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Fruit\"&gt;Harvest Fruit&lt;/a&gt; is an example.\nSources of food.\nFood can easily be purchased from &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s, which appear on your &lt;a href=\"minimap\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt; as a bread/milk icon () when using the tracking feature. The food vendors are well distributed and very common, for instance all &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;s have food for sale, but finding the specific food type vendor when you need it for your pet can be a pain. &lt;a href=\"Gorilla\"&gt;Gorilla&lt;/a&gt;s eat only fruit and fungus, for example, and you may be hard pressed to find the vendors. Vended foods are always of the consumable type, so the vended fish is always the cooked version.\nFood items can be received as &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; rewards. These are helpful, but limited; if you use a lot of food (hunters) you will need other sources. These are often the same item as a vended food.\nConsumable food and food ingredients are frequently dropped as &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. \nYou can often find edible food in &lt;a href=\"Chest%20%28container%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. These will be of any food type. These are often the same item as a vended food.\nFood can be made by player characters using the &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; profession, a secondary &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; that all player characters can learn (it does not count against their primary profession limit). Cooking will make food ingredients that are inedible by player characters into consumable food products. Often, higher level recipes will use similar ingredients and produce better quality food. Many fish can be eaten raw but have better food properties when cooked. Buffing food is primarily made by cooking. The food in demand by players for their characters, as opposed to pets, is invariably cooked food or a hard to find food ingredient used to make the food they want to cook. Pets can eat cooked food of the proper type, but do not get the benefit of the increased stats.\nFish can be obtained by &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. You should be able to keep yourself supplied with fish if you need it, and you should be able to purchase other players' surplus fish at the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. This makes feeding fish-eating pets easy as well. \n&lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s can conjure food which restores both health and mana. The required level of the food and its restorative value correspond roughly to the level of the mage, with new and more powerful refreshments every few levels. Conjured food is mostly the same as other food during play but cannot be sold on the auction house nor to vendors and as a &lt;a href=\"conjured%20item\"&gt;conjured item&lt;/a&gt; disappears if you log out for 15 minutes. Creating food consumes mana, so plan ahead and ask for food before the battle starts and mana becomes a critical resource. Conjured bread can be used to feed bread-eating pets.\nAchievements.\nThere are numerous &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s associated with food:\nHoliday events usually have achievements that involve eating some food related to that holiday, either consuming all the different varieties available (such as candies and chocolates during &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt;), or consuming large amounts of one kind of food (such as &lt;a href=\"Noblegarden%20Chocolate\"&gt;Noblegarden Chocolate&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Noblegarden\"&gt;Noblegarden&lt;/a&gt;). Note that the latter type of achievement may not be possible in one sitting, even if you have enough food, as consuming enough food items in rapid succession will eventually result in an error message informing the player that the character is too full to eat any more. More research is needed to determine how long this condition takes to wear off."}

The souls were obtained by ritual sacrifice. There are two varieties, one resembling &lt;a href=\"revenant\"&gt;revenant&lt;/a&gt;s and one that is a taller humanoid shape. The drust constructs are made from the land, and their hearts are a runic power core. Unless the magic in the core is disrupted, more constructs will be created around the dark hearts. Stone cairns empower the constructs.\nWhen the Drust were first learning to attach souls into constructs, they used the bones of their dead as hosts. As the Drust became more skilled at trapping souls within objects, so did they become more adept at creating constructs of death in which to trap the souls. Revenants are amongst the fiercest of these creatures. Their bodies constructed from pieces that can no longer decompose, these creatures never tire and will hunt their prey for all eternity.\nIn the modern day, the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;'s magic awakened the slumbering constructs.\nThe most powerful one is the &lt;a href=\"Hailstone%20Construct\"&gt;Hailstone Construct&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"world%20boss\"&gt;world boss&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is in some ways a continuation of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Drust\"&gt;war against the Drust&lt;/a&gt; around 2,700 years earlier.\nThe conflict.\nPrelude.\nWaycrest Manor.\nThe Waycrests had long ago wiped out the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, but could not destroy their king &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;. For countless years he waited to enact his vengeance, until &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; provided the means.\nIt all started after Lord and Lady Waycrest stopped interacting with their subjects for two weeks. Rumors began spreading around that &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arthur Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; came under a deadly illness and a grief-stricken &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Meredith Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; locked herself inside his chambers. Solicitors and guards when in and out of the manor with no heed to the civilians. During their absence, a strange occurrence started to occur. Many young girls from &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Corlain\"&gt;Upper Corlain&lt;/a&gt; started going towards the Manor and returning back to their homes for a number of times. Stricken with grief due to her ailing husband, Lady Waycrest called out to any power that could save him. &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; answered her cry and promised that death would never part the couple, for a price.\nAfter sometime, Meredith would emerge from the Manor. She calmed the villagers and assured them that the king is in good health and took control of the guardsmen for the time being. Some villagers found this odd as she never wielded this kind of power, but they didn't think too much of it.\nThe Fall of Corlain.\nThings in Corlain would only get worse from here. Girls of all ages were joining the Coven and they themselves recruited more citizens. The men of the village were also placed under a spell, rendering unable to act. Soon, all the girls of the Coven started wearing wicker charm as their numbers grew. Soon after, the first disappearance happened, a stable hand named &lt;a href=\"Jon\"&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rest of the villagers knew something was up with the third disappearance, a man named &lt;a href=\"Knowlton\"&gt;Knowlton&lt;/a&gt;. Knowlton was the one who witnessed the first victim, Jon, being dragged on a cart. At first, the guards kept insisting that all was fine but then they all went silent. Soon after, the Coven unleashed their wicker men on the streets. Standing side by side, they killed every villager they came across. Abandoning their homes, those villagers that managed to escape regrouped back at &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfiltrating Arom's Stand.\nWith Corlain having finally fallen, the witches send their agents to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Corlain%20Refugee\"&gt;Corlain Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Littlefield\"&gt;Sister Littlefield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unmasked%20Witch\"&gt;undercover witches&lt;/a&gt; started placing grimoires in hopes of recruiting new hosts.\nThe end of Watchman's Rise.\nWith the Coven growing in power, the &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Guard\"&gt;Waycrest Guard&lt;/a&gt; would eventually notice the ongoing at &lt;a href=\"Corlain\"&gt;Corlain&lt;/a&gt;. To slow them down, they sent &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Adela\"&gt;Sister Adela&lt;/a&gt;. Adela was able to hex the soldiers at &lt;a href=\"Watchman%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Watchman's Rise&lt;/a&gt; and take the tower for the Coven.\nThe siege of Falconhurst.\n&lt;a href=\"Falconhurst\"&gt;Falconhurst&lt;/a&gt; would be the next target. From the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the witches crafted large wicker men and sent them all to &lt;a href=\"Falconhurst\"&gt;Falconhurst&lt;/a&gt;. Under &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Noella%20Briarwood\"&gt;Sister Noella Briarwood&lt;/a&gt; the wicker men charged in, overwhelming the defenders and forcing them to retreat to the harbor. As the village burned, they barricaded themselves to try and push them back.\nGoodspeed's betrayal.\nA branch of the &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Guard\"&gt;Waycrest Guard&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Goodspeed%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Goodspeed's Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Goodspeed\"&gt;Captain Goodspeed&lt;/a&gt;, these men protected the land from the heights of &lt;a href=\"Pikeman%27s%20Ridge\"&gt;Pikeman's Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. When the Coven offered power to Captain Goodspeed, he immediately accepted their offer and was one of the few men who betrayed the Waycrest Guard by his own free will.\nThe Bleak Hills Mine infestation.\nTo increase their influence, the Coven placed a curse on the &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Hills%20Mine\"&gt;Bleak Hills Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Their curse forced a large number of spiders to take the mine and kill the miners for sustenance. &lt;a href=\"Elsie%20Wright\"&gt;Elsie Wright&lt;/a&gt;, a foreman, was the only one to managed to escape.\nThe takeover of Fletcher's Hollow.\nBefore the Coven came to Fletcher's Hollow, the local miners had uncovered an ancient tomb, presumably belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown whether the miners knew what they found, but the Coven did. Hidden without warning, &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Levae\"&gt;Matron Levae&lt;/a&gt; and her followers made their way into the mine in hopes of finding some relics to help in their rituals. They sealed themselves inside and place a barrier on the mine. Any outside who tried to enter would be killed immediately.\nInside the mine, they started to a large army of wicker men, ready to unleash upon the town. When they least expected it, the villagers were ambushed by the sudden attack. The mayor Evelyn Pare tied to fend them off but to no avail.\nWith no way of saving the town, the villagers led by the mayor escaped to the surrounding areas. Evelyn and her men build their defenses on a hill and hold the wicker men off from all sides. The rest of the villagers are scattered, fending off the wicker men on their own.\nThe slaughter at Glenbrook.\nThe town of Glenbrook was run by &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Striggs\"&gt;Mayor Striggs&lt;/a&gt;. When the Coven appeared, they attracted the attention of a woman named &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Hayes\"&gt;Mary Hayes&lt;/a&gt;. Having an addiction to power, Mary joined their cause and started to recruit other females, such as &lt;a href=\"Abby%20Lewis\"&gt;Abby Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they would lure the other villagers and slaughter them one by one. Eventually, they decided that Glenbrook was finished. Before leaving to join their sisters, the women cursed the nearby wolves which forced them to rush the village and kill anyone they came in contact with.\nDamning the dead.\nThe Coven now set their eyes on the dead of &lt;a href=\"Barrowknoll%20Cemetery\"&gt;Barrowknoll Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Westwood\"&gt;Sister Westwood&lt;/a&gt; the witch was sent here to corrupts the spirits who have long earned. The witch bound them to her magic in order to increase her power, turning them from peaceful dead to aggressive spirits, rendering any outsider from visiting the cemetery. The ones she would worthy were bound in a &lt;a href=\"wicker%20man\"&gt;wicker man&lt;/a&gt;, trapped in a pile of wood to her service. One of the spirits to succumb to such a fate was &lt;a href=\"Bridget%20Fairwater\"&gt;Bridget Fairwater&lt;/a&gt;.\nReanimation at Gol Koval.\nAfter millennia of peace in the old ruins. &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;Drust construct&lt;/a&gt; started to reappear from nowhere, making the area hazardous for the local hunters. &lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Hale\"&gt;Rebecca Hale&lt;/a&gt; was the only one who managed to escape.\nReanimation at Gol Osigr.\nIn another area, &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Osigr\"&gt;Gol Osigr&lt;/a&gt;, Drust constructs were also seen rising again. However, this time it also brought the spirit of dead warriors from the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Drust\"&gt;war against the Drust&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cult of Autumnvale.\nWhile it is unknown how it began, it is certain that it had something to do with a &lt;a href=\"Wicker%20Man\"&gt;Wicker Man&lt;/a&gt;. A human by the name of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Autumnvale\"&gt;Lord Autumnvale&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the Wicker Man and was soon followed by other followers. Eventually more and more humans abandoned their human homes and joined in the worship of the Wicker Man. Their rituals involve offering tributes to the Wicker Man or sacrifices. Any follower of the Wicker Man can be chosen to be sacrificed to it.\nThe cursed of Carver's Harbor.\nAn unknown witch slipped into &lt;a href=\"Carver%27s%20Harbor\"&gt;Carver's Harbor&lt;/a&gt; without anyone noticing. She placed an &lt;a href=\"Pig%20Effigy\"&gt;pig effigy&lt;/a&gt; inside one of the buildings and cast her curse on the local butcher by turning them all into pigs. She then cast a spell on the great butcher &lt;a href=\"Roland%20Hacksaw\"&gt;Roland Hacksaw&lt;/a&gt;, forcing him to continue making pigs into sausages. The culprit left the scene, leaving behind &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker construct&lt;/a&gt;s to guard the area. All the humans that were turned into pigs were tied up in hopes that Roland would make them into sausages.\nLost contact in Fallhaven.\n&lt;a href=\"Helena%20Gentle\"&gt;Helena Gentle&lt;/a&gt; would be the last witch to extend the reach of the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;, by traveling all the way to &lt;a href=\"Fallhaven\"&gt;Fallhaven&lt;/a&gt;. Presenting herself as a kind old lady, she took residence on the hill nearby. Her first interaction was with &lt;a href=\"Griffith%20Shelvey\"&gt;Griffith Shelvey&lt;/a&gt; who gave him plant scraps to feed to his pigs. The plant scraps made the pigs aggressive, making it hard for Griffith to provide his shipment of sausages. &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Odell\"&gt;Tom Odell&lt;/a&gt; started to approach her every night, most likely to ask her for help with his daily choirs. When no one was looking, Helena interacted with the local farms and cursed them, forcing an endless breed of blightflies to inexact and kill the crops. She also started to place cursed charms around the village. At this point, &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Levy\"&gt;some of the villagers&lt;/a&gt; started to suspect her of foul doing. The news of the village being cursed has spread to the mayor to which he decided to do something about it.\nFearful of the happenings around, &lt;a href=\"Cyril%20White\"&gt;Cyril White&lt;/a&gt; set up a curfew that tells villagers to get back home by sunset. He wrote it down on a piece of paper and went outside to place it on the local billboard. At the same time, Helena set up a &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Effigy\"&gt;Cursed Effigy&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of town. As Cyril started to hammer the new notice, Helena finished casting her spell. Before they all knew it, Helena activated the effigy and they all got frozen in place. Time would go on but they would not move. This would be the last time anyone would ever hear from the village. Helena would retreat back to her residence.\nPresent day.\nA witch hunt in Fallhaven.\nA representative of the Alliance is sent to investigate the disappearance of Fallhaven. Arriving in town, the adventurer finds Cyril White and all the other citizens frozen in place. Noticing the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Effigy\"&gt;Cursed Effigy&lt;/a&gt;, he tried to break it but to no avail. He realized that the effigy was protected by dark magic and would not break it with brute force. Seeking to find more information on how to deal with this threat, the adventurer searched around town. He found several ledgers, all hinting towards the kind woman that arrived all of sudden and how everything went south. Deciding to take matters into his own hands, the adventurer decides to go and search for this woman.\nArriving at the top of the hill, he was greeted by an old lady. Her name was &lt;a href=\"Helena%20Gentle\"&gt;Helena Gentle&lt;/a&gt; and she greeted the visitor with open arms. She agreed to tell everything she knew about the goings-on at Fallhaven and poured a cup of tea for the adventurer. As soon as the adventurer sat down, he was cursed into place. Helena revealed her true identity as a witch who was sent by the Coven to infiltrate Fallhaven. She warns the adventurer to turn back before running away into the woods. The adventurer regains control and immediately gives chase. Before leaving, he finds a spellbook that contains information about curses. He placed the book in his pocket and rushed out on a witch hunt. After searching the woods nearby, the adventurer managed to track down Helena performing a ritual on an altar to summon &lt;a href=\"wicker%20beast\"&gt;wicker beast&lt;/a&gt;s. The adventurer charged at Helena and her companions, taking the advantage of surprise. After a short battle, the adventurer would be successful and slays the witch.\nWith the deed done, the adventurer returns to Fallhaven and tried to break the lesser effigies around town. It worked and the adventurer goes back to town to break the larger one. Using the spellbook, the adventurer was teleported to another realm where a &lt;a href=\"wicker%20brute\"&gt;wicker brute&lt;/a&gt; awaited him. The two fought and the adventurer came out victorious. At the moment the wicker died, the citizens started moving again. Fallhaven was freed.\nThe Mayor of &lt;a href=\"Fallhaven\"&gt;Fallhaven&lt;/a&gt; thanked the hero personally and told him the fate of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of the lord and lady had been accused of being a witch and was going to be hanged at &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20Point\"&gt;Hangman's Point&lt;/a&gt;. Hearing the news the hero rushed to save her and road off to her rescue.\nRunning bacon at Carver's Harbor.\nWhen the villagers of Fallhaven were freed, the villagers returned to their daily choirs. One of the freed townsfolk was &lt;a href=\"Elijah%20Eggleton\"&gt;Elijah Eggleton&lt;/a&gt;, a sausage vendor. For a long time, he hadn't been receiving his goods from Carver's Harbor. He asked the adventurer who freed them to go and see why the goods had stalled. Arriving at the harbor, the adventurer encounters &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Staughton\"&gt;Thomas Staughton&lt;/a&gt;, the last normal butcher. Thomas tells the adventurer about his coworkers being turned into pigs, an infestation of &lt;a href=\"wicker%20man\"&gt;wickermen&lt;/a&gt; and a cackle being heard from the warehouse. He tasks the adventurer with destroying the wickermen, saving his friends and kill the famed butcher, &lt;a href=\"Roland%20Hacksaw\"&gt;Roland Hacksaw&lt;/a&gt;. While going on these tasks, the adventurer visits the warehouse Thomas spoke of. Inside, the adventurer finds a pig effigy hanging on the wall. Deducting that this had something to do with the goings-on at Carver's Harbor, he takes the effigy with him. Finishing the tasks given to him by Thomas, he returns to the butcher and gives him the pig effigy. Not knowing what to do with it, Thomas burns it on the campfire in hopes of dispelling the curse. It works and his friends return back to human.\nA sacrifice to the Wicker Man.\nAs the adventurer made his way to &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20Point\"&gt;Hangman's Point&lt;/a&gt;, he was stopped by a merchant at &lt;a href=\"Trader%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Trader's Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The local seller by the name of &lt;a href=\"David%20Maldus\"&gt;David Maldus&lt;/a&gt; was consoling his wife after their son left them to join a cult. He asks the adventurer for help in bringing their son home. The adventurer agreed to help and made his way towards &lt;a href=\"Autumnvale\"&gt;Autumnvale&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving at the location, he finds several cultists worshiping a wicker man along with their leader, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Autumnvale\"&gt;Lord Autumnvale&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer asked for the whereabouts of the boy, but Lord Autumnvale refused to talk until proper respect was shown to the wicker man. Grabbing tributes nearby, Lord Autumnvale was pleased to see the adventurer worshiping the wicker man by offering it entrails, wicker, and bones. Keeping his word, the cultist told him what he wished to know. He told him how the boy was looking for an offering and accidentally disturbed a beehive. That was the last time he ever saw him.\nThe adventurer goes searching for the lad and finds him in a cave being attack by bees. Getting in the way, the adventurer saves the boy from the endless onslaught. Edwin Maldus, the boy in question is grateful for the help and goes back to the cult camp. The adventurer runs after him but as he returns, Edwin is nowhere to be seen. An initiate by the name of &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Peony\"&gt;Peony&lt;/a&gt; tells the adventurer that Edwin had been chosen as a sacrifice to the wicker man and that he would soon be killed. The Adventurer rushed to &lt;a href=\"The%20Wicker%20Altar\"&gt;The Wicker Altar&lt;/a&gt; where he finds the cultist ready to begin. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Autumnvale\"&gt;Lord Autumnvale&lt;/a&gt; tells the adventurer to go back but he refused. He fought &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Autumnvale\"&gt;Lord Autumnvale&lt;/a&gt; and killed him. The remaining cultists run away as the adventurer frees Edwin. Grateful once again, Edwin decides to leave the cult for good. Before leaving, he decides to burn the wicker man so no more will be fooled into joining the cult. He returns to the main camp, lights it ablaze and tells the cultist to go back to their homes.\nThe dead of Barrowknoll.\nPassing a nearby cemetery, the adventurer came across a local caretaker, &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%20Allen\"&gt;Allen&lt;/a&gt;. Allen tells the adventurer about &lt;a href=\"Barrowknoll%20Cemetery\"&gt;Barrowknoll Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; and how the spirits became agitated as of late. The adventurer agrees to help with this problem and Allen tells him how to communicate with the dead. He tells him that he needs to make powder from materiel found in the graveyard, apply it and find &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Cresterly\"&gt;Aaron Cresterly&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer does just that. he finds several &lt;a href=\"Gravebloom\"&gt;Gravebloom&lt;/a&gt;s and applies it. With his eyes open, the adventurer finds Aaron Cresterly, being corrupted like the rest. The adventurer breaks the seal on the ground and frees Aaron.\nHappy to be free once again, Aaron tells the adventurer that a witch has befouled the cemetery. He tells him that one of his companions was trapped inside a wicker man by the witch. The adventurer goes in search of this trapped spirit and finds &lt;a href=\"Wicker-Bound%20Hunter\"&gt;Wicker-Bound Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. He destroys it and out comes the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Bridget%20Fairwater\"&gt;Bridget Fairwater&lt;/a&gt;. Now that she was free, Bridget asks the adventurer to find the witch and kill her before she corrupted her friend, &lt;a href=\"Mercy%20Fairwater\"&gt;Mercy Fairwater&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer searches around the cemetery and finds &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Westwood\"&gt;Sister Westwood&lt;/a&gt; corrupting Mercy. Before she had time to finish the ritual, the adventurer kills her. With the spirits now freed, they had returned to their rest.\nCalming Gol Koval.\nDuring one of his journeys, the adventurer comes across &lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Hale\"&gt;Rebecca Hale&lt;/a&gt; and her pet. She told him about how the ruins had become active and that her friends had been caught in the crossfire. She asked the adventurer to save them and gave him bandages. She also asks him to take care of the large &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;Drust construct&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile in the ruins, the adventurer kills the construct and also saves the other hunters. He also destroyed several stones which he believed to be reanimating the &lt;a href=\"Awakened%20Revenant\"&gt;Awakened Revenant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSilence at Glenbrook Homestead.\nWhile wandering the woods the adventurer came across Glenbrook Homestead. The whole town was abandoned with just one girl remaining, &lt;a href=\"Abby%20Lewis\"&gt;Abby Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. The child ran in circles as she sang creepy songs. The adventurer approached her with caution. Abby told him that her toys had gone missing and asks him to find them. Running across town, they found &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Munchykins\"&gt;Mr. Munchykins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trunksy\"&gt;Trunksy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Striggs%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Mayor Striggs&lt;/a&gt;. However, one guest remained missing, Abby's cat, &lt;a href=\"Smoochums\"&gt;Smoochums&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the two went looking for the cat and the adventurer found him nearby without Abby present. As the adventurer approached the cat, it ran away. Rather than chase it, the adventurer examined a book he found where the cat once stood. It was a registry of all the inhabitants of Glenbrook. Curious, the adventurer searched for the missing residents. In a cave nearby, they found the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Hayes\"&gt;Jonathan Hayes&lt;/a&gt; who wrote a letter to his wife Mary Hayes wanting her to come home. The next citizen was &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Hawthorne\"&gt;Samuel Hawthorne&lt;/a&gt; who went looking for herbs for his sheep but ended up killed and left to rot to the bone in the woods. The last citizen was nowhere to be seen but the adventurer found in a cave her diary in which she wrote how she brought the end of the village and left once it was desolate. In another cave, the adventurer found an unresponsive woman named, &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Warren\"&gt;Annie Warren&lt;/a&gt;. The woman was in shock barely able to comprehend her surrounding. Then out of nowhere Abby appeared and told the adventurer that the tea party was about to begin.\nThe adventurer chased the girl until arriving at her tea party. In the middle was a ritual circle along with her toys and a dead cat. The adventurer sat down and poured the tea witch summoned a large wicker beast. With her work complete, Abby runs away into the wood, leaving the adventurer to be devoured by the beast. However, the adventurer would survive and kill the creature in the process. Annie came rushing in soon after telling the adventurer to forget about the village and ran away.\nThe trial of Lucille Waycrest.\nArriving just in time, Lucille was moments away from being hanged. &lt;a href=\"Constable%20Henry%20Framer\"&gt;Constable Henry Framer&lt;/a&gt;, the one in charge of the execution was stopped when the adventurer appeared in the crowd. The adventurer requested to speak with Lucille and Henry allowed it. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Everit%20Reade\"&gt;Marshal Everit Reade&lt;/a&gt; appeared and asked for the release of Lucille Waycrest. The Constable refused, ordering his man to stand down. Meanwhile, the adventurer spoke with Lucille and tells her that he wishes to free her. Lucille agreed but only if it meant not hurting her people. She sends the adventurer to Everit, asking him to let the trial continue as normal. Everit agreed and send the adventurer to set up traps in the woods in case of a wicker attack.\nMeanwhile, Lucille decides that the best course of action to prove she is not a witch is by asking the villagers how to prove someone is not a witch. The tasks she chose are to cry, to barf, and to be attacked by blood flies. She sends the adventurer to grab several blood flies, venom glands, and a ripe onion. The adventure goes out and brings all the items back. An onion was used to make her cry, blood flies attacked her and the venom glands made her vomit. But even with all this proof, the constable was still unconvinced. In order to finally convince him that she is not a witch, she asked the adventurer to go to &lt;a href=\"Fletcher%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Fletcher's Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and see what happened.\nThe exodus of Fletcher's Hollow.\nArriving at Fletcher's Hollow, the adventurer is greeted by the mayor, &lt;a href=\"Evelyn%20Pare\"&gt;Evelyn Pare&lt;/a&gt;. Holding a hill at the edge of town, she and her men are being bombarded by an endless assault from the &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker men&lt;/a&gt;. Instructing him to push back the wickers and save some of the lost civilians, he kills the beasts and escorts some of the villagers back to the hill. With the villages secured, Evelyn orders her men to make a send at the river while the villagers escaped by boat. They succeed and prepared a counterattack. Evelyn informs the adventurer that three women dressed in odd clothing had been seen wandering the town. She asked the adventurer to go have a chap with them and he does just that. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Ashwell\"&gt;Sister Ashwell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Early\"&gt;Sister Early&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Mooring\"&gt;Sister Mooring&lt;/a&gt; weren't cooperating and the adventurer was forced to put them down. On Sister Ashwell, the adventurer finds a letter which detailed the location of their leader, the mine. During his visit to town, the adventurer finds a scythe that the coven had been using to control the wicker man. After some experiments, the adventurer managed to control one of these monstrosities and brings it back to the hill.\nWith the location of their leader and a wicker man at their disposal, Evelyn comes up with a plan. Since no one is able to enter the mine without dying instantly, she tells the adventurer to take control of the wicker man and kill the one leading this force. The adventurer nods and takes control of the wicker man. The wicker man enters the mine with no problem and finds a &lt;a href=\"Drustvar%20hag\"&gt;Drustvar hag&lt;/a&gt; waiting below. &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Levae\"&gt;Matron Levae&lt;/a&gt; sends her followers on the wicker man but manages to take them out. Focusing on their leader, the adventurer charged her and after a long fight, the hag was slain. With the Coven, a grateful Evelyn says that she will be able to retake the town from here on and wrote a letter for &lt;a href=\"Constable%20Henry%20Framer\"&gt;Constable Henry Framer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmbush at Hangman's Point.\nWith the letter in hand, the adventurer rushed back to Hangman's Point. The constable reads it and was convinced of Lucille's innocence. He lets her go and she is reunited with Marshal Everit. All of a sudden, the Coven attack to capture Lucille. Led by &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Widdowson\"&gt;Sister Widdowson&lt;/a&gt;, the villagers cowered in fear as wicker men attacked. Marshal Everit and his men defended the villagers while the adventurer kills the witch, saving Hangman's Point.\nLucille's Plan.\nAfter being freed, Lucille decided to find more information about the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the adventurer, they traveled to a secret cottage her family owned. Getting past several yetis will picking up supplies for the coming conflict, they managed to get inside. Informing the adventurer about a secret door, the two searched around and found the secret passage when the adventurer slides a torch. Going inside, the two took care of the traps. As they walked Lucille told the adventurer of how the scholars found weaknesses in the Drust's magic and how the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; was formed. As they went in further, they would the ancient headquarters of the Order. Taking a manicurist on the table, the two headed towards &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of reviving the Order.\nSecrets of Arom's Stand.\nArriving at Arom's Stand, Lucille, the adventurer, and Everit immediately got work. Opening up the old tome, Lucille learns that weapons were created to counter the Drust's magic and thus concluded that the same tools could be used against the coven. four weaknesses would be learned. Rowan wood, alchemical fire, worgsbane, and silver. Not knowing what worgsbane is and that Rowan wood doesn't grow in Drustvar, she decided to go with silver first. The first thing she does is give a silver needle to the adventurer and sends him out to poke the villagers to see if they've been infiltrated. In the meantime, Lucille would order the local tailor to make armor for the new Order of Embers and the marshal would hand missives to the adventurer for their recruits.\nWandering the outdoors, the adventurer would find out that Lucille concerns were true. He found a grimoire lying around that could corrupt the locals into joining the Coven. The adventurer finds more of these books and destroys them. Going back to his mission, the adventurer starts poking the refugees at random to see if one was a witch. After several attempts, he manages to poke a witch, reveal her disguise and kill her. On the now slain opponent, the adventurer finds a badly drawn map of Highpass with a mark on it. The adventurer follows the mark and finds a cellar below with a &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Refugee\"&gt;Suspicious Refugee&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand%20Commoner\"&gt;Arom's Stand Commoner&lt;/a&gt;s and asked them if they have seen anything suspicious. Realizing that her cover was blown, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Littlefield\"&gt;Sister Littlefield&lt;/a&gt; revealed herself along with two wicker men. They try to kill the adventurer but failed.\nWith Arom's Stand secured, the adventure goes out to hand the missives to Everit's chosen recruits.\nThe order reborn.\nWhile everyone left, Waycrest Guard was preparing for a counterattack. But before they left, Lucille conducted a ceremony to fully initiate them. Calling forth &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20Yorrick\"&gt;Ensign Yorrick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Sterntide\"&gt;Lieutenant Sterntide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falconer%20Notley\"&gt;Falconer Notley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Captain Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20Mace\"&gt;Ensign Mace&lt;/a&gt; there were given brand new armor and were reborn as the Order of Embers.\nThe forgotten detail.\nWith the order reformed, Lucille sets her eyes on alchemical fire. She sends the adventurer and Joan Cleardawn to Falconhurst to find &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Ashton\"&gt;Warren Ashton&lt;/a&gt; while she and the rest travel to Corlain. Along the way, they are blocked in the snowy ruins of &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Osigr\"&gt;Gol Osigr&lt;/a&gt;. There they wind the spirits of old fighting against the recently awoken &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;Drust construct&lt;/a&gt;s. While they were there, the two decided to learn more about the history of the Drust to see if they can uncover a boon. They learn how the Drust started to attack the villagers and how many human settlements fell before them. They also learn about the Drust's retreat and how their leader, &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, created Drust construct to try and turn the tide. The final piece of information however revealed the most. It shows that while Gorak Tul was stabbed, he was never shown as dead. This leads the two to believe that Gorak Tul was still alive. Before leaving, the two learned from where the construct were coming and how to destroy them.\nTo Falconhurst.\nArriving at &lt;a href=\"Falconhurst\"&gt;Falconhurst&lt;/a&gt;, Joan and the adventurer find the town under siege. They killed several wicker men, ended the cursed villagers, and freed trapped villagers, before joining the rest of the town to hold the wicker men at bay. Side by side, they joined the Falconhurst Guards and pushed back the wicker men, giving them some time to regroup and prepare. While the attacks are slowed down, Joan thinks that the one leading the wicker men hid inside the highest mansion in the village. She sends the adventurer to the location and there he finds the Drustvar hag, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Noella%20Briarwood\"&gt;Sister Noella Briarwood&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer takes her up and joins her to talk with the mayor.\nBy alchemical fire be purged.\nArriving at the port, the two find the mayor of Falconhurst, &lt;a href=\"Leandro%20Royston\"&gt;Leandro Royston&lt;/a&gt;. The mayor wished to push back the wicker men and asked the adventurer to find lumber and build a forward barricade. In the town, he also found &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Ashton\"&gt;Warren Ashton&lt;/a&gt;. After helping him put out the fires, he agrees to try and create this alchemical fire. With success, they managed to create the position and worked as intended on the wicker men, burning them almost instantly. Unfortunately, when the adventurer returned to inform Warren of the results, he was nowhere to be seen. The assistant of Warren, &lt;a href=\"Marten%20Webb\"&gt;Marten Webb&lt;/a&gt;, informed him that the alchemist had been captured by the Coven.\nAssault on the Crimson Forest.\nAlong with Marten Webb and Inquisitor Joan, the three enter the Crimson Forest to find and save Warren. They hid on a hill covered with bushes. From there Joan sends the adventurer to find and free Master Ashton while Marten asks for some reagents to conduct a study. The adventurer finds warren and uses a key to open his cell, while also helping a &lt;a href=\"Samantha%20Sweet\"&gt;woman&lt;/a&gt; gain her armor back. Returning back to the hideout, Master Ashton doesn't look so good. He is in shock and uncooperative after all that he had seen. Marten prepares a potion to give it to Warren, but is missing bear hearts. The adventurer is sent out once again to get some bear hearts and reagents for Marten and kill another &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Elsbeth%20Garrick\"&gt;Matron Elsbeth Garrick&lt;/a&gt; at Joan's request. When he returns, Marten finished the potion and gives it to Warren. The alchemist snaps out of his confusion and is back to work once again.\nRegaining his consciousness, Warren spoke of a grand ritual to bring their master back into the world of the living. A being who grants them their power who Warren had heard speak. One who hates the Kul Tirans with every fiber of his being. &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;.\nStopping their plans.\nTo stop their plans, the four came up with several plans. For Master Ashton, he learned that they used charms to control the wicker men and he thinks he can create an even more powerful charm. He sent the adventurer to get several charms from the matrons in the woods. For Joan, she asks the adventurer to free the villagers captured and stop the ritual. The adventurer goes out and does as he is told, he destroys several witch effigies, free the prisoners and gather the charms.\nBut even with all the disruption, the Coven was still at work. Believe them to have already finished it, Joan and the rest go down inside a deep cave. There they face Gorak Tul. After a short battle, Gorak Tul escapes and collapses the cave behind. The four managed to make it out alive. As they made it out, Master Ashton finishes his charm and to test it, they use it on the &lt;a href=\"Crimsonwood%20Demolisher\"&gt;giant golem&lt;/a&gt; nearby. With the giant in hand, the four ravage the Crimson Forest, eradicating the Coven in the area. With their mission succeeded, they call and ride a gryphon to Arom's Stand.\nRetaking Watchman's Rise.\nIn order to advance into Corlain, Lucille and Everit decide to invade Watchman's Rise for being the highest watch tower. Along with the adventurer and the inquisitors, they attack the tower and kill the lieutenant guarding the tower. The adventurer charges in and finds the witch, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Adela\"&gt;Sister Adela&lt;/a&gt;. He slays her and the Waycrest Guard takes the tower.\nScouting Corlain.\nNow that they held Watchman's Rise, Everit orders a full scouring of the area. Inquisitor Notley is a great &lt;a href=\"Falconer\"&gt;Falconer&lt;/a&gt; but since he was injured, he asked the adventurer to do it in his place. Notley lends &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; to the adventurer and used it to scout Corlain. He learned that Upper Corlain has a barrier placed on it, the Coven are rounding up the townsfolk and that the blacksmith was still alive in the armory.\nSaving Angus Ballaster.\nLearning that the blacksmith was still alive, Everit focused on saving him first to have someone repairing their armor if need be. &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Yorrick\"&gt;Inquisitor Yorrick&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer were sent to save him and gathered several supplies along the way. Entering the basement below, they find the blacksmith, &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Ballaster\"&gt;Angus Ballaster&lt;/a&gt;, holding his ground against the slaves of the Coven. After a short ambush, the three returned to Watchman's Rise.\nSupplies from Bleak Hills Mine.\nWhile going to save the blacksmith was the option. Lucille Waycrest also sent the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Hills%20Mine\"&gt;Bleak Hills Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Although the mine is usually there for iron, they also manage to find silver sometimes. Arriving at the mine, the adventurer finds &lt;a href=\"Elsie%20Wright\"&gt;Elsie Wright&lt;/a&gt; cowering in fear. She tells him that a witch cursed the mine to be infected with spiders and that her men are trapped in their webbing. The adventure agrees to help, and goes down to the mine to collect silver, kill spiders and save the miners.\nA weapon of war.\nWith the supplies gathered from &lt;a href=\"Corlain%20Armoury\"&gt;Corlain Armoury&lt;/a&gt;, Everit gave the materiel to Angus and sent the adventurer to assist him. After toying around with what little materiel he had in the basement of the tower, he created a blunderbuss that is able to fire silver. Calling it &lt;a href=\"Witchrend\"&gt;Witchrend&lt;/a&gt;, he sends it back to Lucille.\nTo test it out, the Waycrest daughter sends the adventurer to test out on three matrons who occupied Corlain. While in town, the adventurer uses Witchrend to kill &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Ceridwen\"&gt;Matron Ceridwen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Adeline\"&gt;Matron Adeline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Letitia\"&gt;Matron Letitia&lt;/a&gt;.\nA smell of protection.\nInside Corlain, the adventurer comes across &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Mace\"&gt;Inquisitor Mace&lt;/a&gt;. She was investigating a few knocked-out soldiers under the Coven's spell. From his investigation, the adventurer came across a man named &lt;a href=\"Harris%20Hocking\"&gt;Harris Hocking&lt;/a&gt; on his farm of onions. It would seem that the Coven would not attack the farm. Beveling this to be the onions at work, Harris made a deal with the adventurer. If he could remove some of the boars eating the onions he would let him borrow some onions. The adventure does just that, he kills the boars and pulls several onions. Grateful for the help, Harris gives him the sealed onion and takes them back to Lucille.\nTaking down the barrier.\nWhen the adventurer returned Lucille informed that the blacksmith had an idea on how to take down the barrier. The adventurer is informed that the best way to take down the barrier is with a cannonball. Fortunately, Angus used whatever silver he had left to make it and gave it to the adventurer. He also informs him that he will need some gunpowder to blow it out and there must be some left at &lt;a href=\"Pikeman%27s%20Ridge\"&gt;Pikeman's Ridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith enough gunpowder available, he took it to a cannon next to the barrier. Arriving at the spot, he finds &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Sterntide\"&gt;Inquisitor Sterntide&lt;/a&gt; already had freed up a cannon. Aiming the cannon at the entrance, the adventurer broke the barrier and rushed in with the Order of Embers.\nDeath to the traitor.\nAt some unknown point, Marshal Reade would find out about &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Goodspeed\"&gt;Captain Goodspeed&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal. While the adventurer was out on other errands, he asks him to take out the betrayer, along with his kin. Going to &lt;a href=\"Pikeman%27s%20Ridge\"&gt;Pikeman's Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer finds the traitors holding their ground. With no other choice, he slays them. Along the way, he meets with &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Notley\"&gt;Inquisitor Notley&lt;/a&gt; who helps him take down the effigies placed on top of the building to prevent the falcons from turning while also free those who had yet to be corrupted. With this deed done, the adventure head to the top and finds the traitor under a tent. He personally executes Goodspeed and tells the good news to the Marshal.\nThe liberation of Corlain.\nWith Lucille and Everit leading the charge, the adventurer followed suit. At the entrance, Lucille tells them to open the side entrances for the other inquisitors while Everit asks them to cull the covens numbers while destroying their wicker men. As the adventurer does all of this, he also learned how Corlain fell from the dairies left behind from the villagers.\nThe final push.\nWith the inquisitors in place, Lucille, the Marshal, and the Order of Embers rushed to Waycrest Manor to free the lord and lady. They kept charging in with each inquisitor stopping on the sides to hold the members of the Coven at bay. Arriving at the top with just the adventurer, Everit and Lucille. The three could not believe what they saw. The leader of the Coven was &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Meredith Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, mother of Lucille.\nThe Mother unveiled.\nWith a simple spell, the Mother corrupts Everit, turning him into an obedient slave. With the Marshal corrupted, he was forced to fight Lucille against his will. Lucille was in shock unable to do anything. The adventurer fought of the corrupted marshal and after a heartbreaking battle, the Marshel falls dead on the ground. Lucille mourns his passing while the other inquisitors saluted their fallen commander. In grief, Lucille urges the others to go into the manor and finish the Coven while she returned to Arom's Stand.\nWaycrest Manor.\nWith the Coven on the run, the inquisitors make their final push at &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;. The inquisitors raided down the manor, slaughtering any members of the Coven they came across. Their victims would include &lt;a href=\"Raal%20the%20Gluttonous\"&gt;Raal the Gluttonous&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Triad\"&gt;Heartsbane Triad&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Soulbound%20Goliath\"&gt;Soulbound Goliath&lt;/a&gt;. With the house extinguished of its evil presence, Lady Waycrest invites them to the cellar.\nIn the end, Lady Waycrest was merely a vessel for Gorak Tul's power, and her death opened the &lt;a href=\"Rupture%20%28Waycrest%20Manor%29\"&gt;Rupture&lt;/a&gt;, the doorway for the Drust to enter Azeroth. At the Rupture Gorak Tul was able to raise his people from the dead, but he was slain nonetheless. However, upon his death, Gorak Tul revealed that it was only a vessel and he still existed in the Blighted Lands. Even so, the Heartsbane Coven was broken and Drustvar was released from Gorak Tul's power.\nWith the Waycrests taken care of, the Inquisitors made their way to Gorak Tul and destroyed his body. Even though his spirit escaped, this would mark the end of the Drust Incursion.\nAftermath.\nLucy Waycrast assumed her role as matron of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; and appointed &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt; as the new Marshal of &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Guard\"&gt;Waycrest Guard&lt;/a&gt;."}

Heavily forested and mountainous, Drustvar is more inhospitable than neighboring lands, and produces most of the kingdom's ore as well as some of its toughest warriors.\nFor ages, Drustvar has served as the seat of power for &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, one of Kul Tiras's most powerful families. As the original home of the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; in ancient times, the region witnessed intense fighting as the first &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s battled to colonize the islands. Its legacy remains both dark and sinister, and has resurfaced in modern times in the form of perverse &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;witchcraft&lt;/a&gt; and twisted cults.\nDrustvar has a deep &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;hunting&lt;/a&gt; tradition. The &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Guard\"&gt;Waycrest Guard&lt;/a&gt; features many &lt;a href=\"falconer\"&gt;falconer&lt;/a&gt;s, and the region also has its own &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; order. Besides them, there are also &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;witch hunters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDrustvar is a forested, mountainous area. It was once occupied by a kingdom of &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s arrived on Kul Tiras, they slew the Drust and took the area as their own. The Drust created stone golems in their war with the settlers. The human armies, led by &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, researched their magics and created the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; to counter it.\nIn the present day, Drustvar is controlled by the Lord and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, who have gone suspiciously absent. In their absence, Drustvar's contributions of arms (and sausages) have begun to dry up. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; is working with their Kul Tiran allies to get to the bottom of the mystery, as well as the curse over the land.\nThe harsh lands of Drustvar are ruled by House Waycrest, who conquered these lands after vanquishing the ancient, evil Drust. The edifices of the Drust still stand in ruin across the land, but that's not all that remains of this accursed people. Recently, their evil leader has been awakened\u2014and if left unchecked, his dark power will spread throughout all of Kul Tiras. Upon arriving in Drustvar, you will be met with a request to visit Mayor Cyril White of Fallhaven in eastern Drustvar.\nOfficial preview.\nIn the land of Drustvar, the stalwart protectors of House Waycrest hold fast along the western border, but recently all contact with them has been lost. Travel beyond the frontier to learn of their fate and battle the resurgence of an ancient and terrifying enemy.\nDrustvar is a region known for the tenacity of the soldiers who protect it. Long after the defeat of the mysterious Drust who once dwelled there, the descendants of Arom Waycrest and his people continue to eke out a living in this unyielding land. They are known throughout Kul Tiras as being a hearty, stoic, and deeply superstitious people, and would make keen allies in the fight against the Horde\u2014but now it's up to you to discover why they've gone silent.\nWhen first arriving in Drustvar, you'll be greeted by a dark and foreboding shoreline on the eastern border. Drustvar is a rugged land plagued by superstition, and signs of witchcraft are everywhere. The pathways through Glenbrook to Fallhaven are fraught with danger, so you'll need to stay on your guard. Dark rumors swirl as to what may have befallen the Waycrest family\u2014and if the Alliance has any hope of convincing the Kul Tirans to join them, you'll need to untangle the mysteries that lay ahead.\nVerdigris roofs and awnings adorn buildings of brick and wood, their amber window panes alight from within. The sea's intrinsic role in Kul Tiran culture is reflected in the architecture, and anchors and other symbols of the sea decorate doorways and awnings.\nA stygian pallor looms over the town of Fallhaven, reeking of mystical meddling. A large and ominous construct stands as sentinel in the center of town, and the townsfolk are... unresponsive. You'll need to work diligently to break the curse on the town before you can make any progress toward getting to the heart of the troubles in Drustvar.\nCobblestone paths wind through the region and in and out of the various villages and towns. History and culture are deeply woven into the fabric of Kul Tiras, but so too are the workings of dark witches. Cursed and hopelessly twisted townsfolk and creatures work in servitude to these mystics' machinations, set to a task you'll need to decipher and put an end to\u2014if you have the stomach for it.\nVisitors to this region will need to rely on their wits, solve a few not-so-small issues the citizenry faces, and hopefully make some inroads with the people along the way.\nThere are more mysteries to unravel, and an ancient enemy is stirring in the land, causing a tremendous slew of trouble.\nTraveling westward will lead to a large chain of rugged snow-touched mountains running from the northern border of the region to the southern Iceveil Glacier, nearly bisecting the region in two. Along Highroad Pass, you'll come across various wildlife and creatures, including Chillwind Yetis who find the cold of the mountains to their liking and food sources plentiful.\nThe road is fraught with danger, but you'll eventually arrive in the town of Arom's Stand, which overlooks a valley to the west. A tribute to Arom Waycrest stands vigil even as the people here struggle against the darkness that has swept over the land.\nOn the southwestern coast you'll cross into the Crimson Forest. Various shades of red assail your eyes and bear witness to the veracity of the name. The town of Falconhurst sits on the coast, and as in your previous travels through the region, you'll find this settlement is under siege by dark forces.\nNorth of the Crimson Forest, the Ashenwood Grove bears witness to creatures adorned with fungi and strange creatures known as Fungarians patrolling the pathways. Farms dot the area and mines can be found dug into the mountainsides, but what should be bustling enterprises have ground to a halt as the witches' special brand of pestilent creatures wreak havoc.\nEach clue found and mystery solved only puts forth more questions as to what could be ultimately manipulating events in Drustvar. Perhaps you'll find the source of the troubles within Waycrest Manor\u2014ancestral home of the Waycrest family who watches over Drustvar.\nA vast coastline surrounds Drustvar to the east, south, and west, where those brave enough can fish, boat, swim, and hunt for treasure. Inland, the mountains and forests provide a chance to hunt a variety of... interesting... creatures. To the north, the rolling hills and mountains of Stormsong Valley await, while eastward lies Tiragarde Sound\u2014and even more opportunities to earn your way into the good graces of the Kul Tirans.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Even though the humans tried to live in peace with the Drust, it was clear that war was unavoidable. Led by their leader &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, the Drust pushed the humans back from every settlement they made. With the only viable option of retreat left, Drustvar Militia hired several scholars to see what could be done about the Drust. In the end, they've learned of several weakness and planned to use them against their enemy. They formed the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; to combat their forces.\n&lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; was the one who led the assault against the Drust. With their newfound weapons, the Drust and their king were forced to retreat. The humans kept pushing forward into the mountain tops. Even when the Drust king tried to push them back with his newly created &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;Drust construct&lt;/a&gt;s, it was to no avail. With their final stand at Gol Osigr, Arom charged Gorak Tul and stabbed him. The Drust armies would falter immediately with the Drustvar Militia victorious.\nFrom this point forward, Drustvar Militia would be no more. It became a true army under the command of Lord Waycrest as the &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Guard\"&gt;Waycrest Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther battles.\nOn one mission, Arom Waycrest found an injured &lt;a href=\"Athair\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt; that had been battling the Drust. Rather than killing it, he decided to heal it in hopes for it to continue its assault against his enemies. On that very night at their campsite, the Drust would take the Drustvar Militia by surprise and their defeat seemed assured. It was at that moment that the stag reappeared and helped them repel the aggressors. Grateful for its help, Arom thanked the stag and in response the stag spoke and thanked him for his kindness."}

Druz fought in at least one of the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Wars\"&gt;Trade Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blank Scroll.\nDruz came to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; with his boss after the mists had parted. They harbored their uberzeppelin off the northern coast of the continent in order to inspire the plundersquads sent to pillage and loot. One night, a squad led by &lt;a href=\"Ziya\"&gt;Ziya&lt;/a&gt; accidentally exposed a &lt;a href=\"lorevault\"&gt;lorevault&lt;/a&gt;, a vault for the &lt;a href=\"Lorewalkers\"&gt;Lorewalkers&lt;/a&gt; to store and hide dangerous &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; artifacts.\nSeeing the distress call from the squad, Druz personally landed on the shore, but &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Shuchun\"&gt;Lorewalker Shuchun&lt;/a&gt; refused to let him and Ziya enter the vault. She told them of the dangers of the vault yet it fell on deaf ears. Shuchun had no choice but to lead both Druz and Ziya into the vault, as she knew the two goblins would otherwise be lost to the defense mechanism. In doing so, she hoped to convince them that the dangerous artifacts stored within were put there for a reason. As they faced various challenges based on pandaren legends, Druz and Ziya argued over the purpose of the war against the Alliance, the true nature of Trade Prince Gallywix, and the danger of seeking simple answers to complex problems, eventually realizing that their arguments were actually creating the traps. The source of these creations turned out to be a dangerous pandaren artifact: &lt;a href=\"The_Blank_Scroll_%28item%29\"&gt;the Blank Scroll&lt;/a&gt;.\nDruz and Ziya attempted to claim the scroll. Realizing that her warnings were going unheeded, Lorewalker Shuchun activated the scroll, and showed the goblins a vision of a terrible future. In the vision, the Bilgewater Cartel goblins were declared traitors to the Horde for hiding a powerful weapon from Warchief Garrosh Hellscream. The Exodar, Teldrassil and Stormwind were destroyed by the orcs, and Azeroth itself was devastated by the Burning Legion and horrors from the sea.\nStunned by what they had seen, Druz and Ziya decided to leave the Blank Scroll in Lorewalker Shuchun's hands. Druz gave Ziya some paid time off to escort Lorewalker Shuchun \"where she needs to go\". Ziya found she was grateful for some respite from the war she had fought for years.\nBefore the Storm.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Druz accompanied Jastor to &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; to meet &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt;. Druz and the other bruisers remained with Grizzek to guard and supervise him. He later appeared when &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt; was delivered to the engineer by &lt;a href=\"Kezzig%20Klackwhistle\"&gt;Kezzig Klackwhistle&lt;/a&gt;. Druz was ready to take care of her, if needed, but Grizzek sent him away instead. Druz learned about Grizzek and Saffy's laboratory sabotage and escape attempt and caught them, completely thwarting their plans. Grizzek tried to plead with Druz of their necessity, but the enforcer revealed they could make do with the inventors' confiscated research. Furthermore, the enforcer had his orders from Gallywix to eliminate them. Druz had the inventors bound and ordered Kezzig to place a bomb between the couple before leaving them to their fate.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDruz appears during &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;assaults on Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, he can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Greystone%20Ruins\"&gt;Greystone Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, managing the &lt;a href=\"Hide-No-More%202000\"&gt;Hide-No-More 2000&lt;/a&gt; to locate Alliance saboteurs. During &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Vol%27dun\"&gt;assaults on Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, he is located in &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Pass\"&gt;Dead Man's Pass&lt;/a&gt; and provides &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Getaway%20Pack\"&gt;Gallywix's Getaway Pack&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Horde adventurers to reach the Alliance spies camped on the cliffs around the pass.\nPersonality.\nWhile Gallywix was widely known for his unscrupulous and ruthless antics, little was ever said of Druz and his own talents, including his ability to make Jastor's enemies disappear. He is also known for his research; Druz always seems to know the names and weaknesses of everyone he meets. \nDruz is highly loyal to Gallywix, and views the trade prince's antics as par for the course in goblin society. He dismisses Gallywix's crimes against his own people (including the enslavement of their cartel), implying the goblins were only sold because they were careless.\nOddly, prior to his departure from the Bilgewater Cartel, &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt; always got along well with Druz.\nSpeculation.\nDue to his noted loyalty to Gallywix, he presumably left the Horde to join his close friend."}

{"id": "15330", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15330", "title": "Dryad", "text": "Dryads are the enchanted daughters of the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. The playful, frolicking creatures vaguely resemble a female &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; for the upper part of their bodies, while the lower part is more akin to woodland &lt;a href=\"fawn\"&gt;fawn&lt;/a&gt;s. They are swift and sure and are at peace with all of the children of the forest. Like the &lt;a href=\"keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt;, while they prefer peace and abhor unnecessary violence, the dryads will defend the wildlands of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with their lives if need be. They are curious, but only a few leave the forests. They can enter the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; by shifting their bodies between the planes.\nBeing the &lt;a href=\"Cenarius%27%20children\"&gt;children of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, they have shared ancestry with the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s. Some are the children of &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; rather than Cenarius.\nBackground.\nThe first known encounters with the dryads were almost 15,000 years ago when they were encountered by the &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s that eventually evolved into night elves. Following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the woodland dryads emerged from the secluded &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, traveling to other areas such as &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and being revered by the night elves as an omen of good times. When dragons left the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; after the Sundering, green dragons left dryads among those that were left to care over the isles.\nNotably, they assisted the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"dreamform%20army\"&gt;dreamform army&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey also appear in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, and a group of dryads lives in the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Wilds\"&gt;Verdant Wilds&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nDryads, when first grown, stand at around 5'5\". They first begin their lives as enchanted acorns, cared for and tended to by experienced &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s who consider them sacred. These druids whisper in various languages to the acorn to teach them about the world before they're grown, and at the first touch of water, sprout into their normal appearance in a matter of seconds. Once grown, they immediately imprint on the first person they see, meant to be a druid, who will teach them to control and utilize their powers for the good of nature. Dryads do not consume animal products, and instead enjoy various vegetables and fruits. They can converse with any living beings, such as bee hives, can grow plants at their will, and are largely immune to all forms of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Although they grow from an acorn, they do seem to have normal biology once done growing, as they're capable of bleeding and defecating.\n&lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; hold dryads in very high regard. &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt; bowed her head to &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt; out of either respect--or fear.\nIt is said that the knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20Lore\"&gt;Ancients of Lore&lt;/a&gt; is necessary also to enable communion with the enigmatic, free-spirited dryads.\nThey use spears or wands.\nOther types.\nNymphs.\nThe term nymph is interchangeable with dryad. Nymphs are a wilder variation. Two types are known to exist: the &lt;a href=\"frost%20nymph\"&gt;frost nymph&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest%20nymph\"&gt;forest nymph&lt;/a&gt;s. Frost nymphs were first discovered in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; during \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", when they started revealing themselves in order to ask for help. A few forest nymphs have also been seen in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; helping the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; during \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCrystal dryads.\n&lt;a href=\"Crystal%20dryad\"&gt;Crystal dryad&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other dryads, their coloration is not like that of woodland trees. They are most likely this way as a result of the same dragon magic that overtook much of the forest.\nIn the RPG.\nThey monitor the health of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s forests, ever watchful against the depredations of evil magic. The creature has the head, arms, and torso of a beautiful night elf woman, but the lower body of a fawn. A gentle calm is evident in her eyes, but she hefts a spear with practiced skill. It doesn't look like she wants to use the spear in her hand \u2014 but if she had to, she could.\nAllies of the night elves, dryads are the daughters of the demigod Cenarius. They are peaceful by nature and despise violence; however, like ancients, night elves, and their brothers the keepers of the grove, dryads fight to protect the forests and their allies. They are particularly adept at destroying magic and are immune to its effects. Most dryads remain in the forests, frolicking with the animals, dancing in the rain, and occasionally bringing nature's wrath onto their enemies. Some dryads, however, leave their forests and become adventurers. For some, encounters with hostile forces spark this desire \u2014 they wish to bring the fight to the enemies of nature. Others are curious about the world outside their forests and wish to experience new environments and meet new beings. Other dryads and night elves see adventuring dryads as a bit less unusual than adventuring ancients. Dryads possess an innate streak of curiosity, after all. However, adventuring dryads are still branded as eccentrics who go against the natural tendencies of their kind. Dryads are peaceful watchers of the forest. They are friends of the night elves and defenders of nature. Daughters of Cenarius, they somewhat resemble centaurs, their cursed brethren. Dryads enjoy play and frolic in the forests. Despite the fact that dryads abhor violence, they fought alongside their night elf allies in the Third War and continue to protect the forests against the depredations of the Scourge, the Burning Legion, and other intruders. They focus their efforts particularly against hostile magic.\nWhile dryads are peaceful with all inhabitants of the forest, they can be fierce defenders against those who would do harm to nature. Dryads are peaceful, but they fight to protect nature and in defense of their night elf allies. They hurl their spears at close range (most dryads carry five or six spears), closing to melee when they run out of ammunition. In a serious engagement, one or two dryads flee to summon help from ancients, keepers of the grove or night elves, while the others delay their opponents. A dryad's magical nature coats her weapons with a painful and debilitating poison. Dryads attempt to weaken their enemies to the point where their gear weighs them down, forcing them to move slowly and making them vulnerable.\nThey are playful, frolicking &lt;a href=\"fey\"&gt;fey&lt;/a&gt; creatures that vaguely resemble &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s (their cursed cousins), but have upper torsos of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and lower bodies more akin to woodland &lt;a href=\"faun\"&gt;faun&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDryads are known to visit the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aessina\"&gt;Shrine of Aessina&lt;/a&gt; to venerate &lt;a href=\"Aessina\"&gt;Aessina&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey can be &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. They are classified as Medium Fey.\nParentage.\nThe first dryads are the daughters of Cenarius, and sisters of his sons (&lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, \"the centaur\", etc). Later, dryads were born from his \"favored children\", the dryads and keepers. Cenarius' daughter known as \"the dryad\" mothered dryads, and Remulos fathered dryads as well.\nCorrupted dryad.\nA dryad that has been mutated into one of the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ones\"&gt;Corrupted Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The creature has the torso of an elf and the body of a faun, it is clearly a dryad. Yet, the body is twisted, its skin scaly and fingers clenched like horrid talons. Its face is screwed up in an evil scowl, and it attacks with a wild scream.\nCulture.\nDryads usually speak &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;. Dryads find it useful to know the languages of the races with which they are most likely to come into contact. These languages include Common, &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;.\nA dryad has wild empathy and can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a &lt;a href=\"badger\"&gt;badger&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"tallstrider\"&gt;tallstrider&lt;/a&gt;). The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. The dryad must be within thirty feet of the target animal and under normal conditions. A dryad can use this ability to influence a magical beast with low intelligence (such as a &lt;a href=\"darkmantle%20%28monster%29\"&gt;darkmantle&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"girallon\"&gt;girallon&lt;/a&gt;).\nInspiration.\nIn Greek mythology, s (from Anc. Greek: \"\u03b4\u03c1\u1fe6\u03c2/dr\u0177s\" 'oak') are tree nymphs, specifically those of oak trees."}

Though they abhor unnecessary violence, the Dryads will defend the wildlands of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with their lives if need be.\nInformation.\nDryads are popular units amongst Night Elf players because of their two most powerful traits; Spell Immunity and Slow Poison. Dryads innately come with these abilities, so no research is required in order to unlock them. Spell Immunity protects Dryads from spells (including most beneficial ones) and magic damage - essentially making them invulnerable when facing off against &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gryphon Rider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Chimaera%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s, along with most spellcasters. \nSlow Poison causes the Dryad's attacks to slowly chip off the unfortunate target's health over time, along with the additional effect of slowing them down slightly. This, coupled with their fast speed and attack rate, allows them to chase down fleeing troops.\nDryads may also learn Abolish Magic, allowing them to dispel any unfriendly spells casted on allied units and beneficial spells on enemy units, essentially countering Bloodlust, Polymorph and Slow.\nFocus on the Dryads whenever possible, as they have low health and Unarmored-based armor which makes them particularly suspect to piercing and siege attacks. Artillery units such as &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20Team%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mortar Team&lt;/a&gt;s can make short work of them.\nSpells and abilities.\nAolish Magic (Autocast).\nDispel Magic won't automatically dispel any summoned units such as skeletons or wards, so you will have to manually cast it to remove them."}

At the end of the gorge lies a cave. It is currently inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Drywhisker\"&gt;Drywhisker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s. Deep within the cave, a mysterious stone shard can be found in which a piece of the essence of Princess &lt;a href=\"Myzrael\"&gt;Myzrael&lt;/a&gt; was trapped.\nThese kobolds, allies to the &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s, guard the &lt;a href=\"Mote%20of%20Myzrael\"&gt;motes&lt;/a&gt; and the shard within.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, the Drywhisker kobolds still remained active in this area. Among them, &lt;a href=\"Geomancer%20Flintdagger\"&gt;Geomancer Flintdagger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Krix\"&gt;Overseer Krix&lt;/a&gt; were priority targets.

It appears to be due east of Hammerfall on the map. Kobolds are found to the south and east and that is the route that has to be taken to the cave, as the northwest border of Hammerfall is guarded. \nThe path to the cave can be found on the east side of Hammerfall. Look for a long, moss-covered log then a boulder in front of a tree. Stand facing the hills with your back to the boulder and look up. Beyond a grassy hillock, you will see a small bush and a tree top between a \"V\" formed by the taller hills in front of you. Head up the hill past the bush and you will see that the tree has another boulder in front of it; go around these heading straight up. You will pass several more bushes and the path will curve toward the left. At the top of the rise, bear left and very shortly thereafter you will see the cave.\nNotes.\nThis cave was the only known source of &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Bloodstone%20Ore\"&gt;Lesser Bloodstone Ore&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;."}

Introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, dual talent specialization was the ability to create and switch between two distinct 'specs'. Each spec comprises a &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; and a full set of &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"action%20bar\"&gt;action bar&lt;/a&gt;s. It was an economical alternative to resetting all of these if the player intended to switch between the same two specs frequently, or simply allowing the player to experiment more freely and cheaply.\nIn \"\" players can now switch between all of their specs rather than being limited to just two, and no longer requires gold to activate the option.\nUsage.\nInitial purchase.\nTo purchase dual spec, you must be at least level 30, and can purchase the ability from your class trainer. (A few class trainers, such as those in Dalaran, do not offer talent reset or dual spec.) The cost is . No reputation discount applies.\nSetting your specializations.\nOnce you have purchased dual spec, there will be two tabs at the top right of the &lt;a href=\"Specialization%20%26amp%3B%20Talents\"&gt;Specialization &amp; Talents&lt;/a&gt; interface, representing your Primary and Secondary specializations. Each tab's icon will reflect the specialization chosen. The currently inactive spec's pane will appear greyed-out, and feature an 'Activate' button, which can be used to switch to that specialization. \nSwitching between specializations.\nTo switch specialization, select your currently inactive spec's pane, and click the 'Activate' button. Switching between talent specs takes 5 seconds, and all mana/rage/energy are reset to zero by this process. Some &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s are also removed by switching. Once the 5 second cast is completed, your glyphs, action bars, and talents will all be restored to your other specialization. \nPlayers cannot switch between specs during combat, or while in &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; or Arena (except during Preparation, before the Battleground/Arena match begins).\nIf you want you can also use this macro. Just create a new macro, insert the text below and throw it into your bar. When you click it, the macro will change your spec. Click again to change back. Since action bars change between specs, it may be necessary to add it to your action bar in each spec.\n /usetalents [spec:1] 2; 1\nRespec.\nEven if you have purchased dual specialization, there is still a cost to &lt;a href=\"respec\"&gt;respec&lt;/a&gt;. \"Switching\" between your specializations is free, but if you want to exchange one of your specializations for another (such as changing your mage's primary specialization from Arcane to Fire), you will require a class trainer, and will have to pay a fee.\nSpecializations can be changed by visiting the appropriate &lt;a href=\"class%20trainer\"&gt;class trainer&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure the specialization you wish to respec is active, then purchase the respec from the trainer.\nTalents and glyphs.\nTo set talents or glyphs, first select the specialization (primary or secondary) and activate the specialization. Now any talent or glyph changes you make will apply to this specialization. Changing talent and glyphs does not require the purchase of a respec - however you will need &lt;a href=\"Vanishing%20Powder\"&gt;Vanishing Powder&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dust%20of%20Disappearance\"&gt;Dust of Disappearance&lt;/a&gt; to remove one of your choices, or you can visit a class trainer and pay a fee to wipe all of your talent or glyph choices. Inversely, respeccing will not modify any talents or glyphs you have set to either specialization.\nAction bars.\nEach spec has its own set of action bars. Druids' alternate forms use the same action bars for both specs.\nArmory.\nThe initial release of dual spec also impacted the &lt;a href=\"armory\"&gt;armory&lt;/a&gt; website. "}

Mainspec/Offspec rolling had no way to even out loot distribution, leaving some people with no loot while others with many.\nHow It Works.\nFor every raid ID, each week, each person gets a NEED and a GREED token which can be used for any piece of loot. If a raid is allowing alts to run on bosses that are on farm, they do not receive NEED or GREED tokens, but can /roll for mainspec and offspec.\n1. When an item drops, a person who still has their NEED token can spend it to get the item. If multiple people wish do so, there is a roll among those who have needed, and the highest roller gets the item. Only the winner will lose their NEED token. Type /roll when this is called for in raid chat.\n2. If no one spends a NEED token, a person who still has their GREED token can spend it to get the item. If multiple people wish do so, there is a roll among those who have needed, the highest roller gets the item. Only the winner will lose their GREED token. Type /roll when this is called for in raid chat.\n3. If no one spends their GREED token, a mainspec /roll occurs. There is no limit to the amount of gear you can win via /rolling mainspec, and it comes at no cost to you -- This does not effect your NEED or GREED token in any way. Type /roll or /random after this has been called for if you wish to do this. We want all upgrades going to mainspec players, even if extremely minor. Do not let your guilt over a fortunate series of rolls gear us less well. \"Mainspec\" means \"You'd use that item, most of the time, as the spec you currently are at this raid.\"\n4. If no one /rolls for mainspec, then people can roll offspec. There is no limit to the amount of offspec loot a person can get this way.\n5. If the item hasn't gone to someone at this point, it will be sharded, or /rolled for if the item is a BOE.\nAt the end of the raid lock, everyone loses the tokens they have not spent for that raid. If at any time during the week, everyone in the raid has spent a certain type of token, everyone gets a new one of that type.\nLoot Administration Tool.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//code.google.com/p/frsloot\"&gt;Dual Token Addon&lt;/a&gt;\nLoot Strategies While Using the Dual-Token System.\nThe Dual-Token system allows you to choose how to best maximize your possibilities for upgrades based on your individual needs.\nLoot \"Cleverness\" In Regards to Mainspec Rolls.\nDon't play games and outstrategize yourself, thinking you know what everyone will do with this system. People can get burned quite often when they don't take into account the fact that they don't exactly know what the other 24 people are thinking. Moreover, there are well over 30 specs in WoW, and they may not understand the gear for the 29+ specs that they aren't as well as they think they do.\nThis is just a partial list of why \"just waiting for mainspec\" may not be such a guaranteed bet.\nRemember that Blizzard actively made gear useful to a lot of different classes in the new expansion as a stated goal. That means it doesn't often fit a class 100%, but is still GREAT for them, if not best in game ATM.\nWhen you risk a random roll, be mentally prepared to take what comes to you -- and what doesn't.\nUsed By.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//FarstridersRS.com\"&gt;Farstriders Raiding Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;"}

{"id": "19732", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19732", "title": "Dual wield", "text": "Dual wield allows the character to hold a &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; in each hand (&lt;a href=\"main%20hand\"&gt;main hand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"off%20hand\"&gt;off hand&lt;/a&gt;). The character can deal some &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; with the weapon in the off-hand between strikes with the strong hand. This is a very important passive ability as it allows a character to deal significantly more damage as compared to a single one-handed weapon. Once it is acquired, the character will immediately begin to strike with each hand (if there is a weapon in each) while in battle.\nWarriors, monks, rogues, death knights and shamans are all able to dual wield weapons, however there are some limitations:\nA weapon equipped in the main hand will deal full &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, while an off-hand weapon will deal 50% of its damage.\nMost &lt;a href=\"disarm%20effect\"&gt;disarm effect&lt;/a&gt;s do NOT affect off-hand weapons. While abilities that require a weapon in the main hand can't be used, the off-hand weapon will still deal its regular damage. The rogue disarm &lt;a href=\"Dismantle\"&gt;Dismantle&lt;/a&gt; removes both main-hand and off-hand equipment.\nMiss chance.\nDual wielding adds a 19% miss penalty to both main and offhand weapons. The base miss rate for all characters is 5%, so each weapon by itself has a 24% chance to miss (19% + 5%). \n\"Important note\": Prior to version 1.8, dual wield's miss chance had a hard cap of 19%, meaning that all dual-wield auto-attacks had a \"minimum\" 19% miss chance regardless of how much +hit% gear was equipped. In version 1.8, this hard cap was removed. The exact wording of the 1.8 patch note was:\nTake a level 80 rogue for example vs. a level 83 raid boss: the rogue has 5% + (0.04% * 15) = 5.6% base miss chance, plus 19% dual wield miss chance, leaving us with a total miss chance of 24.6%.\nNote that the +19% miss chance for dual-wielding only applies to ordinary auto-attack melee attacks. It does not apply to any special attack powers that cost rage, energy, or mana -- instant attacks such as &lt;a href=\"Sinister%20Strike\"&gt;Sinister Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormstrike\"&gt;Stormstrike&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Strike\"&gt;Heroic Strike&lt;/a&gt; do not incur the dual wield miss penalty. So, with 9% +hit from gear/talents a dual-wielder will never miss with an instant attack (although the attack can still be dodged, parried, or blocked -- see the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20table\"&gt;Attack table&lt;/a&gt; article). However, a dual-wielder would need 25% +hit if he wants to remove the miss chance for auto-attack/white damage totally.\nChance on hit proc rate.\nSome weapons have special abilities that will occur (or \"proc\") on some hits. These abilities are preceded in the weapon's description by the words \"Chance on hit:\".\nThe chance for one of these abilities to proc on a successful auto-attack strike is independent of whether the weapon is being wielded in the main hand or wielded in the off hand. However, these abilities also have the same per-strike chance to go off when making an instant attack (such as Sinister Strike, Mongoose Bite, Overpower, etc.). Instant attacks are always assumed to be made with the weapon in the main hand only. This means that over the course of a normal fight in which several instant attacks are used, a given weapon's chance-on-hit ability will go off more often if the weapon is wielded in the main hand than if it is being wielded in the off hand. The exceptions to this are the shaman &lt;a href=\"Stormstrike\"&gt;Stormstrike&lt;/a&gt; ability, the rogue &lt;a href=\"Mutilate\"&gt;Mutilate&lt;/a&gt; ability and the warrior &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; ability, in which all three abilities give an extra instant attack with both wielded weapons.\nProc rate for other weapon abilities.\nSome weapons have abilities that go off some of the time, but are not listed as \"Chance on hit:\". For example, the Crusader enchant reads \"... often when attacking in melee ...\", and the Misplaced Servo Arm's ability reads \"Equip: Chance to ...\". The proc chances for these kinds of abilities are separate and distinct from the \"Chance on hit:\" abilities discussed above.\nThe proc rate for these abilities is generally based on an average rate &lt;a href=\"Procs%20per%20minute\"&gt;per minute&lt;/a&gt;, not a chance per strike. Whether the proc rate for such an ability on a one-hand weapon is affected by which hand the weapon is wielded in is something that needs to be experimentally verified.\nMists of Pandaria.\nBefore Mists of Pandaria, hunters were able to dual-wield melee weapons, but with the removal of a special ranged weapon slot and the ability for hunters to efectively use melee weapons, they have no need to do so. However, it still is useful for &lt;a href=\"roleplay\"&gt;roleplay&lt;/a&gt; purposes.\nLegion.\nWith the introduction of &lt;a href=\"artifacts\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, Feral and Guardian druids received &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20Ashamane\"&gt;Fangs of Ashamane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; respectively, allowing them to dual wield. This fact as well as the druid exclusive &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove%20Blade\"&gt;Dreamgrove Blade&lt;/a&gt; might suggest druids were planned to have dual wielding added to them permanently.\nHowever, excluding these two artifacts, druids have not been able to dual wield any other weapons since."}

The theme tune to the beginning title was Butthole Surfers - Dracula From Houston, but was changed in episode 8. The show started running all the way back in 2004 when the first episode was made and left for about a year. Then the team thought of making more episodes and soon, they were offered to join Machinima Inc. and have been part of the machinima community since 2007. After the shutdown of Machinima Inc in Febuary 2019, the fate of the series remains unknown, though they retained publishing rights and reuploaded the first season to their YouTube channel.\nPlot.\nTwo retarded dudes are on an epic adventure of...absolutely nothing.

Below are what theme is with each episode:\nPodcasts.\nOn April 15 2009, the first Dude, Where's My Podcast was released featuring the two main characters of the show Dave and Phil, and as of Episode 9, skitch has become a perminant host. Sometimes, Phil, Dave and skitch would invite a guest (usualy a member of Apt-T). On the podcast, they talk about games and updates on their show and other items such as TV shows and their real lives. The podcast is recorded sometime around the weekend and it used to be released every Wednesday but got pushed back to Monday/Tuesday. The podcast has also become an every other week podcast. On an extremely rare occasion, the team would do a competition, the first being a photoshop contest to be creative over Apt-T. One episode is episode 16 and 17, since the real episode 16 went wrong, so that episode was cancelled for the week.\nSeason One.\nSeason One constists of 10 episodes.\nClick on the title to download the episode.\nSeason Two.\nSeason Two constists of 15 episodes.

They aren't that big as since Apt-T is a small business, they can only give out small prizes.\nThe competition is now closed.\nFAQ.\nThis is shortened from the Actual Version on the Apt-t Forums. To get the full FAQ, click &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.apt-t.com/forums/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D3%26amp%3Bt%3D16%7C\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\n- It is filmed on the Whisperwind US Server.\n- When it's done, it's done. When it's released, it's released. Please stop asking. It does take up a lot of time making these but we thank you for your curiosity :)\n- We'll get some PayPal buttons setup soon.\n- \"Apt-T\" is short for Apartment T. It's simply where the show was revived. It's where Chris and Jacob used to live together, but Chris has now moved out with his girlfriend. Phil, has never lived at Apt T, but is an honorable r'mate of the Apt T legacy, as are Ray and Dave.\n- ABSOLUTELY... not. Nah, we're joking OF COURSE YOU CAN ;D We have two guilds on the Whisperwind Server. Of course, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; is named 'Dude Wheres My Mount?' and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly different name of 'Dude Wheres Me Mount?'. You can of course contact the top ranked members of these guilds but the guild masters if you'd rather ask them are Phillyness for the Alliance, and Avanthar for the Horde. Make sure your online or we cannot invite you! Alternatively, you can ask Jacob\u2019s character \"DaveJenkins\" for an invite to the Alliance side, or Teresa's character \"Telesuh\".\n- That is the golden question that I have heard about seven hojillion times, and the main driving reason behind writing this FAQ. Here\u2019s the deal: we have at least the next ten episodes planned out, and the amount of additional characters we will need is not even in the double digits. Yes, we\u2019ll need a few extras here and there, and those extras will be pulled almost exclusively from our Guild, so that\u2019s your incentive to join up. But keep this in mind: generally, we will just randomly ask a person that\u2019s online while we\u2019re shooting to step into a shot for a few seconds. Your chances of being in the show as an extra are small, your chances of joining up as a main character are none. I don\u2019t want to sound harsh, but to maintain our already low integrity, we will not be casting anyone outside our existing company as main characters. It would be just too hard to coordinate movements and emotes and shooting times with people that we can\u2019t talk to face to face.\n- Maybe.\n- No. He's much worse, I assure you."}

He appears as a retard alongside Phil, but as the show progresses, Phil remains an idiot, where Dave is more sane. Dave is one of those people where you never know who to trust, such as Wydwen being a rogue. One of the things Dave loves doing is anything away from Phil as he wishes he never met him.

She is voiced by Chelsea Sprauer.\nPlot Overview.\nLucia is a night elf druid who first appeared at the end of episode two. Her face was not seen until episode four and throughout the entire series, she has tried to lead them into her trap. In episode six, she explained her master needed Phil and Dave for something unknown. In episode 8, Phil jumped off the edge after a squirrel, and managed to lure Dave off the edge by getting undressed and giving him a choice between \"boobs\" and \"epics\", which Dave chose the epics, making her plan work perfectly. Phil and Dave soon found a cave, which is leading them to Lucia's master's lair.\nAppearences.\nEpisode Two.\nAt the end of the episode, in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, she spots Phil and Dave and realised they would work perfectly for her plan, with an added evil laugh.\nEpisode Four.\nAt the end of the episode, she made the comment that she needs to try and keep both Phil and Dave alive, because she would not want to lose the two most crucial peices of her diabolical plot.\nEpisode Six.\nNear the end of the episode, she appears before Phil and Dave, introducing herself as Lucia. She tells them that she has been following them both for quite a while, keeping them alive for her employer. She then tells them about the guards that &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; has sent after them, telling them to get to the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airport\"&gt;Ironforge Airport&lt;/a&gt; to escape and she also returns Phil's soul.\nEpisode Eight.\nShe appears laughing from behind the tree's, telling Phil and Dave they are terrible at staying alive. Dave asks what she is doing, which she responds to trying to lead them to her employer, but soon is interupted by Phil and a Squirrel. She wonders herself if this is a coincidence, since her employer is an apparent \"squirrel\". To distract Dave, she undresses, but Phil calls out for Dave, apparently saying that there were epics where Phil was. Dave chose the Epics, meaning he jumped off the edge, which there weren't any epics at all. This is what Lucia wanted, as she wanted to lure them off the edge for her plan.\nEpisode Ten.\nThis is the final episode of the first season, which is when Lucia finally takes Phil and Dave to her employer."}

He introduces himself as many things, but most importantly Mage Francis.\nEpisode Four.\nAfter a flirt them them both, he realises they have no goals in life, are on no quests, are not after anything rare; they are just cruisin' and brusin'. Thats where Francis steps in, and sells a \"safe map\" to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; for 500 gold. After he sells them the map, he portals away to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, but from a distance, shoots an arrow telling both Phil and Dave \"You Are In Mortal Danger\".\nEpisode Five.\nFrancis only has minor roles. The first one being when he is in the auction house, and spots both Phil and Dave, and &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;blinks&lt;/a&gt; away before they could see him. The second one being when Phil and Dave leave the auction house and he is standing right outside it, and yet again, he blinks away.\nEpisode Seven.\nYet again, a very minor role. As Phil is in the aircraft, and he flies up, we can see Francis sitting, and he notices Phil and shouts \"Sweet Monkey Christ!\""}

He is classed as a Human Paladin and is known as an idiot of the show with his stupid, but hilarious remarks. Phil can sometimes be given racist remarks, but only by Dave. He is voiced by Phil Hutton.\nPlot Overview.\nPhil is a Human Paladin and is one of the comic duo Dave and Phil. He first appears alongside Dave, where they both enter as retards. During the series, Dave may sometimes give Phil racist remarks, which at first he never really noticed the, until Episode Nine where Phil called Dave a racist. In almost every plan Dave and Phil has had in the past to get out of situations, Phil is usually the one to ruin it, except one time where he saved himself and Dave from two raptors. Phil has an obsession over Gnomes, and he just loves how silly they can be."}

After some leveling and shenanigans with tipping cows they decide to get drunk, slaughter kittens, and have the... accidental bump in the night. They soon are killed by a cat after they killed his father and experience their first death. They visit &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; for their first time and are soon thrown into the river, as they laughed at the king being a child.\nEpisode Two: The Escalator Goes This Way.\nDave wakes up in the river after being given a scare of a druid in &lt;a href=\"Aquatic%20Form\"&gt;Aquatic Form&lt;/a&gt;. He soon spots Phil pantless and after explaining that a gnome stole his pants, they both decide to get new clothes. After walking out of the clothes shop, they spot the &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; that took Phil's pants. They are soon chasing after the Gnome, but Phil soon gets distracted by the sight of a bakery. Dave is soon alone with the Gnome and is beaten up with two other friends of the Gnome after he yells \"I am being molested!\". Phil soon wakes up Dave and they go off to get a drink. A Mysterious voice can be heard talking briefly onher diabolical plot and soon gives an evil laugh.\nEpisode Three: Epic Fail (Part One).\nPhil and Dave are a little bit tipsy over their drinks. Phil soon wishes to play 'I Spy' and is terrible at it. Dave soon warns Phil to be quieter due to &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s being found nearby. Phil soon rinses his mouth with mouthwash and attracts the Murlocs, who believe it is a mating call. Phil and Dave are soon chased by a whole group of them and is saved by a Human Mage named Mage Francis. He finds out that they are both on a journey of absolutely nothing and soon has the perfect idea...\nEpisode Four: Epic Fail (Part Two).\nMage Francis hosts the WSN, a shopping network for virgin adventurers. He sells a \"safe map\" to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; for 300 &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; with which Phil pays for. He then blinks himself away from them and through a portal to Ironforge, thus being delighted he has scammed them. A Message is then sent reading:\n\"You are in mortal danger - A Friend\" which of course a Gnome mistakes it is their message as he was told to avoid it, which he then jumps off the bridge. Phil and Dave soon embark on the journey to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and are soon killed by Orcs. After reviving themselves, they realise that they are definitely not in a happy place. Dave is soon attacked by a Dragon and Phil is filled with rage (hence being a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;) and attacks the Dragon. An axe is thrown from a distance, defeating the Dragon. However, Phil and Dave believe it was Phil who defeated it. The mysterious woman from Episode Two reappears talking furthermore about her plot. The Dragon Phil and Dave encountered tells Phil (as Phil speaks &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;) he is humbled by his defeat and calls upon his friend, and Phil and Dave are soon flying to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpisode Five: Mind The Continuity.\nA Human Rogue can be seen in the dark being chased by hunters and jumps off &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Dam\"&gt;Stonewrought Dam&lt;/a&gt;. Phil and Dave are spotted by a group of people and arrive at the gates of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The people are obviously scared of the Dragon and does exactly what Phil and Dave ask. The Dragons wish to go with them but they can't as the Dragons may \"eat the Gnomes\", which in the end, one of the Dragon's do. They walk into the Tram and Phil instantly see's cupcakes. He runs over to them but is soon hit by a Tram. Dave is laughing his head off and as he arrives at the other end of the line, he starts crying as he finds out he is now in Stormwind, so they both could have taken the Tram to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; than the long way. When they leave the tram in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, they decide to get into a line at the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; bank and are distracted by a female &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei's&lt;/a&gt; tail. A masked Gnome soon walks in the bank in 'slow motion' and jumps up onto the desk ordering the banker to give him the money. Of course, hardly anybody keeps anything of value in the bank, so he got nothing. However, due to Phil being black, he takes Phil's soul as black souls sell well. Phil wakes up naked and he and Dave go across to the auction house and spot the Gnome, but soon lose him as they enter the Auction House. At the same time, Mage Francis can be seen in the background, and blinks out of existence. They hear that Phil's soul has been put up in the auction house for 5000 &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, they do not have that much, so Dave decides to leave it. As they leave, Mage is spotted again and blinks... again. Phil is very upset about Dave refusing to get his soul back and are soon approached by a Rogue named Wydwen, who tells them that they are going to steal the money!\nEpisode Six: Patent Pending.\nAs Dave and Phil walk to where they have to meet Wydwen, Dave is having dobts as he believes Wydwen may be a ninja, who may just use them to get the gold and run off, as Dave can remember when something was taken from him in the Deadmines. When they re-meet Wydwen, they see a short film on the plan. And the one thing they are warned about to be careful of are... LAZERS! Phil is soon lowered into the Vault in a \"Mission: Impossible\" like way and is distracted by the lasers due to how pretty they are. He touches a laser and triggers the alarm and Raptors are let loose. Phil falls into the vault along with Dave and try to escape, but there is no exit. Wydwen soon unlocks a door and Dave complains by asking why they didn't use Plan B. Phil and Dave soon escape the vault, but Wydwen is left trapped inside it. They are soon approached by the raptors and Dave tries to escape without Phil, leaving him for bait. Phil catches up with Dave and they both hide. Phil soon has an idea and pulls out a rocket launcher and defeats the raptors. They are soon Ironforge's Most Wanted and make their way to the top of 'Mount Menethil'. They defeat an Infernal and are approached by a Woman named Lucia (the mysterious woman from previous episodes) who brings back Phil's soul. She tells them about the guards that Bronzebeard have sent after them and that they should get to the airport and fly away from &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpisode Seven: Skip This One, Seriously.\nPhil and Dave are at the Airport and end up following a guard as that's the way the average storyline happens. They are lead to a plane, which Dave asks Phil if he knows how to fly and asks Tech, a machine with all the information to know on everything, tells him how to fly it. Apparently, you hit up to go up, and down to go down. They are soon both flying but are soon caught and split up. Phil ends up back in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; being chased by one of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. As the Dwarf locks onto Phil's aircraft, on a bridge are a bunch of Gnomes. Below the bridge are some pants and one of the Gnomes see's that the Gnomes are not claiming them, so he tries, but crashes into the Dwarf. Phil soon escapes Ironforge and meets back up with Dave. All the Gnomes end up trying to dib the pants and all jump off the bridge to get them. Phil and Dave fly higher in the sky, but then Phil spots a 'really big giant scary robot that looks absolutely nothing like the robot from Doctor Who' and get attacked. They soon enter the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and fall through absolutely nothing. They start seeing some strange things and fall through a light. We then see the Apt-T Team, other than the real Phil and the real Dave, creating episode seven of Dude, Where's My Mount? and they realise the Phil and Dave on WoW is missing. Elsewhere, the real Phil gets brain freeze and the real Dave hits the fake Phil with his car. The fake Dave tells the real Dave that he ran over the fake Phil and the real Phil and Dave look at the fake Phil and Dave in amazement. (Ow! My Head!) Dave runs through the door asking the Apt-T team \"Guess What?\" and Chris says \"You guys found Dave and Phil?\" and Jacob explains that they are not in WoW. The fake Phil and Dave walk through the door and all the Apt-T team are shocked! The fake Phil and Dave explains what happened and the Apt-T team tells them they are in a show. The fake Dave asks the most important question of them all... \"Does Phil Ever Die?\" The team explain what they have planned for future episodes, but first they have to get Dave and Phil back in WoW. The fake Phil logs into WoW with his Username being: Philisawsome and his password is ilovecupcakes1 (please not this is not a real account). He hits enter and the next adventure awaits...\nEpisode Eight: Awwww Nuts!\nPhil and Dave soon return to Azeroth when an Eagle explodes. They arrive at the gates of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; and it is not long before they are chased by a dragon they cannot reason with, but soon lose it when the dragon cannot get through the gates. They soon hear distant laughing from behind a tree. They see Lucia who tells them they both suck at living. She then tells them that her job is to lead them to her employer, but Phil gets distracted by the Squirrel, whos entered \"Dramatic Chipmunk\" style. Phil starts chasing it and Lucia is all confused. Dave tells her about when they were told the storyline involved a squirrel. Lucia soon spills that she was to take them to her 'evil' master squirrel, but has spilled out too much. She soon tries to distract them by getting undressed and bouncing around her boobs.\u21b5Note: They are not \"pixelated\". Phil accidentally kicks the squirrel off the cliff and thinks it tried to committed suicide. He decides to save it, but soon falls into the water below. Dave soon heard Phil say that there are \"epics down here\", and Dave can't decide which is better... Boobs or Epics. He goes for the epics and jumps off the cliff. When Dave hits the water, and a few other things along the way, he realises he was mistaken and Phil actually said that it was \"epic down here\" due to the wonderful view of the sun. Phil tells Dave that he found a tunnel and they enter it. They surface the water and see an Ogre patrolling the area. Phil takes the mick out of the Ogre but Dave tells him not to as the Ogre \"has an excuse\" and that the Ogre has Razorfen Down Syndrome. Dave soon has a plan on how to get past the Ogre but feels bad for it after. It involved an electric plunger but lets leave it at that. They enter further into the cave and they see a squirrel party, but in fact it was a squirrel army, and when Phil asks them for directions, they stop and stare at them all at the same time.\nEpisode Nine: Tigole Bitties.\nPhil gets chased by an army of furry little raptors (Squirrels), and he jumps off the edge heading for the lava below and the Squirrels follow him. Meanwhile, Dave walks casually into a bar/nightclub named Tigole Bitties. As Dave sits down, the waitress asks for his order which is a huge sized order... for himself as he is certain Phil is dead. The waitress tells him all they have is Chicken Strips and beer and Dave asks for 5 of each. As Dave hums to himself, Phil starts humming the same song and ruins his life by walking back into Daves mind. The waitress returns and reminds Dave that she thought he said there was going to only be one on his table, which is what Dave thought too. He tells the waitress that she is welcome to move him, but she doesn't. Instead, Phil asks her to surprise him with food, so she does just that. Phil can start hearing some music in the background called \"Tom Cruise Crazy\", which is about, of course, Tom Cruise. Then Phil and Dave start dancing around to the song with the waitress and with each other... and then they get drunk and have their accidental bump again. As Phil wakes, he can see a blurry figure heading his way. The ogre they had encountered before who they gave an electric plunger to smacks Dave and Phil out and locks them in a prison cell. As they wake up, Phil and Dave realise what they did again and Phil asks Dave to forgive him over what they did together, which he refuses to. As 3 hours pass, Phil tries to talk to Dave, but Dave thinks all Phil wants to do is either play Eye Spy, but there is nothing to spy on, Wall Ball because Dave or Phil do not have a ball or the Licence Plate game as there are no cars. As fun as that all sounded to Phil, he really wanted to show off his impressions to Dave and his impressions become really believable and Phil (for once) impresses Dave. Dave asks if this is a talent all Black People has and Phil realises that Dave is real racist to him and gets a bit upset. 6 hours, 2 minutes and 26 seconds later, Phil asks whether Dave checked the door to see if it was actually unlocked. Dave says no as they are mean to be \"High Security Prisoners\". Phil touches the door and it crashes to the ground. Phil and Dave are confused as what kind of retard puts them in a defective prison cell that even a rat could escape? Soon, the electric plunger Orge crashes through the wall and says hello to them. Phil and Dave realise who he is and Dave realises that he spoke too soon.\nEpisode Ten: AntiClimax.\nThey begin to follow the Ogre out of the cell. While Dave was rambling, Phil begins to daydream about Basketball. After the Ogre lets them go, they approach a giant throne room. A voice can be heard saying \"Welcome to my evil manufacturing plant of evil\" when it is revealed that there is a mechanical squirrel. In a state of excitement, Phil runs over the squirrel and ultimately killing him at the sight of a computer with \"shiny buttons\" saying that he hopes it has \"Oregan Trail\" However when he pushes the button, it turns out that it is a rocket sequence initiator. This causes the throne to separate and have a giant bomb erect from it. Lucia then comes in, in a complete shock that her evil master was actually destroyed. After reminding Phil that he killed the squirrel, Phil runs over and attempts to save him. After a dialogue between Dave and Lucia asking to motorboat her, she agrees to come. Phil then notices an escape door that reads \"DO NOT OPEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE\". Dave then argues that this is not just \"any circumstance.\" They agree to use it after Dave let's Phil keep the bomb. In an attempt to open the door, Phil uses a large gun and blasts it open. After commenting that this was like \"Stargate\" Dave runs through shouting about his love for Taylor Swift. After pushing the missile through the portal, there is a cliffhanger on where they end up. The episodes never continued.

Players from opposite &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s can duel, but the mechanism is primarily for dueling players of the same faction. Perfect for challenging friends or testing your skills against your peers 1 on 1, duels offer no rewards, save the sweet taste of victory.\nHow do I start a duel?\nRight-click on a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"portrait\"&gt;portrait&lt;/a&gt; and select the \"Duel\" option. A &lt;a href=\"Duel%20flag\"&gt;Duel flag&lt;/a&gt; will drop from the sky, and if the other player accepts, a countdown will start showing the time remaining before the start of the duel. The circle around your opponent will turn red, indicating that the player is now &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother option is to type \"/duel\" while having the target you wish to duel both targeted and in range. This may be more convenient if you wish to create a &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; for this function.\nDueling is disabled in most capital cities and in dungeons. Attempting to request a duel with another player in these locations will cause the on-screen notification \"Dueling isn't allowed here.\" One exception is the &lt;a href=\"Underbelly\"&gt;Underbelly&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nDueling etiquette.\nSome behaviors during a duel are considered bad form or impolite (also known as bad &lt;a href=\"etiquette\"&gt;etiquette&lt;/a&gt;) and some are considered good form.\nSome examples of usually frowned upon behavior:\nThese points are disputed among players. Discuss your opinions on the talk page. If you are having problems with any of these issues, make sure to discuss the points of your duel with your opponent before beginning.\nSome examples of good behavior:\nWhat ends a duel?\nGenerally two things will end a duel:\nYou can use /forfeit or /yield to end a duel if for example you agreed to one by accident, or some other circumstance dictates you need to leave (mob spawns and attacks a player)\nDueling in Contested territory on PvP servers.\nIt is generally discouraged to Duel in Contested territory on PvP servers. If you do decide to duel in contested territory, beware of enemy factions and their proximity to you. If you are both low on health and an enemy player shows up, it's two free Honor kills for them.\nDueling in Contested territory on PvE servers.\nPlayers of opposing faction can duel, but be careful of the opponent switching on the PvP flag during the duel, as hitting him will make you PvP-flag-enabled. When this happens, you are attackable by anyone in his faction who may have been waiting for a chance to gank you.\nWhat does winning a duel mean?\nYou win. You get glory (the system announces that you won). You don't earn &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Honor\"&gt;Honor&lt;/a&gt; or an opportunity to loot, you just get the satisfaction of knowing that you were able to defeat another player and possibly gain some experience at fighting other players that you will be able to use in the various forms of &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat. Sometimes players wager bets on duels, which means that you can earn (or lose) gold from dueling. However, the first time you win a duel, you receive the achievement."}

He holds court in &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Hold\"&gt;Bloodsail Hold&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Isle\"&gt;Plunder Isle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jessi%20Falrevere\"&gt;Jessi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magrann%20Falrevere\"&gt;Magrann Falrevere&lt;/a&gt; are his children and are also members of the Bloodsail. Falrevere's wife was left behind in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and none know her fate. Falrevere spends almost all his time aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Devil%20Shark\"&gt;Devil Shark&lt;/a&gt;\", hunting &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, and stops off in Bloodsail Hold only occasionally. He is distant, with few friends. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Zank\"&gt;Lester Zank&lt;/a&gt; and Jessi are the only people the duke allows into his con\ufb01dence.\nFalrevere is tall and lanky, with black hair, long mustache, and a short beard. He wears a tri-corner black hat pulled low over his eyes. He is neither affable nor likable but keeps his people together. He prefers to give his commodores, \ufb02eet masters, and captains free reign, but when they \"err\", he responds with veiled threats and detailed explanations of what went wrong and what could have been done to make it right. Despite his threats, he is protective of the Bloodsail Buccaneers and each of its members, and only rarely does he execute pirates under his command \u2014 though he has no problems with individual captains engaging in such brutal justice.\nBiography.\nDuke Falrevere was originally a &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeronian&lt;/a&gt; noble. Some years before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Falrevere had a &lt;a href=\"Falrevere%27s%20estate\"&gt;grand estate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest rivals on the island, and he boasted a dozen merchant ships and twice as many warships. Falrevere enjoyed sailing and was good at it; he often joined his men on the seas, patrolling for &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s and following his goods down the coast, breathing the sea air and seeing interesting sights. Falrevere was not particularly friendly or likable, but he kept his people fed and safe, and so they liked him.\nFalrevere was a staunch believer in &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; supremacy, and he thought the other races \u2014 &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s in addition to &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and the others \u2014 would be the downfall of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and even perhaps of the world. He advocated harsh measures against the other races, which made him unpopular but attracted people of his mindset.\nThird War.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; began, Falrevere was at sea with one of his battleships. A &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt; found him and the small \ufb02eet with which he sailed. The dwarf told him of the war and begged him to come to the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Drisburg\"&gt;Drisburg&lt;/a&gt;, on the northern coast of Kul Tiras. Falerevere sneered at the dwarf but agreed, and put his sail to the wind. Upon sighting Drisburg, the duke saw the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; had landed a small army on the coast and laid siege to the town. The defenders \ufb01red catapults and a few cannons at their besiegers, but there was little they could do. Falrevere calculated and came to the conclusion that if he landed and fought the Scourge, Drisburg would have about a 50% chance of surviving the onslaught, but most of its people, and Falrevere's crew, would die. Many of Drisburg's citizens were gnome and dwarf immigrants from &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and so, Falrevere's choice was clearer. He turned his ships around and bid goodbye to the doomed settlement. Many of his crewmembers railed against this action. Falrevere threw the loudest overboard.\nKnowing he could never set foot in Kul Tiras again, Falrevere sailed to the mainland for news of the war. He learned that the invasion was in full swing. &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s north had become a &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt; and twisted land, overrun with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; monstrosities. Falrevere thought this was due to humanity becoming friends with the elves and dwarves. Thus, Falrevere decided he would not be part of that land's folly anymore. He gathered his crew and announced that any &lt;a href=\"sailor\"&gt;sailor&lt;/a&gt; who wished to do so could disembark there and \ufb01ght for Lordaeron. As for himself, he was going to reestablish his estate elsewhere; a tropical island in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps, where the Scourge could not reach them and he could choose his friends. Many of his soldiers left his ships and died on Lordaeron soil, but more joined him. A month later, Falrevere found &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Isle\"&gt;Plunder Isle&lt;/a&gt; and began construction of his &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Hold\"&gt;new fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Once a stalwart Lordaeron noble, Duke Falrevere became a professional pirate lord founding the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; pirate band.\nPiracy life.\nFive years on Plunder Isle did little to improve Falrevere's disposition, and he and every pirate under his banner seemed to bear a personal grudge against everyone they come across \u2014 especially non-humans. This grudge is particularly strong when it comes to the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. Falrevere despises them because the despicable &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s provide the Raiders with &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, equipment and other support. Falrevere believes that humans rightfully deserve control of the seas. Tavern tales also say that the Blackwater Raiders are responsible for the death of Falrevere's son, &lt;a href=\"Magrann%20Falrevere\"&gt;Magrann&lt;/a&gt;, though the same tales mention that Falrevere was never fond of him.\nDuke Falrevere runs the Bloodsail Buccaneers and is usually sailing the seas on his \ufb02agship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Devil%20Shark\"&gt;Devil Shark&lt;/a&gt;\". Four commodores assist him, each of whom is in charge of about a dozen pirate ships while fleet masters command smaller groups of ships, captains command individual ships, and their \ufb01rst mates take over when they fall. Most of the Bloodsail elites are former members of Falrevere's estate \u2014 knights, reeves and the like who joined him in his exile, and about half the Buccaneers memberrs are remnants of Falrevere's original crew that betrayed Lordaeron and Kul Tiras for a life of piracy; the remaining members come from waterfront saloons and docks. As Falrevere has a reputation for treating his people reasonably well, new members are in ready supply \u2014 at least, they are enough to replace the buccaneers who fall on their missions.\nWhen a commodore falls, Falrevere personally selects a replacement. He picks those he trusts; loyalty is more valuable than skill, for Falrevere knows what an odious bunch he commands and realizes the potential for mutiny and betrayal. However, his experience as a noble proves valuable in his new role, and while he has become a thoroughly unpleasant individual, he keeps his men and women well fed with food, plunder and blood, and so most are glad to have him at their head.\n&lt;a href=\"Wallace%20Boltscrew\"&gt;Wallace Boltscrew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Annetta%20Crank\"&gt;Annetta Crank&lt;/a&gt; have crafted several &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s that could prove extremely dangerous and Falrevere is holding these vessels secretly beneath Bloodsail Hold for now, for fear of tipping his hand to the Blackwater Raiders before he is ready."}

It was the last battle between the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her allies, for control of the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and the Undead thereof.\nLoading screen.\n\"The next day, on the outskirts of Lordaeron's capital city, Sylvanas and her allies prepare to lay siege to Balnazzar's formidable defenses.\"\nPrelude.\nHaving broken free of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s waning power, Sylvanas had turned down the offer to rule the Plaguelands jointly with &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, as she considered this simply as another form of slavery. She gathered together a small army of free-willed Undead and defeated Varimathras, forcing him to pledge allegiance to her cause. The two of them marched upon Detheroc and &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%27s%20Fall%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;slaughtered&lt;/a&gt; both him and his retainers, sparing the life of his mind-slave &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt; so that he could bolster their forces with his &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; troops. In return for helping her attack Balnazzar, the last and most powerful Dreadlord, Sylvanas promised the egotistical commander control of Lordaeron.\nBalnazzar was no fool; he had reinforced the former human capital extensively after ousting &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and had gathered a very large Undead army to defend it, as well as opening a Dimensional Gateway to summon Demonic reinforcements. He was outraged by his brother's treachery, and promised to respond to Detheroc's destruction in kind.\nThe Battle.\nSylvanas and Varimathras launched a frontal assault upon Lordaeron's walls whilst Garithos attacked from the rear. The latter was most displeased to find that his &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements had gotten lost on the way to the battle; Garithos had to fight his way through the wilderness to lead them to safety. Despite the tensions between the commander and his Dwarven charges (who didn't think they were getting paid enough), this action added much needed firepower to Garithos's assault and the Alliance began to make headway against the Undead, forcing them back further and further into the city.\nLikewise, despite the terrible magical powers Balnazzar brought to bear upon his foes, Sylvanas, Varimathras and Garithos managed to destroy the Loyalists' and Insurgents' bases, claim their resources and defend their own before storming Balnazzar's base with a two-pronged attack from the front and rear before capturing Balnazzar himself.\nAftermath.\nSylvanas ordered Varimathras to kill Balnazzar, as a last test of the Dreadlord's loyalty to her. Despite his protests that the Nathrezim were forbidden to harm one another he eventually did so, or at least seemed to. Garithos then ordered them out of \"his\" city, and Sylvanas told Varimathras to kill him also, which he gladly did with no remorse. The remains of Garithos's forces were slain or fled. With this final victory, Sylvanas declared herself ruler of the Plaguelands, and renamed the free-willed Undead who had pledged themselves to her the Forsaken.\nIn fact, whether by accident or design Varimathras did not kill Balnazzar; he later resurfaced disguised as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Splinterspine\"&gt;Ras Splinterspine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fell\"&gt;Morbent Fell&lt;/a&gt; were defeated in this battle, they may have survived if their &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylacteries&lt;/a&gt; remained intact.\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nBalnazzar.\n\"Balnazzar, the most powerful of the Dreadlords, holds Lordaeron in an iron grip.

Both wolves then attack the player.\nUpon being brought to 30% health, the wolves turn friendly again and lie back down in their old spots. Defeat both to complete the stage.\nStage 4: The Farseer's Power.\nThe Projection turns hostile and attacks. Each of the four totems turn hostile as well; each one channels a buff into the projection. Destroy them to remove the buffs. Drek'Thar keeps separately channeling magic into the Projection.\nFinal Stage: Preparations.\nUpon the Projection's defeat, Drek'Thar sits down again and the other orcs walk back into the center.\nDrek'Thar gets new gossip text:\nTalk to Thrall:\nThe player receives &lt;a href=\"Thrall%27s%20Hearthstone\"&gt;Thrall's Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, both as an item and as an extra action button:\nUse either one to leave the scenario.

It shows the story of a rogue who has two sides, a presumed \"good\" side and an evil one. He tries to find his place in the world of Azeroth. The comic itself is assisted by the famous Cru the Dwarf.\nlink: http://www.drunkduck.com/A_Rogue_with_Two_Sides/\nMain Characters.\nTeodor the Rogue: The main character, Teodor is a neutral human who finds himself as the leader of his group. He is often in the company of the dwarf Ahmed.\nAhmed the Destructive: A dwarf warrior - engineer, member of the guild \"Phix0r Irish men\", he is a really destructive dwarf, capable to create anything out of... anything... in a destructive way. He once had 2 maces, but in an explosion 1 of them fell on Deserous from the comic Cru the Dwarf. \nSecondary characters.\nMush the Dwarf: Another destructive dwarf, this time a priest. And an engineer. He is not-so-destructive-as-Ahmed, and created something useful, the \"Portable HaX0r teleporter 1337\". It can teleport AT MOST 5 people to any locaton of the world. He teleported the group to Duskwood. After traveling with them to Outland, a beholder started eating his face and he hasn't appeared since. Until recently, he is seen with the Stormwind army before they attack the ogres. He telled Stormwind about the invasion.\nGeorge the Draenei: A secondary character with an Arnold Schwartzenegger accent. He wears ONLY green armor. He appeared only once in Duskwood and he was left behind dancing.\nDomicus: Leader of a trio that were invited in Teodor's party, he says that he was enslaved by dark iron dwarves in the Cauldron.\nProfessor Iliya Iliev: He is mostly silent, he is a warrior who never attacks. He leveled to 80 in a party. He is also a protection warrior, but as said, he never attacks. He bandages himself. He also discovered Varian Wrynn's fetish for alchohol.\nWeevil Grasshopper: A pocket gnome warlock, he spent all his talent points in affliction.\nVillains.\nRonlark: The main villain of Act 1, Ronlark (spelled Kralnor backwards) is a mad orc warlock, talking some times about his staff and he wants to take over Azeroth. He thinks, that the perfect way is a teleportation device. He saw the one in Teodor's group and he desires it so much, that he follows them all the way to Outland, without knowing that they didn't even seen him. \nAuthor's comment: Ronlark was raised by the guidance of the renowned orc warlock Kralnor. He got used to being killed by players of the opposing faction and he started power leveling so fast and madly, that he got so powerful, that even a Level 80 warrior with full latest PvP armor can't kill him. When he later finds the gang and provokes them, he is stabbed by a dagger of Teodor's and turns in his demonic form for a final confrontation. He battled Teodor, but was stabbed with Leonidas' sword. Finally, with a lot of effort, he was killed permanently.\nBobby the Brain and Peppy the Boar: Two hired mercenaries of Ronlark, they are sent to retrieve the teleportation device, but to this day, they have not.\nTwoo'Nutts: Two nuts are better than one... oh, wait... Twoo'Nutts is an ogre serving Ronlark. He is the one that organised an ogre army to take over Azeroth.\nDeserous: While not a large villain, he acts as one. Since the mace accident, Deserous wants to kill the one who owned the mace.\nDrakedog: Appears only when Ronlark gathered the villains.\nThe Shadowbolt warlock Starchev: Seen in a postcard and in Ronlark's gathering. He is supposedly the most extreme warlock programmer, who programmed his Shadow Bolt into custom spells.\nLeonidas: While not appearing directly, he appeared in a flashback, fighting George.\nDeath Leonidas: The ressurected Leonidas, he pretends to serve Ronlark, but he never actually did. When the warlock battled Ronlark, Leonidas stabbed his sword in the demon, weakening him severely. After the battle, he and Teodor's group go to Stormwind, where he departs. \nCohkblok: The dreamland ogre from the comic Cru the Dwarf. \nThe Scatman: While technically not a villain, the Scatman makes it up with his famous line \"STFU!\". He is a gnome player that named himself the Scatman. He often finishes the sentence \"Haven't gnome players learned, that naming their...\" with \"...character after a famous person does not make us any special, because we never were\"... he probably got used to it. He also appears as an enslaved gnome by the orc Ronlark.\nThe cultists: Two cultists, which are supposedly married, fight all the time like children. They serve some kind of lich, who heads their cult. The male cultist by far is know to have an unknown son. \nCameo Characters.\nCru the Dwarf: Appears in Duskwood saying: \"Ladies love the Cohk!\"\nVarian Wrynn: Appears commercialing Mountain Dew.\nTrool: A pant less troll, he appears as a mountain dew seller.\nQuinn: A gnome from QUEST.\nOrc Bakula: A random orc with a punk hair style. He is seen twice. 1: In a post card attacked by the Shadowbolt Warlock. 2: Seen in front of the Stair of Destiny attacked by infernals.\nStaff.\nThe Ask a Rogue rogue: Also known as the Rougston rogue, he is a spoof of the Ask a Ninja series. He appears when people least expect and he discusses random questions sent by readers on his email (real): rougston.rogue.rogue@gmail.com"}

After staking your claim to a piece of land, defeat your neighbors and expand your territory. If you can occupy legendary places and control powerful magical artifacts, you'll reach new levels of domination. However, empires must eventually fall, so be ready to put your over-extended race into decline and lead a new one to glory so you can eventually rule Azeroth.\"\nRaces.\nThe game has 16 playable Races\u20146 &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, 6 &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and 4 neutral\u2014along with one non-playable Race (&lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s):\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

There are pillars that grow in the Alabaster Shelf rich with 'em.\nJust use yer old blacksmithin' hammer and smash those pillars ta bits. Don't worry about breaking the diaminium. We'll meld it all back tagether.\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nThis'll be fun! I haven't made one of those anvils in ages!\nCompletion.\nOh, did the drakes hear you smashing? Ha ha! Yea, I suppose that'd get their attention.\nStill though, this'll be plenty of diaminium.\nNotes.\nFly due south from Ormhun Stonehammer until you reach the Alabaster Shelf. Look around for a short, narrow pillar on the ground and smash it, then pick up the &lt;a href=\"Diaminium%20Fragment\"&gt;Diaminium Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s. Smashing a pillar will agitate a nearby &lt;a href=\"Stonescale%20Drake\"&gt;Stonescale Drake&lt;/a&gt;, so be prepared to fight."}

He also makes an unofficial appearance as a supporting character in \"\". \nBiography.\nEarly history.\nGrom was young for a chieftain, only a few years older than &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt;. There had been mutterings about the mysterious circumstances under which the former chieftain had died, but the Warsong clan did not challenge Grom's leadership. Upon his ascension to chieftainship, Grom's jaw had been ritually tattooed a uniform shade of black. At some point, Grom's mate &lt;a href=\"Golka\"&gt;Golka&lt;/a&gt;, bore him a son, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;, though the exact date of his birth is unknown. After contracting the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt;, young Garrosh was sent to live in &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;, and Grom would never see him again.\nAround 11 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, Grommash led aggressive raids deep into &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; lands. When the ogres retaliated, they nearly destroyed the Warsong clan. &lt;a href=\"Golka\"&gt;Golka&lt;/a&gt; was critically injured during the battle and pleaded with him to finish her off. Disgusted at her weakness in calling for death instead of striving to live, Grom called her \"a wolf with no teeth\" and walked away, leaving her to suffer. He was similarly disgusted by the weakness of his other warriors who had \"bent like weeds.\" In truth, however, he simply lacked the strength to take the life of the one he loved, and this weakness gnawed at his heart for years to come.\nGrom quickly called upon his forces to hunt down the ogre raiders. However, it was a trap set by the ogre warlord and Grom was captured. The ogre warlord tried to break Grom's spirit by strapping him to a tree and taunting him over the course of many days. While his body withered and became emaciated, Grom's will never wavered. Declaring that \"this wolf still has teeth,\" he finally bit and killed the ogre warlord when he came too close. Grom returned to lead the Warsong clan as \"the Warlord with the Iron Will.\"\nGrommash later had the tree transported to &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt; to serve as his throne, hanging the head of his ogre tormentor from it.\nRise of the Horde.\nGrom was present at the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg%20celebration\"&gt;Kosh'harg celebration&lt;/a&gt; in Nagrand.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s became increasingly aggressive under the secret control of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. They constructed massive arenas where the orcs honed their warrior skills in trials of combat and death. During this period, a few clan chieftains spoke out against the growing depravity in their race. One such chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, warned against the orcs' losing themselves to hate and fury. His words fell on deaf ears, however, as stronger chieftains such as Grom Hellscream of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward to champion the new age of warfare and dominance.\nPrior to the creation of the Dark Portal, Grom Hellscream was the uncontested leader of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; clan, marked by his slim build and black-tattooed lower jaw. Suspicions floated away the previous chieftain's death, giving rise to the notion that Grom usurped the position, rather than gain it though heredity like Durotan. Though he was stubborn, he was the first to give heed to the prospect of war when &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; warned the other clans of a \"new old enemy\": the draenei, and he was the first to drink &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood. He invaded &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;; he was described as being a tattooed, fiery-eyed massive orc carrying a wicked two-handed axe, with raven-hued hair, and his lower jaw had been colored as black as pitch. He fought against &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; managed to crush Grom's right-hand fingers and compromise his grip on Gorehowl, but Grom only smiled. He and the rest of the orcs succeeded in taking the city.\nConsumed with the curse of this new bloodlust, the orcs sought to unleash their fury on any who stood before them. Sensing that the time had come, Gul'dan united the warring clans into a single unstoppable Horde. However, knowing that the various chieftains like Hellscream and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; would vie for overall supremacy, Gul'dan set up a puppet warchief to rule over this new Horde. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; the Destroyer, a particularly depraved and vicious orc warlord, was chosen to be Gul'dan's puppet. Under Blackhand's command, the Horde set out to test itself against the simple &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nThe Warsong clan was spared the defeats of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; since Gul'dan manipulated Grom into staying behind on Draenor. The Horde was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with Grom and his clan never having faced the humans or the Alliance in battle. Hellscream awaited a long time to venture into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and prove the dominance of his clan on the field of battle. In order to keep his troops sharp, Grom warred against the other orcish clans, but while he took savage joy in bloodlust, afterward he always felt empty, hollow, and slightly unclean for having killed his fellow orcs.\nDespite his distrust for the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, Grom was used with effectiveness by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the Second War. He alongside &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; were summoned to join the reformed Horde. Grom was then sent to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Hurkan%20Skullsplinter\"&gt;Hurkan Skullsplinter&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was reopened, Grom and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; led the attack on &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; as a distraction for a team of orcs that were about to steal certain artifacts from Azeroth.\nA pair of orcs brought their children - &lt;a href=\"Krenna\"&gt;Krenna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorgonna\"&gt;Gorgonna&lt;/a&gt; - through the Dark Portal, but Grommash did not approve of this, and exiled the family from his camp.\nWhen the artifacts were collected, Grom was said to remain in Azeroth and defend the portal. When the Alliance attacked the portal and entered Draenor an explosion was set to kill Grom and his clanmates but they were able to survive and retreated after their failure. Throughout the next months, he battled against the Alliance for the control of the Azerothian side of the Dark Portal, with it constantly changing hands. When the portal was destroyed by the Alliance, Grom was able to rally the Horde under his command and planned to find a new land for his orcs. At the same time while sad to leave him, Grom respected Rexxar's decision to leave the Horde.\nRevitalization of the Horde.\nWith the destruction of their only passage home and the successful vanquishing of the orcish strike forces, Grom and the Warsong clan were forced into hiding in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. They eked out an existence on the edge of human civilization for nearly 15 years. An older Grom came to recognize the real differences between the shamanism of his youth and the warlock magic of the Orcish Horde, and how it had dearly cost himself and the rest of his people. All of this time, Grom was forced to fight the demonic curse that had left him weakened and listless. Whereas other orcs gave into this malaise, Grom's iron will once again came to the forefront in the face of adversity, and he fought it to the end of his days. As the number of free orcs was diminished by conflict and old age, their situation looked more and more hopeless. The young and weak were unable to thrive in this harsh environment and the day of reckoning looked to be closing in on the Warsong clan.\nThen Grom had a young orc named &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; seek him out. Inspired by Thrall's courage, strength, and mercy, he accepted the young outcast and taught Thrall more of the ways of the orcs. When the humans searching for Thrall got too close, Thrall left his side. He was given Grom's necklace as a symbol of the trust placed in Thrall by Grom. The Warsong clan led by Grom was reunited with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and Thrall's lost clan, the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt;. Battling against the human &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, the two clans set about freeing and reinvigorating the orcish nations.\nReign of Chaos.\nGrom was captured by &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces until he was rescued by Thrall and his forces. When Thrall revealed his intention to have the Horde leave the human lands for good, Grom suggested they commandeer the Alliance ships to transport the Horde on their journey.\nInvasion of Kalimdor.\nGrom and his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; were separated from Thrall's fleet and made landfall on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; first. Eventually, Grom and the Warsong were found by Thrall's forces as they were fighting humans. Reinforced by Thrall's forces and his &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20troll\"&gt;Darkspear troll&lt;/a&gt; allies, Grom's forces managed to fend off the human incursion. Grom revealed to Thrall that the pass north through the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; were cordoned off by Alliance forces led by a girl named &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall thought it best to avoid conflict with the humans by having &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s fly them over the pass. While Thrall and his forces went to secure the zeppelins, Grom could not contain his bloodlust and instigated attacks on the human encampments, despite being given explicit orders from Thrall to not harm the human forces. With no other choice, Thrall and his forces aided Grom in destroying all the human encampments. Grom was elated by the humans' slaughter and felt emboldened by the resurgence of the &lt;a href=\"blood-curse\"&gt;blood-curse&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall became concerned that Grom's bloodlust would prove to be a liability; and for disobeying direct orders from Thrall, Grom was given what was presumed to be an easy, if not orcishly demeaning mission to clear land and gather lumber for the new Horde's settlement.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; were angered when Grom's orcs began to cut down the trees in Ashenvale Forest and attacked without explanation. He received help from the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Neeloc%20Greedyfingers\"&gt;Neeloc Greedyfingers&lt;/a&gt; who gave him &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; shredders for killing a &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;. The Warsongs under Grom managed to successfully defend themselves and kill their attackers, but by doing so they caught the attention of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to avenge the deaths of the night elves who had fallen against the Warsong clan and protect the forest from what he saw as further desecration, Cenarius attempted to slaughter the orcs. Cenarius appeared to know something of the history of the orcs and was convinced they were \"demon-spawned wretches\" who deserved only death. In an exchange with the demigod during one skirmish Grom vehemently told him that the orcs no longer served any demons, but Cenarius didn't believe him and continued his attempts to kill them all. The orcs quickly discovered that Cenarius was invulnerable to conventional attacks. Death at Cenarius' hands seemed inevitable.\nOne of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s accompanying the Warsong clan told Grom he sensed strange energies nearby which might be able to aid them in defeating Cenarius. When Grom investigated he discovered a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Well\"&gt;fountain of blood&lt;/a&gt;. This was the doing of the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, who had originally enslaved the orcs after &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; convinced them to drink his blood with promises of power. Mannoroth saw Cenarius as a formidable obstacle standing in the way of the Burning Legion, as he had been during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The demon poured more of his blood into the fountain on a suggestion from &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that the orcs would once again drink it and become sufficiently re-energized with demonic power to kill Cenarius. There was also another reason Mannoroth hoped they would partake of his blood...\nWhen Grom brought his troops to the fountain, the witch doctor told him that he could sense that the fountain contained demonic energy. One of Grom's soldiers told him that if they drank from the fountain they would be going against everything they had been taught by Thrall. But to Grom, these things did not matter. Desperate to preserve his clan from this new threat, Grom drank from the fountain and either persuaded or forced those under his command to do likewise. Driven again by the demonic energies, Grom attacked the demigod Cenarius' forces. Even the demigod himself was killed by the demon-enhanced orcs.\nAfter Cenarius fell, Mannoroth appeared. By drinking the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Warsong clan was once again susceptible to the vile &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt;'s control. When Mannoroth told him this Grom was horrified, but that horror was one of his final independent thoughts before Mannoroth exercised control and turned Grom and the rest of the clan into his slaves, causing them to despise Thrall and the rest of the Horde and make war on them and the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, under &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, whom Thrall had since allied with. Determined to save his old friend, Thrall confronted Grom after fighting through the corrupted Warsong clan. When Thrall reached him, Grom told him the horrible truth of the demonic curse. The orc clan chieftains had willingly taken the bloodlust offered by the Burning Legion. They were not so much cursed as doomed by the willing choices made by their power-hungry leaders.\nThrall (with the help of &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;) managed to capture Grom and bring him to Jaina, who worked with other magic-users from both her forces and Thrall's to perform a ritual that would release him from his blood curse.\nRedemption and death.\nUpon learning the truth, Thrall and Grom set out to hunt down Mannoroth and located the vile demon in what is now &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Canyon\"&gt;Demon Fall Canyon&lt;/a&gt; in Ashenvale. Bellowing in rage, the Warchief struck out at Mannoroth with the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, but the demonic leviathan shrugged off the attack and stunned Thrall with a vicious counterattack. After being taunted by Mannoroth that they were the same, Grom charged him and sank &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; into Mannoroth's chest, shattering the breastplate and slicing through to the infernal heart of the demon. Mortally wounded, Mannoroth exploded in an inferno of flame, and Grom took its full fury alone. In a burst of hellfire, Mannoroth the Destructor was dead...\nWith nothing remaining of the pit lord but the shattered armor, Thrall made his way to where Hellscream lay in the dust. The crimson glow faded from his eyes; the blood curse which had damned his race for decades was finally over. With his best friend and Warchief at his side, the still-undefeated chieftain died at the site of his greatest triumph, both over the corruption of the Burning Legion and over the whispers of his own soul. With Mannoroth gone, the Legion's hold on the orcish race was forever shattered. Even those who had drunk the blood of Mannoroth (willingly or otherwise) found that the curse had lifted and that their souls were free from the shackles of demonic corruption. With that knowledge, Grom Hellscream left the mortal plane a redeemed spirit.\nLegacy.\nGrom has become a center of heated dispute after his death. Hellscream is generally viewed in the Horde as a hero and a savior, who fought a constant battle with his inner self which ultimately culminated into the death of Mannoroth and the end of the Blood Curse on the entire orcish race. However, he was also the very first chieftain to readily agree and eagerly partake of Mannoroth's blood, and retake it once more in Ashenvale, which indirectly resulted in the death of the night elf demigod Cenarius. To the outrage of the night elves, the orcs refuse to claim responsibility for Grom's actions. It was not the orcs who killed Cenarius, but fel orcs, and it was the orcs who took it upon themselves to slay their wayward brethren. By taking responsibility for Grom's actions the orcs would be acknowledging that they are still the &lt;a href=\"old%20Horde\"&gt;old Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nNonetheless, despite Grom's two instances of self-chosen corruption, he still remains a cultural hero, and his death is honored every year by thousands of Horde citizens. The legacy of Hellscream continues to be the major dampener that prevents orcs and night elves from cultivating a cordial relationship.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall mentioned that &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; reminded him of Grommash, in that both were natural leaders.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; Thrall met Grom's son, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;. Having suffered the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Pox\"&gt;Red Pox&lt;/a&gt; and lived in quarantine in Garadar, Garrosh remained uncorrupted and was the leader of &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;The Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; in Nagrand. The young Hellscream was ashamed of his father's legacy, not knowing of Grom's sacrifice, and feared he would repeat his father's mistakes and become the second Hellscream to damn the orcs. Thrall showed Garrosh the truth, breaking the young orc out of his depression and filling him with pride. Garrosh would follow Thrall back to Azeroth, where he took his father's place as chieftain of the Warsong and eventually became Warchief of the Horde... before he was later deposed after turning his fellow leaders and the Alliance against him. \nThe great hall where Thrall held court was dubbed &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of Thrall's fallen friend. Its successor under Garrosh retained the name.\nGrom lies buried in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, in the area now known as &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Canyon\"&gt;Demon Fall Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, which is near the site where he destroyed Mannoroth. Leaving a candle here during the &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Festival\"&gt;Harvest Festival&lt;/a&gt; will allow the player to read \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Horde%27s%20Hellscream\"&gt;The Horde's Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMonument.\nLocated in the southeastern part of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, there stands a &lt;a href=\"monument%20to%20Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;monument to Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, located presumably at the spot he was slain in the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s death. The exact coordinates are and the inscription reads as such:\nSpirit.\nDuring Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Grommash's spirit briefly manifested alongside those of other famous orcs in response to an offering prepared by an orc adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;. Before disappearing, Grom acknowledged that the memory of his sacrifice had been used for many different causes, but he did not fault anyone for fighting for a better future for the orcs. His one regret was that he had not been alive to guide his son &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; down a better path, and he hoped that Garrosh's fate would serve a warning to the rest of the orcs.\nAppearances.\nGrom Hellscream is playable in missions of '. His clan is also clearly evident throughout the human campaigns. His missions in the \"Warcraft II\" expansion include destroying an order of &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; loyal to &lt;a href=\"Mogor\"&gt;Mogor&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt;. Grom is one of a few heroes of the orcish Horde that makes a reappearance in both the ill-fated ' game and the \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Clans\"&gt;Lord of the Clans&lt;/a&gt;\" novel which both roughly lay out the same story. Grom also makes an appearance (unnamed) in the short story \"&lt;a href=\"Unbroken%20%28short%20story%29\"&gt;Unbroken&lt;/a&gt;\", by &lt;a href=\"Micky%20Neilson\"&gt;Micky Neilson&lt;/a&gt;, during the sacking of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrom was noted for his horrific, earsplitting shriek of a battle cry, which he often used to interrupt people, his chest thrust forward and his jaw open wider than it seemed possible. He also had ritual tattoos, the most prominent of which was his lower jaw, completely tattooed in solid black. Such work was done by a trained orc tattooist with the tip of a sharp, narrow blade repeatedly dipped in black ink and a small hammer. Even when done by experienced hands, it would have been very painful, and the jaw alone would have taken more than several hours. The tattooist that worked on Grom's son Garrosh was the apprentice of Grom's tattooist, and claimed that Grom did not sweat during his tattoo session.\nBoth \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Clans\"&gt;Lord of the Clans&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Rise of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" noted that Grom was slender and thinner than other orcs, something that is sometimes reflect by artwork, but not always. His \"&lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20War\"&gt;Lords of War&lt;/a&gt;\" sequence showed how emaciated he had become after being caught by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Grommash was resisting against the humans. He hid in an &lt;a href=\"Ork%20Reservation\"&gt;orcish reservation&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href=\"pseudo-dragon\"&gt;pseudo-dragon&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Singe\"&gt;Singe&lt;/a&gt;. Because he wanted to unite back the scattered clans of the Horde, he got captured by the orcish traitors &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, who drugged him with &lt;a href=\"black%20ale\"&gt;black ale&lt;/a&gt; and had their henchman &lt;a href=\"Uglaz\"&gt;Uglaz&lt;/a&gt; bring him to &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall saved him, and Hellscream was the one who provoked Blackmoore's death in the end.\nAccording to the game, Grommash was also the one who killed &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt; for the betrayal of his clan during the last battle for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Second Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nPersonality.\nGrom Hellscream moves with a warrior's grace and his reflexes are fast and abrupt. He is proud of his achievements but willingly serves Thrall (or any other master), as he is content in his role as chieftain of the Warsong. Grom is honorable and admires his enemies' fighting prowess. He is devoted to his race and his traditions. Though Thrall has calmed his soul, Grom still seethes with suppressed rage. He speaks with a deep, guttural voice that is used to command.\nCombat.\nGrom is devastating in melee and he knows it. He eagerly charges into the thickest part of any battle, giving in to his rage, and lays waste with the mighty Gorehowl. Though he knows that slaying enemy wizards and healers is to his tactical advantage, he cannot resist going toe-to-toe against powerful melee fighters. Against such opponents he uses his critical strike and maximum damage abilities, and uses blade whirlwind when lesser foes surround him.

A living legend, Grommash is a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; of great strength and fury. Following the advice of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, his disguised son from the prime timeline, Grommash refused to accept the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;Blood Pact&lt;/a&gt; and serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. With Garrosh's knowledge of war machines and his clan's own power, he rallied the orcs of to create the Iron Horde, setting his sights on invading and conquering &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

There had been mutterings about the mysterious circumstances under which the former chieftain had died, but the Warsong clan did not challenge Grom's leadership.\nGrommash led aggressive raids deep into &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; lands. When the ogres retaliated, they nearly destroyed the Warsong clan. &lt;a href=\"Golka\"&gt;Golka&lt;/a&gt;, Grom's mate, was critically injured during the battle and pleaded with him to finish her off. Disgusted at her weakness, Grom called her \"a wolf with no teeth\" and walked away, leaving her to suffer. He was similarly disgusted by the weakness of his other warriors who had \"bent like weeds.\"\nGrom quickly called upon his forces to hunt down the ogre raiders. However, it was a trap set by the &lt;a href=\"Unidentified%20ogre%20warlord\"&gt;ogre warlord&lt;/a&gt; and Grom was captured. The ogre warlord tried to break Grom's spirit by strapping him to a tree and taunting him over the course of many days. While his body withered and became emaciated, Grom's will never wavered. Declaring that \"this wolf still has teeth,\" he finally bit and killed the ogre warlord when he came too close. Grom returned to lead the Warsong clan as \"the Warlord with the Iron Will.\"\nGrommash later had the tree transported to &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt; to serve as his throne, hanging the head of his ogre tormentor from it.\nHellscream.\nGrom instated the custom of &lt;a href=\"Mak%27Rogahn\"&gt;Mak'Rogahn&lt;/a&gt; to cull the shame from that day the ogre raid nearly wiped out the clan. He was haunted and regretful over his weakness that led to &lt;a href=\"Golka\"&gt;Golka&lt;/a&gt;'s death. His thoughts often turned towards pleading for a warrior's death and constantly struggled to keep his weakness from overtaking him. While sleeping, a Warsong orc woke him and insisted to have a mak'rogahn with a clan-mate. Grommash agreed and oversaw the duel. After it was over, a strange but familiar orc stepped in and began speaking about redemption for the orcish race. Grommash realized that the guards who were supposed to guard entrances had been watching the previous duel and so he sent them and the &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;stranger&lt;/a&gt; into the pit. As Grommash watched the shackled stranger fight, he noticed similarities in his fighting style. When the battle ended, Grommash cut with &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the shackles. The chieftain then took the stranger into his camp and started speaking about the past, as well as about the future.\nThe stranger told him about a prosperous future with new weapons and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;, and without slavery and . The stranger showed the chieftain &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;a shard&lt;/a&gt; of an artifact that was to prove his words. Both of them went to the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Stones of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; but the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Zhanak\"&gt;Zhanak&lt;/a&gt; was uncertain about this. Grommash activated the object and was shown visions about the rise and fall of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the main universe. He also saw a figure of an orc raised and named as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. At that moment, the stranger interrupted the visions, telling him that the visions killed Zhanak. The stranger took Gorehowl and kicked the shards out of Grommash's hands, ending the visions. Once he calmed himself, Grommash wanted more answers. The stranger responded that this is the price for Gul'dan's power which now needs to be stopped. He added that the alliance of the orcish clans can exist without the corruption and darkness. Grommash vowed to have Golka's strength in averting the fate the stranger revealed to him. He was willing to do what he was just told. Their next move was to warn the other clans and overthrow Gul'dan's &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;masters&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverthrowing the Legion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the alternate Draenor, he was able to persuade Grommash not to drink &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood, but instead to prepare a technologically empowered army in order to ambush the pit lord Mannoroth, and overthrow the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to enslave the orcs. When revealed his intention to empower the orcs, Grommash sent Garrosh to learn more.\nGarrosh went with Grommash to the gathering of the orc clans, in response to Gul'dan's summons to imbibe the demon's blood. Grommash accepted the drinking horn from the warlock, but at the last moment refused to drink from it, pouring the glowing blood onto the floor and incurring the wrath of Mannoroth. With the pit lord revealed, at Garrosh's signal the hidden Iron Horde burst forth, firing ballistae and chains at Mannoroth. The orcs prepared to launch an &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Mannoroth, but the mighty demon quickly overcame their attempts to trap him and began to lay waste to the orc army. \nGrommash, seeing his chance to defeat the pit lord, seized the now unmanned iron star and single-handedly launched it at the demon, but the projectile fell short, its explosion serving only to anger the pit lord. As Mannoroth prepared to strike afresh at the orcs, Grommash soared out of the fire and smoke, leaping through the explosion to drive &lt;a href=\"%3AGorehowl\"&gt;:Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; directly into the pit lord's forehead.\nAs the pit lord released a devastating explosion in his death throes, a stunned Garrosh picked himself up off the ground and dived for Grom, pulling him out of harm's way. This reflects another departure from the prime universe, in which &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; slew &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; only to be killed by the resulting explosion.\nWith the Legion's plot foiled, Gul'dan was imprisoned, and the united Iron Horde was revealed. Grommash proclaimed a glorious future for their people and launched a campaign across the continent to conquer or destroy all opposition. Gul'dan's plans to invade Azeroth were also re-purposed to suit this new Horde.\nCode of Rule.\nGrommash Hellscream sent an emissary to the ogres at &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that they would have to prove their worth or be made extinct. A few hours later the Iron Horde began to lay siege to Highmaul under Grom's command. Not long after , seeing that the Iron Horde could possibly seize Highmaul, sought peace with the Iron Horde and personally met with Grommash. During this meeting, Imperator Mar'gok remarked that even with their strength the Iron Horde was weak due to lacking the magical prowess of the ogre-magi. The Imperator then remarked that even if the Iron Horde did claim Highmaul, they would lose an entire year in removing the bodies so they could successfully live within the city. Grommash in response retorted that not only would they win, but that they had no desire to dwell within Highmaul; they simply wanted the ogres dead. However he did acknowledge the might of their sorcery and ordered the Imperator to teach them their arts, and in return, the ogres would be spared. After a brief council, Imperator Mar'gok tried to get Hellscream to call off the siege before beginning the training of orc mages, pointing out that each ogre death was one less person who could teach the orcs. However, Hellscream was adamant that the ogres teach them the magic of the breakers immediately, and knowing he had no choice if he wished to save Highmaul Imperator Mar'gok conceded to his demands. \nAt Hellscream's command Imperator Mar'gok and his ogres fought orc warlocks who the Iron Horde had taken prisoner and after witnessing the ogres winning (despite the losses they suffered) Grommash called off the siege of Highmaul and declared the ogres of Highmaul to be henceforth servants of the Iron Horde. Approaching the Imperator, the Warchief of the Iron Horde ordered him to deliver all orc slaves in Highmaul to and warned that any attempt at treachery or rebellion would see them returning to claim his blood.\nThe Iron Horde.\nAs the Warchief of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Grommash exerts authority over most of the orc clans (excepting those who rejected membership, such as the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt;, the and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Exiles\"&gt;Shadowmoon Exiles&lt;/a&gt;). He named Garrosh the new warlord of the Warsong clan and gave him his Gorehowl.\nHe set out to conquer the draenei strongholds of in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;holy temple&lt;/a&gt; in , as well as the Frostwolf holdouts in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong his orders were doubling of research and engineering efforts at the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Siegeworks\"&gt;Iron Siegeworks&lt;/a&gt; in Frostfire Ridge, forcing &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s of Shadowmoon Valley into submission, as well as subdue and subvert the magic of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nGrommash is first seen after the is destroyed in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, standing upon a rise with the other Warlords. He commands his forces to attack the Azerothians and the rescued Frostwolf and draenei prisoners, but they escape to the harbor and sail off to safety. However, as they leave he threatens to find them and make them pay for disrupting his plans.\nIn Shadowmoon Valley, showed the Alliance Commander a vision of how Grommash had \"convinced\" Ner'zhul to join the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later, Ner'zhul showed the warchief the power of the Dark Star when he summoned &lt;a href=\"Arkeddon\"&gt;Arkeddon&lt;/a&gt;. Grommash, impressed, ordered the invasion of Karabor to begin.\nAfter one of the Azerothian commanders had been captured by &lt;a href=\"Azuka%20Bladefury\"&gt;Azuka Bladefury&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Mok%27gol%20Watchpost\"&gt;Mok'gol Watchpost&lt;/a&gt;, they witnessed a council meeting between Hellscream, Bladefury and Blackhand. He berated Blackhand for allowing the Alliance and Horde forces to continue to assault the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Foundry&lt;/a&gt; and also inquires into the status of Bladefury's plan. After the meeting, he departs to Tanaan.\nHe is later briefly seen with Kargath in &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, capital of ogres, with whom the Iron Horde had allied, and observes Kargath in the coliseum. When Kargath dies and enters, Grommash is already gone.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Azuka%20Bladefury\"&gt;Azuka Bladefury&lt;/a&gt; is killed, the allied forces at the confront Hellscream. &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Exarch Yrel&lt;/a&gt;/ demands that he surrender, but he refuses. He then declares that if they dare challenge him, he will be waiting in Tanaan, which at this point, he and his forces retreat through the gates.\nAn Inside Job.\nGul'dan approaches Grommash at &lt;a href=\"Bladefury%27s%20Command\"&gt;Bladefury's Command&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; and mocks the Iron Horde's failures and losses, which include the death of the Warchief's son; a point that Gul'dan punctuates by throwing Gorehowl at Grom's feet. Gul'dan re-opens his invitation to drink the blood of Mannoroth. Grommash, saddened by his son's death and wishing to preserve his honor, does not agree to Gul'dan's offer and attempts to strike him down, only to be effortlessly incapacitated by the warlock's magic. Gul'dan opens the offer to all other orcs present, promising them power like his if they accept. Kilrogg steps up in order to drink the blood, with Grommash urging him in vain not to do so. After Kilrogg's transformation, Gul'dan takes control of the Iron Horde.\nHellfire Citadel.\nGrommash was held captive by Gul'dan and taken to a vantage point in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking his iron citadel. Gul'dan mocked Grom for his choices and bathed the citadel in twisted fel-blood to better serve his needs. Grom's will is not yet broken, however; he ensured his usurper that the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; who had challenged his Iron Horde would defy Gul'dan and the Legion also.\nGrommash was then moved inside under the captivity of the demonic commander &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Lord%20Zakuun\"&gt;Fel Lord Zakuun&lt;/a&gt;. Grommash proved resistant to Zakuun's torture methods, vowing that the Iron Horde would never be slaves even as Zakuun ridiculed him for holding out hope. The heroes eventually arrived and confronted Zakuun, with Grommash taking every opportunity to taunt and threaten the Fel Lord. When Zakuun was slain by the heroes, Grommash broke free from his bonds. Taking Zakuun's axe as a weapon, Grommash thanked the heroes before having them leave the scene as he worked to carve a trophy from Zakuun's corpse.\nGrom is present during the battle against &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; at the Black Gate. He fights alongside &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and champions of Azeroth in overcoming the mighty demon lord, although Gul'dan escapes his wrath. After the battle, Grommash proclaims the victory and the freedom of to the gathered soldiers, and will work to rebuild his world alongside his &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe draenei and orcs lived together in peace for years, but when the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; arrived, the draenei became fanatical and attempted to forcibly convert the orcs to the Light. By the time a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; returned roughly thirty years after Archimonde's defeat, Grommash has become Warchief of the : the uncorrupted orcs of Draenor who had banded together against the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; draenei. At some point, he had a &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Hellscream\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; who joined the Lightbound and rose to the rank of &lt;a href=\"exarch\"&gt;exarch&lt;/a&gt;. He would personally choose &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; as his second in command during the &lt;a href=\"war%20between%20the%20Lightbound%20and%20the%20Mag%27har\"&gt;war between the Lightbound and the Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; elevating her to the rank of overlord.\nAs the Mag'har and &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; clashed, events on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would see to a &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of this, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; sought to travel to the and call upon the debt the Mag'har owed to the Horde for liberating them from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. During Overlord Geya'rah's interrogation of Eitrigg and a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde champion&lt;/a&gt;, the pair having been taken prisoner on suspicion, Warchief Hellscream would arrive and recognize the two as coming from Azeroth. After hearing Eitrigg's request for aid, Geya'rah would object on the grounds that the Mag'har couldn't pledge soldiers to aid the Horde when they faced enemies of their own. Believing that having a common foe would soothe Geya'rah's wariness, Warchief Hellscream requested that the two Horde emissaries assisted Geya'rah in putting down an ogre uprising led by &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%2C%20Greatson%20of%20Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing securing Beastwatch against an attack by the Lightbound, Warchief Hellscream and Overlord Geya'rah were approached by and informed that the entire Lightbound army was spotted heading towards them. While Lantresor gathered every orc he could to Beastwatch, Hellscream held the line with his forces. During the battle, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;High Exarch Yrel&lt;/a&gt; appeared on the battlefield and offered the Mag'har one last chance to embrace the light. Warchief Hellscream ordered Overlord Geya'rah to gather and safeguard the Mag'har, and escape to Azeroth with Eitrigg and the adventurer. Just as Eitrigg activated the shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Hellscream and Lantresor charged against the Lightbound. \n&lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg, the adventurer, the remaining Mag'har, several gronn and ogres successfully teleported to Durotar and pledged themselves to the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; presumes Grommash did not survive his encounter with Yrel.\nSpeculation.\nDespite being overthrown by Gul'dan, Grommash is credited to have sent several ships on missions. This may reflect the ignorance of the Alliance and Horde intelligence which assumed that Grommash was still in charge of the Iron Horde and were not yet aware of Gul'dan taking it over.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Rexxar had a stash of goods in front of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Fortress\"&gt;the fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe first Grommash Hold was located in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Valley of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, and was referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Fortress\"&gt;Fortress&lt;/a&gt;\" by the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Grunt\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to be designed as a direct upgrade of the &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; model, being larger, built into the cliff-side, and with a distinct interior.\nThrall held court inside the hold, while outside a traveler would find a monument to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' triumph over demonic influence. &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, the demon lord who cursed the bloodline of the orcs, fell in battle to Thrall and Grom Hellscream. Mannoroth's skull and armor were displayed on the trunk of an ancient tree, bearing a plaque that told of the orcs' victorious transformation and reminded readers of the mistakes of the past.\nThe throne room had thick stone walls and a lack of windows that kept it chilly. Thrall liked it that way, preferring for visitors to be slightly uncomfortable when in the presence of their leader.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt; resided here as well, but after the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate incident&lt;/a&gt;, many civilians gathered in front of the building while Thrall, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; discussed the events.\nElemental Unrest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, meetings of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; leaders gathered in the hold, once during the celebrations in honor of the Northrend campaign and later, Thrall met with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; where he named Garrosh the Warchief. \nFollowing an ambush on the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; arrived here, accused the new Warchief and challenged him to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. The troll chieftain later left the Hold after years of residing here.\nThis Grommash Hold was replaced by the current Hold, designed by Garrosh in his image of the Horde's \"glory days\", located in the Valley of Strength. The Mannoroth bones were moved inside of the new Hold and hung above Garrosh's throne. At the center of the hold is a massive hide rug depicting a map of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde leadership used this rug to plan their war strategies.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; the Horde leaders met here to discuss Garrosh's plan to conquer &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIt was here that &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; informed Warchief Garrosh about the naval victories against the Alliance and about the &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;new uncharted land&lt;/a&gt; in the south.\nGarrosh Hellscream left Grommash Hold and now sits upon his new throne within the Underhold, leaving the Kor'kron Dark Shaman, to guard it in his absence while the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Horde rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;lay siege&lt;/a&gt; to the city.\nAfter dethroning Garrosh, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; became the new Warchief and took the place on the throne.\nLegion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin was brought hurt and poisoned. The building became closed to visitors, excepted for &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s which &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; let pass. While sitting on the throne, Vol'jin declared &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; Warchief and died right after. Following his funeral ceremony, the building was closed but opened later with Saurfang residing within as leader of the orcs.\nHorde leaders dined here after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, a portal was opened here to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. After its fall, Sylvanas commanded the Horde from the hold and was known to hold several meetings within, including the private meeting with her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s when she sent them after Varok Saurfang in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the course of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde split between &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; loyalists and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries. Sylvanas and her loyalists had secured Orgrimmar, where Sylvanas commanded them from Grommash Hold during the conflict. After the revolutionaries and the Alliances secured the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, to which she accepted. The Mak'gora ended with the death of Saurfang and Sylvanas abandoning the Horde.\nFollowing these events, the Horde reunited once more and held Saurfang's funeral outside of the hold.\nAfterward, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; relocated to Grommash Hold where he listened to the petitions of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Dresh\"&gt;Commander Dresh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Sonji\"&gt;Bladeguard Sonji&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, Baine was approached by &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt;, who asked to let his people join the Horde. The High Chieftain was forced to decline due to the Horde's allies struggles. They proved their worth, and Baine apologized and realized that he was wrong to dismiss them, eventually welcoming the vulpera into the Horde.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the Horde leadership forewent selecting a new warchief in favor of a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;council-style&lt;/a&gt; leadership.\nShadows Rising.\nGrommash Hold was where Horde Council held their meetings. One was derailed by a failed assassination attempt on &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; queen and a key ally, which prompted the Horde leadership to empower &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; with aiding Talanji against the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;rising threat&lt;/a&gt; against her.

It is a well-defended fortress, from which the Warsong clan dominate the eastern half of Nagrand. It is named for , chieftain of the Warsong clan. The entrance is called the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Grommashar\"&gt;Gates of Grommashar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a throne area where a tree, the one Grommash had been tied to may years ago, was moved. On the tree is the skull of a &lt;a href=\"Unidentified%20ogre%20imperator\"&gt;former Imperator&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter Grommash Hellscream, the chieftain of the Warsong clan, formed the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he became its warchief, leaving his previous role as chieftain. \nShortly after its formation, the orcs attacked &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; and sent a message to negotiate. &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Ko%27ragh\"&gt;Ko'ragh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vareg\"&gt;Vareg&lt;/a&gt; entered the camp and started negotiating with the Warchief. Mar'gok noticed how the camp has changed.\nHe subsequently chose &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; (who, unbeknownst to Grommash, was not only his son, but from a different timeline) to succeed him as ruler of the Warsong clan. Garrosh accepted this position and took up residence in the Warsong stronghold of Grommashar. From here he oversaw the war effort against the encroaching &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces in Nagrand.\nFollowing several Alliance and Horde victories throughout Nagrand, they eventually targeted Grommashar itself. In a &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Grommashar\"&gt;long and vicious battle&lt;/a&gt;, Grommashar was breached, and the defenders were eventually defeated. At the end of the battle, Garrosh was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance. They clashed but, before long, Thrall challenged Garrosh to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh eagerly accepted the challenge and they proceeded to the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Stones of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. There, Garrosh was defeated and killed by Thrall, who emerged victorious. The fall of Grommashar marked the end of Warsong dominance in Nagrand and was an important blow to the Iron Horde.\nLayout.\nGrommashar is built into a crescent-shaped canyon. It has two entrances, one in the east and one in the west. An almost dried up river runs through the fortress, which begins in the lake surrounding Telaar. The entire base is dominated by towers, which are especially prominent near the entrances. \nSpeculation.\nIn Hellscream.\nGrommashar may have been the encampment which Garrosh entered after traveling through time, to convince Grommash to join his cause.\nOriginal timeline.\nIn the original timeline, Grommashar was very likely destroyed when Draenor shattered and became &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the land where it once stood in Nagrand having crumbled into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;."}

Upon being slain by the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, Grond's body fell and became the region of &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, while his head in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; became known as the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;. The boulders that toppled from his body during his clash with the Sporemounds gave rise to the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s and in turn their descendants\u2014the various &lt;a href=\"breakers\"&gt;breakers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014while the elemental energies contained in the debris gave rise to Draenor's first physical &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiography.\nWhen Aggramar came across Draenor in his travels, he was intrigued by the world, but foresaw doom for the planet if the Evergrowth was allowed to grow unchecked, as it would eventually consume everything on the world, including the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elemental spirits&lt;/a&gt;. Once that happened, the Evergrowth would devour itself, and Draenor would be left a wasteland devoid of life. Aggramar's natural affinity for order compelled him to take action, but he did not wish to completely destroy Draenor's plant life, only to temper it. Thus, he would need to neutralize the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s, the heart of the Evergrowth's power.\nThe titan considered destroying the Sporemounds himself, but since his power was so great it risked irreparably damaging or even shattering Draenor and because he could not stand guard over the world forever, he instead decided to create a mighty servant in his own image to uproot the Sporemounds. Aggramar swept his colossal hand over the world and wove its fire, air, earth, and water energies into a massive elemental storm. He channeled the roaring tempest into Draenor's largest mountain, sending the energies blasting through the crust and causing shockwaves of force to echo around the globe. The mountain itself groaned to life and rose up on two colossal legs. Raw elemental power crackled over a craggy hide crisscrossed by veins of molten stone. Aggramar named his creation Grond, and he would serve as the titan warrior's hand on Draenor.\nBattle with the Sporemounds.\nAt his creator's command, Grond set out to conquer the Evergrowth. As the walking mountain lumbered over the world, lakes of elemental fire trailing in his footsteps, he dredged out seas, carved valleys and forged mountains to separate the Evergrowth. He then marched toward the nearest Sporemound, which towered nearly as high as a giant. Grond smashed through the Sporemound's entangling roots with ease before stabbing his jagged fingers into the creature and then tearing it from the world's surface with a single mighty heave. The other Sporemounds shivered in agony at the destruction of their kin. Mere roots would not topple Grond; instead, the Sporemounds would need to adapt.\nEach Sporemound drained the surrounding wilds of life essence, leaving behind only withered tracts of land. Infused with these energies, the Sporemounds arose to walk the world. There were three, each embodying a different region of the Evergrowth: &lt;a href=\"Zang\"&gt;Zang&lt;/a&gt;, whose hide was covered in swamps and mushroom thickets; &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, who was covered with primal forestlands; and &lt;a href=\"Naanu\"&gt;Naanu&lt;/a&gt;, who wore a fleece of dense jungles. As one the Sporemounds moved against Grond, and Draenor buckled under the weight of the warring giants. Aggramar watched the battle from the skies over Draenor. Zang, Botaan and Naanu were determined to protect the Evergrowth at any cost, and through their communal sentience they moved in perfect unison against Grond, nearly overwhelming him. However, like his creator, Grond possessed a will of steel and refused to give up. As the calamitous battle raged, the tide shifted between each side. The Sporemounds were resilient, but could not hold out forever against Grond's attacks. Zang, the smallest of the Sporemounds, suffered the most and was the first to fall. Grond took hold of it and tore it in half. Its rotting body would later transform into the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Sea\"&gt;Zangar Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Grond pressed his attack against Naanu and crushed it between his hands. The creature collapsed to the ground, where its broken husk would slowly sink into the earth and become the region of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. Only Botaan remained, but Grond was weakened and scarred by the battle. Botaan sensed its opponent's weakness but would need more power to defeat the giant. It leeched the life essence from the bodies of Naanu and Zang, absorbing them and growing to a monstrous size. Still, Botaan remained cautious, evading Grond's direct assaults while entangling him in thousands of small vines that gradually burrowed into the cracks and wounds on his skin. Grond considered them a mere nuisance and ignored them until it was too late. The vines wrenched open his existing wounds and tore open new fissures across his body. Grond collapsed beneath his own weight and crumbled to pieces, the bulk of his corpse forming a mountain range now known as &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, at the edge of a region later called &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nChildren of giants.\nDuring the battle between Grond and the Sporemounds, pieces of their bodies had fallen to the earth and given rise to new types of creatures. From the seeds and roots of Zang, Naanu and Botaan, many unique beings sprouted, the greatest of which were the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;, while from the largest boulders that had toppled from Grond, the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s arose. Though not as mighty as Grond, their shadows still loomed large over the land. Much of the stony debris that had fallen from the giant also contained the elements of fire, air, earth and water, which coalesced into pools of power from which &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; spirits took shape for the first time in Draenor's history \u2014 something made possibly by the Sporemounds and their consumption of much of the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed the elemental spirits to grow in power. The elementals were initially few in number, but their population exploded after Grond's defeat, causing countless elementals to emerge around his mountainous remains, with the most powerful among them being &lt;a href=\"Incineratus\"&gt;Incineratus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aborius\"&gt;Aborius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gordawg\"&gt;Gordawg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalandrios\"&gt;Kalandrios&lt;/a&gt;. They lamented Grond's death and vowed to dwell in his corpse's shadow forever, with their home being the remains Grond's head, which formed a small island in the middle of a tranquil lake. This place would eventually become known by mortal cultures as the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the aid of power granted to them by Aggramar, the colossals eventually sacrificed themselves to destroy Botaan, killing hundreds of genesaur and destroying the communal sentience of the Evergrowth. The life energies and spores released by Botaan's destruction caused many new forms of plant life to arise, but also settled on and weakened the bodies of the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 pieces of the colossals just as the colossals had been pieces of Grond. This led to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; races. The descendants of Grond, known collectively as the &lt;a href=\"breakers\"&gt;breakers&lt;/a&gt;, would continue to battle the descendants of the Sporemounds, the &lt;a href=\"primals\"&gt;primals&lt;/a&gt;, for millennia.\nWhen orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; learned to peacefully commune with the elements at the Throne of the Elements, becoming the first orcish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, they transformed Grond's head into a crude temple. When the ogres of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; witnessed the power of the shaman first hand, they decided to take this elemental power by force. The Gorian leader, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Molok\"&gt;Imperator Molok&lt;/a&gt;, sent an army to drive away the orcs and claim the Throne of the Elements for the empire. The ogres eagerly and carelessly dissected the Throne with their &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; spellwork, ignorant to the mix of raw titan and elemental power that lingered in Grond's remains. One day, the dissonance between the ogres' magic and Grond's residual energies ignited an explosion that blew apart the temple the orcs had carved from the giant's skull and killed every Gorian sorcerer inside the structure, leaving behind only a few standing stones. This disaster threw the elements out of balance all across Draenor, but as Molok simply sent more sorcerers to continue their heedless tampering with the Throne, the orcs were driven to action and united into a single army to wage war on the ogres."}
