If the Dragonborn waits to reach level 9 without visiting Falkreath, the Jarl will request to see them by sending a letter via &lt;a href=\"Courier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt;. Starting the quest via letter will skip the \"&lt;a href=\"Rare%20Gifts\"&gt;Rare Gifts&lt;/a&gt;\" quest for Siddgeir.\nThe starting quest for the Jarl to obtain a drink is a \"radiant\" quest that cannot be started if the Dragonborn has one of the quests for \"Rare Gifts\" active. After getting his drink, the Jarl will give the Dragonborn a quest to kill a bandit leader at a radiant location. Upon completing this objective, the offer of becoming a Thane will be made. The Dragonborn must now assist three citizens of Falkreath.\nThere are several easy ways to assist the people of Falkreath:\nBecause Falkreath has the fewest citizen quests of any hold, and because the town is so open to dragon attacks, if the Dragonborn waits until the mid-game or endgame to become Thane, it can be difficult to find enough citizens alive to do three quests. This becomes an even worse problem with installed, as citizens will also be attacked by vampires. &lt;a href=\"Mathies\"&gt;Mathies&lt;/a&gt; (the farmer), &lt;a href=\"Lod\"&gt;Lod&lt;/a&gt; (the blacksmith) and &lt;a href=\"Narri\"&gt;Narri&lt;/a&gt; (the tavern worker) can be killed. Players can usually find the remaining quests they need by finding citizens who tend to stay inside buildings and by investing 500 gold in &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Pine%20Goods\"&gt;Gray Pine Goods&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Investor\"&gt;Investor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; skill. Additionally, if you drop an expensive piece of armor on the ground and a character asks if they can have it, letting them do so will grant progress towards becoming Thane.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Helvard\"&gt;Helvard&lt;/a&gt; is killed as part of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; questline, this quest cannot be started at all.\nThe quest objective for the Jarl will be different depending on civil war quests.\nIf the expansion is installed (and enabled), the Dragonborn may receive a letter at any time early in their adventures from &lt;a href=\"Siddgeir\"&gt;Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt; requesting a meeting at his longhouse in Falkreath. If this is the case, if the Dragonborn goes to meet him, the first part of this quest will be skipped entirely in favor of the next part of the quest to become a Thane.\nThe Jarl of Falkreath is added as a citizen so when the quest is started only two citizens need to be helped.\nRewards for earning this title include the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Falkreath\"&gt;Blade of Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, along with the standard Thane option for dealing with pursuing guards in the hold."}

Like 'Sir Nich' or 'Sain Nack' ...\nADVENTURER: You said 'Nick' or 'Nack'? Just a minute ... let me have a swig from your bottle, Brother ... Ah! That's better - high-class stuff you fellows drink! Yes, I recall - some story or old legend about an elf, name of Nuckle, I think\u2014from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;?\nLHEBAN: You know, maybe you're on to something there\u2014there is an old legend around these parts, comes from deep in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; I think ... hmmmm ... Nackles, that's it!\nADVENTURER: Nackles, eh! Seems that several Dark Elves use that name ... particularly the ... more peculiar ones...\nKOMON: Yes, I guess that the bad ones are into all that weapons magicka stuff ... very nasty fellows ...\nLHEBAN: (to Komon) Komon! This fellow's got pointy ears and red eyes ...\nKOMON: Pardon me, friend ... it's sort of dark, and I didn't ... uh ...\nADVENTURER: Oh, that's fine. These are strange times. You know, live and let live\u2014or die\u2014as the case may be. Now ... suppose you tell me about this Nackles myth? Here, let me help you with that bottle ... Ah! Thanks.\nLHEBAN: Er ... sure, if you want to put it that way ... Here, have another swig! Sure, we've got the time, and I recall it clearly now.\nKOMON: Yes, we've a couple hours 'til that little blonde shows up at her lamp...\nLHEBAN: (to Komon) Quiet! Remember, we had to tell the High Priest her address, so she won't be around for a while!\n(to all) Very well, here's the story, best as I can recall it. This is a tale the peasants up in High Rock tell their kids to scare them into being good for a while, I guess. They tell it, let me see ... either on &lt;a href=\"Tales%20and%20Tallows\"&gt;Tales and Tallows&lt;/a&gt;, or is it &lt;a href=\"Witches%27%20Festival\"&gt;Witches' Festival&lt;/a&gt;? -- just before the kids are sent out to the barn or pigsty to sleep.\nKOMON: Nasty cruel peasants! But then, I'd send them all out to &lt;a href=\"The%20Midden\"&gt;the midden&lt;/a&gt; ...\nLHEBAN: Really, Komon! Remember, those poor souls need our compassion and blessing, we are their salvation!\nKOMON: Now who's in Old High Mucky-Mucks' study?\nLHEBAN: Er ... anyway. It goes a bit like this. If the kids have been real good during the year\u2014filched enough in the market, mucked out the stables every day, not gone playing with goblins, left the sheep alone, and so on. If they have been real good, they've nothing to worry about. But if they haven't been real good then there is this nasty, horrid Dark Elf spirit called Nackles. Doesn't look like your typical Dark Elf\u2014thinner, taller. Pasty white face, long as your arm. Walks like his knees and elbows bend the wrong way. Snickers like when you drag your fingernails across slate. Wears a tight black suit (not &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, more like a formal suit with buttons) but too tight and small. He visits the bad girls and\u2014\nKOMON: Why are you talking about Old High Mucky again, Lheban?\nLHEBAN: You really must excuse Komon here: overwork, you know. Too many curings and conversions ... Anyway, Old Nasty Nackles is supposed to wander under our &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, in dirty deep dark dwarven tunnels. Everywhere under the lands, if you can believe that! Rides in a rusty squeaky old mine cart, on old mine tracks ...\nADVENTURER: I saw some of those in &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt; once, down in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; a long long while ago ...\nKOMON: (to Lheban) What the &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; was he doing in Fang Lair!?\nLHEBAN: (to Komon) Hush! If he's who I think he is, you do not want to know! (to all) Um, yes. Well, Nackles gets pulled all around these deep tunnels by goblins\u2014not your usual dirty yellow ones, but nasty black things. Anyway, they pull Nackles round and through these dark tunnels, and then, late at night, he stops below each and every bad child's hovel or house or castle - makes no difference. Then he slides up the drainage pipes ...\nKOMON: Creeps up cracks ... crawls through holes ...\nLHEBAN: Oozes up oubliettes ...\nKOMON: Climbs giggling up garderobes ...\nLHEBAN: Right into the kid's place! Then, if the kid's only been sort of bad, Nackles will just mess things up in general, so the kid gets blamed. Make greasy dirty marks everywhere (more than usual, anyway), break some things, steal some things, so on and so forth. Maybe take the sugar sweets, leave some lumps of fools' ebony instead ...\nADVENTURER: Fools' Ebony - what's that? Heard mention of that, oh, a few hours ago ... Some Mages ...\nLHEBAN: You did now? Interesting ... Very ... Well, lets talk of that in a bit ... just let me finish this Nackles thing. Where was I -- Oh yes ... Now, if the little brat has been real bad\u2014then all the little brat's toys get taken. The copper dagger, the wooden sword, the little whip, and so on. All the usual favorite kids things.\nKOMON: Whips? I like those.\nLHEBAN: Now if that little brat has been very, very bad then Nackles grabs the brat. Pops him or her in his dirty great sack. Hauls the sack off down the holes and cracks, down to his rusty old mine cart! And away they go!\nKOMON: Hope he leaves some bad little girls behind.\nLHEBAN: Er ... so we can save them, of course, friend ... Well. Sometimes, so I've heard tell, the brat never comes back. No great loss, I guess, peasants just breed another.\nKOMON: Know 'bout that, I do, I do ...\nLHEBAN: But, as the story goes round here anyway, often the brat is just put to work, digging out lumps of Fools' Ebony, shoveling dirt, bagging it. Extending the tunnels of the Nackles. After a while, Brat is pushed back up to where it came from. Seems that Brat might think it's spent a year down there, but only a day has passed up top ... Brat comes back real thin and dirty though, covered in black mess ... You know, come to think of it\u2014on the day past Witches' Festival, I've often seen some little brats, scrawny, real dirty black mess on them, looking terrified, too. Parents drag them into Temples to get blessed and cured, if they have the gold. By the Beard of Sheogorath, the wailing and noise! Enough to drive a priest to ... er ... well, never mind ... that's our problem ...\nKOMON: Nah ... it's a problem with our suppliers, I tell you ...\nLHEBAN: Anyway, that's the short of it, this Nackles legend up around here. I recall now, it's widespread all over Tamriel ... and knowing the place, probably more than a grain of truth in the tale, much, much more ...\nADVENTURER: So, I guess some of the ... er, darker Dark Elves sort of identify with this Nackles. Take on the persona, so to say ...\nLHEBAN: Yeah, that sort of sums it up, I guess ... though we don't see those types hauling off brats in sacks, now do we?\nKOMON: Nah, that's wot we does, girly brats anyway, isn't it not?\nADVENTURER: That's a very interesting tale, gentlemen. Say, let me repay you with another bottle\u2014what's that you're drinking? Ah, thought so - Innkeep! More holy wine for these holy men!\nLHEBAN: A blessing on you for that kind gesture, friend.\nADVENTURER: I thank you, I sure could use one or three ... Anyway, this 'Fools' Ebony', I've heard mutters and murmurs about that of late\u2014mostly eavesdropping ... pardon me ... listening ... to Mages and the like. What's with this stuff? Here, have another swig ... good!\nLHEBAN: Well, we're not supposed to tell outsiders ... but then, you seem to know something already. And if you have been hearing Mage gossip ... Why, maybe we can do some business. Profit all round! Well ... for &lt;a href=\"The%20Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;the Akatosh Chantry&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and your fee, good Sir.\nADVENTURER: More and more interesting\u2014tell on, I pray you.\nKOMON: Time for me to go convert that little lamppost girl ... no, no, no - not last nights one, but the blonde ...\nLHEBAN: Friend, you'll have to excuse Komon. He's a bit ... you know strange ... Got these ...\nADVENTURER: Oh, that's all right, we've all got our own...\nEPILOGUE: Our apologies for the quality of this drama so far. If those of you still present will wait for a few minutes while our bard plays \"Silence Implies Consent,\" we will change the set for the next act, &lt;a href=\"Fools%27%20Ebony%2C%20Book%20II\"&gt;Part the Twoth&lt;/a&gt;. Please don't forget to tip your wench. Do you believe there's such a thing as Fools' Ebony? Maybe we'll find out in Part the Twoth. Or maybe not.\nEnd of Part the Oneth, Being Mostly Concerned with The Legend of Nackles."}

Enter Prologue, the Adventurer, and Lheben\nPROLOGUE: Little has occurred so far in our comedic drama. The Adventurer, our &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; rascal, has bought drinks for two priests of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. All have drunk considerably. One of the priests has rushed off in pursuit of his lamp girl. And, unless I've forgotten something or something happened when I was paying attention to something else, that's a complete synopsis of &lt;a href=\"Fools%27%20Ebony%2C%20Book%20I\"&gt;Part the Oneth&lt;/a&gt;. Ah, here come two more priests. Humble Prologue must depart.\nRAIC: Evening Lheban! Evening stranger. My fellow priest here is Stete, I am Raic. We are honored to serve Julianos.\nADVENTURER: What is this, anyway - Priests night out? And ... I thought that your Temples - Akatosh, &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, the rest ... I thought them all cut-throat competitors. In theology and gold, if you will forgive my bluntness. Yet you all seem the best of friends ..? Come to think of it, didn't I have words with Stete earlier, you said you were of &lt;a href=\"The%20Temple%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;The Temple of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;?\nRAIC: A common misconception, friend ...\nLHEBAN: ... but one that we ... encourage ...\nRAIC: Really, we all work together closely, move between the Temples as needs dictate ...\nLHEBAN: ... exchange information ...\nRAIC: ... share funds ...\nSTETE: ... swap our sisters ...\nPROLOGUE: Sorry to interrupt the merry slapstick, but I neglected to mention earlier that the Fools' Gold saga\u2014if that is the word\u2014contains gratuitous reference to priestly misdeeds and sexual excess. I hope those of you in the audience of peevish, prudish, sullen, frumpy, or grumpy demeanors are not offended. Now then, on with the entertainment.\nLHEBAN: ... and all that ...\nRAIC: But it helps in our ... holy work, if we are perceived as separate and, uh, competitive...\nLHEBAN: Mind you, there are one or two, er ... religious organizations ... well, sort of ... that we do not have anything to do with ...\nRAIC: Nothing at all, nothing at all ... animals, just animals ...\nADVENTURER: Such as ..?\nLHEBAN: Weeell\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; for one ... nasty bunch of thugs ... and then there's the &lt;a href=\"Afterdark%20Society\"&gt;Afterdark Society&lt;/a&gt; ...\nThis fellow, seems a decent sort of chap ... seems to know something about &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt; and Fools' Ebony ...\nRAIC: (aside to Lheban) Really now ... how interesting...\n(to all) Hey fellow, have another bottle\u2014this will bless you throat. My, my, yes indeed it will...\nADVENTURER: Thanks Raic, don't mind a bit ...\nLHEBAN: But let me continue\u2014I was explaining about this Fools' Ebony to you ...\nRAIC: Yes, Fools' Ebony ...\nLHEBAN: Well. Fools' Ebony now. Well, you know about ordinary Ebony, how it's rare, only some dwarven clans dig it and sell it. And not too many, these days and times ...\nSTETE: How's that popular song go ..? (singing)\nWhere have all the Old &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; gone, Long time ago ...\nLHEBAN: There's a pile of real ebony up in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wrothgarians&lt;/a&gt; somewhere north, I hear tell. You know how that dullish black ebony gets worked over by Mages, by some skilled armorers, made into all kinds of potent weapons, amulets, belts, what have you. All fetch a huge price, when you can find any. And how the best was made long ago, by those old dwarves ...\nLHEBAN: Oh my! Oh, my apologies, friend, Sir! I see you have\u2014what's that? An &lt;a href=\"Torc%20of%20Labyrinthian\"&gt;ebony torc&lt;/a&gt;? Oh my, and an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Katana\"&gt;ebony katana&lt;/a&gt;! Oh My! Oh My, My! So, of course, you know all that, sir.\nADVENTURER: Oh, that's all right, you didn't know. Here, have another bottle ...\nLHEBAN: Many thanks, kind Sir. Well, then you know how every adventurer, even snotty kids, all the dungeon-delvers, are always looking for ebony artifacts, weapons, whatnot. But what you may not know, some of the more experienced delvers hunt for &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;raw ebony&lt;/a&gt; lodes, piles, dwarven leavings. That stuff, the raw ebony, is far more valuable.\nADVENTURER: The raw unshaped material that provides work ... and power ... for so few? Apparently just loaded with negative magicka?\nRAIC: Right, right!\nLHEBAN: Yes, right so! Quite so! Well, Fools' Ebony now. Looks just about like the real raw stuff. Runs in veins in the deep rocks. Feels the same, smells almost the same. But the big difference: it's not real ebony. No power at all. If you pick some up, it gets your hands a bit dirty. Softer too, by all accounts. But sort of shiny too. But who can tell all that, deep in some old mine, maybe a &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt; breathing down your neck! So it's just grab and run, I guess, down in those nasty holes. So the fools, the kids, the crazy delvers, are always hauling up a bag, a sack, of Fools' Ebony. And getting laughed at by the merchants, dealers, mages, us ... hence the Fools' part. Stuff just gets thrown into the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Bay&lt;/a&gt;...\nADVENTURER: Yeah, that's sort of what I ... er ... heard from some Mages. But I heard something else, too ...\nLHEBAN: And just what was that, friend ... if you want to tell us, of course ... Sir.\nADVENTURER: Oh, of course! I think that we can come to ... er ... an arrangement?\nLHEBAN and RAIC (Together): Certainly, Oh Yes!\nADVENTURER: So, yeah, so these mages\u2014Shub and Shub, they are always called Shub, aren't they? -- anyway, these old guys were saying how this Fools' Ebony can burn. Not magically, but like an ordinary piece of wood. But the flame lasts far longer, gives off lots more heat, makes no smoke to speak of, no noise ... very interesting ... Mages were saying as how the alchemists want it, to heat the &lt;a href=\"retort\"&gt;retort&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Calcinator\"&gt;flasks&lt;/a&gt; ... How the Mages Guild wants it, to make and sell ... er ... fake amulets and the like ... rotten trick that! And especially the Armorers, they want it bad, for their forges, I guess. And the Alchemists, for their &lt;a href=\"alembic\"&gt;alembic&lt;/a&gt;s ...\nLHEBAN: Precisely my information! Now... gets cold up here in the winter, doesn't it? And everyone is cutting down all those trees, making &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Weapons\"&gt;siege engines&lt;/a&gt;, boats, all that evil war machinery! All those rich royals and merchants got to heat their great big piles of homes. So their Contessas can run around in next to nothing, instead of furs...\nSTETE: ... just like my sister ...\nADVENTURER: All those armorers got to keep their hearths and furnaces running...\nLHEBAN: ... All the Mages got to keep their familiars warm ...\nRAIC: ... All those royals got to keep the contessas running ...\nLHEBAN: ... All those peasants got to keep their animals warm ...\nADVENTURER: And To &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; with the wife and kids, right? Ha! And, I guess, its sort of hard for you Priests to give blessings and cures, when your fingers are all cold and stiff ..? Makes getting corks out a tad hard, to say nothing of opening those little twists of parchment ..?\nRAIC: You speak truly, indeed!\nLHEBAN: A man of wisdom, indeed! Yes!\nADVENTURER: So, where do we find this Fools' Ebony\u2014in quantity?\nLHEBAN: You put your finger (you have six, I note\u2014oh, excuse me, Sir) on the crux of the matter. I have heard rumors, just rumors, mind you, that there are huge enormous veins of this stuff, at one place on the surface, far up in the Wrothgarians. Bad, bad place to go. But, if you can get there and back, cartloads of the stuff!\nADVENTURER: That's just what I overheard from those Mages\u2014far up there in the Wrothgarians\u2014&lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dragonling\"&gt;dragonling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath only knows what ... Those Mages seemed to know the spot, though. Mages wanted someone to ...\nRAIC: You didn't ... talk ... to the Mages. I mean, you haven't ...\nADVENTURER: Oh no. They didn't even know I was there...\n(aside) Not yet, anyway...\nLHEBAN: Good, good - can't trust those Mages, you know ... old fossils would turn their own mothers into sludge-toads, just for a bit of gold! Gold-mad, power-mad, Mad-mad, the whole rotten lot of them! But then they don't have mothers!\nRAIC: Excellent. Seems to me, friend\u2014or, can we call you partner? Yes? Excellent. Seems time, partner, that my brother priests and you should do some digging and poking around - see if we can get to those veins, those deposits, eh!\nADVENTURER: Yes indeed, partners! But it would cost a fair pile of gold to get up there\u2014weapons, spells, women, clothing, carts and horses, women, food, potions ... Best go well-prepared, up there.\nLHEBAN: No problem, partner. Our Temples have ... certain resources, such that if we were guaranteed ... sole access, sole knowledge of the location, then we could finance someone ... someone with the requisite skills, such as yourself? Just by happenstance, I am Keeper of the Books ... you see the opportunity?\nADVENTURER: Oh yes! Oh yes! Well\u2014lets split a last bottle, and shake on an agreement?\nLHEBAN: Indeed, let us! We first need information\u2014who knows about the site up there, where it is, how to reach it ... Why don't we meet back here in, say, a week, to the hour. And see what we can learn, meanwhile?\nRAIC: We need to find a merchant, too. Someone who can handle it for us ... warehouses, distribution ...\nLHEBAN: And keep a shut mouth!\nADVENTURER: I'll make some inquiries about merchants ... got a contact or two ... Trouble is\u2014well, you know how these things go\u2014few golds here, few there, before you know it you've bribed half the town, or so it seems. Now, as luck would have it, I don't have much\u2014got swindled by a wretched Mage, some town south of here, and lost most of my belongings in a shipwreck ...\nLHEBAN: Ah Yes! You need some ... seed money as it were.\nRAIC: (To Lheban) Let me lift old Stete's purse, he made a lot renting out his sister last week ...\nLHEBAN: Thank you, Raic. Here, about 100 gold\u2014enough ?\nADVENTURER: Oh yes, more than enough for a start, Gentlemen. Good, good, good ... so we have a deal?\nADVENTURER: Yes! It's agreed. One week!\nEPILOGUE: Ah, things are happening now, I doubt it not. Patrons, I request that you recall that this is a work of fiction created by one of the finest writers of the asylum, &lt;a href=\"Frincheps\"&gt;Frincheps&lt;/a&gt;, Archprince of All &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Sumurset&lt;/a&gt;. There is no such thing as Fools' Ebony. Furthermore, Ebony is not mined as the priests have described the process. Grasp that please. If you can still enjoy the play as a rude work of fiction, stay with us for &lt;a href=\"Fools%27%20Ebony%2C%20Book%20III\"&gt;Part the Threeth&lt;/a&gt;. If you can't, farewell. And don't forget to tip the wenches.\nAnd so endeth Part the Twoth"}

If you are just arriving, you have missed little. The Adventurer, our rogue &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt;, has joined with a quadripartite (that's a triumvirate plus one) of priests intent on discovering a burning metal called Fools' Ebony and becoming wealthy. The priests have given our hero some gold for bribing merchants, but the only people who know where the Fools' Ebony is are the mages of the Mages' Guild. As the Epilogue pointed out at the end of Part the Twoth, there is no such thing as Fools' Ebony and real Ebony is not mined. Something our playwright apparently did not research. Well, accept it as high fantasy, if you will. Or whatever. Hark, here comes our hero now. Imagine the miasma (if that's the word I want) of magical elixirs, &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;bubbling cauldrons&lt;/a&gt;, hovering balls of sparkling whatnot. And now, the Prologue must depart.\nADVENTURER: Ho! Anyone around?\nSHUB: Over here, young man, in the corner ...\nADVENTURER: Morning. Do I call you ... Shub ..?\nSHUB: Oh yes, Shub is my name, Shub it is ... How on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; did you know?\nADVENTURER: Can we have some ... privacy ... I have a somewhat ... er ... delicate matter to discuss..?\nSHUB: No need for privacy here! We Mages do not hide anything!\nADVENTURER: Fools' Ebony?\nSHUB: Quick through this door ..! Turn right ... Turn left ... Ah ... just let me throw a privacy spell around us ...\nGood! Now Sir\u2014Oh, by the way, meet my fellow Mage, Shub.\nSHUB: Mmmm.\nSHUB: Now, you mentioned Fools' Ebony ..?\nADVENTURER: Well, I fancy myself a bit of an expert in ebony. Had quite a bit come and go through my hands in my time, I have ...\nSHUB: We notice that you have an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Amulet\"&gt;ebony amulet&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Katana\"&gt;ebony katana&lt;/a&gt; -- Of &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Katana%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, no less! And an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Belt\"&gt;ebony belt&lt;/a&gt; ... ...mmmm...\nADVENTURER: Hands off the toys, gentlemen, please!\nSHUB: Forgive us\u2014but we so appreciate such fine items ...\nSHUB: ... collect them too ...\nADVENTURER: Well, the other day, just by chance of course, I just happened to hear two priests of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Temple%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Temple of&lt;/a&gt; ... er ... &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, I think it was ... They were a bit high in their cups, I think, a bit loud, and never noticed me skulking\u2014I mean, standing\u2014there. They were going on about this Fools' Ebony - stuff like the real thing, only no magicka at all. None. But it burns like wood, only longer, hotter, no smoke, nice even heat.\nSHUB: Yes ... we have heard similar rumors. Seen a bit of that stuff\u2014lumps from a sack or two that some crazed delver dragged up, that kind of thing. Right, Shub?\nSHUB: Oh - Oh yes, right, that kind of thing ... right ...\n(aside) I must remember to keep the secret, whatever it is.\nADVENTURER: Well, these fool priests seemed to talk as if they knew a location for lots, I mean piles, of that stuff\u2014somewhere up in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wrothgarians&lt;/a&gt;...\nSHUB and SHUB (Together): Where! Who! Did they say? How? When? Where?\nSHUB: You didn't let them know you were listening, did you?\nADVENTURER: Of course not! What do you take me for, a priest lover?\nSHUB: Calm yourself, my lord ... that's better...just don't go fiddling with that katana so much. Makes us nervous.\nSHUB: Yes, nervous, very ...\nSHUB: Here, sit down. There. Want some mulled wine? No? Oh well, just have to finish it myself.\nSHUB: So they seemed to know the location.\n(aside) Hmmmm. This means we have to act fast, quickly, speedily, and with great rapidity.\nADVENTURER: Oh yes! They were talking like they were going to get a load in a few weeks or so ...\nSHUB: Oh My! Oh Dear Me! Ohhh...\nSHUB: Now then. Seems you know a fair amount about this Fools' Ebony. And you realize the potential\u2014just think, big warm fires in all our study rooms ...\nSHUB and SHUB (Together): ... Selling it to the Palace... selling it to those stupid Alchemists ... the &lt;a href=\"Armorer%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Armorer's Guild&lt;/a&gt; would be good for a lot ... ...keep out familiars nice and warm ... ... and our posteriors ..! ... just think how Daedra Seducers love a nice warm fire ... Giving smoldering lumps to the peasants to warm their hovels with - in return for some gold, of course ...\nSHUB: ...just think of all that gold...\nSHUB: Trouble is, son - we would like to get that stuff by the cartload, bring it down here ...\nSHUB: Have some trustworthy merchant ...\nSHUB: Put a spell on him!\nSHUB: ... Have some merchant act as sort of, middleman, for us ...\nADVENTURER: But ... then why the delay, gentlemen?\nSHUB: You seem like an honest fellow. We'll tell you\u2014mind you, you let out a word of this, and there will be a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daedra\"&gt;Fire Daedra&lt;/a&gt; in your bed ... but no threats between gentlemen, right!\nADVENTURER: Very well\u2014I shall be the very soul of discretion.\nSHUB: You see, we know where the stuff it, cartloads and cartloads of it. But we can't get there and back ...\nSHUB: We are not the outdoorsy types.\nSHUB: Far safer here in town.\nSHUB: Much warmer too.\nSHUB: Think of all the supplies we would have to take.\nSHUB: All those nasty things out there.\nSHUB: Did you know that seducers won't come to us in the wilderness?\nSHUB: We'd have to hire guards, to keep those awful priests away.\nSHUB: And the strain of dealing with all those coarse types ... the Merchants.\nSHUB: The Armorers.\nSHUB: The Royals.\nADVENTURER: Mmm. I think I comprehend. You want some\u2014experienced explorer-hero type, someone used to the wilderness - to go get it for you, set up a supply line, so on ..?\nSHUB: Exactly. And find us a nice, usable merchant. Someone we can control.\nSHUB: With a big, big warehouse, delivery service, that kind of thing ...\nADVENTURER: Well, gentlemen. Let me volunteer my services! I have always admired you Mage gentlemen\u2014so clever, so sharp. No fooling you in anything, is there?\nSHUB: No, no fooling us ...\nPROLOGUE: This, ladies and gentlemen, is irony.\nADVENTURER: Tell you what, I can probably arrange a suitable merchant or you. Take some gold though\u2014those thieves know the value of a gold piece! As luck would have it, my last gold was swindled off me by a thieving priest, in some little town south of here. And I lost a lot of good stuff in a shipwreck just before that ...\nSHUB: Well ... since you have agreed to help us ... we can spare some gold from the treasury, can't we, Shub?\nSHUB: Oh! Oh yes, lots there ... always make more ...\nADVENTURER: Now, I do need to know roughly where this site is, got to pick the right breed of horse, calculate my supplies to the last drop, figure out what weapons I might need ... supplies, like food, little things like that ... diameter of the cart wheels in square &lt;a href=\"yurt\"&gt;yurt&lt;/a&gt;s ... ambush points for the priests, in case they try to get up there ... mmmmm ...\nSHUB: Tell you what - here is 500 gold. Go get things started.\nSHUB: Yes ... we can always make some more.\nSHUB: (aside, to Shub) Shut up!\n(to all) Excuse us ... where was I ... Oh ... get a merchant, guards, carts, whatever you think it will take. Come back if you need more.\nSHUB: But what about those priests?\nADVENTURER: I've an idea or two there. Let me get friendly with them - maybe hire a couple of good lamppost girls, lay in a few cases of holy wine ... I'll have them eating out of my hand in no time. And if you show me where this Fools' Ebony is ... why, I can misdirect them, send them straight into an trolls' den or something.\nSHUB: You're the expert! Here, let me show you on a map ... and I don't need to mention Fire Daedras, do I?\nADVENTURER: So ... seems to be ... hmmmm ... only thirty days there, this time of year. Maybe forty back, with the loads. Let me study this a bit more ...\nSHUB: Can't take it with you, of course ... don't want this getting out now ...\nADVENTURER: Oh no. That's fine. Look, let me have a bit more gold. Going to need some heavy-duty carts. See here, this section ... cut by all these washes ... hmmmm ... the flummox there will be something terrible ... Oh, and these ruins, full of ghosts, I bet ... hmmmm ... and this pass, just full of willies too ...\nSHUB: If you say so ... My, seems that we picked the right man, right, Shub!\nSHUB: Oh yes, indeed.\nADVENTURER: So\u2014why don't I make arrangements, get back to you in ... er ... say a week? Say\u2014sure that you don't want to come with me. After all, there's nothing like the wilderness life. Waking up with the sun, shaking off the frost. Catching an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; for breakfast - ever have orc guts fried over stinkwood? Oh, that's a treat! Checking each stream for dead &lt;a href=\"Spiders\"&gt;giant spiders&lt;/a&gt; - or live ones! Imp jerky for lunch! Scanning the ridges for &lt;a href=\"dragonling\"&gt;dragonling&lt;/a&gt;s! Standing guard against Ice Daedra in a blinding snowstorm! Oh, what a life!\nSHUB and SHUB (Together): No, no ... we, we better stay here at the Guild. Got our duties after all ... someones got to mind the store ... someones got to get the word out to selected customers ... No, thank you kind Sir, it does sound such a lovely life, but I think we best be here ... yes, indeed ...\nADVENTURER: A pity, gentlemen. Well, I'll be about it then. And don't worry if you see me with those priests\u2014got to mislead and misdirect them, haven't I!\nSHUB: One week, then!\nEPILOGUE: Shub and Shub, ladies and gentlemen. Implausibly retarded mages, yes, but perhaps there's something more to them than this act suggests. Do you think so, maybe? Well, if you are not in the theater for &lt;a href=\"Fools%27%20Ebony%2C%20Book%20IV\"&gt;Part the Fourth&lt;/a&gt;, you won't know for certain, will you? Don't forget to tip your wenches and think on that while we change the set.\nSo Endeth Part the Three"}

After some general discussion and verbal dancing around, finally the topic of Fools' Ebony is explored ...\nSomewhere near the market, in the back of a store called \"Nephron's General Mercantile.\"\nThe day after.\nPROLOGUE: Whilst the actors playing the Adventurer and the merchant Nephron dramatically move their mouths to pantomime a conversation, it is on poor Prologue's shoulders to update the audience on the play's actions in its first three acts. The Adventurer, a rogue of a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, has been hired two different groups\u2014four inebriated priests and two greedy mages\u2014to delay the other group, and find the lost cache of Fools' Ebony in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Now, picture this clownishly decorated set as the back room at a prosperous merchant's shop. And before the Adventurer and Nephron develop lockjaw, Prologue will leave you thus.\nADVENTURER: So you see, friend Nephron, just what an opportunity we have here. We have this new commodity, for which you agree there will be a huge demand.\nNEPHRON: Especially from the Royals\u2014once one of them has something new, they all want it, of course.\nADVENTURER: And do not forget the Armorers for their forges, and the Alchemists for their &lt;a href=\"Retort\"&gt;retorts&lt;/a&gt; and whatnots...\nNEPHRON: You seem to have the Mages lined up nicely, got their location, memorized the access map, and so on - you know, we merchants have had a suspicion for quite some time that those old twits had some deep dark secret of interest to us... Now, the priests - &lt;a href=\"The%20School%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;the School of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; we already work well with, hand and glove, you might say. But of course we shall cut them out of the major profits\u2014maybe let them distribute some to their flocks? And their Temples make good, how can I say? -- storehouses? But &lt;a href=\"The%20Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;the Akatosh Chantry&lt;/a&gt; is a problem, always running off and doing things on their own initiative, no cooperation, just crazy people ... we really need to do something about them, to ... er ... ensure their cooperation ...\nADVENTURER: I have a suggestion that might help ... you recall how old Komon left and apparently dragged off some little blonde lamppost girl ... just suppose, that just by chance, in his state of ... befuddlement ... he dragged off someone important by mistake..? Might be a lot of trouble for the Chantry, if word got out?\nNEPHRON: Hmmm. Indeed ... there's this silly little blonde Royal who's all excited by the 'real life' down in these parts of town. Disguises herself (or so she thinks), comes on down here and plays at being poor. Stupid little twit ... Komon is still in hiding with his blonde, right?\nADVENTURER: Yes, in that 'retreat' the Priests have, down near the waterfront.\nNEPHRON: Oh yes, I know that place - often sell them some 'spiritual powders' and so on ... Good ... you see, just imagine what would happen if Komon, by mistake, had grabbed this slumming little Contessa ... Akatosh Chantry would have no end of trouble from the palace if something nasty happened to her ... and then we could move in, offer to 'help' the Chantry during their hard times ... Hmmm. Yes! Leave it to me, I shall contact a few of my ... er ... business associates, as it were ... make some arrangements.\nADVENTURER: And I'll keep up chatting with the priests, get them to support our little business venture?\nNEPHRON: Right! And I should introduce you to some of the more senior members of our &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;... excuse me, Guild. Let me contact you in a few days, when everything is all set. You are here every evening?\nADVENTURER: Yes, not particularly safe outside after dark these days.\nNEPHRON: I see. We shall have to arrange some ... protection for you. Well, in a few days, then.\nARMORER 1: OK, fellow. Lets not &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;spriggen&lt;/a&gt;-foot around! We know about this Fools' Ebony thing. And about the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt; who apparently discovered the location. And we have been watching you dance around with the Priests, the Mages, the Merchants. Just about everyone with two feet!\nARMORER 2: And how you are really working with Nephron.\nARMORER 3: And how you are double-crossing the Priests and Mages ...\nARMORER 2: You and Nephron are really doing a good job on &lt;a href=\"The%20Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;the Akatosh Chantry&lt;/a&gt;, we must admit.\nARMORER 1: But now, we want that Fool's Ebony supply. We need it to increase our production, our quality\u2014and our prices. We can work with Nephron and his gang, we need warehouses and distribution anyway.\nARMORER 4: We could torture it out of you ...\nARMORER 3: We could let the Priests know about your plans\u2014they would throw you to the &lt;a href=\"Afterdark%20Society\"&gt;Afterdark Society&lt;/a&gt; in a flash!\nARMORER 5: We could let the Mages know\u2014they would send you to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; for a very, very long time!\nARMORER 1: But we would rather you 'joined' our Guild. We cannot afford to leave &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; for some hairy wilderness trip. Too much demand these days, for our services.\nARMORER 2: But we can send a group of our apprentices along to keep you company.\nARMORER 4: Our apprentices usually test all our products ... and will be just itching to test out there.\nADVENTURER: Gentlemen, gentlemen! Please - I really was going to give the whole deal to you, once I had gotten gold from everyone else.\nOhhh ... well, I thought of it...\nARMORER 5: Sure! And I'm a &lt;a href=\"Nymph%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Nymph&lt;/a&gt;!\nADVENTURER: Yes, Yes, Yes, you are very persuasive. I would welcome an ... er ... escort and guard of such tough gentlemen. Be very handy out there.\nARMORER 1: Good. Thought you would see it our way! Some of our other members are presently having a little ... chat with Nephron. We can handle him. And from now on, two of our bigger apprentices will always be close at hand. Protection, of course - this town can be quite dangerous at night ...\nARMORER 3: So continue with your arrangements, work with Nephron. You can always leave word about your departure date with any weapons shop. And about any problems you may have ...\nADVENTURER: Certainly, gentlemen. Yes, you are indeed very persuasive. I shall keep you up to date. And, er...thanks for the protection.\nADVENTURER: Hello, who are you?\nORTHO: Me am Ortho!\nADVENTURER: My ... protection?\nORTHO: Me am Ortho!\nADVENTURER: You look very familiar to me for some reason. Have you every been to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;?\nORTHO: Me am Ortho!\nADVENTURER: Fine then. (aside) My old man used to say the very worst thing that can happen to a fellow is an evening spent in the company of an earnest politician. This, I think, is a close second.\nEPILOGUE: Our play has six parts, and we've just finished the fourth. It's interesting I think that the Lusty Contessa has not made an appearance yet. You don't suppose our playwright forgot he put her in the Dramatis Personae, do you? Well, you'll only know if you come back for The Fools' Ebony, &lt;a href=\"Fools%27%20Ebony%2C%20Book%20V\"&gt;Part the Fiveth&lt;/a&gt;. And if your neighbor decides not to return, don't tell him what happened. We actors have to make a living too, you know. Don't forget to tip your wenches while we change the scene.\nSo Endeth Part The Fourth"}

In the quest for Fools' Ebony, that substance that all would kill for, the Adventurer attempted to play &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; against Priest with the help of the merchant Nephron. Alas, that is to say, alackaday, the five armorers have trapped Nephron and the Adventurer and taken over their scheme. The hulking Ortho now watches the Adventurer's every move. But I get the feeling -- to be honest, don't you? -- that beneath the Adventurer's defeated quivering jelly lurks a jungle cat of such cunning and resource to shatter all his enemies when the time is right. Of course, I could be wrong. Ah, I see one of &lt;a href=\"The%20Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;the priests of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; who believes himself a friend of the Adventurer. I, Prologue must away.\nLHEBAN: Evening there, mind if I join you?\nADVENTURER: Well ... since you already have - no. And where is our esteemed brother Komon this chill evening?\nLHEBAN: You mean you haven't heard -- Oh, I guess you have been busy with the ... preparations?\nADVENTURER: Right, right, very busy...\nLHEBAN: Then let me tell you -- Oh, what a bad business. What trouble ... Oh Dear ... Well ... you doubtless recall that poor Komon had this ... er ... problem -- overwork of course!\nADVENTURER: Oh yes -- you fellows do work exceeding hard, seems to me.\nLHEBAN: Well ... recall how Komon left, somewhat erratically as it were, and ... er ... made off with that young blondie under the lamppost outside? Well -- in his ... er ... state of confusion - he grabbed the wrong blondie - Oh My, indeed the wrong one ...\nADVENTURER: They all look pretty much the same to me, but of course, I do not look too hard!\nLHEBAN: Oh My! Well, to cut a short tale to the bone, old Komon grabbed a Contessa, who had thought to 'disguise herself.' Oh Dear!\nADVENTURER: Well -- did she get away? Did they catch Komon? What happened?\nLHEBAN: Well, old Komon, tipsy as he was, was quick as spit in a gale. Eluded all pursuit, took the lady to a small private ... retreat house that we have. Oh Dear Me! Well, the City Guards, Palace guards, half a dozen Royals, all caught up with Komon 3 days later. One day too late for the poor Contessa -- I hear that they had a hard time locating all the ... er ... bits and pieces. Komon was there, passed out cold. And another body, some common blond lamppost girl. And by now he is cold -- permanently, most likely at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nADVENTURER: Oh well. Serves the Contessa right, coming down to this area. But I suppose that there are repercussions?\nRAIC: Evening, Lheban. Evening, Adventurer. And --\nORTHO: Me am Ortho.\nRAIC: Yesss. Charmed. And Lheban, you indeed have my sympathies ... if there is anything we can do to help -- our &lt;a href=\"The%20School%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;Temple of Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, that is ..? But really, you should have kept Komon on a tighter leash - or preferably a noose!\nADVENTURER: Hello Raic. And hello to you, Stete - how's your sister?\nSTETE: Oh, she's great.\nLHEBAN: Yes, I know I know. Oh the repercussions! Do you know that the Priests of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Castle\"&gt;Daggerfall Castle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Palace&lt;/a&gt; and just about everywhere else have all been thrown out? That the Royal tax exemption for the Chantry has been revoked? That the Akatosh Chantry has just received a 'past due taxes' bill? Oh My!\nADVENTURER: Well ... I suppose that we could help somewhat, maybe? Maybe a small loan from &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; for that tax bill? With, say, a Temple as security? Oh -- are not the taxes based on the number of the Priests of Akatosh? So, maybe ... the School of Julianos could take over a ... significant number? Reduce your tax bill? You realize that this is not the best time for this -- just as we need a lot of funds for that expedition that I am arranging for you.\nLHEBAN: Oh, I am so sorry about Komon! But, yes, maybe if good brother Raic could -- I hate to say this -- take over a greater share of the financial burden ..? In return, of course, for ... er ... considerations ..?\nRAIC: Hmm. Like a good number of 'permanently' loaned priests? A long look at your books? At your cellar? Your name-lists? A Temple as security on our loan? And, of course, a bigger cut in the proceeds of this ... expedition? Names of your ... er ... suppliers ..?\nLHEBAN: Oh. I foresaw something like this, talked a bit about it with old Mucky-Muck - livid, he was. But, as I am a Senior Brother, he finally authorized me to 'take care of it.' Those weren't his exact words, mind you, which were quite a bit ...longer, more explicit ... but the gist, at least.\nADVENTURER: Of course, Lheban. If -- and note I say 'if' -- if we are successful, why then you can easily get back into good graces at the Palace. Merely sell them the goods, as a good low rate! With first refusal on any shipment you have? What's one Contessa to them, anyway?\nLHEBAN: Yes, yes! That could work! Worth a try. But how? Royals will not talk to anyone from the Akatosh Chantry now.\nADVENTURER: Leave that to me, I can make ... approaches to certain ones. Yes, I can probably persuade them to let up on the Chantry, in return for... future favors ...\nLHEBAN: Oh, Oh how can I thank you?\nADVENTURER: Well, I need a fair amount of gold to finish setting up my little trip. Maybe 10,000? Special horses, reinforced carts, cartiers, guards ... the list goes on and on. And the cost of keeping our little trip quiet is really quite high.\nLHEBAN: Well, yes, we can afford it, I guess -- you do have the map now, don't you? I know we can afford 8,000 gold. Given the potential profits ...\nADVENTURER: Rest easy! - it's all here in my cloak -- show you in a bit. I've also managed to ... hire some good young hefty fellows, like old Ortho here, to manage the carts, dig and load, act as guards, and so on ...\nLHEBAN: Good, good - I can relax a bit. Oh my, the fellows back at the Chantry will be so relieved. We really owe you, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; does -- Oh, I mean the Akatosh Chantry, of course!\nSTETE: Brotherhood ..? What about our sisterhood, eh?\nADVENTURER: Well, Raic, what about you and the School? How much are you good for, the extra 2000? And maybe some more - always lots of last minute expenses on a trip like this, you know.\nRAIC: Well now. Since we seem to getting a whole extra sect of Priests, and ... other considerations ... Certainly!\nADVENTURER: Well, gentlemen -- Oh, and Stete -- here it is!\nOh, by the &lt;a href=\"Resolution%20of%20Z%27en\"&gt;Arms of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, did I ever have to work hard for this! Those cagey Mages! But, in the end, just greedy old fools! ... Oh, just in case you or your, er, Head Priest, hasn't seen the goods -- here's a sample. Play with it.\nRAIC: Thank you, thank you. I must admit, I had some ... well, some doubts. You know - dealing with a stranger, so on ... No more. Partner!\nADVENTURER: Good, good!\nSTETE: Say, you fellows ever hear this one -- what's a Priest keep under his robe? Haha -- His sister! Haheheha!\nRAIC: You know, I fear that we really have to do something about young Stete here ... his sister thing ... ugh!\nADVENTURER: Yes, he could be another Komon -- just what don't need!\nLHEBAN: Hmmmm. This sister of his -- does she really -- exist?\nRAIC: Oh yes. My. Oh yes. We know her well - I mean, we have often seen her ...\nLHEBAN: I think, Brother, that she should be made to see the errors of her ways. So she is no longer an influence on Stete ...\nRAIC: Yes, most certainly ... Hmmm ...\nLHEBAN: A somewhat &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibelytical theological&lt;/a&gt; point -- Oh, please excuse the technical discussion here - Raic, if we are to make her see the errors -- well, how shall I put it -- we first have to know just what the ... ways ... are, correct?\nRAIC: Indeed, an astute observation! Hmmm ... so you are suggesting that ... in a nut, we should first determine her ... ways, so as to be able to then show her the ... er ... errors?\nLHEBAN: Precisely! Mind you, a difficult, ardous, tiring project, I fear. One that will take all our ... will and energy.\nRAIC: Hmmm, true. But challenging, eh? Take all our time - but then, we shall have some time, while friend the Adventurer here is off hauling and carting.\nLHEBAN: And ... I personally, would feel far safer if we were ... in retreat maybe. Studying the ways ..?\nADVENTURER: Yeah -- be a good idea for you two to, maybe, disappear? For a while, of course. Cut down on the chances of a ... rival faction catching on? Or catching you?\nRAIC: Very well! Lheban, why don't you and I take his sister off with us on a ... theological retreat, as it were? Study the ways in details, and so on ...\nLHEBAN: We could go to that unused little Temple, up on that shoulder of Edward's Mountain ... out of the way, quiet ...\nRAIC: Door has locks ...\nLHEBAN: Thick walls ...\nRAIC: A big cellar ...\nLHEBAN: Good! It's settled then. A theological retreat! Oh goody!\nRAIC: Of course, once we know the ... er ... ways in detail, we can of course tell old High Mucky-Muck, and let him take care of the ... er ... showing of the errors ..? Yes, that would improve his mood quite a bit ...\nLHEBAN: Then it's agreed. Let's start, say, day after tomorrow?\nRAIC: Yes! Adventurer, why don't I meet you at, oh, that horrid ugly statue of ... what on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; is it? - a harpy and a gargoyle? Called something silly like 'Vendigao and Her Lover' or some such? Up in the north west corner of the town. Oh, and can I keep the map?\nADVENTURER: Sure, keep it, I have a copy. And you will pass me a small bag, there at that nasty statue?\nRAIC: Have it all ready for you -- say, ten o'clock sharp? Oh, Lheban, another thought about young Stete here. He really needs some ... seasoning in the field, one might say ...?\nLHEBAN: Hmmm. Good point ... I know! The priest who handles field assignments is coming by tomorrow. We could arrange an ... educational ...assignment for Stete?\nRAIC: Very good! But where ... hmmm ... Winter's coming soon now. There's a vacancy up in &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, far north &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, I believe. Night collections at street corners, or some such. Very Good! Come on, Lheban. We have accounts to work on. Good night to you then, Adventurer. Ten tomorrow morning! (Lheban, Raic rise to leave, picking up Stete)\nLheban and Raic (Together): ... have to arrange some supplies ... ... leather, rope ... holy wine ... ... lots of that pink powder ... I prefer the green, myself ...\nNEPHRON: Well?\nADVENTURER: Excellent. Went just as I said it would. Got 5000 gold from them. And, thanks to your work with that Contessa ... we have the screws on the Chantry. And the School of Julianos is going to be ... otherwise engaged ... on a theological retreat. More like a &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; retreat!\nNEPHRON: And those Mages Shub and Shub seem to have disappeared ...\nADVENTURER: So we are set?\nNEPHRON: Yes, you can come by my warehouse tomorrow afternoon. Have the heavy carts waiting.\nORTHO: And Ortho ...\nNEPHRON: Oh yes, must not forget you fellows. How kind of you to ... volunteer your services ...\nADVENTURER: Tomorrow, then!\nEPILOGUE: Well, we only have one part left to this play and I've run out counting the number of loose strings. Either &lt;a href=\"Fools%27%20Ebony%2C%20Book%20VI\"&gt;Part the Sixth&lt;/a&gt; is going to be eight hours long, or we're going to leave some parts unsolved. I for one hope that they don't chose to drop the character of the Wanton Contessa.

The time is shortly after the last scene, which if you've forgotten, ended with our hero and his partner-in-crime, Nephron, making some arrangements to swindle from the mages, priests, and armorers. All are interested in getting their hands on a lode of Fools' Ebony, a miraculous burning mineral, and the priests and mages each consider the Adventurer their ally. The Armorers know better and have assigned one of their apprentices, Ortho, to watch the Adventurer's movements. Now, as Ortho slumbers, the Adventurer has his first moment of peace in days. I should mention that in the interest of common decency, this scene has been abbreviated from the original by order of the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Guild of Playwrights, Actors, and Dramatists&lt;/a&gt;. It now contains little material of relevance. A full copy may be obtained from the playwright after the show for a mere 50 g.p. copying fee. Now is the time for poor Prologue to shuffle away.\nADVENTURER: Who's there? I'm coming!\nADVENTURER: Er, well ... er ... Come In! Please.\nCONTESSA: So sorry to surprise you, but I thought that we might find something in common ... Oh! You poor man, you have a wound! Here, let me fix that bandage ... it looks very fresh.\nADVENTURER: Well, I ... just opened it up again. Evening exercises, calisthenics, so on...\nCONTESSA: How did you get this cut - if you do not mind me asking?\nADVENTURER: No, not at all. I was ... in a fight, earlier. These three crazy people jumped me.\nCONTESSA: Really? This cloth looks like part of a Mage's robe.\nADVENTURER: Well, yes, two of them were Mages.\nCONTESSA: Oh My! You must have been very good, to defeat them.\nADVENTURER: Oh, ah, well, I've been in one or two fights. Not to be rude, but who are you?\nCONTESSA: Oh, I am so sorry, I quite forgot the proper introductions. I am the Contessa Aveet Videspreed\u2014call me Ave. From the Court at &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nADVENTURER (aside): By &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, what now?\nCONTESSA: Here, help me off with this robe, these inn rooms are always ... so hot. And let me check that bandage again, poor man. Ooh, you are wearing an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Belt%20of%20Stamina\"&gt;ebony belt of stamina&lt;/a&gt;, and bracers of strength. Ooh, a bracelet of endurance. This is my lucky night.\nADVENTURER (aside): Help.\nCONTESSA: Here, let me help you off with that old shirt - got to check you for any more cuts - they can go bad so easily, you know.\nADVENTURER (aside): Well, its not the Armorers this time. Maybe my luck has turned.\nCONTESSA: Well, everything seems all right...very all right, in fact...\nADVENTURER: Er...well, Ave - tell me about ... er ... yourself.\nCONTESSA: If you want - just for a bit -\nADVENTURER: Here, have some wine ...\nPROLOGUE: Here our worthy playwright's speech has been heavily edited by the Guild of Playwrights, Actors, and Dramatists. I will endeavor to fill in those removed passages. I should first mention that the Contessa is not meant to be a relative of any noble currently in Castle Daggerfall. The Contessa Aveet regales the Adventurer with tales of the peculiar and hearty members of her royal family. She has many brothers and sisters. They are all very\u2014close.\nCONTESSA: I think I must have been a bastard. I was the only one with red hair, and an affinity for &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone else tried to hide this skill of mine. I remember one spanking very well ...\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa relates further differences between her siblings.\nCONTESSA: While my sisters were learning to curtsey in ten different modes, and my brothers were learning flower-arranging, I used to sneak off into the woods or town. I soon learnt how to get what I wanted, from just about anyone. Just for example, there was this merchant who had three sons ...\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa goes into detail about her training.\nCONTESSA: I became quite good at the school of &lt;a href=\"illusion\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt;. You never noticed me, downstairs, did you?. I also learned how to use some weapons. Let me tell you how I learned &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand\"&gt;hand-to-hand&lt;/a&gt; ...\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa relates an amusing anecdote, and then continues.\nCONTESSA: And on bad days, I used to dig in my father's library. He had a marvelous collection of old texts. I was fascinated by &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dwarvish\"&gt;Old Dwarvish&lt;/a&gt;, managed to learn it quite well, I think. Of course, no one has seen or spoken to one in years and years. So its probably perfectly useless knowledge. But I've always had an interest in collecting new knowledge. At the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, they taught me an old &lt;a href=\"High%20Elven\"&gt;High Elven&lt;/a&gt; tradition. You spread this potion all over your body...\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa relates her current state of boredom.\nCONTESSA: The life up at the Palace bores me so. My sisters ...\nPROLOGUE: The Contessa's sisters are entertaining some visitors.\nCONTESSA: And my brothers are now studying Advanced Floral Theory, so I come down here, do a little ... er ... business. I keep all my relations supplied with their favorite vices\u2014so I can blackmail the whole rotten lot.\nADVENTURER: But isn't it dangerous, down here? Did I not hear that some young Contessa got killed, recently?\nCONTESSA: That little twit was my cousin, and as far as I'm concerned, she got what she deserved. She thought she could just borrow a maids dress, muss up her hair, and pass for commoner. She was spotted the first minute she left the Palace gates. Now, I use illusion, craft, guile\u2014and I carry weaponry. By the way, that was a neat scheme you and Neph cooked up.\nADVENTURER: Well, lets change the subject, can we? ... Just what do you carry? I can't see anything ... like a weapon, I mean ...\nCONTESSA: Here, let me show you ...\nADVENTURER: Oh my, those are nice ... knives...\nCONTESSA: And there're more ...\nADVENTURER: Oh yes...\nCONTESSA: But we don't need these silly nasty weapons now, do we?\nADVENTURER: My, my\u2014now those are what I call weapons ... Oh yes ... heavy duty, high class ones too, my ...\nCONTESSA: I think its time that we put that ebony to the test ... to say nothing of your Mages Staff ...\nPROLOGUE: At this point, extensive material has been removed. However, please remember that any scholar who truly wishes to peruse this material can obtain a copy for only 50 g.p. - hand-drawn illustrations are of course extra. The Contessa, after a bit of fun, volunteers to be a part of the Adventurer's party to find the fools' ebony lode. I know, I know. It didn't make much sense in the original draft either, if you want to know the truth.\nADVENTURER: Sure you want to go out there in the wilds?\nCONTESSA: Oh, yes. I am so bored here. Well, not right here and now, but generally. And I can really be of assistance. I'm pretty good with woods survival, knife work, hand-to-hand ... and it gets cold out there at night, even for big ebony-wearing men like you ...\nADVENTURER: All right, then. Do you know where and why we are going?\nCONTESSA: Oh, of course. It's all over Daggerfall. Everyone is watching and waiting to see what happens. There is even a lottery or two running ...\nADVENTURER: On what ..?\nCONTESSA: Oh, your life.\nADVENTURER: Oh dear Oh dear! Oh my!\nCONTESSA: Look, don't worry\u2014I know all about the double-dealings with mages, priests, merchants, those crude armorers. And I intend that we come out on top. I love being on top. With the goods and the profits. I'll have yet another vice to sell to my stupid relatives in their boring palaces.\nADVENTURER: But won't it be us two against hordes?\nCONTESSA: Oh no. Most everyone is waiting here in town to see what and who comes back. And I will have a surprise arranged for our 'escorts' - Ortho included. Out in the wilderness, they can be dealt with easily.\nADVENTURER: Tell me more.\nCONTESSA: Certainly. But first ... lets see how many uses you have left in that ebony. Mmm, your Mages' Staff is in good shape ...\nPROLOGUE: Exactly. Sorry to interrupt again, but we're going to have to stop this scene right here. After a frenzied night comes the placid dawn, tripping onto the sky like a budding rose. And then another day doth dawn, and then another. Ten dawns and ten frenzied nights pass as our wily Adventurer, the wanton Contessa, the clever and naughty Nephron, the loutish Ortho, and an assemblage of randy armorers and backsliding maidens take to the road. Imagine now that we are in the wildy wilderness of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nScene 2\nCONTESSA: I do so love a bucolic frolic.\nADVENTURER: It's getting pretty wild now. I guess the dangerous part is coming up tomorrow...?\nCONTESSA: Yes, one last stop tonight, at that old inn up here\u2014Minnie's Inn.\nADVENTURER: Minnie's Inn? Oh, those two old scholars who gave it all up, came to run the inn out here. they must get all of two customers a year.\nCONTESSA: I think they like the solitude. It gives them time to study. They know a lot about old Dwarvish stuff - get them started on that, they will wear you ears out.\nADVENTURER: Er ... when does your surprise happen? I should probably know.\nCONTESSA: Don't fret, dear. At the Inn tonight. Just sit back and enjoy the show.\nPROLOGUE: Time passes, the carts roll, things happen in the backs of the carts. And there are strange furtive movements unnoticed by all, on the high ridges around. When next we see our players, they are at Minnie's Inn, home of Minnie and Crunn, the philosopher- innkeeps. Imagine, if you will, the rather dusty dining room of Minnie's Inn.\nMINNIE: ... er ... Crunn ...\nCRUNN: ... yes ... Minnie ...\nMINNIE: ... I was thinking ...\nCRUNN: ... yes, you were thinking, Minnie ...\nMINNIE: ... er ... thinking ...\nCRUNN: ... yes ...so was I ...\nMINNIE: ... can't remember now ...\nCRUNN: ... yes, Minnie ... Minnie ...\nMINNIE: ... Yes ..?\nCRUNN: ... Shut up ...\nGURNSEY and ORTHO (Together): Moo ... oooh ... moo.\nADVENTURER: Moo?\nCONTESSA: See, Adventurer, Ortho's fixed.\nADVENTURER: Is he?\nCONTESSA: You just watch.\nADVENTURER: And what about the other armorers?\nCONTESSA: Any minute now.\nORTHO: This Gurnsey. Ortho love Gurnsey, oooh.\nGURNSEY: Gurnsey love Ortho ... moo ...\nORTHO: We go get marry, we is.\nADVENTURER: Well, congratulations! And that was a fine long speech, Ortho!\nORTHO: We go raise piggies.\nGURNSEY: Grows animals too, farmers be we.\nADVENTURER: Extraordinary. Ave, I think that you must have been up here before.\nCONTESSA: Oh yes. I often come up here to get away from the Palace and talk &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; with Minnie and Crunn.\nADVENTURER: You mean that these two ancient ... er, Scholar-InnKeeps can actually talk and about dwarves?\nCONTESSA: Oh yes, you must just be very patient. But look over at our other escorts ...\nADVENTURER: By the Lady!\nCONTESSA: Minnie was an Alchemist before she met Crunn, and knows a lot of old forgotten Dwarvish potions.\nADVENTURER: But what do we do with the bodies?\nCONTESSA: Wait ...\nCONTESSA: Adventurer, meet Major Bloodnok, head of my own ...private little bodyguard. He's been with me since I was a mere girl. Served me very well, haven't you, Major?\nMAJOR: We give our all, milady.\nADVENTURER: Pleased to meet you, Major.\nCONTESSA: How are my other men?\nADVENTURER: (aside) Other men?\nMAJOR: All present and accounted for, milady. Had a spot of bother with what looked like a party of Merchants following you. But they are out of the picture now, down a ravine. Only one thing.\nCONTESSA: Yes?\nMAJOR: Me and my men, we've been noticing sort of furtive movements, up on cliffs, on ridges\u2014always just out of the corners of our eyes. And we keep getting this feeling of being watched. Now, me and my men, we're the best but there's something out there. Don't like it, not one bit.\nCONTESSA: Oh Dear - and just when it was getting to be fun.\nMAJOR: Its not anything human. Not Mages, Armorers, Priests. And its not the usual &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20%28Daggerfall%20Creature%29\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing like that, not at all.\nMINNIE: Dwarves!\nCRUNN: Where? ... oh ... Minnie ... you mean ... up ... there ... here ...\nMINNIE: ... Dwarves, up there ...\nCRUNN: ... How exciting ... mmmm ...\nMINNIE: ... There, there, Crunn, calm down ... just dwarves ... I knew that one day they would ...\nCRUNN: ... Wake up ..?\nMINNIE: ... Come back ...\nCRUNN: ... But ... I didn't go anywhere ...\nMINNIE: ... The dwarves, Crunn ...\nCRUNN: ... Oooh ... Back ... So excited ... Dwarves! ... oooh ...\nCONTESSA: Well Major, is it possible?\nMAJOR: Anything's possible, especially up here. Dwarves? I don't know. Me and my men, we'll get rid of this lot. There's a good deep mine shaft out back.\nADVENTURER: Dwarves, Ave! Is that trouble? I mean, they sort of own all the ebony down here, don't they?\nCONTESSA: Maybe. I guess we just have to push on, see what develops. I can try to talk to them, maybe? Oh, and Adventurer, you'll have to drive the first cart. I'll take old Nephron's. We'll leave the other here\u2014Spares for later.\nADVENTURER: What, no more bucolic frolics?\nCONTESSA: Sorry, but we've got to get to the site and out again before the weather goes bad.\nADVENTURER: Can't your Major and his men, handle the carts?\nCONTESSA: Oh, no. They will cover us from all sides and make certain there are no surprises.\nADVENTURER: Oh well. All good things end, I guess.\nCONTESSA: Not quite. If you have any charges left in your bracelets of endurance, we can go upstairs and see what develops.\nPROLOGUE: Well, I guess we all saw that coming. Scene 3 takes place some time later at the site. Flanked by the Major's men, the Adventurer and the Wanton Contessa successfully follow the map of the dear, departed mages. Imagine great veins of glistening ebonyesque material piercing the surface of the ground, and a nice warm fire of Fools Ebony where the Adventurer and the Contessa sprawl. To the west are signs that the weather is turning and the first major snowstorm of the year is coming. For some time, they have been mining and the Adventurer is beginning to feel the strain of actual labor.\nScene 3\nADVENTURER: I've got blisters on my hands from shovelling that black rot, blisters on my rear from that cart bench, and we are running out of ale. My bracelet is running down and my fingers are getting frostbite.\nCONTESSA: What, your bracelet is running down? Oh, now that is serious.\nMAJOR: Dwarves! Milady, dwarves, dozens of the little buggers caught my men! I'm sorry, milady.\nCONTESSA: Major, get out of here now. If you get away, you can maybe help us later. I'll try to talk to them.\nCONTESSA: Hhjgys jjvvu klpss Jjqqx zzyzx.\nDWARVES (Together): Jjpoo Kalagloo gashnoo bibloo franoo Xxnadoo\nCONTESSA: Jnik? Balpo?\nDWARVES (Together) :Gabloo! Wazzikoo! Eppapupu!\nCONTESSA: Glooky, glooky, glooky.\nADVENTURER: Ave, whats going on?\nCONTESSA: Relax. I think I've impressed them by talking their language. I don't understand everything, but it seems that they have only just 'woken up' or something. And that they will not let us take any of this Fool's Ebony\u2014it's somehow related to the real stuff or something. And it really belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Lords of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; -- the Dwarves are just care or something.\nADVENTURER: Very interesting. Now, what about us?\nCONTESSA: I made a deal with them the only way I could see. I told them about Minnie and Crunn, how those two old ones know lots of dwarven tales and legends. The dwarves tells me that, having just 'woken up' or something, they want three things\u2014ale, women, and us to leave the Fools' Ebony alone.\nADVENTURER: Ah, flog my log.\nCONTESSA: Well, I told them about all the ale down at Minnie's Inn. And about the 2 redheads there. They are going there, leaving right now. We may take one empty cart, 2 horses. And they will keep us guarded all the way there. They also said that they will\u2014I don't know how\u2014destroy all the Fool's Ebony here. It shouldn't be on the surface like this, they say. (aside) Dwarvish is a remarkably compact language.\nADVENTURER: By the great roaring buttocks of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;! All these blisters and backache for nothing! Ah well. At least we are still alive. For now ...\nPROLOGUE: Farnoo Lickety Kanoo Gadfloo. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. As Scene 4 begins, we are back at Minnie's Inn, where the dwarves appear to be on holiday.\nScene 4\nMINNIE: ... ga ... sszx ... spnoo? ...\nCRUNN: ... glurky ...\nDWARVES (Together): Jotcha potchka lazzo lanni joopy hoopy qui me amat, amat et canem meam\nADVENTURER: Ave, any ideas? I can't seem to work my magical items. And when the ale runs out ...\nCONTESSA: Your ebony material is useless against them. Dwarves fashion the ebony, so I guess they can suppress it or something. Don't worry - just think, these dwarves have been asleep or something for hundreds of years. And Minnie has a huge stock of ale. Not many customers come this way, and she knows how to salt the ale just right to keep from spoiling for decades.\nADVENTURER: Oh, that's why my tongue always looks like a chunk of leather after a pint or two.\nCONTESSA: Dwarves apparently love ale. I expect them all to pass out in an hour or so.\nCONTESSA: If not sooner. Come on, Adventurer. Grab a sack and start collecting! When the dwarves wake up, they'll finish the ale, and then us.\nADVENTURER: South, as fast as our horses will take us in this weather.\nCONTESSA: If we make enough distance before they wake up, we'll be all right - I don't think that they will leave their precious mountains. I hope not.\nPROLOGUE: The wailing wintery wind whirls wickedly, wafts whipping, wading waist-high, oh never mind. The Adventurer and the Contessa get lost in the snow storm. Several days later, we find them desperate for warmth and exhausted.\nADVENTURER: The horses have had it. They can't go another step and its going to snow again. No ale left, and just one loaf.\nCONTESSA: It will have to do.\nADVENTURER: Anything left, Ave?\nCONTESSA: No, no more fire anything - just my daggers\nADVENTURER: Same here, just a common shortsword. Curse Sheogorath for those dwarves! Those oafs chewed up our horses! Do you think the Major made it out?\nCONTESSA: If anyone can, it's him. Guess we'll find out in town. Interesting thought just occurred to me. Don't giants hunt in several groups? Is that more I hear?\nADVENTURER: Yes, there are more giants out there. Quick, Ave. Help me with this one.\nCONTESSA: What on Tamriel are you doing? This is not the time for studying anatomy!\nADVENTURER: Don't argue, climb inside!\nCONTESSA: Poppydash and Baldercock! Inside that smelly dead giant? My dear Adventurer, I'm a Lady.\nADVENTURER: It's our only hope! The giant smell will hide our scent, and live giants never touch dead ones. Quick!\nADVENTURER: Here, help me pull the skin shut - and try not to throw up. Don't make a sound.\nPROLOGUE: A few hour pass.\nADVENTURER: They've all left, but it's snowing hard. Definitely getting real cold. We better stay here.\nCONTESSA: It indeed is warm.\nADVENTURER: It will keep us warm, safe from the storm and giants, for a day or so if we can stand the smell. Here, want some bread?\nPROLOGUE: For this, the last scene of the play, please forgive us, but we need to change the set. Remove the \"giant corpses\" and whatnot. Please be patient while our bard performs the timeless classic \"Whither Goest Thou?\"\nPROLOGUE: Ah, here we are, back at the Dead Daedra Inn. The Contessa and the Adventurer made it, after all. They had to pay three times the normal rate, for they were very dirty and stinky. Now poor Prologue will bid you farewell, goodly people.Scene 6\nCONTESSA: Thank the Gods for hot water and soap! I thought I would smell like a giant forever.\nADVENTURER: Me too. Where did you go while I was bathing? And why no mages, priests, armorers, or merchants outside yelling for our blood?\nCONTESSA: I took a quick trip to the Palace. I've fixed it so some cousins have told the armorers and merchants that we don't have cartloads of the Fools' Ebony.\nADVENTURER: Pity that that's actually true.\nCONTESSA: But at least no one's interested in us anymore. Seems that some priests turned up dead in an old temple, up on &lt;a href=\"Edward%27s%20Mountain\"&gt;Edward's Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. They were found with some girl, all dead from 'bad green powder' or something. And some old mages named Shub have gone missing ...\nADVENTURER: Now then, what did you stuff in those sacks that's so important?\nCONTESSA: Here, dump them out, take a look.\nADVENTURER: By the Gods, just look at that!\nCONTESSA: Yes, those dwarves were just loaded with ebony. Look. Rings, torcs, bracers, belts, helms All solid old ebony.\nADVENTURER: And this stuff feels just loaded with magicka. Why, I bet that this ring alone has a thousand uses... whatever it does.\nCONTESSA: Ooh! Look! &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Extreme%20Endurance\"&gt;Bracers of Extreme Endurance&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Belt%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Belt of Strength&lt;/a&gt;! Put them on, Adventurer, let's celebrate!\nADVENTURER (aside): Help!\nEPILOGUE: As I feared, all the loose threads of the play were ended by wholesale slaughter. More of the adventures of the Adventurer will follow, unless, of course, they don't. We thank you for your tempered patience. Don't forget to tip your worthy wenches on your way out this evening, and enjoy our bard's rendition of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; classic, \"It's A Matter of Luck.\" Goodnight."}

His mother, &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt;, asked me to go to Frostbreak Fortress to aid the king.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter the Vestige has completed the previous quest in the main questline \"&lt;a href=\"Invitation%20to%20Orsinium%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Invitation to Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;,\" the objective \"Talk to Forge-Mother Alga\" will appear. The Vestige must speak with her in order to initiate the \"For King and Glory\" quest. When spoken to, Forge-Mother Alga will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"So our ambassador has finally found you? Took her damn time. But you're here now and that's what counts. Welcome to Orsinium. Amazing how fast we rebuilt this place, isn't it? Orsimer can do anything when we work together.\"\nAfter finishing the conversation, the Vestige must travel to Frostbreak Fortress to speak with King Kurog. When nearing the fortress, the sky will gradually get a dark-orange tone, and the sound of battle can be heard. After entering the siege camp, the Vestige must pass the wooden siegetowers and battle engines and make their way to King Kurog's tent. After they have reached the tent, they must speak to King Kurog who awaits them surrounded by several of his Orsinium soldiers and his two shield-wives. When spoken to, he will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"\"Do you always just barge into the king's tent without so much as a \"by your leave\"? Who in the name of the First Forge do you think you are, troll breath?\"\"\nAccompanied by King Kurog, the Vestige will now have to find a way inside the fortress. Kurog will tell the Vestige to \"\"Talk to &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Urgdosh\"&gt;Chief Urgdosh&lt;/a&gt;. They're working on a plan to get into Frostbreak Fortress.\"\" Chief Urgdosh can be found standing near the wooden siege camp walls, watching his men bombard the fortress walls with their catapults. When spoken to, he will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"Look at those catapults fly! I'm amazed the towers can withstand the punishment. The Breton must have used Orc crafters and they built that place to last. But never fear. The Winterborn won't have a fort to protect them for much longer!\"\nSo what's your plan? \"We need to get inside the fort. Find out where they're spawning those abominations. But the damn harpies! We can't walk five steps without becoming bird food! &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Commander%20Dulph\"&gt;Siege Commander Dulph&lt;/a&gt;'s working on a plan. I hope it's a good one\u2014for all our sakes.\"\"\nAfter exiting dialogue, the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hidden%20Harvest\"&gt;The Hidden Harvest&lt;/a&gt;\" quest will initiate. The quest involves the Vestige ridding the fortress towers of harpy nests and destroying the source of the Winterborn's briarhearts, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alinon%20the%20Alchemist\"&gt;Alinon the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;. One must complete part of this quest before being able to progress through \"For King and Glory.\"\nAfter having destroyed the harpy nests during the \"The Hidden Harvest\" quest, the Vestige must enter Ice-Heart's lair and defeat him. This can be a very challenging battle for low-level players, so it is adviced to take the necessary precautions. Ice-Heart will use multiple &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; spells to freeze the Vestige in place, afterwhich he will hit them with his blade. His lair will be filled with several frozen minions, who will attack the Vestige in waves. Ice-Heart's frozen minions will carry both ranged weapons and blades.\nAfter having defeated Ice-Heart, the Vestige must speak to Kurog once more, who will tell them the following:\n\"You don't know how good that feels! Urfon Ice-Heart is finally dead! Imagine you ate to much and, try as you might, you can't get out that really big belch. Then, finally, you let out a thunderous burp. Yeah, that's how I feel right now.\"\nAfter this conversation, the Vestige is tasked with traveling to &lt;a href=\"Scarp%20Keep\"&gt;Scarp Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After entering the Throne Room, they will find Forge-Mother Alga speaking to several clan chiefs infront of King Kurog's throne. After the conversation is over, Forge-Mother Alga will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"As you can see, the clan chiefs can be a contentious lot. They oppose King Kurog at every turn\u2014especially on matters of faith. But tell me. Was Kurog succesful? Did you defeat the Winterborn warlord?\"\nAfter exiting dialogue with Forge-Mother Alga, Kurog will enter his throne room and speak to the Orc chieftains. Impressed by the sight of Ice-Heart's blade, they still refuse to kneel and accept him as true king of the Orsimer. In rage, Kurog will plunge the blade into &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Targak\"&gt;Chief Targak&lt;/a&gt;'s chest, lifting him up into the air and killing him. The Vestige must approach Kurog and speak to him. He will tell them the following:\n\"Treasonous bastards! I just saved their ungrateful arses and this is the thanks I get? I even showed them Ice-Heart's sword! How can I create a united nation when the chiefs refuse to accept my rule?\"\n\"Go on. See the wonders of Wrothgar. I'll be at my private cornerclub when you're ready for a new challenge. Just don't get yourself killed. I still have plans for you!\"\nAfterwhich the quest will be completed, and the Vestige will receive their reward."}

The cults combine the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; cult, veneration of the divine god-hero &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, founder and patron of the Empire. Imperial cult priests provide worship and services for all these gods at Imperial shrines in settlements throughout &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat is the Virtuous Life?\nOur doctrines are simple. We acknowledge the divinity of the Nine Divines: Akatosh, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth, Julianos, and Tiber Septim. We preach the Nine Virtues: Humility, Inspiration, Piety, Work, Compassion, Justice, Ambition, Learning, and Civility. Our Emperor is the Defender of the Faith, and the Empire is the worldly working of the Divine Plan. We pledge aid and comfort to all citizens in need, and serve the Emperor and Empire at his will.\nThe Imperial cults look to the Nine Divines as models for living a good and virtuous life. Each of the Nine represents different aspects of life, and how it should be lived. But the simplest statement of our doctrines is -- help and protect one another. The stronger one is, the wealthier one is, the more one bears responsibility for helping and protecting others. One's first duty, of course, is to one's fellow members of the Imperial Cult. But after that, one should help and protect any needy persons.\nWe also say, \"do not harm one another.\" It is forbidden to attack another person of the Imperial cult, and of course, forbidden to kill another member. It is forbidden to steal from another member, whether by open theft or by covert pickpocketing. It is forbidden to trespass upon the private property of another member. Break any one of these rules, and be expelled from the cult.\nHow can I join the Imperial cult?\nThe Imperial cult accepts all citizens of good character and earnest faith. We ask only a one-time pledge of 50 drakes to aid us in our good works. Thereafter, the only cost of membership comes when you use our health, healing, and blessing shrines -- modest fees which help us spread the blessings of the Nine to those less fortunate than ourselves.\nThose who wish to join the Imperial cult in Vvardenfell will find a warm welcome from our cult greeters: Ygfa at Fort &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;, Syloria Siruliulus at &lt;a href=\"Buckmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Buckmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt;, Somutis Vunnis at &lt;a href=\"Moonmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Moonmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruccia%20Conician\"&gt;Ruccia Conician&lt;/a&gt; in the Grand Council Chambers in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Lalatia%20Varian\"&gt;Lalatia Varian&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial Chapels at Ebonheart.\nWhat are the requirements for advancement in the Imperial cult?\nSeekers who wish to advance in the service of the Nine must dedicate time and resources to serving the cult, and must strive for personal improvement in their attributes and skills. Only the most distinguished are worthy of advancement to the higher ranks in the Imperial cults.\nTo serve and glorify the Nine Divines, the faithful must cultivate a noble personality and a strong will. Respect the magical arts, especially the colleges of &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;. Those who swear to avoid bloodshed, to take the field unarmored to fight only with &lt;a href=\"blunt\"&gt;blunt&lt;/a&gt; weapons, are especially praiseworthy. Knowledge of enchantments and the gift of diplomatic speech are other qualities we value in our initiates.\nImperial cult services\nYou can find Imperial cult services in Buckmoth Legion Fort, Moonmoth Legion Fort, Pelagiad Legion Fort, &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; Legion Fort, &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Hall\"&gt;Wolverine Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Foreign%20Quarter\"&gt;Vivec, Foreign Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, and Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart. Seek training at Wolverine Hall, Buckmoth Fort, Moonmoth Fort, Ebonheart Imperial Chapels, Governor's Hall in &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Velothi%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Velothi&lt;/a&gt; Outpost.\nMany Imperial cult locations have healing altars. You may pray at Imperial cult healing altars and receive blessings which cure common and blight diseases, cure poisons, and restore damaged attributes. Non-members pay 25 drakes. Non-members pay 25 drakes. Newer members pay 10 drakes, while higher-ranking members receive blessings free. Healing altars are found in: Vivec Foreign Quarter; Wolverine Hall in Sadrith Mora; Buckmoth Legion Fort; Moonmoth Legion Fort; Pelagiad Legion Fort; Gnisis Legion Fort; and Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart.\nOpportunities for service\nLay healers gather ingredients for health and healing potions, and minister to the sick and hurt in poor and isolated communities. It is difficult and sometimes dangerous work, but the spiritual rewards are great. Lay healers need only the skills of the prudent traveler, being often on the road and in the wilderness, gathering herbs and potion components. They should avoid trouble where possible, and so need not be masters of the arts of war. Those interested should speak to &lt;a href=\"Synnolian%20Tunifus\"&gt;Synnolian Tunifus&lt;/a&gt; at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart.\nAlmoners gather alms from members and friends of the faith. We depend on donations to fund most of our good works. Almoners who are successful at bringing in generous donations may rise in the ranks of Imperial Cults service. Almoners must travel in town and village, and should be skilled in persuasion and mercantile matters. Also, almoners with personal wealth are in a position to better serve the cult. Those interested should speak to &lt;a href=\"Iulus%20Truptor\"&gt;Iulus Truptor&lt;/a&gt; at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart.\nA shrine sergeant helps keep order at the shrines, carries messages and packages, and sometimes escorts priests and lay servants on dangerous missions. This occasional service is ideal for bold, free-spirited adventurers. Shrine sergeants are called upon to serve the Nine with weapon, armor, and spell. New shrine sergeants are given the easiest tasks, but later, missions may demand higher levels of combat proficiency. Those interested should speak to &lt;a href=\"Kaye\"&gt;Kaye&lt;/a&gt; at the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart.\nOracle's Quests are the most demanding of all Imperial cult missions. Only members of the higher ranks are invited to assist the Oracle, and the challenges require the skill and courage found only in heroes of legend.\nHow do the Imperial cults view the other factions of Vvardenfell? The Imperial cults have a very close relationship with the Imperial legions, and a friendly and supportive relationship with the Imperial Guilds -- especially the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fighters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guilds&lt;/a&gt;. We also have a friendly and supportive relationship with House Hlaalu, which strongly supports the Emperor and Imperial principles. Though we cannot condone the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, we praise their faithful dedication to the Emperor and to Imperial culture.\nThe Imperial cults have the greatest respect for the high moral principles of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, and honors their different but noble conceptions of Divine Inspiration.\nWe disapprove of the primitive heathen beliefs of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;, and of the impious and inhumane practices of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial cult especially disapproves of the practice of slavery, and looks forward to the day when slavery is illegal in all Imperial provinces. The Imperial cult also disapproves of the lawless and greedy &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;, and their ruthless exploitation of the poor and weak.\nHistorically, our relationship with the Tribunal Temple is difficult and unfriendly. Though the Imperial cults acknowledges the lords and saints of the Temple pantheon as worthy inspirations, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; falsely insists that theirs is the One True Faith, and that the Imperial cults worship false gods."}

The quest has the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; adventuring across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, exploring the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Tombs\"&gt;Nordic Tombs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Geirmund%27s%20Hall%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Geirmund's Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reachwater%20Rock\"&gt;Reachwater Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"Long ago, the Archmage Gauldur was murdered, and his three sons were hunted down by King Herald's personal battlemage. The entire incident was covered up, their names struck from every record. But the legend survived. Perhaps someone still knows the truth of this ancient tale.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest can be started by reading the book \"\"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Legends\"&gt;Lost Legends&lt;/a&gt;\"\" found throughout Skyrim. See &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Legends%23Locations\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information on their locations. A copy can be found on a dead adventurer's body in Reachwater Rock where part of this quest takes place. The quest can also be activated by reading a &lt;a href=\"Writ%20of%20Sealing\"&gt;Writ of Sealing&lt;/a&gt; in any of the burial locations.\nThe quest details the investigation of the Gauldur legend, and the finding and forging of the long lost, ancient &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Amulet\"&gt;Gauldur Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. When the three sons of Gauldur divided the amulet amongst themselves, they immediately began sacking various settlements around Skyrim. This attracted the attention of the High King Harald of Skyrim, which caused him to send his best warriors and his personal battlemage &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Geirmund\"&gt;Lord Geirmund&lt;/a&gt;. After the defeat of the three sons, Harald ordered every record of their murders destroyed and Gauldur's name and deeds were struck from history, with only fragmented stories left behind.\nInvestigate the Gauldur Legend.\nThe quest begins in &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt; by reading the &lt;a href=\"Daynas%20Valen%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daynas%20Valen\"&gt;Daynas Valen&lt;/a&gt;, which is located under a tent in the camp outside of the tomb. The journal tells of his travels with the &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Dragon%20Claw\"&gt;Ivory Dragon Claw&lt;/a&gt;, and his time on a passenger ship from the city of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. He traveled to Folgunthur with two adventurers that he met on the boat, looking for the fragments of the amulet.\nLearn the Truth from Daynas Valen.\nInside, past one claw keyhole is a room with puzzle pillars and another claw keyhole (all are already opened), then the corpses of &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; and Valen's compatriots. There are also spike and fire traps, and at least one live draugr. In the next large room, there are 5 draugr and &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Wight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr wight&lt;/a&gt; waiting to rise from their crypts. In the northeast corner of the room is a spiral staircase with a trap door in front of it. The trap door can be closed by activating the lever on the right wall of the staircase. Across the bridge at the top of the stairs, he will be lying on another claw keyhole. The Claw and his notes are on his corpse. Reading the notes activates the next three parts of the quest.\nFind the Gauldur Amulet Fragment in Folgunthur.\nThe bridge can be crossed by activating the keyhole. Once across and having avoided the traps and draugr, the Dragonborn will come to a gate with four levers. The path can be opened by activating the two on the right starting with the one nearest the gate, then the lever on the left furthest from the gate, the left lever closest to the gate, then finally the one on the right closest to the gate again. Past the gates, the path goes down stairs, then northeast across a set of stairs where there is a falling boulder trap.\nThe path continues to a room with two thrones. The lever to the left of the leftmost throne opens the door to the room with pillars to unlock the grille covering a staircase (from the left, Hawk-Whale-Snake) plus a soul gem trap. The chain pull in the previous room finishes the job. Down the stairs are two &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt;. Ahead will be a dragon claw puzzle door, but there will be several draugr in crypts on either side. The combination to the puzzle, top to bottom, is Hawk-Hawk-Dragon. Inside is a door to Folgunthur Crypt.\nBeyond that door is &lt;a href=\"Mikrul%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Mikrul Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the easier Gauldur brothers as he has no special skills that separate him from a regular leveled draugr. However, he does have a small contingent of leveled draugr thralls who will attack the Dragonborn upon Mikrul's awakening. They all die, though, as soon as he is killed. A &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Amulet%20Fragment\"&gt;Gauldur Amulet Fragment&lt;/a&gt; and enchanted sword, &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Blackblade\"&gt;Gauldur Blackblade&lt;/a&gt;, are on his corpse. Afterwards, the claw can be used to gain access to the two rooms on the back wall. The one to the right has a chest with leveled loot and a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt;. A door to the right of the word wall provides an exit back to Folgunthur.\nFind the Gauldur Amulet Fragment in Saarthal.\nIn order to gain access to the excavation site, the Dragonborn must first begin the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Under%20Saarthal\"&gt;Under Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\" This quest is attained by joining the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn is not skilled with magic it may be best to not join until prompted by the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;\" as this will only require a demonstration of the &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt; to join the college (after asking her if an exception may be made for being the Dragonborn). After completing the very short quest \"&lt;a href=\"First%20Lessons\"&gt;First Lessons&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; will give the quest \"Under Saarthal\" while leading his class to the tomb to explore it.\nAt this point, \"Under Saarthal\" has similar steps to \"Forbidden Legend.\" Tolfdir should be followed into the excavation site. He will be available for most of the dungeon. He will be missing for a short stretch where he leaves after defeating a room full of draugr, but will return right before the Dragonborn discovers the antechamber with Jyrik and The Eye of Magnus inside. &lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik&lt;/a&gt;, who is in Saarthal by the orb, should be defeated and his &lt;a href=\"Writ%20of%20Sealing\"&gt;Writ of Sealing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Amulet%20Fragment\"&gt;Gauldur Amulet Fragment&lt;/a&gt; taken. Do not forget to claim the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Staff of Jyrik Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt; on the table in front of Jyrik's throne before it can be sent bouncing around the room by Tolfdir when he first tries to attack Jyrik.\nA mage can defeat him by watching the elemental cloud around him as it changes randomly between storm, frost, and fire, and not using the element that is cloaking him as he will resist the attack. Warriors may treat him like a draugr scourge lord, or another draugr mage. Reading the writ will start the next quest point. The next clue about the origin of the Gauldur Amulet Fragment (if needed) can be found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt; by reading the book &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Legends\"&gt;Lost Legends&lt;/a&gt; (on a small table on the right hand side of the room, behind the pillars not in the middle, as the room is entered).\nFind the Gauldur Amulet Fragment in Geirmund's Hall.\n&lt;a href=\"Geirmund%27s%20Hall%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Geirmund's Hall&lt;/a&gt; is a dungeon close to &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, grave of the hero &lt;a href=\"Geirmund\"&gt;Geirmund&lt;/a&gt;. There is a large hole in the ground against the eastern wall. At the bottom is an underwater alcove, with a chest and a Potion of Waterbreathing at the southern end. Up the wooden ramp is an iron door. Behind it are two frostbite spiders and an adept-locked door with leveled loot behind it. To the south and then west, check behind you for a chest. Before opening, disarm the trap or stand to the side of the chest to avoid the fire. Beware of the plate triggering a dart trap. Continuing, you will find a set of steps that lead down to a water-filled room with a pillar puzzle and some draugr. Halfway down the water room is a table with a soul gem \u2013 taking it releases a swinging mammoth skull trap. To unlock the puzzle, the order of the pillars starting from the first is hawk, whale, snake, whale. Once the pillars are in place, the lever by the gate opens the door.\nThe next room contains several more draugr. After climbing the wooden ramp, immediately to the right is an altar with the body of Geirmund holding a key. The door opposite Geirmund's resting place leads to an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; plus a draugr and a frostbite spider. There are stairs up to the right, but they lead to a blocked path. The path to the left leads to a strong leveled draugr. After that is a dead end and a lever on the ground which will trigger a trap if activated. However, behind that lever on the right-hand side is another lever on the wall. Activating that one will cause the drawbridge to drop.\nAcross it is another lever that will drop another drawbridge with draugr on the other side. Next is a swinging pendulum trap with a draugr on the other side, who can be dispatched by shooting him with an arrow through the pendulums \u2013 he will attempt to come through the pendulums, and will be killed.\nThe final room is water-filed, with wooden ramps leading to the crypt for &lt;a href=\"Sigdis%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Sigdis Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;, arguably the hardest of the three sons to kill. There are four sigils on the ground in the cave. He will frequently teleport to whichever one is farthest from the Dragonborn and make two copies of himself. All three will attack the Dragonborn, including using Shouts like &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; (which will knock the Dragonborn over whether or not any bonuses for the Unrelenting Force shout are active) and, at higher levels, Disarm. The easiest way to attack him is with stealth and ranged attacks.\nIf one of the clones is attacked, it will dissipate after one hit; after both clones have died, Sigdis will teleport away again. It is possible to tell Sigdis apart from his clones because he is the only one with the true health amount (the clones will have full health), and also by the fact that his clones will be surrounded by a bluish glow. In addition, the \"real\" Sigdis can be identified by being the only one wearing an Ancient Nord Helmet. His helm's decorative horns curl downwards; the horns on his clones' helmets will be curled upward, akin to the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Yngol\"&gt;Helm of Yngol&lt;/a&gt;. Sigdis also carries the &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Blackbow\"&gt;Gauldur Blackbow&lt;/a&gt;. After he has been killed, the Gauldur Amulet Fragment can be looted from his corpse. Exit through the cave behind Sigdis's coffin.\nReforge the Gauldur Amulet.\nAfter all of the fragments have been collected, the quest continues in &lt;a href=\"Reachwater%20Rock\"&gt;Reachwater Rock&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Karthspire\"&gt;Karthspire&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, there is a dead Adventurer near the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragon%20Claw\"&gt;Emerald Dragon Claw&lt;/a&gt;, on a pedestal along with a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Edict\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; warning would-be explorers to stay away from the site. Further up the path is a claw door, which can be unlocked by rotating the rings to match the combination inscribed on the palm of the Emerald Claw: Bear, Whale, Snake (from the top down). Insert the claw in the keyhole and the door will open, along with three similar doors further ahead. Inside is yet another claw door, this time using the combination of the &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Dragon%20Claw\"&gt;Ivory Dragon Claw&lt;/a&gt;: Hawk, Hawk, Dragon (again, from the top down).\nFurther inside will be a large room with a table with three amulet pedestals. Placing the three amulet fragments on each of the pedestals will make the ghosts of each son appear, each of whom the Dragonborn will have to fight in turn.\nFirst will be Mikrul, who again can be faced as a leveled draugr with a small horde of draugr thralls. The draugr he commands will not stop attacking until Mikrul is defeated.\nSigdis will use the same tactics as before, disappearing and reappearing to shoot arrows at the Dragonborn, using four out of the six possible locations, and using shouts occasionally. Every time he teleports, the battle temporarily stops, which allows restoration of health and saving the game. The real Sigdis has a slightly different helmet model (Ancient Nord Helmet) than his clones (Helm of Yngol), and his clones will always have full health, and be surrounded by a slightly bluish glow.\nAfter Sigdis, Jyrik will appear, occasionally teleporting around the room and using the same elemental cloaking tactic he used back in Saarthal while Tolfdir dealt with the Eye of Magnus. Defeat him using physical attacks or Destruction magic that does not match his elemental cloak.\nOnce all three sons have been defeated, they will reappear as ghosts above the pedestal. As they look to take the Dragonborn on three against one, their father appears and banishes them, with Sigdis commenting on realizing their father has awoken before Gauldur's sarcophagus bursts open and unleashes the spell to send them to Oblivion. Archmage Gauldur will then reforge the &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Amulet%20Fragment\"&gt;Gauldur Amulet Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"The%20Gauldur%20Amulet\"&gt;The Gauldur Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, a necklace that grants +30 to health, magicka, and stamina.\nGauldur's skeleton, in the crypt behind the table with the pedestals, holds a decent amount of money. Additionally, the Ghosts' use of Unrelenting Force may cause one to get stuck on the platform that the Ghosts who have not yet fought are on \u2013 this may cause them to not be able to get back down.\nAfter the three sons have been banished, there is an area that opens behind the pathway that you last entered. This area contains a chest and some items surrounding the chest."}

Due to the pact made between Umaril and Meridia, Umaril was allowed to use her Aurorans to further the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Empire\"&gt;Ayleid Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, however, Umaril and his forces, as well as the Ayleids, would be defeated by Alessia and her rebels, in particular the Divine Crusader &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. In that conflict Umaril would be killed, but he would rise again years later, and gather to him his army of Aurorans once more. But he would again be defeated by a Divine Crusader, this time the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, along with his &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;, bringing a final end to both Umaril and his forces.\nHistory.\nThe Daedric Forces of Umaril were composed of the Daedric warriors known as Aurorans, servants of Meridia. When exactly Umaril made his legendary pact with Meridia, granting him the immortal life of a Daedra, is unknown. What is known is that, as part of the deal, Umaril was also given command of Aurorans as well. Umaril used these in furthering the interests of the Ayleid Empire which he jointly ruled with the other Ayleid kings.\nThe Fall of White Gold Tower.\nAs Alessia's Rebellion grew and became a much more significant threat, Umaril watched as one individual in particular, the legendary Pelinal Whitestrake, caused havoc and destruction within the bounds of the Ayleids. Using armor and weapons blessed by the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt;, Pelinal seemed invincible. Eventually, Umaril called out Pelinal to a duel in &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the Ayleid capital.\nWhen Pelinal arrived, Umaril chose trickery over honor, and he sent hordes of Aurorans to kill Pelinal. Using his Crusader's Relics, though, Pelinal would not fall. But the Aurorans did their job, weakening Pelinal, and even causing him to bleed. With this advantage, Umaril finally faced Pelinal, but the Crusader's fury was unmatched, and Umaril too was slain. Whatever Aurorans that may have been left were killed when Alessia's forces overwhelmed White-Gold Tower, finally turning the war against the Ayleids. Defeated and bereft of their leader, the Aurorans presumably returned to Meridia's Realm after being reborn from the Waters of Oblivion.\nAuroran Crisis.\nBut Umaril was not truly dead. His pact with Meridia allowed his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; to be recycled much like a Daedra's. In time, he regained his body, where and how is unknown. He did immediately prepared to take his revenge on humanity, starting with the Gods that had given Pelinal the weapons to defeat him. Umaril set out to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Church of the Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Gathering his Aurorans once more, Umaril set up base in the westernmost of the old Ayleid outposts, Garlas Malatar, and prepared for attack.\nThe first salvo came in the form of an &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Chapel%20Anvil\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Great Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. A group of Aurorans silently entered the chapel and slaughtered every member of the staff. Using the blood of their victims, they wrote in bloody runes around the main altar: \"By the eternal power of Umaril, the mortal gods shall be cast down.\"\nBy the same unknown means as their entrance, the Aurorans left the chapel to be discovered soon afterwards, raising all manner of suspicion. The faith in the Nine Divines had been shaken, and Umaril's plan had gone into effect.\nThe next attack was &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Chapel%20Bravil\"&gt;launched on Bravil&lt;/a&gt; in a similar manner. The Great Chapel of Mara was attacked and desecrated, all the staffers killed, further shaking the Church. By this time, however, another player had entered the arena. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, famed champion of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, had taken up a quest to recover the lost Relics of the Crusader, the weapons and armor of Pelinal Whitestrake. Whether Umaril knew of this or not is unclear, but it is possible that the next &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Chapel%20Leyawiin\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; was launched on Leyawiin's chapel as a means of killing the Hero, who had succeeded in recovering two Relics already. This attack would be foiled by the Hero, though, the first major setback for Umaril and his forces in the Crisis.\nThe Aurorans would lay low for a long while following this defeat, giving the Hero ample time to gather the remaining Relics, as well as reorganize the old holy order of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;. When next Umaril's forces &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Chapel%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;attacked in Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, it was surely a means of stopping the Hero from reconsecrating the final Relic, the Sword of the Crusader. The Hero defeated the Aurorans set against him and reconsecrated the Sword, finally reuniting all the Relics.\nThe next attack would come not from the Aurorans, but from the Knights of the Nine. Finally ready to move against Umaril, the Knights gathered outside Garlas Malatar and launched their attack. In the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Garlas%20Malatar\"&gt;Battle of Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights and the Aurorans finally clashed head on, with the Hero, now also the new Divine Crusader, leading the charge. In the second level of Garlas Malatar, the Hero destroyed the Dark Orb, a mysterious stone that gave the Aurorans the power of regeneration. When at last the Hero came face to face with Umaril, the two dueled just as Umaril and Pelinal had long ago. In this battle, the Hero was equipped with one more Relic, the Blessing of Talos, which allowed him to follow Umaril to a spirit plane after death. There the Hero destroyed Umaril's spirit, ensuring that he, and his Aurorans, would never rise again.\nWeapons and abilities.\nThe Aurorans under Umaril's command were well armed and equipped. Hidden within protective Ayleid armors, no one knew what their faces truly looked like. Umaril also equipped them with powerful Ayleid battleaxes charged with lightning magic. The Aurorans themselves were magically powerful as well, utilizing a lightning spell called \"Mortal Light.\" Alone the Aurorans were deadly, in groups they could be devastating.\nUmaril's army was also allowed unique powers in the way of teleportation. By some means, the Aurorans were able to infiltrate locations without at all being detected, and left in much the same manner. No evidence exists as to how they do this, exactly, though the secret may lay with yet another mystery: The regenerative abilities of the Aurorans.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Garlas%20Malatar\"&gt;Battle of Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;, the Aurorans demonstrated the ability to resurrect themselves after death via a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Orb\"&gt;Dark Orb&lt;/a&gt;. The origins of this Orb are unknown, possibly it is a piece of Ayleid magic utilized by Umaril, or a gift from &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, mimicking the Daedra's immortality in the mortal plane, thus allowing the Aurorans to return to Umaril without having to revive within Meridia's Realm."}

He and his caravan were attacked and taken hostage by the &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt;, but he managed to escape. His companion Razasha might know more, but she went back to try and save other prisoners. \nYou will find Razasha further to the west. She will tell you that they were captured by a man named &lt;a href=\"Glothun%20the%20Recruiter\"&gt;Glothun the Recruiter&lt;/a&gt;, and that they have captured her mate &lt;a href=\"Shaldagan\"&gt;Shaldagan&lt;/a&gt; as well as a number of others. She will ask you to help free her mate and as many other prisoners as you can. \nHead into &lt;a href=\"Paragon%27s%20Remembrance\"&gt;Paragon's Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;. You will find the prisons south from the big room, guarded by Glothun. Once Glothun is dead, look around the room. You will find one surviving prisoner here, &lt;a href=\"Thorkh\"&gt;Thorkh&lt;/a&gt;. Free him, then read the note on the table about the conversion status of the other captives. First off, head westward to free Shaldagan and &lt;a href=\"Morushna\"&gt;Morushna&lt;/a&gt;. You will need to put out a fire to get to them; there is a bucket and some water nearby. Once you have put out the fire, talk to Shaldagan and she will tell you that the cultists here are being led by someone called &lt;a href=\"Azhnura%20the%20Proselytizer\"&gt;Azhnura the Proselytizer&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe remaining captives can be found north of the main room. In the northeast, you will find &lt;a href=\"Batasha\"&gt;Batasha&lt;/a&gt;; she can be freed without issues. In the northwest, you will find an icy room with &lt;a href=\"Unsulag\"&gt;Unsulag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gahar\"&gt;Gahar&lt;/a&gt; being kept in place by some kind of gust. There are two switches here; each of them will kill one prisoner and release the others. Talk to them both, then make your decision. \nOnce you have freed the prisoners, it is time to go after Azhnura. Head west from the main room, then north. Here, you will find Azhnura, as well as the people who designed the fire and ice traps. Kill them all, then head for the back exit to the south. You will find the rescued captives gathered there; guide them to safety through the passages ahead. Once you exit the dungeon, speak with Razasha to finish the quest."}

Cosh \"found\" her stolen dowry, and now they are getting married for the future of Taneth. Zeira is apparently none too pleased with this and wishes to get her revenge on Cosh. Head over and speak with her about the ordeal. \nZeira will tell you that she intends to crash the wedding and tell Magnifica Falorah what kind of man she is really marrying. This will get her to turn the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt; on Cosh, which will force &lt;a href=\"Nicolas\"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt; out into the open. Zeira will tell you to head to &lt;a href=\"Silver-Claw\"&gt;Silver-Claw&lt;/a&gt;'s shop to get your invitation to the wedding. Head over there and speak to the man; it turns out he is one of the few merchants in &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; to not get an invitation. He will direct you to two people who did get invitations: &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Wallavir\"&gt;Lord Wallavir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Balina\"&gt;Lady Balina&lt;/a&gt;. You can steal it from either one of these people. Lord Wallavir will keep his invitation on his person as he walks around the market, while Lady Balina will keep it under lock and key in her mansion. \nOnce you have stolen an invitation, head back to the Den and speak with Silver-Claw so that he can start forging the documents. You can bring one guest along, so now is the time to talk to everyone and decide whether you are taking &lt;a href=\"Quen\"&gt;Quen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velsa\"&gt;Velsa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt; or Silver-Claw. Once you have made your decision, head to &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Thimble\"&gt;The Diamond Thimble&lt;/a&gt; to pick out your wedding attire. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Percius%20Loche\"&gt;Percius Loche&lt;/a&gt; here and he will allow you to pick any of the dresses and suits here in the shop, though you must return them when the operation is over. Make your choice, then speak with Zeira, who has just arrived in the shop. She will give you the forged invitation and ask you to cause a distraction once you are inside, so that she can sneak in. \nHead to the palace in the east of town and give your invitation to the gatekeeper &lt;a href=\"Muazel\"&gt;Muazel&lt;/a&gt;. He will let you in and tell you that &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Inspector%20Rhanbiq\"&gt;Chief Inspector Rhanbiq&lt;/a&gt; is officiating the wedding. Head inside, then talk to your date. They will suggest that to allow Zeira to gain entry, you should either convince the doorman or distract him somehow. You can persuade the doorman to believe your lies that someone else needs to be joining you; if you do not persuade him, .\nSpeak with Zeira once she is inside. She will tell you that you need to get closer to Cosh to find Nicolas. Escort her to the palace steps, where Cosh will be introduced to the public. Zeira will tell you that this man is in fact Nicolas; they are one and the same. Talk to Zeira about this and she will want to put a stop to this wedding, by getting through to Magnifica Falorah and convincing her that the person she is marrying is in fact a criminal. For this, you need to get inside the palace, and you also need to find out where Magnifica Falorah is. You can pickpocket a key off one of the servers to get into the palace. To discover the bride's location, you can talk to &lt;a href=\"Turalla\"&gt;Turalla&lt;/a&gt; and give her a bottle of the wine she wants. It can be stolen from a chest south of the pool. Once you give it to Turalla, she will tell you that Magnifica Falorah is in her bedchamber.\nBreak into the palace through the kitchens. Sneak up to the second floor, where you will find the door to the bedroom. Once inside, speak with Magifica Falorah; she will not believe you unless you can produce the skull of her ancestor Danobia, which Nicolas stole from the tomb. Your date will suggest there might be a hidden passage here in this room; the candlesticks can all turn, and the \"&lt;a href=\"An%20Excerpt%20from%20the%20Book%20of%20Seasons\"&gt;Book of Seasons&lt;/a&gt;\" here in the room will provide hints as to the order in which they must be turned. The candlesticks are all next to a painting that represents a certain season; the correct order is spring-summer-fall-winter. This will open a door to a secret room in one of the cabinets. \nIn this secret room, you will find the crown, still attached to the skull. Speak with Zeira and she will tell you to head back to the wedding crowd as she tells the truth to Magnifica Falorah. She will tell you to head back to the guild after; you are in charge until she gets back. Make your way downstairs and to the ceremony. Zeira will crash the ceremony and confront Nicolas with the skull, which will prompt Magnifica Falorah to tell the Iron Wheel to arrest everyone present. Escape the palace with your date; you cannot save Zeira. \nOnce you are out of the palace, return to the Den and talk to Walks-Softly to finish the quest."}

Some forges are unique in that they are the only way to forge special weapons or armor.\nLocations.\nThere is a Forge in almost every major town and near every major faction or guild. Some have more than others and many include smelters, but most have a workbench, &lt;a href=\"Tanning%20Rack\"&gt;tanning rack&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and Grindstone. &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Strongholds\"&gt;Orc Strongholds&lt;/a&gt; and certain dungeons and caves possess a forge. All &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; encampments possess an &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Smithing%29\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, which serves the same purpose as a forge.\nWith installed, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can construct a house with a forge in the basement of the house. A smelter can be found outside."}

I have made no attempt to correct the texts themselves as they may have historical value.\nWithout further ado, the ramblings of Thorbald:\nThis ain't no book for how to be a grayt smith. So if you're reeding this, stop. It's just me own notes cawse i'm getting old and cranky and don't rember stuff. These be me own methods for makin things.\nIron armor and weapons.

And &lt;a href=\"studded%20armor\"&gt;studded armor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Scaled armor&lt;/a&gt; too. Well, that needs some steel also. And . Can't make Scaled armor without Corundum. That would be dum.\nDwarfen armor and weapons. &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Scrap%20Metal\"&gt;Dwarfen scrap metal&lt;/a&gt;, some iron, and some leather strips. I'm gonna stop sayin leather, cawse it's always used. Are you writin what i jus said? You idiot! Jus do it, don't rite it. (Thorbald is old and fat).\nElven armor and weapons. Elves and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;dwarfs&lt;/a&gt; didn't get along. Bet you didn't know that. Elven stuff needs &lt;a href=\"Refined%20Moonstone\"&gt;Moonstone&lt;/a&gt; and a little bit of iron. Except for that &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Gilded%20Armor\"&gt;Gilded&lt;/a&gt; stuff. Gotta add &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt; if you wanna make Gilded Elven armor.\nOrcish armor and weapons. Use &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orichalcum&lt;/a&gt; and a bit of iron. (Thorbald doesn't like &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;)\nEbony armor and weapons. Takes only &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;. No iron. Not even a little. You'll want to, but don't.\nGlass armor and weapon. Need &lt;a href=\"Refined%20Malachite\"&gt;Malachite&lt;/a&gt; and sum Moonstone. Nasty stuff, workin' with Malachite.\nDaedric armor and weapons. Hah! Like i'd rite that down. (He uses &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;daydra hearts&lt;/a&gt;.

Upon entering the fort, walk up the steps on the left side to reach the drawbridge and pull the lever to lower the bridge, walk over and enter the North Tower.\nThe North Tower.\nWhen walking down the corridor someone calls out, &lt;a href=\"Christer\"&gt;Christer&lt;/a&gt;, an older male who is dressed in common clothes, stands in a small room on the left. He goes on to tell the story about how he sneaked in past the guards in order to find his wife &lt;a href=\"Fjola\"&gt;Fjola&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"Stendarr's mercy - you aren't one of them. Please, you've got to help me!\"\nWhat's going on? \"It's my wife, Fjola! I think she's being held in this tower.\"\nAccepting to help Christer starts the quest, and he also gives away the Mistwatch Key as a reward for easier access within the fort.\nMoving forward through the locked door, several bandits appear with varying degrees of difficulty dependent on level. At the top of the North Tower exit to enter the roof and walk over to the West Tower. Just past the door is a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with various loot.\nThe West Tower.\nOn the first floor is a large room with a cell and a dead woman. Two bandits, they can be &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Marauder\"&gt;Bandit Marauder&lt;/a&gt;s, guard the room. On top of the table is a &lt;a href=\"Note%20%28Mistwatch%29\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; explaining why the captured woman is dead. After killing the bandits, move up to the top and exit the West Tower. Walk over the roof and enter The East Tower.\nThe East Tower.\nHalfway up the tower the Dragonborn is stopped by a Bandit Leader who asks questions. After the appropriate reply she reveals herself to be Fjola and does not wish to go back to her husband:\n\"All right, snowback. Who are you, and what are you doing in my tower?\"\nStand aside, woman. I'm here for Fjola! \"Fjola? How do you know that name?\"\nGetting rid of Christer.\nThe Dragonborn may tell Fjola that they will help her get rid of her husband without killing him. She then gives them her &lt;a href=\"Fjola%27s%20Wedding%20Band\"&gt;wedding band&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat am I supposed to tell Christer? \"I don't know. I never expected the old bag to follow me so far. Just get rid of him. But don't kill him. I don't hate the man. I just want him to go back to his farm and forget about me.\"\nShe is passive from that moment on, so if the desire to kill her is there, do any sneak attacks on her as this would be the safer option.\nWhen returning to Christer, either tell him a ring was found and that &lt;a href=\"Fjola\"&gt;Fjola&lt;/a&gt; is either dead, or that she was not in the fort. For the latter he will reward the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; with some gold and leave in hopes of finding her; for the former he will be disheartened and allow the Dragonborn to keep the ring as it reminds him too much of the pain:\n\"What news? Why isn't Fjola with you?\"\nI found this ring, but no sign of her. \"Her marriage band? Then there's hope - she was here! I have to move on if I want to find her. Please, take the coin I promised. Blessings of Stendarr on you!\"\nShe's dead, but I found this. \"That... I gave it to her on our wedding day. Help me, Divines... it's true isn't it? I'm sorry. Keep the ring. I cannot bear the weight of them in my heart, and I must make the journey alone now. Thank you for... thank you.\"\nAfter he leaves, return to Fjola and inform her that her husband has left and she is grateful. She states that she will help them in the future and the quest is completed:\n\"Oh, it's you. I didn't think you could handle this on your own. Did you get rid of Christer?\"\nHe won't bother you again. \"How did... no, forget it. I don't care to know. I'm free of the little man, and that's what matters. I owe you a debt, and I aim to repay it. We'll see each other again someday. For now, goodbye, and thanks.\"\nKilling Fjola.\nThe Dragonborn can choose to kill Fjola and loot her body, including her ring:\nThis is pointless. I should just kill you and be done with it. \"Better men have tried. Let's finish this.\"\nAfter she is dead, inform Christer and tell him that she had to be killed. He flies into a rage, and the Dragonborn may need to kill him, too:\n\"What news? Why isn't Fjola with you?\"\nI had to kill her. She attacked me. \"What? My Fjola would never... You monster! I'll kill you for this!\""}

In the center of a room upon a pillar stands a gauntlet with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;Daedric letter \"Oht\"&lt;/a&gt; glowing in the palm. On a table nearby, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will find the \"&lt;a href=\"Midden%20Incident%20Report\"&gt;Midden Incident Report&lt;/a&gt;\", which details the fate of the deceased students surrounding the Relic, and the Investigator's Key. According to the report, the Relic was unable to be moved, so the author instead pried off the four rings found left behind on the Gauntlet. The rings were then stored in &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Investigators%20Box\"&gt;Master Investigators Box&lt;/a&gt;. The box may be opened with the Investigator's Key, or picking the Master-level lock. Note that opening the box to take the rings is counted as &lt;a href=\"stealing\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt;, so one needs to avoid &lt;a href=\"Urag%20gro-Shub\"&gt;Urag gro-Shub&lt;/a&gt;'s detection and attempts to stop you from taking the rings. Instead, one can wait after Urag retires to his room at night; alternatively Urag will not be present in the room immediately after completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;The Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe names and order of the rings are as follows:\nUpon placing all of the rings on the Relic, &lt;a href=\"Velehk%20Sain\"&gt;Velehk Sain&lt;/a&gt; is summoned from the gauntlet and speaks to the Dragonborn:\n\"Where am I? You! Out with it, then.\"\nWe're beneath Winterhold College. The Midden. \"Ah, I was beginning to think the day would never come. So you broke the binding spell, did you? Matter little. Their souls are trapped in Oblivion all the same, and here I stay.\"\nYou're going back where you belong, dremora. \"Where I belong is back aboard my ship, on the Abecean. You've no hope of defeating me, pup. Don't bother. Why not broker a bargain, instead?\"\nHe informs that the Gauntlet was part of a binding spell that held him in &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, and, despite his admitting to having killed the students, tries persuasion to free him in exchange for wealth. This wealth is the result of excess booty which came from a captured and looted Imperial galleon that he was unable to carry. To stash the treasure, he hid his cache both geographically and magically.\nTo release him, the Dragonborn must say \"Velehk Sain I release you.\" He will laugh, give his thanks, and portal away. A &lt;a href=\"Velehk%20Sain%27s%20Treasure%20Map\"&gt;treasure map&lt;/a&gt; will then appear in the inventory, which leads to a chest at the base of a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Shrine of Talos&lt;/a&gt; west of the College of Winterhold. The chest will appear as if by portal when the Dragonborn gets near the spot depicted in the map. See the &lt;a href=\"Velehk%20Sain%27s%20Treasure\"&gt;treasure page&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nAlternatively, the Dragonborn may attempt to get rid of him by saying \"Velehk Sain I banish you to Oblivion.\" This will fail, and Velehk Sain will then attack. If he is defeated, his body will only hold two &lt;a href=\"scimitar\"&gt;scimitar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20garb\"&gt;Hammerfell garb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguard%20boots\"&gt;Redguard boots&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedra heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt should be noted that the &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; spells &lt;a href=\"Banish%20Daedra%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Banish Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Expel%20Daedra\"&gt;Expel Daedra&lt;/a&gt; do affect Velehk Sain, but by draining his health until he dies rather than sending him back to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;."}

But lo, it was not a simple naturally formed cave, but &lt;a href=\"Vardnknd\"&gt;Vardnknd&lt;/a&gt;, a long forgotten Dwarven ruin.\nA storm of great intensity had ravaged the region recently, and the locals all thought that some curse lay upon the caves, and they spewed out bad weather because of this. But Elberon Blackthorn is nothing if not well read, and I was well-versed with the legends surrounding those caves. You see, I had been looking for Vardnknd for a long time, Because deep within it contained a Karstanghz-Beharn, also known as a Weather Witch.\nThese legendary devices were said to be able to control the weather, and Vardnknd's was the strongest of them all. But why did they make it? To terrorize innocents? To help in times of underground drought? Either way, a storm now raged across the region, and it was obvious who was at fault. To save the locals, and to claim the power of the weather for my own, me and my trusted band of mercenaries dove towards the problem with the same bravery and skill I approach everything in life with.\nInside, evidence of the storm's rampage could still be seen and felt. Pipes spewed a poisonous ooze into the streams, rubble lay about, and most tellingly, a massive indoor storm raged. The Weather Witch had gone mad! Alas, the door to the main gallery was sealed shut. But with my impressive knowledge of the Dwarves and their infernal sciences, I was able to quickly deduce the issue.\nYou see, dear readers, while the storm raged, it drew its power from magic derived from each of the four seasons. Yes, the Dwarves had in this very ruin undertaken a massive analysis of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and tied to each of them a conduit that would focus their natural energies into the gallery, allowing the weather to be controlled! All one had to do was enter each part of the facility and disconnect those conduits. Only then could I enter the main gallery and shut down the Weather Witch!\nThis first volume details my intrepid adventure into each of these seasonal sub-facilities, as well as my harrowing escape. It also serves as a manual on how to shut down those conduits which I aim to document in my next volume.\nThus armed with this information and my benefactor's funding, my apprentice and I have once more endeavored into the heart of this ruin, this time with more men, and hopefully, with more satisfying results.\nAutumn&lt;br&gt;\nAs I trundled through the halls of autumn, a marvelous sight unfolded. Before me lay an enormous stretch of farmland, decrepit and overgrown, but a farm nonetheless. Strange fruits and grains grew in plots, while emaciated &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt; ran about, all the while being tended by enormous double-bladed centurions. Did the Dwemer find it amusing that the surface-people had the whole season dedicated just to harvest, or did they do this as a mockery to some forgotten god of the feast? Whatever the case, I aimed to examine a piece of this Dwarven history for myself.\nThe harvest glowed with a foul light, yet the grains as stiff as a rock. Yet as dense as the wheat was, I observed the bladed centurions cutting through it with little effort and carrying them off to a set of depositories near the entrance. While no doubt the blades of these machines would make short work of flesh and armor, my men nevertheless valiantly served as a distraction as I made my escape. Perhaps if I had more time, or more men, I could carry the heavy wheat over to the depository, and sate whatever freakish endeavors the Dwarves had begun.\nSpring&lt;br&gt;\nSpring greeted me with a splash of color, as beautiful flowers were scattered across the halls of metal and stone. There were even animals sauntering about, feeding off the vegetation warmed by the artificial light. Unfortunately, our journey through this horrific sight was soon delayed by a most peculiar obstruction.\nThick, gnarled roots blocked the passageways, halting our progress. Perhaps the Dwemer found nature to be cumbersome, and saw spring as nothing more than a season of suffering. While the mercenaries labored to cut through the bark, my strong perception allowed me to notice strange &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt; shambling through the artificial forests. As I brushed aside it, the roots quivered, as if their tendrils were an extension of the forest creature. Were these spriggans the tenders of the gardens, or just a consequence of its existence? Regardless, if we could somehow sever the connection between the spriggans and the roots, we might find a way deeper into the ruins.\nSummer&lt;br&gt;\nSummer was a maze of tunnels and pipes, and no doubt centuries of neglect had left the place in a state of pure chaos. Lava spewed from every stone orifice I could see, and unbearable heat made for a precarious journey, causing many of the mercenaries to turn back to cooler times. But the Dwemer had predicted such superheat, for this unbearable weather was undoubtedly what summer meant to them.\nAs I pulled myself through the swelter, I noticed &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;repair spiders&lt;/a&gt; darting to and fro, lowering bridges that granted access to side sections of the chamber. It seems that within each section is a service waypoint that releases some sort of magical coolant, reducing the heat from impossible to merely annoying. Perhaps if I could find a way to direct the spiders to the various waypoints in the area, I could drop the temperature to a more manageable level.\nWinter&lt;br&gt;\nWinter was, not to my surprise, home to a great indoor blizzard and what the mercenaries thought of as artificial stone mountains. Yet they were not mountains, but great towering silos of frozen water. And the cold! Not even the highest mountains compared to such chills, and we were soon trading furs amongst ourselves to stay warm!\nIt became clear that to progress through this area, I would need to dive through the frozen taters that surround the towers, sneaking up and around the structure like the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wraiths&lt;/a&gt; that call this place home. As clever a solution as any solution thought up by me, but not one I could risk at the moment. Perhaps when we return to this ruin, I can find someone less important to brave it."}

The Forsworn were formed following the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; was engaged with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in a conflict known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; were the main provinces involved. During this war, the Empire all but turned a blind eye to the other Imperial provinces. As a result, the Reach was drained of its Imperial garrison, which was conscripted to fight in the War. As a result, the native Reachmen took up arms and conquered the Reach, forming the Forsworn Kingdom in 4E 174. The Reachmen were said to have been generally fair rulers, despite commiting crimes against former &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; landowners, especially the ones who had mistreated the natives prior. During this time, Hagravens are implied to have been able to walk around freely in Markarth.\nThe Reachmen would continue to rule their lands until 4E 176, when &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed the Reach at the request of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Hrolfdir\"&gt;Jarl Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt;. With his militia, and the power of his &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric reclaimed the city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; from the natives in battle. After the conflict, however, both Jarl Hrolfdir and Ulfric were said to have been merciless against the people within the city. Ulfric was said to have killed any who did not take up arms against the Forsworn, and even those who had only spoken to the King of the Reachmen, Madanach, were scheduled for execution by the Jarl. King &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt; himself was also scheduled for execution, but was ultimately spared by the request of &lt;a href=\"Thonar%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thonar Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt;, who would use Madanach's influence for his personal gains. Those who did not run were executed, excluding Madanach and a handful of others. Ulfric Stormcloak and his men chased the rest of them out of the city.\nPost 4E 176.\nSince the Markarth Incident, the Forsworn have made travel in the Reach perilous and dangerous, the Imperial Legion considers the Forsworn as little more than brigands based on their frequent raids and ambushes within the Hold. The Forsworn, likewise, consider the Empire an enemy, and do not hesitate to attacks its Legionnaires when encountered in the wild. Back when communnications with the Forsworn were possible, Jarl Hrolfdir attempted to negotiate for peace with their leaders, but was killed by the Forsworn instead. The Forsworn were bold enough in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; to actually take over the gold mine known as &lt;a href=\"Kolskeggr%20Mine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Kolskeggr Mine&lt;/a&gt; from the miners working the location, resulting in fear at &lt;a href=\"Left%20Hand%20Mine\"&gt;Left Hand Mine&lt;/a&gt; for a similar attack. A similar raid occured at &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten\"&gt;Karthwasten&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Mercenary\"&gt;Silver-Blood Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; being sent out to the site in an attempt to force the owner, the Reachman &lt;a href=\"Ainethach\"&gt;Ainethach&lt;/a&gt;, to sell the mine to the Silver-Blood family.\nJarl Igmund also frequently places bounties on the heads of Forsworn leaders, which are commonly used by mercenaries as a means of income in the Reach. Ambushes by the Reachmen are common within the Reach, though large sums of gold are often left behind by the Forsworn. Many seek death in battle over capture by their enemies. At the same time, traders and caravans are ambushed by the Forsworn, and goods are taken after the raid. The Forsworn are also known to kidnap people.\nSince the Markarth Incident, the Forsworn no longer function as a unified force, instead having each tribe govern itself. Communications between the tribes does occur, but there is no solidified Forsworn force. Conflict exists between the Forsworn in regards as to how they should fight. Even their revered Hagravens have conflicts, resulting in the Forsworn getting involved in the mix. Due to a lack of a centralized body, the Forsworn struggle to organize assaults. Despite holding the eastern slopes of the Reach, and only needing to take over &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sungard\"&gt;Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt; to solidify their position, some Forsworn refuse to act and summon the tribes to cut off the retreat of their enemies. Other tribes are ready to fight, having trained and inspired themselves for battle, but refuse to engage in combat without the approval of their matriarch.\nWithin Markarth, Madanach sent out orders to one of his allies, &lt;a href=\"Nepos%20the%20Nose\"&gt;Nepos the Nose&lt;/a&gt;. Madanach gave passion to the downtrodden within Markarth, directing them to kill the enemies of the Forsworn in their name. Such attacks were frequently organised to target the enemies of Thonar Silver-Blood, however, such as the attack on an Imperial agent named &lt;a href=\"Margret\"&gt;Margret&lt;/a&gt;. The garrison stationed within the Reach is barely able to keep the Forsworn in check, and has to rely on further Imperial Legion support to keep the trade lanes with the other Holds open. The Forsworn not only engage with Legion soldiers in the wilderness, however, as &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Hunter\"&gt;Orc Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s are also often fought by the natives.\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Forsworn also made attempts to return the glory of Red Eagle. Red Eagle, also known as Faolan, was a King of the Reach around &lt;a href=\"1E%201030\"&gt;1E 1030&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, the Reach was ruled by ten kings, and Faolan was destined to unite the ten kings under one banner, a journey he would slowly aim to complete. Then the Alessian Legions under Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt; arived, and either through conquest or bargains, took over more and more of the Reach, until coming to &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Hills\"&gt;Sundered Hills&lt;/a&gt;, the home of Faolan. Faolan would lose his lands due to being betrayed by his elders, and with a number of Reachmen he continued the fight, even collaborating with a Hagraven who had come to join him.\nFaolan would fight thousands of the Alessian invaders, but when they had routed, he too fell. His followers prepared a tomb for him, which would house Faolan until being awoken so he may lead the Reachmen once more.\nThe Forsworn at &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Towers\"&gt;Sundered Towers&lt;/a&gt; held copies of the book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Red%20Eagle%20%28Book%29\"&gt;The Legend of Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;\", but their Briarheart also held \"&lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%27s%20Rite\"&gt;Red Eagle's Rite&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%27s%20Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Red Eagle's Fury&lt;/a&gt;, the sword of Faolan, aiming to use its power to advance the Forsworn cause.\n&lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral members of the Forsworn, including Madanach, were imprisoned in Cidhna Mine. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, they attempted a breakout from the prison. It is unknown if they were successful or not, but if they were, they established a camp at &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Redoubt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Druadach Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;, from where Madanach aimed to unify the Forsworn into a single force, reclaim the Reach, and bring peace to the land. Expecting it to take years, Madanach believed no place would be safe from the Forsworn until that time, as they aimed to cut a bloody swath in the Reach until they were free.\nReligion and culture.\nThe Forsworn, largely, venerate and protect the Hagravens, providing trinkets at small altars with soul gems for these beings. Both the spirits and the hagravens within the Reach are said to largely support the Forsworn cause. This faith of the Forsworn is largely considered to be old and heretical by both Imperial and Nord standards, and were therefore forbidden by the Nords. Since their uprising was crushed, the Nords have forbidden the native Reachmen from following their own culture and venerating their own gods once more. Which Gods the Forsworn venerate is never specified, though it is implied that they worship both &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;. Times under the rule of the Reachmen had been both good and bad. The Forsworn follow the old ways, though some consider some of those ways to be best forgotten, as they include blood sacrifices and communing with Daedra.\nSupport for the Forsworn varies per person. Some believe that life was better under the rule of the Reachmen, opposing the laws and ways of the Nords. Others joined the Forsworn due to injustices faced at the hands of the Nords. Some do support the Forsworn cause, but do not join them, stating that their \"crusade\" against the Nords has failed. Among the most deadly of the Forsworn are the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Forsworn Briarheart&lt;/a&gt;s. These members of the Forsworn have their own hearts replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Briar%20Heart\"&gt;Briar Heart&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of the Hagravens, providing them with great power. This feat is seen by the Forsworn as an act of a \"true Reachman\".\nOthers sympathize with the Forsworn, but do not support them, as the deaths they caused were in attempts to rebuild a past which was over long ago.\nWeapons and armor.\nForsworn equipment is distinguished by its use of bone, fur, and feathers. It is of a primitive, albeit effective, design and is surprisingly valuable. According to their fighting techniques and equipment, Forsworn prefer to use dual-wielded weapons with unmatched skill. Their bows are especially powerful for their weight.\nForsworn armor is statistically identical to &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt; while their weapons are on par with &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, albeit heavier. Their arrows are considerably weaker than most arrows.\nUnits.\nThe units used by the Forsworn in their uprising vary greatly. The classifications are as follows: Forsworn, Forsworn Forager, Forsworn Looter, Forsworn Pillager, Forsworn Ravager, Forsworn Shaman and Forsworn Briarheart. Of these units, the Forsworn Briarhearts are the strongest of the units, with both the best experience in melee combat as well as magical capabilities."}

They appear to be partially &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; in nature, as the ritual of creating a Briarheart involves cutting out the warrior's heart and replacing it with a &lt;a href=\"Briar%20Heart\"&gt;briar heart&lt;/a&gt;, hence the name.\nBriarheart Ritual.\n\"Heart of thorn... bones of the wild... in life, Forsworn... rise from death, Blood of our Blood.\"\nCombat.\nThere are two distinct types of Forsworn Briarhearts: &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; casters, and &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; fighters. The attack methods used by Briarhearts are &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;one-handed weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;destruction magic&lt;/a&gt;, usually &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; based, but sometimes &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt;. The melee using Briarhearts can be found &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;dual-wielding&lt;/a&gt; Forsworn &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Axe\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;, and are usually leveled with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. They are also rather quick, and can make short work of their enemies when at close range.\nThe magic-casting Briarhearts will often begin the battle by activating a cloak spell and conjuring an &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;. They can cast &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Spear\"&gt;Icy Spear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Cloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Cloak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Frost%20Atronach\"&gt;Conjure Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Incinerate\"&gt;Incinerate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sparks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Cloak\"&gt;Flame Cloak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Conjure Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the preferred element of the Briarheart. These enemies can be very difficult to face at longer ranges, and they also run backwards if chased, making them harder to hit with melee weapons.\nThe partially-exposed Briar Heart can also be targeted with a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; if the Dragonborn is skilled enough. Striking the heart will deal more damage than usual and is easier to score a critical hit on it, though not significant."}

Their king is &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; was busy fighting the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, it pulled many of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; soldiers from Markarth to fight, leaving it with only a small garrison. The Reachmen, who had wanted independence for a long time, took this opportunity to force Imperial troops out of the Reach, and from &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;, it was its own kingdom. Aside from some crimes which were committed against former Nord landowners, the Forsworn were recorded as having ruled their lands fairly, and were trying to be recognized by the Empire as a legitimate kingdom. In 4E 176 Markarth's nobility asked &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim the Reach, to which he accepted. Upon reclaiming Markarth the remaining Forsworn scattered, those who stayed or those related to the Forsworn were executed, excluding Madanach, Nepos the Nose and a handful of others. Their uprising has made travel in the Reach dangerous.\u00a0The Legion sees them as merciless, and order their soldiers to neither give, nor expect mercy if they attack.\nCombat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; make use of looters, foragers, &lt;a href=\"hagraven\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt;s, shamans, archers, pillagers, ravagers, warlords, assassins, and lastly, briarhearts. The briarhearts are a special type of Forsworn. These Reachmen chose to let their heart get cut out by Hagravens for it to be replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Briar%20Heart\"&gt;Briar Heart&lt;/a&gt;, granting them greater strength. When they attack, they do not care about their chances of success, nor for the money, as large sums of gold are often left behind. They seek to harm the Nordic population in such a manner that they will eventually leave.\nHideouts.\nThe following are Forsworn hideouts:"}

For someone who has been by my side since birth, he's now almost a stranger to me. His interest in our lessons has waned, and for hours he'll go out by himself. He simply tells me he's going for a walk to clear his mind, but I don't believe that's the case.\nPerhaps my worries are unfounded. He could be training alone, after all. I know his magic exceeds mine, and it could be he's simply grown bored of our shared lessons. I always thought myself the one in need of solitude, but here I am mourning the loss of his company. I'll try to talk to him again tonight.\n16th of First Seed\nI never thought an acting troupe would be so disruptive to my personal studies, but our once peaceful town has been thrown into chaos with their arrival. Day and night, their caravan is surrounded by a crowd. The noise is enough to drive one mad.\nWorst of all, my brother couldn't be more excited! All he seems to talk about now is their parlor tricks and trite plays. It's downright common for me to catch him holding a conversation with one of the actors. I know my brother is far more gregarious than I, but there simply must be limits.\nI keep telling myself this will soon end. They're a novelty, and a passing one at that. As soon as they leave town, my brother will return to his studies. I'm sure of it.\n2nd of Rains Hand\nNever has my brother shocked me so. I'm near tears with the indignity of it all, I truly am. I'm loath to write such events, but there's no denying my brother's embarrassing actions.\nTonight Larydel came to our studies reeking of alcohol and perfume. I have no idea what manner of company he was with beforehand, nor do I want to know. Never before has he displayed such ludicrous behavior. It was all I could do to even look at his face, covered in shame and smeared with lip paint.\nHe was remorseful of course. Told me that he realized the repercussions of his actions and how unacceptable they were. Still, my trust in him wanes ever more. First he secludes himself, then he makes friends with riffraff, and now this? I fear I'm losing the brother I once knew.\n9th of Mid Year\nToday I received the most wondrous news, I barely know how to write about it. Even now my fingers tremble in excitement, so much I can barely hold my quill! All of our hard work researching and practicing, all of it has led to this moment.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; have accepted us both as assistants. I'm to aid the Sapiarch of Artifice, and Larydel has been accepted by the Sapiarch of Thaumaturgy. I could near cry from happiness. I was so worried that only one of us would be accepted, and the other would be left behind. I couldn't bear the thought of parting with my dear brother, but now we don't have to. We can remain together, as it's always been.\nLarydel was \u2026 shocked when he heard the news, I see that now. At first I thought it was something akin to fear, but that's just silly. What reason would he have to be frightened? No, it must just be surprise! Apprehension perhaps over such a great honor being bestowed upon us.\nThis is good. I've tried to not mind it, but Larydel has been so distant as of late. I understand why he's chosen to live apart from me to conduct his own research. After all, I've always feared I would hold him back. But when we do meet, well \u2026.\nSometimes I barely recognize him. It's as if he's wearing a mask when we're together. Even now, I can feel my chest tightening at the thought. No, I must not think such thoughts. Soon we'll be happy in &lt;a href=\"Lillandril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;, studying together once more. I'll finally be able to catch up. Be his equal once more.\nNever has such a happy day come. I can finally be with my brother again."}

However, as the treaty was about to be signed, King &lt;a href=\"Camaron\"&gt;Camaron&lt;/a&gt; became outraged and ordered his troops to riot within the city, starting a riot. Daggerfall historians claim that Camaron \"realized that the proposed treaty would have included a formal declaration that the kingdoms of Sentinel and Daggerfall would share Betony, and he flew into a rage,\" however, Sentinel historians state that the treaty had been purposefully miswritten by Daggerfall (specifically the Arch-Priest of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; Lord &lt;a href=\"Vanech\"&gt;Vanech&lt;/a&gt;) in an attempt to trick Camaron into signing a different contract. The entire city of Reich Gradkeep erupted into a bloodbath, with the entire royal family of the city dying, except for one sickly infant, who later died. Lord &lt;a href=\"Auberon%20Flyte\"&gt;Auberon Flyte&lt;/a&gt;, a cousin of Lord Graddock, took control of the city after the riot, and renamed it &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of the deceased royal family.\nAs the riot began to die down, Sentinel's army fled to &lt;a href=\"Yeorth%20Burrowland\"&gt;Yeorth Burrowland&lt;/a&gt;, with Daggerfall\ns army chasing them as far as the &lt;a href=\"Ravennian%20Forest\"&gt;Ravennian Forest&lt;/a&gt; before making camp.

It's said that &lt;a href=\"Faolchu\"&gt;Faolchu&lt;/a&gt;, the invader of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, was originally slain here. They hope to find out what killed him in the past.\"\nWalkthrough.\nContinue talking to Grahla and she'll tell the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; the spirits still linger even after an age has passed since the Battle of Glenumbra Moors. They are looking for Faolchu, the beast that ravages Camlorn. He fought and died here and the mages want to know what happened all those years ago so they can kill him again.\nSarvith, the master of Incunabula, hopes to evoke a vision that shows the events surrounding Faolchu's death. They are collecting the most powerful historic artifacts to use as focus objects. The spirits are making it difficult though. After collecting the blades, hand them over to Sarvith, he knows what to do.\nHead out over the Moors and locate the swords and fight the spirits when they attack. Then head over to the tent where Sarvith is and give them to him. He seems uncertain for a second but still thinks the swords will be enough for the ritual. He hopes to open a window to get a glimpse into the past and see what happened to Faolchu and find out how the Dirennis were able to defeat the Alessians so long ago.\nFollow him and &lt;a href=\"Bhagrun%20gro-Dunk\"&gt;Bhagrun gro-Dunk&lt;/a&gt; outside and observe when they perform the ritual. A short second a window opens during the ritual and a ghostly figure is seen, then the window closes upon them. It seems the spell backfired on the mages and talk to Sarvith to find out what happened.\nHe is happy as it worked, they opened a window and somewhere nearby a door into history stands open. All that's needed is to step through it. He thinks the woman who appeared was a fragment from the past. But he is now unsure of what to do next and suggests the Vestige to go back to Grahla and speak to her.\nShe isn't happy that Sarvith has opened a door into the past, he wasn't supposed to do that. Tell her what he thinks about going through, back in time to find out more about Faolchu's death. Grahla doesn't like this but what is done is done, and maybe one of those ripples has the answer we seek. Go and examine the ripples and see if there really is a doorway of some kind out there.\nFollow the markers to find the ripples, when examine them a spirit shows itself in each one, trying to say something. At the final ripple it becomes clear she will tell the Vestige how Faolchu died. Find the nearby crypt and met her inside.\nHead over to the crypt and step inside. The spirit is standing in front of a set of &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; that radiates magic. It is the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alana%20Relin%20%28Ghost%29\"&gt;Alana Relin&lt;/a&gt; and she tells the Vestige it all started here, on the day of the final battle. We gave up everything to kill Faolchu. I'm here because the one I loved gave up everything that day to save his people. I'm here to show what happened that day to hopefully avoid the tragedy occur again."}

If I do, the Windhelm office can re-open, and there should be some money in it for me.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe first objective is to steal the logbook that the Shatter-Shields keep in their office right next door to the East Empire Company office. The entrance is normally locked with a master-level lock. For those struggling to pick it, head over to the Clan &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Clan%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt; house inside Windhelm and pickpocket the key from &lt;a href=\"Torbjorn%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Torbjorn Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt;. The book is located in the back left corner of their office behind a larger open book. Because of its location behind a small wall it is easily grabbed in sneak. After obtaining this log book take it back to the East Empire Company's warehouse office. As it turns out the Shatter-Shields have been employing a pirate group in order to dominate trade.\nThe East Empire Company will then send the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"Windpeak%20Inn\"&gt;Windpeak Inn&lt;/a&gt; to find out where the pirates make port. There, speak to Stig Salt-Plank. The Dragonborn is given the option to either bribe or brawl for the location. (An easier solution is by sneaking, searching his inventory and reading the Blood Horker's Note in his pocket.)\nAfter learning the location of the hideout of the Blood Horker pirates, Japhet's Folly, an East Empire agent, Adelaisa Vendicci, will order the Dragonborn to lead the assault on the island and slay their magician. Once the ship arrives at the hideout, jump across the gaps in the ice floe, heading south until a small stone tower can be seen in the mists. To the left (east) are the Blood Horker docks. Ahead is a sea cave, where a stealthy infiltration into Japhet's Folly can be made. Enter the sea cave and eventually the Dragonborn will reach Japhet's Folly tower. At the top of the tower, the Blood Horker's &lt;a href=\"mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; leader, Haldyn, can be found.\nHaldyn is a powerful magician who wields &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Healing\"&gt;Fast Healing&lt;/a&gt;. Anti-shock potions and shock-resistant enchanted apparel can be very helpful, as well as magicka-draining weapons. Especially useful can be the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; which can drain Haldyn's magicka to the point where he becomes harmless. Alternatively, if the &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill is high enough, he can simply be approached and backstabbed or hit with a poisoned arrow while in stealth mode, since he has no allies nearby and he is in a dead-end room. In Haldyn's room there is a chest with gold, scrolls, enchanted items and jewelry.\nAfter looting his body, Haldyn's key will be found, which will provide an easy exit from the Japhet's Folly tower. At the very bottom of the tower is an expert level door containing &lt;a href=\"Japhet\"&gt;Japhet&lt;/a&gt;'s body and a chest containing leveled loot and also quite a lot of spiderwebs. The East Empire Company is now bombarding the island with explosive arrows, destroying all the buildings around and killing all the remaining pirates. Be careful around the explosions, as they may harm followers. Head northeast through the ruined harbor structures to the boat where Adelaisa awaits.\nShe explains that the bombardment came just after Haldyn died, as the fog he conjured disappeared along with him. Afterwards, she will ask the Dragonborn if they are ready to leave.\nBack at the Windhelm Docks, Orthus Endario will be pleased to hear that the Blood Horkers are no longer a threat and will offer the Dragonborn a sum of gold. Adelaisa Vendicci is also very impressed with the Dragonborn's abilities and would be happy to take some time away from her duties to become a follower."}

But if you asked anyone other than a sailor to name even one crew responsible for their nautical woes, I wager you'd find them woefully at a loss. Few of these outlaws ever achieve the heights of infamy needed to reach the ears of inland folk. The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sails\"&gt;Red Sails&lt;/a&gt; and their Pirate Queen, &lt;a href=\"Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;, stand as the notable exception to this rule. Their notoriety stretches all along the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Coast\"&gt;Abecean Coast&lt;/a&gt;, to the point of being a household name and catchall bugaboo among residents of waterside towns. This widespread reputation is a relatively recent development.\nNot all that long ago, the Red Sails were much more like their contemporaries\u2014independent and unremarkable. Originally a band of raiders plundering a meager living along the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;, it was the arrival of Fortunata ap Dugal that marked the beginning of a new era for the humble raiders who would soon be known as the Red Sails. Using her position in the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; to lure the raiders to her side, she soon began building her floating armada.\nUnder Fortunata's ambitious\u2014some would say fearless\u2014leadership, the raiders made their first voyage out to the Abecean Sea. In what can only be described as a suicidal assault, her smaller complement of raiders scaled a larger pirate vessel. Its captain considered the smaller river boat beneath his notice and made the mistake of ignoring its approach. With cunning and brutality, Fortunata and her crew seized the captain and forced his surrender. Offering to accept the oath of any of the enemy crew who would serve her as captain, she ordered the former captain and his officers strung up on the rigging and slaughtered the lot of them. With the blood of her rivals still seeping into the cloth, Fortunata raised the sails that would be her crew's calling card for years to come.\nUsing her connections as a merchant lord and the growing power of her Red Sails pirates, Fortunata turned a band of lawless miscreants into a feudal hierarchy of lords and vassals in the form of ship captains and their crews. After a number of successful boarding actions that resulted in the capture of pirate and merchant vessels alike, more and more captains began to voluntarily flock to her banner. The fearsome reputation of the Pirate Queen and her Red Sails spread like wildfire from port to port as the harrowing tales of their attacks became the main topic of discussion in smoky taverns and crowded inns.\nWhen the time was right, Fortunata and her armada sailed into &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; Harbor and grabbed control of the city. Now Provincial Governor Fortunata and her Red Sails enforcers claim the entire &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; as their personal domain. It's estimated that the Red Sails have more than two dozen vessels under the blood-red sabers on a white banner. A navy in its own right, the Pirate Queen could lay claim to any port she desired. And without the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; to oppose her, it's just a matter of time before she sets her sights beyond the Gold Coast. Anyone who thinks the Red Sails have reached the pinnacle of their ambition is simply living in denial.\nBrace yourself Abeceans. A storm is coming."}

The very air was torn asunder, leaving gaping, infected wounds that spewed &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; from the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Many flocked to the shores, seeking escape from &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon's&lt;/a&gt; murderous host - but the seas betrayed our people, raising up to smash our ships and our ports, leaving us to fates so vile and wicked that death would seem a mercy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; stood as our last bastion of hope, in both the literal and figurative sense. Refugees filled the Crystal Tower until it could hold no more. I could taste the fear hanging in the air; feel the pall of despair suffocating us. We could see the daedra moving through the trees in the distance, but they did not come. Days passed, and still the daedra would not approach within arrow-shot of the battlements. Hope began to grow. \"They fear us,\" some would say, \"even a daedra knows not to trifle with the wisdom and magicks of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal-Like-Law\"&gt;Crystal-Like-Law&lt;/a&gt;!\" It was as if the foul denizens of Oblivion had been waiting for this very spirit to stoke our hearts before they acted.\nAs we slept, innumerable legions of daedra amassed around us... and they were not alone. Hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; prisoners were gathered with them. As dawn broke, we were awoken by their screams as the daedra began to flail them and flay them. We watched in abject horror as our kinfolk were defiled completely... carved up and eaten alive, impaled on their depraved war machines, and worried apart as meals for their profane beasts. This bloodletting was only a prelude to whet their appetites.\nOnce the daedra finished with our kinfolk, they turned their eyes to the Crystal Tower. Our great and noble bastion proved as much of an impediment as a mighty oak to a landslide - standing tall for but a few moments, appearing almost able to ride the tide of destruction around it, but ultimately being swept away.\nOur exalted wizards decimated the fiends, roasting them by the dozens. Archers were finding the narrowest of chinks in their daedric armor at over a hundred paces, felling their captains and commanders. The might and skillfulness of our heroic defenders was astonishing to behold, but it was not enough. The daedra clambered over the corpses of their cohort. They marched headlong into death and destruction that would make the mightiest armies in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; quake with fear.\nWhen they breached the walls, I fled along with the other cowards. I take no pride in that act. It has haunted my existence ever since, and I burn with shame to admit it, but it is truth. We fled in mindless panic - abandoning those stalwart Altmer who held the line against the onslaught, to preserve and defend our illustrious Crystal Tower.\nWe raced through cleverly concealed passageways and emerged well away from the chaos that had descended upon the tower. That is when it happened. It started like a gust rustling through the leaves of a dense forest, but the sound did not taper off. It rose into a roar as the very ground on which I stood began to shudder. I turned to look, and the world held its breath...\nI stood transfixed as the heart of my homeland was torn as if from my own breast. The unthinkable, the incomprehensible... the tower of Crystal-Like-Law cast to the ground, with all the dignity of a beggar meeting an iron-clad fist. An eternity I watched, trying to reconcile what I knew with what I saw.\nSobs racked my chest and weeping filled the air around me as the spell loosened its hold and I realized where I was. There were scores of other refugees mesmerized by the horror that had likewise ensorcelled me. \"Go,\" I croaked out as my heart - the heart of my land - shattered. No one moved, not even me.\nI mustered what will I could and bellowed all the fear and hatred and agony at what had just happened, turning the word into a mindless shriek: \"GO!\" I ran then, feeling more than seeing that the others had followed."}

It was as if my mind simply... stopped. Instinct took over, as my every thought sank into a black abyss of despair. Time lost all meaning, and to this day I know not how long I was in this state. Eventually a conscious thought managed to break my fugue: the Daedric Horde had vanished! Gone as suddenly as they had come.\nBefore my numbed mind could comprehend the tumult that consumed my beloved Summerset Isle, before I could formulate the question \"how?\" they were there, dripping honeyed poison in our ears: the Thalmor. They were the ones that saved us, they claimed, working deep and subtle magicks. It was their efforts, their sacrifices that delivered the Altmer from extinction.\nOh, what fools we were. We wanted so desperately someone to thank for ending our tribulations, we lavished it upon the first to step up and claim the glory. With that simple act of gratitude, we allowed a vile rot to seep into our homeland, to putrefy our once noble and distinguished civilization.\nIt was months before I began to suspect the error we had made. Small twinges of unease would vex me, but each one alone was easy enough to disregard and push aside. The exile of the great seer-mage &lt;a href=\"Rynandor\"&gt;Rynandor&lt;/a&gt; the Bold was the final doubt that I could not ignore. You see, Rynandor was one of the very few who survived the collapse of the Crystal Tower - I saw some of his bravery and heroics with my own eyes. It was his leadership and sorcery that made the daedra pay such a high price for their destruction of the Crystal Tower.\nThe Thalmor besmirched his name when he had the audacity to publicly doubt and question their role in ending the Oblivion Crisis on Summerset Isle. Rynandor made the mistake of ignoring the consensus gentium, trusting instead to logic and facts. The shrewdness of the Thalmor, however, was not such to allow something as trivial as the truth stand in their way. As soon as they shifted the collective opinion ever so slightly against Rynandor, they had him sequestered and intensified their efforts to tarnish his reputation. Unable to mount any sort of defense to the Thalmor's attacks, Rynandor was quickly denounced and exiled."}

Over several months, I liquidated my ancestral holdings and took whatever inheritance I could without raising any suspicions. I would follow after &lt;a href=\"Rynandor\"&gt;Rynandor&lt;/a&gt; and help him restore his reputation and status. We would then return to best the Thalmor at their own game and win back the mores and morals of the Altmer! The rest of my cabal would stay on Summerset Isle and win the trust of the Thalmor on whatever level best suited each of them, sending clandestine missives to me when possible.\nAfter weeks of painstaking investigations and exorbitant bribes, I was able to learn that Rynandor was placed on a ship to &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. I booked my own passage to Anvil. My search almost ended there, for Rynandor had never arrived in Anvil Harbor. My instinct that Rynandor met a duplicitous end was confirmed when I sought out several of the deckhands who were reported to be aboard Rynandor's vessel. All died under mysterious and violent circumstances.\nThe first of many attempts on my life occurred soon after. Needless to say, I survived, but my grand plan to stymie the Thalmor fell apart without an esteemed leader to rally behind. I went into hiding, waiting anxiously for word of the Thalmor's activities back on Summerset Isle.\nOver the following years, I tried to bend the ear of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; through various avenues and warn them of the Thalmor's doings. The Empire, however, was having enough troubles dealing with the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; within its own borders without seeking trouble in far away Summerset. With the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and his heirs, and the self-sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; (the true savior of Summerset Isle and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;!) the Empire's leadership was left defunct.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;High Chancellor Ocato&lt;/a&gt; convened the full &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; in an unsuccessful bid to select a new Emperor. Without an Emperor, the Empire beyond the reach of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; began to splinter. Ocato reluctantly agreed to become the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; under the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council%20Charter\"&gt;Elder Council Charter&lt;/a&gt; until Imperial rule could be reestablished, but a reluctant leader is rarely a strong leader.\nPotentate Ocato made admirable efforts to rein in the bedlam that threatened to rip the Empire apart, and was even making headway when the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted and destroyed much of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; (likely from Thalmor tampering, but have yet to find proof of their misdeeds in this). What was left of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; was thrown into absolute chaos. The effects of the eruption were felt even in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, destroying roads and cutting off the Imperial garrisons there."}

This may be why his fervent warnings and outspoken criticisms of the Thalmor and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; went unheeded, but history has at least partially vindicated Lathenil's claims.\n-&lt;a href=\"Praxis%20Erratuim\"&gt;Praxis Erratuim&lt;/a&gt;, Imperial Historian\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and the Imperial forces in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; were still reeling from the consecutive catastrophes of the Oblivion Crisis and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;destruction of Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor incited the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; to mount a massive uprising. Black Marsh and southern Morrowind were completely lost to the Argonians, but luckily the Thalmor too lost what influence they had over the reptilians.\nAll the while, the Thalmor consolidated their hold over my beloved homeland. It took almost a decade before my own machinations put me into contact with &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt;. He seemed more interested than most in what I had to say about the Thalmor, maybe because he was himself an Altmer and recognized the threat they represented. It wasn't long before the Thalmor had Ocato assassinated.\nPotentate Ocato's murder began the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; fractured, leading into years of ruthless in-fighting, plots and backstabbing. Many tried to claim the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Most were pretenders to the crown, a few had legitimate claims, others still were little more than brutal dullards who thought mere strengths of arms was all the entitlement they needed. Violent, unnatural storms lashed the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; several times during this anarchy, always with the eye of the storm looking directly down upon &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, as if this was the judgment of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Empire submerged in this mayhem, the Thalmor were quick to act. They overthrew the rightful Kings and Queens of the Altmer. I remember the revulsion and horror that took hold when word reached me - that this dementia had gripped my homeland. Once so proud and majestic, many of our great race actually embraced this insanity!\nThen the first of many pogroms descended on Summerset Isle. They slaughtered any who were not \"of the blood of the Aldmer.\" A fine excuse to purge the dissidents, as well - the Thalmor have never been ones to waste such an opportunity.\nAfter seven long, bloody years the Stormcrown Interregnum was ended when a &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; warlord by the name of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede&lt;/a&gt; seized the crown. Whether he had rightful claim or not is moot. Without Titus Mede, there would not be an &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; today. He proved a shrewd and capable leader, such that &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; endorsed him as Emperor.\nWith the Empire stabilizing under the auspicious efforts of Emperor Titus Mede, I resumed my efforts to warn them of the Thalmor threat. Again, the Thalmor remained a step ahead. Before my efforts could come to fruition, the Thalmor struck: another coup, this time in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The Empire was not prepared for the Thalmor's subterfuge and stratagem.\nThere are those who claim the combined Altmer and Bosmer forces greatly out-matched the Empire, but this is a farce. This short, savage campaign was won by the Thalmor even before first blood was drawn. They waited and watched their enemy, they chose where and when they would attack. The Thalmor were able to bring the full fury of their small contingent of Altmer and Bosmer to any of the several Imperial strongholds.\nContrary to the posturing of the Empire's generals, the Thalmor did not command greater numbers. They had better spies and greater mobility, and knew how best to use them. This is the menace that the Thalmor represent! They are cruel and merciless, but they are no fools! They are devious and subtle, and so very patient.\nIn one fell stroke, the Thalmor took a strategic foothold on the mainland of Tamriel and prevented any significant attempt the Empire could have made to invade Summerset Isle and depose the tyranny of the Thalmor. At the same time, they took a better vantage to continue to watch the Empire and wait. In so doing, they also revived the Aldmeri Dominion with their alliance to the Bosmer of Valenwood!\nOver the decades, the Thalmor have grown quiet - but this is not the end. It has only just begun. They merely consolidate their power and tighten their grip on the hearts and minds of the Altmer. The Empire may wish to forget the wounds its pride has suffered at the hands of the Thalmor, but they are still out there. Plotting. Watching. Waiting.\nWhile the Empire is content to secure inconsequential corners of its vast holdings, the threat of the Thalmor continues to rise. Not since Potentate Ocato has anyone in the Empire listened to me. I beseech any and all citizens of this renowned Empire to heed my words! The Thalmor must be stopped, before it is too late.\nSoon after Lathenil of Sunhold commissioned to have these volumes printed and distributed far and wide in the Empire with his own coin, he himself met a violent end. In light of the events that followed his death, we must consider that he may very well have been murdered by Thalmor assassins.\n-Praxis Erratuim, Imperial Historian"}

To remedy Stage 4, wait until night and drink the blood of a sleeping person (this no longer occurs if the &lt;a href=\"Official%20Add-ons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;add-on&lt;/a&gt; is installed).\nAt any point after becoming a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, speak to any bartender in Skyrim and hear a rumor that Falion in Morthal has been doing experiments with all sorts of undead, &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, vampires, and the like, beginning the quest \"Rising at Dawn.\"\nTravel to Morthal, north of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and find &lt;a href=\"Falion%27s%20House\"&gt;Falion's House&lt;/a&gt;. It is the second house past the Blacksmith. After 6pm, go in and speak to Falion, and he will recognize the Dragonborn as a vampire. Ask him what he knows about curing vampirism and he will say he can perform a ritual to remove the curse, but he will need a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;filled&lt;/a&gt; black soul gem first.\nIf a black soul gem is lacking, Falion has one for sale, but that can prove to be a bit cost prohibitive for some. Another good way to acquire one is to travel to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Snowhawk\"&gt;Fort Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt;, west of Morthal as it is full of &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, who frequently carry black soul gems. Once a soul gem is acquired from one necromancer, cast &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; on another necromancer to fill it up to make Fort Snowhawk the one stop shop. &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Fang%20Cave\"&gt;Broken Fang Cave&lt;/a&gt; always has a black soul gem in the chamber with the beds. It is on top of a small shelf to the left of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to Morthal and speak with Falion, giving him the filled black soul gem. He will tell the Dragonborn to meet him at dawn (between 4 and 6 AM) at the &lt;a href=\"Summoning%20Stones\"&gt;Summoning Stones&lt;/a&gt;, which is located to the North of town. Go there and meet him as he instructed, then watch him perform the ritual. Make sure to feed first, otherwise Falion will not have trust enough to help. If Falion chooses to attack or if the Dragonborn becomes a stage 4 vampire before or as Falion begins the ritual (at which point he will attack) using a calm spell (or Voice of the Emperor if they are an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;) will stop Falion from attacking and he will complete the ritual. The screen will fade to black, and when vision returns, the vampirism will be gone."}

We are told by chroniclers that the springtide night in the &lt;a href=\"1E%20448\"&gt;448th&lt;/a&gt; year of the &lt;a href=\"first%20era\"&gt;first era&lt;/a&gt; on which he was born was unseasonably cold, and that his mother &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Lynada\"&gt;Queen Lynada&lt;/a&gt; died very shortly after setting eyes upon her son. If he were much beloved of his father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Mhorus\"&gt;King Mhorus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, who already had plenty of heirs, three sons and four daughters before him, the chroniclers make no mention of it.\nHis existence was so very undistinguished that we hear virtually nothing of him for the first twenty years of his life. His schooling, we can suppose, was similar to that of any \"spare prince\" in the Colovian West, with &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; tutors to teach him the ways of hunting and battle. Etiquette, religious instruction, and even basic statecraft were seldom a part of the training of a prince of the Highlands, as it was in the more civilized &lt;a href=\"valley%20of%20Nibenay\"&gt;valley of Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a brief reference to him, together with his family, as part of the rolls of honor during the coronation of the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt; on the 23rd of Sun's Dawn &lt;a href=\"1E%20461\"&gt;1E 461&lt;/a&gt;. The ceremony, of course, held during the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;, and so was without entertainment, but the thirteen-year-old Rislav was still witness to some of the greatest figures of legend. The Beast of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darloc%20Brae\"&gt;Darloc Brae&lt;/a&gt;, represented his kingdom, giving honor to the Empire. The Chieftain of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric the White&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag&lt;/a&gt; were in attendance. And despite the Empire's intolerance of all elves, &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; Indoril &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt; were evidently there as well, diplomatically representing &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, all in relative peace.\nAlso mentioned on the rolls was a young mer in service to the Imperial court of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, who was to have a great history with Rislav. Ryain Direnni.\nWhether the two young men of about the same age met and conversed is entirely the stuff of historian's fancy. Ryain is spoken of in praising words as a powerful land-owner, eventually buying the island of &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and gradually conquering all of High Rock and large parts of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and Skyrim, but Rislav is not heard of again in history's books for another seventeen years. We can only offer supposition based on the facts that follow.\nChildren of kings are, of course, married to the children of other kings to bind alliances. The kingdoms of Skingrad and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; skirmished over common territory throughout the fifth century, until they reached a peace in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20472\"&gt;472&lt;/a&gt;. The details of this accord are not recorded, but since we know that Prince Rislav was in the court of Kvatch six years later, as husband to Belene, the daughter of King Justinius, it is fair to make an educated guess that they were married then to make peace.\nThis brings us to the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;478&lt;/a&gt; when a great plague swept through all of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and seemed particularly concentrated in the independent Colovian West. Among the victims were King Mhorus and the rest of the entire royal family in Skingrad. Rislav's only surviving elder brother, &lt;a href=\"Dorald%20Larich\"&gt;Dorald&lt;/a&gt;, survived, being in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; as a priest of Marukh. He returned to his homeland to assume the throne.\nOf Dorald, we have some history. The King's second son, he was slightly simple-minded and evidently very pious. All the chroniclers spoke of his sweetness and decency, how he saw a vision in his early years that brought him - with his father's blessing - from Skingrad to the Imperial City and the priesthood. The priesthood of Marukh, of course, saw no difference between spiritual and political matters. It was the religion of the Alessian Empire, and it taught that to resist the Emperor was to resist the Gods. Given that, it is scarcely a surprise what Dorald did when he became King of the independent kingdom of Skingrad.\nHis first edict, on his very first day, was to cede the kingdom to the Empire.\nThe reaction throughout the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; was shock and outrage, nowhere more so than in the court of Kvatch. Rislav Larich, we are told, rode forth to his brother's kingdom, together with his wife and two dozen of his father-in-law's cavalry. It was surely not an impressive army, no matter how the chroniclers embellish it, but they had little trouble defeating all the guards Dorald sent to stop them. In truth, there was no actual battling, for the soldiers of Skingrad resented their new king's decision to give up their autonomy.\nThe brothers faced one another in the castle courtyard where they had grown up.\nIn typical Colovian fashion, there was no trial, no accusations of treason, no jury, no judge. Only an executioner.\n\"Thou art no brother of mine,\" Rislav Larich said, and struck Dorald's head from his shoulders in one blow. He was crowned King of Skingrad still holding the same bloody axe in his arms.\nIf King Rislav had no battle experience beforehand, that was shortly to change. Word spread quickly to the Imperial City that Skingrad, once offered, was now being taken back. Gorieus was an accomplished warrior even before taking the throne, and the seventeen years he had as Emperor were scarcely peaceful. Only eight months before Dorald's assassination and Rislav's ascendancy, Gorieus and the Alessian army had faced another of his coronation guests, &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric the White&lt;/a&gt;, on the fields of the frozen north. The High Chieftain of Skyrim lost his life in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sungard\"&gt;Battle of Sungard&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"pact%20of%20chieftains\"&gt;pact of chieftains&lt;/a&gt; was selecting a new leader, Cyrodiil was busily grabbing back the land of southern Skyrim that it had lost.\nIn short, Emperor Gorieus knew how to deal with rebellious vassals.\nThe Alessian army poured westward \"like a flood of death,\" to borrow the chronicler's phrase, in numbers far exceeding what would be required to conquer Skingrad. Gorieus could not have thought actual battle was likely. Rislav, as we said, had little to no experience at warfare, and only a few days' practice at kingcraft. His kingdom and all of the Colovian West had just been ravaged by plague. The Alessians anticipated that a mere show of arms, and a surrender.\nRislav instead prepared for battle. He quickly inspected his troops and drew up plans.\nThe chroniclers who had heretofore ignored the life of Rislav now devote verse after verse describing the king's aspect with fetishistic delight. While it may lack literary merit and taste, we are at least given some details at last. Not surprisingly, the king wore the finest armor of his era, as the Colovian Estates then had the finest leathersmiths - the only type of armor available - in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The king's klibanion mail, boiled and waxed for hardness, and studded with inch-long spikes, was a rich chestnut red, and he wore it over his black tunic but under his black cloak. The statue of Rislav the Righteous which now stands in Skingrad is a romanticized version of king, but not inaccurate except in the armor represented. No bard of the Colovian West would have gone to the market so lightly protected. But it does, as we will see, include the most important accouterments of Rislav: his trained hawk and his fast horse.\nThe winter rains had washed through the roads to the south, sending much of the West Weald spilling into &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor took the northern route, and King Rislav with a small patrol of guards met him at a low pass on what is now the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor's army, it is said, was so large that the Beast of Anequina could hear its march from hundreds of miles away, and despite himself, the chroniclers say, he quaked in fear.\nRislav, it was said, did not quake. With perfect politeness, he told the Emperor that his party was too large to be accommodated in the tiny kingdom of Skingrad.\n\"Next time,\" Rislav said. \"Write before you come.\"\nThe Emperor was, like most Alessian Emperors, not a man of great humor, and he thought Rislav touched by &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. He ordered his personal guards to arrest the poor madman, but at that moment, the King of Skingrad raised his arm and sent his hawk flying into the sky. It was a signal his army had been waiting for. The Alessian were all within the pass and the range of their arrows.\nKing Rislav and his guard began riding westward as fast as if they had been \"kissed by wild &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;,\" as the chroniclers said. He did not dare to look behind him, but his plan went faultlessly. The far eastern end of the pass was sealed by rolling boulders, giving the Alessian no direction to go but westward. The Skingrad archers rained arrows down upon the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; army from far above on the plateaus, remaining safe from reprisal. The furious Emperor &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt; chased Rislav from the Weald to the Highlands, leaving Skingrad far behind, all the while his army growing steadily smaller and smaller.\nIn the ancient Highland forest, the Imperial army met the army of Rislav's father-in-law, the King of Kvatch. The Alessian army likely still outnumbered their opponents, but they were exhausted and their morale had been obliterated by the chase amid a sea of arrows. After an hour's battle, they retreated north into what is now the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Reserve\"&gt;Imperial Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, and from there, further north and east, to slip back to nurse their wounds and pride in Nibenay.\nIt was the beginning of the end of the Alessian hegemony. The Kings of the Colovian West joined with Kvatch and Skingrad to resist Imperial incursions. The &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Direnni\"&gt;Clan Direnni&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Ryain\"&gt;Ryain&lt;/a&gt; was inspired to outlaw the religion of the Alessian Reform throughout his lands in High Rock, and began pushing into Imperial territories. The new High Chief of Skyrim, Hoag, now called &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt;, though sharing the Emperor's official xenophobia, also joined the resistance. His heir, King &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, helped continue the struggle upon Hoag's death in battle, and also insured his place in history.\nThe heroic King of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, who faced the Emperor's army virtually alone, and triggered its end, justly deserves his sobriquet of Rislav the Righteous."}

Alternatively, a batch of Wolfsbane Petals may be found in &lt;a href=\"Lassnr\"&gt;Lassnr&lt;/a&gt;'s house in &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt;, though this will be considered stealing. Ripened Belladonna Berries may be found on &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Spriggans&lt;/a&gt; or growing outside of Nordic crypts.\nOnce the Nerevarine has the ingredients, they should be returned to Isobel and Fallaise, before speaking with Ettiene. She will tell the Nerevarine to meet her at the Altar of Thrond. When the Nerevarine arrives, they will notice a Nord female lying on the altar. Ettiene will tell you that the Nord is only barely alive, and that they must kill her and take her heart. Do so, then speak with Ettiene again. Ettiene will infuse the heart with part of the Nerevarine's wolf spirit. Place it back in the innocent and speak with Ettiene again. She will do the final incantations, and the innocent will rise again in wolf form. Upon killing the innocent again, the Nerevarine will be permanently cured of lycanthropy."}

They will have to fight two &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt; before one can enter Syl's private chambers. There her dead body is on her bed. However, Kithlan jogs up and tells them that the dead body is merely a decoy, and they must follow her into a secret passage in the Gardens.\nXirethard.\nThe secret door is in the Gardens, next to Syl's private quarters, hidden behind a bust of Sheogorath. Activate it and it will slide back to reveal a passage down to &lt;a href=\"Xirethard\"&gt;Xirethard&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient ruin.\nIt is a heavily trapped ruin. When inside watch out for a network of passageways guarded by statues spitting the &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Drain Health&lt;/a&gt; spell. The map will be invaluable for navigating this section. A switch at the end will turn off the statues, allowing time to explore the halls, where potions and gold lie.\nFight past some &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt; and into Xirethard Depths. There will be two Seducers in a circular room. Kill them and look for a switch on the north side of the room, at the base of a bust.\nFollow the hallway around until one get to a long room with a staircase on the south side. A single Seducer will be guarding the top of the stairs. Behind her, a doorway leads to another room. Syl is in this room and, if the innumerable traps and guards weren't an indication, will be difficult to take down. No longer wearing her regal gown, Syl is now clad in Seducer armor and packing real heat in the form of &lt;a href=\"Nerveshatter%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Nerveshatter&lt;/a&gt;. Kill her and take her heart. Don't forget to look for a chest with leveled loot in the room.\nOn the east side of the great room is door to Xirethard, Subterrane. This level is filled with &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Fight them all the way through, taking care to avoid statues that shoot spells and collapsing ceilings.\nSacellum.\nOnce outside of Xirethard, go back to Sacellum Arden-Sul. Put Syl's Heart on the altar. It will glow for a few seconds and then disappear into a bluish-green burst.\nArctus, High Priest of Dementia, will declare the Hero Duke/Duchess of Dementia. Speak to Sheogorath and he will congratulate them on their new title. Suddenly, &lt;a href=\"Thadon\"&gt;Thadon&lt;/a&gt; bursts into the temple, devastated by Syl's death and worried about the Greymarch. He says he will leave Sheogorath's side and serve &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Order\"&gt;Priest of Order&lt;/a&gt;. Thadon also says that the Fringe has been taken over by the forces of Order.\nSpeak to Sheogorath again and he says that he is pleased by Thadon's treachery, as this has never happened before, and new is good. He will give the Hero the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Lordship%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Ring of Lordship&lt;/a&gt;. He also thinks that Thadon is correct about the Fringe being lost and sends them to investigate.\nAt this point, they also have full use of the Duchess' Private Quarters.

He claims this is the easier choice and tells one has to give Thadon three doses of &lt;a href=\"Greenmote\"&gt;Greenmote&lt;/a&gt; to kill him.\nHouse of Mania.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"Wide-Eye\"&gt;Wide-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, a member of Thadon's court. During the day she can be found in the throne room or the &lt;a href=\"Halcyon%20Conservatory\"&gt;Halcyon Conservatory&lt;/a&gt;. She says that Thadon enjoys \"his pleasures, which include painting, reading a good book, a rousing night of erotic bedroom games,\" and also Greenmote. Wide-Eye says that she would enjoy Greenmote more often, but she is too busy.\nHer disposition must be raised before she will say what her duties are. They include a \"special errand\" every day at noon. She also says that the Greenmote is stored in a secret silo, and she refuses to tell where it is, regardless of how high her disposition is.\nGreenmote Silo.\nWait until noon, Wide-Eye will be in the Halcyon Conservatory. Follow her onto the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Grounds\"&gt;Palace Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, where she will activate a statue. The statue will slide aside and the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Greenmote%20Silo\"&gt;Greenmote Silo&lt;/a&gt;. Wait for Wide-Eye to go inside and then follow her.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; mission, so invisibility spells are useful here. Follow the passage around to the right to catch up with Wide-Eye. The Silo is patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; who will arrest on sight. Wide-Eye will attack outright if seen by her. Stick to the shadows, don't use &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Torch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt;, and stay close to Wide-Eye.\nAt the back of the cave is a shapeless green mound. Be careful, as Wide-Eye will be standing next to this mound. Sneak around her and get close enough to the mound. This is the &lt;a href=\"Greenmote\"&gt;Greenmote&lt;/a&gt; Pile, and activating it will put Greenmote in the inventory. At least two doses are needed, but feel free to take as much as possible. It's valueless, but &lt;a href=\"Greenmote%20Rapture\"&gt;Greenmote Rapture&lt;/a&gt; is also one of the more powerful effects in all of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: \"Taking three doses of Greenmote at the same time will cause instant death by overdose.\"\nAs soon as two doses are picked, Wide-Eye will head back outside. Follow her out, being careful not to be spotted.\nThere are two alternate, though inelegant, ways to accomplish this portion of the quest.\nAs long as one makes it to the Greenmote Pile and get the two doses, all will be okay. The Greenmote will not count as a stolen item so even if arrested it will be kept in the inventory.\nDuke's Quarters.\nOnce outside head back to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Mania\"&gt;House of Mania&lt;/a&gt;. On the east side of the Halcyon Conservatory is the &lt;a href=\"Duke%27s%20Quarters\"&gt;Duke's Quarters&lt;/a&gt;. Pick the leveled lock to gain entrance. Both the Conservatory and the Quarters are patrolled by Golden Saints, and this time a sloppy, pell-mell run through the area will be much more dangerous. If resisting arrest, the entire House comes running and everyone refuses any yield, at least until one is back in &lt;a href=\"Bliss\"&gt;Bliss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe kitchen is in the northeast section of the quarters. Activating the tray of food will take one dose, activating his wine will take the other. The wine is on the second shelf of the bookshelf to the right of the food. Look for the tallest bottle on the shelf.\nAfter that, go back to the House throne room. Wait until 8:00 p.m., and watch Thadon recite terrible poetry until his heart bursts. Collect his blood and go back to the Sacellum Arden-Sul. Remember also to loot his corpse for the &lt;a href=\"Diadem%20of%20Euphoria\"&gt;Diadem of Euphoria&lt;/a&gt;, a leveled helmet with Fortify Speechcraft Fortify Magic, and Resist Magic enchantments.\nSacellum.\nActivate the altar in the Sacellum and a bright yellow flame will shoot up. &lt;a href=\"Dervenin%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dervenin&lt;/a&gt; will then declare the Hero Duke of Mania. Speak to Sheogorath, who will congratulate on the success. Suddenly, Lady Syl interrupts, furious at Thadon's death and the succession. She declares open revolt, tells Sheogorath that &lt;a href=\"the%20Fringe\"&gt;the Fringe&lt;/a&gt; has already been lost, and leaves to become a &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Order\"&gt;Priest of Order&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeak to Sheogorath again. He will give the Hero the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Lordship%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Ring of Lordship&lt;/a&gt; and then send them off to investigate the Fringe.\nAt this point they have full use of the Duke's Quarters. They can take anything they want, sleep in the bed and store anything in any of the containers. Not all the containers however are safe. The two barrels and the wooden chest respawn and are not safe for storage; all the other containers are safe.\nThis ends the current quest and begins the next, \"&lt;a href=\"Retaking%20the%20Fringe\"&gt;Retaking the Fringe&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Chant the ritual and invoke the runestone's power to channel energy through the &lt;a href=\"runestones%20%28Online%29\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt; into a binding stone.\nOnce invoked, the runestone creates a key which can later break its connection to its binding stones. The runestone's key must revoke the energies at each binding stone. Most rituals use one or two binding stones; more powerful entities require three. Legends speak of rare creatures that need four.\nNote: One can avoid the bound entity's death by invoking the Rite of Proxy. For this, use the runestone on a willing sacrifice. That person's life will be forfeit, and the bound entity is freed. The key thus created will be energized with the soul of the proxy sacrifice."}

The ritual usually takes place within one of the many secluded &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Glade\"&gt;Ancestor Glade&lt;/a&gt;s scattered across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreparation.\nThe ritual involves carefully removing the bark of a canticle tree with a traditional tool called a &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Knife\"&gt;draw knife&lt;/a&gt; which in turn attracts the &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Moth%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt;. Once enough moths are in the vicinity, they grant the reader with the second sight needed to decipher the scroll.\nSecond sight.\nThe voice of the Ancestor Moth has always been an integral part of reading an Elder Scroll. They maintain a connection to the ancient magic that allows a Moth Priest to decipher them. Moths within an Ancestor Glade emanate a soft harmonious trilling that when amplified tap into a form of an augur. This allows the moths themselves to become a conduit for deciphering the Scrolls. By having the moths close to the Moth Priest, they can utilize the conduit and share the moth's augury.\nEvery Moth Priest is taught this ritual, but only the most resilient can read the Scrolls in this manner as it takes years of practice to interpret the harmony. As such, few ever get the chance to perform it. At the same time, however, those who have had contact with more than one Scroll are deemed capable of harnessing the ritual, since it means the Scrolls themselves permit the person to read them, with the same risks applied."}

The Huntsman and their \"Greater and Lesser Dogs\" are pit against the Hare of Innocent Quarry, described as \"pitiful and doomed.\" The Huntsman is \"transported by the exquisite thrill and glory of his might and dominion over his helpless prey, and at the same time touched by the tragic, noble, and ultimately futile plight of the Innocent Quarry.\" It is said that this dichotomy serves to balance the Huntsman's \"ecstatic rapture of the kill\" with their \"identification with the sadness and despair of the Innocent Quarry,\" leading to reflection on imbalances of power and the cruel nature of the world as the Hare's body is torn.\nDescription.\nThe Hunt begins as the \"Lesser Dogs\" assemble before the green crystal reflections of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry, inside of which the Huntsman, the Greater Dogs, and the Master of the Hunt perform the rites that initiate and \"sanctify the Huntsman, the Hunt, and the Innocent Quarry.\"\nAs the Hunt begins, the Lesser Dogs assemble before the green crystal reflections of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. Inside the Chapel, the Huntsman, the Greater Dogs, and the Master of the Hunt perform the rites that initiate and sanctify the Huntsman, the Hunt, and the Innocent Quarry. Then the Huntsman emerges from the Chapel, displays the Spear of Bitter Mercy, and recites the Offices of the Hunt. The Offices describe explains the laws and conditions of the four stages of the Hunt: the Drag, the Chase, the Call, and the View to the Kill.\nThe Drag is the first stage, in which the Lesser Dogs drag the ground to flush out the Hare; the Chase is the second stage, in which the Greater Hounds drive the Hare before them; the Call is the third stage, in which the Greater Hounds trap the Hare and summon the Huntsman for the kill; and the View is the fourth stage, in which the Huntsman makes the kill with the ritual Spear of Bitter Mercy, and calls upon the Master of the Hunt to view the kill by ringing the town bell. After that, the Master of the Hunt bestows the Bounty upon the Huntsman Bold, who has wielded the Spear of Bitter Mercy in the Kill, and calls upon him to name the Hare for the next Hunt, though the Huntsman Bold himself may not participate in the next Hunt."}

It is a gloomy region, with jagged rock formations rising out of the bleak, desolate lowlands. Rivenspire is home to many aggressive &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; and wildlife, including &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Bat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giant bats&lt;/a&gt; and a recent incursion of &lt;a href=\"bloodfiend\"&gt;bloodfiend&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRivenspire is ruled by a triumvirate of noble houses, which have ruled the region since the events of &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;. The three houses are &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;Tamrith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;Dorell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;Montclair&lt;/a&gt;, and the three generally mistrust each other. Because of this, Rivenspire could be considered in a state of cold war.\nTamrith's holdings are primarily in the &lt;a href=\"Eyebright%20Feld\"&gt;Eyebright Feld&lt;/a&gt; region in the southwest which also contains the city of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;. House Dorell and Montclair's homes are in the foggy, northern region of &lt;a href=\"Boralis\"&gt;Boralis&lt;/a&gt;. The southeastern region of &lt;a href=\"Westmark%20Moor\"&gt;Westmark Moor&lt;/a&gt; has no major settlements other than &lt;a href=\"Hoarfrost%20Downs\"&gt;Hoarfrost Downs&lt;/a&gt;, but it does contain the legendary &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nRivenspire has been home to many races throughout history, though it is predominantly inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;. A lost &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; tribe known as the Horsemen once settled near the western coast. Others have inhabited the region in generations past. Ayleid ruins still dot the land, including the mighty mountain-tower known as the &lt;a href=\"Doomcrag\"&gt;Doomcrag&lt;/a&gt;, the tallest peak in Rivenspire and possibly High Rock. While the mountain itself was not created by the Ayleids, it contains the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Erokii\"&gt;Erokii&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is evidence in the wilds outside the city of &lt;a href=\"Northpoint%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; once migrated to the region. However, they can no longer be found anywhere in Rivenspire; legend speaks of the \"trammeling of the giants\" long ago. Northpoint itself was not established until the ninth century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, when a Breton trader formed the settlement as a resting point for merchants traveling along the trading route between &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Tamrith has holdings primarily in the western Eyebright Feld region and in the city of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and it was their thriving trade with the lands to the south that led to strong ties with &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. The rivalries between Tamrith and other houses of Dorell and Montclair date back to the late First Era, and each of the houses helped the region in their own way. House Dorell are the descendants of Northpoint's founder, and have held a barony since the days of Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt;. They even ruled Shornhelm for a long time in the First Era.\nFor their rivalry and differences, the houses of Rivenspire hold many of the same traditions. Each house keeps its own military force, though in times of war or other emergencies, it is not uncommon for troops from the three houses to join with the Shornhelm Guard to form a single fighting force in defense of Rivenspire. Rivenspire's nobles are known for burying their dead beneath Westmark Moor, except for monarchs, who are all buried in the great cemetery of &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Ranser's War in 2E 566, &lt;a href=\"Ranser\"&gt;Ranser&lt;/a&gt;, the then-king King of Shornhelm, led the nobles in the region to war against Wayrest due to Emeric's refusal to marry Ranser's daughter &lt;a href=\"Rayelle\"&gt;Rayelle&lt;/a&gt;, cleaning out his coffers for an army of mercenaries in what would ultimately be a fruitless campaign. In the end, the fierce retaliation against King Ranser despoiled Rivenspire, and it is still recovering from the devastating war even fifteen years later. When Ranser was defeated, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; allowed a triumvirate of the three most prominent houses; Tamrith, Dorell and Montclair; to rule over Rivenspire until he found a suitable replacement to become the new King of Shornhelm. Shornhelm would remain kingless for years as a result of this. Baron Wylon of House Montclair asserted his claim to the throne, being the grandson and sole remaining heir of Ranser's predecessor King &lt;a href=\"Hurlbut\"&gt;Hurlbut&lt;/a&gt;, but many seemed hesitant to trust the Montclairs.\nA smaller noble house made up mostly of secretive &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;House Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt;, remained neutral throughout the war. Although the house prefers to \"stay in the shadows,\" &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; made a rare public announcement in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; in which he called for the destruction of the Lightless Remnant, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; artifact lying at the top of the mighty Doomcrag, a great spire above the ancient city of Erokii, which had been studied unsuccessfully for generations. Verandis believed the Remnant was corrupting Rivenspire's nobility and was causing the region-wide Bloodfiend problem, and he made the artifact's destruction the first priority of his house.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Rivenspire and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nRivenspire features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;'s overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Rivenspire. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Rivenspire totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Rivenspire and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

The city is known to have a mass marketplace where people gather from all over the countryside.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nRiverhold is located along the northern edge of the province of Elsweyr. It's located in what can be considered the &lt;a href=\"South%20Weald\"&gt;South Weald&lt;/a&gt; which encompasses the northernmost reaches of both &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and Elsweyr. Nearby the city of Riverhold is a small market town called &lt;a href=\"Sheeraln\"&gt;Sheeraln&lt;/a&gt;, which is three miles eastward. The walls of the city were saffron, irregular, and not very tall. Inside the outer walls are towers colored in an array of colors including azure, cream, vermilion, chocolate, gold, and jet. The city can be described as once tired and exuberant.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle of Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; commenced on the 20th of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt; near the border town of &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;. To the west was &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Reman assembled armies from the cities of Riverhold, &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Suvio\"&gt;Caer Suvio&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Riverhold was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Naghea\"&gt;Queen Naghea&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, Naghea along with &lt;a href=\"Storig\"&gt;Storig&lt;/a&gt; of Farrun led the left flank while &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Ulaqth\"&gt;Warchief Ulaqth&lt;/a&gt; led the right flank. To the east was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, with his army of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; assembled at &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Erfoud\"&gt;Ald Erfoud&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Vivec won the battle for Morrowind by cutting trees along the &lt;a href=\"Pryai%20River\"&gt;Pryai River&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; suffered one of its most deadly diseases known as the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. The Flu originated in &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and quickly exterminated many Black Marsh races, eventually reaching Elsweyr. The disease was sighted in &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; until it spread to the &lt;a href=\"Alabaster\"&gt;Alabaster&lt;/a&gt; docks and eventually the rest of Elsweyr including Riverhold. Many &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; died but some had found ways to slightly subdue the disease. &lt;a href=\"Rathuni-la%20Dawnwhisker\"&gt;Rathuni-la Dawnwhisker&lt;/a&gt;, a daughter of &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; created a distilled &lt;a href=\"sorghum-tea\"&gt;sorghum-tea&lt;/a&gt; that weakened the more severe aspects of the flu, like a painkiller.\nSometime afterwards, the Colovians considered Anequina too weak to defend itself after being decimated by the Knahaten flu. They sent the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20Legion\"&gt;West Weald Legion&lt;/a&gt; to Riverhold and &lt;a href=\"Orcrest\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Quintilius\"&gt;General Quintilius&lt;/a&gt;, to annex it. A militia led by &lt;a href=\"Namu\"&gt;Namu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Foldor\"&gt;Sergeant Foldor&lt;/a&gt; tried to defend the city, but they were either killed by the invading forces or fled the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ab%27dul\"&gt;Ab'dul&lt;/a&gt; was the king of the city and the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; had at one point visited the city in their quest for a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Attrebus\"&gt;Prince Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; was kidnaped by &lt;a href=\"Radhasa\"&gt;Radhasa&lt;/a&gt; and her team, &lt;a href=\"Tsani%20%28Infernal%20City%29\"&gt;Tsani&lt;/a&gt; asked wether they were going into Riverhold. According to Radhasa, the city was swarmed with Imperial agents. Having Attrebus gagged would raise suspicion, so they would head to &lt;a href=\"Sheeraln\"&gt;Sheeraln&lt;/a&gt;, a little market town a few miles west of there."}

A casual perusal of the town will yield several prospects, but I erect the spine of warning. All scouting must be circumspect, with purchase of an item from one of the town's many merchants. For the town guard are active and unusually suspicious of strangers, especially those not of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; race. A meandering walk, without a local purchase in hand, will quickly land one in a cell.\nThe island that forms the heart of town, surrounded by the invigorating waters of the nearby lake, contains several merchant stalls. A quick purchase there will soothe the guards' suspicions. And it affords a glance at the merchants' goods. These vary greatly in quality and selection, so the stalls of greatest interest I leave to each to determine for himself.\nTo the north are two buildings of note. Two merchant families of long standing sell wares not generally available in the island stalls. The &lt;a href=\"Rothalens\"&gt;Rothalens&lt;/a&gt; sell crafting materials, including a few very specialized and rare items. This &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; family is tolerated in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; for the glamor their wares add to the otherwise mundane town. The Rothalens, like all Dunmer, are grasping and suspicious, employing an unfortunate number of guards and more-esoteric security measures. The claw of greed should be tempered with the hiss of caution here.\nNext to the Rothalens is the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Guram%20Ironarm\"&gt;Guram Ironarm&lt;/a&gt;. This retired blacksmith and his family cater to the weaponsmithing and armorer crafts. Virtually all materials needed for these endeavors can be found here, making this shop a destination for crafters from across the Rift. Security here is handled by the Ironarm clan, and a dozen severed hands nailed above the entrance attest to the family zeal.\nOn the Guard Captain's quarters and the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0we need not dwell, for only the foolish dive into waters so deep and swift-running with no reward in sight.\nAh, but the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guildhall&lt;/a&gt;, the most impressive edifice in Riften! My claws quiver in remembrance of the treasures contained therein. Spell components, rare scrolls, and powerful magical items\u2014a trove unique in the Rift. Alas, the safeguards upon them are both subtle and deadly. Venture into this building with all senses alert.\nAlong the water's edge are the town's docks. While the simple-minded fish from them or gaze into the murky waters, for the acquisitive among us they hold greater delights. Merchants who prefer the shadows can be found along the lower level of the docks, conducting business in the delightfully damp warehouses at the waterline. A purchaser for goods of any sort can usually be found here. The town guard avoids the underdocks or patrols only in large, easily avoided groups.\nA grating at one end of the docks leads into a small sewer system. Now used only as a rat pathway, perhaps as Riften grows this will eventually be extended underneath the entire town, rendering it more useful for clandestine operations.\nIn the hopes that I may contribute to the expansion of our guild's knowledge, I offer this record of my experiences in the town of Riften. Stay moist, comrades.\nRespectfully submitted,\n&lt;a href=\"Eyes-With-Intent\"&gt;Eyes-With-Intent&lt;/a&gt;"}

Riverwood is known for its riverside location and its affinity with lumber. Riverwood is a border town near the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nRiverwood is a small community on the eastern side of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;. The river flows from the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ilinalta\"&gt;Lake Ilinalta&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Falkreath\"&gt;Central Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim River&lt;/a&gt; near the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Riverwood is a tiny town but manages very well; it is strategically located on a pass between Falkreath Hold and Whiterun Hold, two trading cities near the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Province\"&gt;Imperial Province&lt;/a&gt; in the south. The nearest settlements to Riverwood are the city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; in the north and the fortified town of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, located near the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; border. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt; in the Brittleshin Mountains has also given the people of Riverwood a spooky feeling; it sits proudly on the mountain summit.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Riverwood in their quest to recover the pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Dragon Crisis in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the township of Riverwood was used as a hidden base for &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim. Ever since the Purge against the Blades, the Blades went into hiding and had left their past behind them. One of the few Blades to remain close to the order was &lt;a href=\"Delphine\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt;, a Breton who lived in Riverwood at the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Giant%20Inn\"&gt;Sleeping Giant Inn&lt;/a&gt; with her coworker, &lt;a href=\"Orgnar\"&gt;Orgnar&lt;/a&gt;. Delphine had escaped the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; through unknown means and left to Riverwood. Around this time, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; appeared after the destruction of Helgen, and was made widely known through the call of &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; from the temple of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. The Blades have waited for the return of the Dragonborn, ever since &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice against &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. To call upon their attention, Delphine took the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; and left a message for the Dragonborn to take it from her in Riverwood. It was there the Blades, and the Dragonborn began to work to put an end to &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World-Eater."}

The village is built on the eastern bank of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;. It is a small &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; village set in a valley, between the river and the steep mountainside of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. It serves largely as a stopping point and rural community along the road from &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nRiverwood was founded by the ancestors of Gerdur and Hod, current residents and owners of the village's lumber mill. The village is small, despite the fact that there is a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20Mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blacksmiths%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;general goods&lt;/a&gt; store, and three log houses and huts with small vegetable gardens. The village is largely self-sufficient, growing its own vegetables as well as hunting and &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; for meat.\nTrade is made through the blacksmith and goods store, and what cannot be found locally or bought from travelers passing through may be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Marketplace\"&gt;Whiterun Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. While the village is walled along its entrances, these walls are not initially patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, and the rural village is largely defenseless. As such, the road to Whiterun is frequented by &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; during the time of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, and the residents will stay in the town.\nInteractions.\nRiverwood is most likely the first location visited by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; following the attack on Helgen and the escape from &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. As such, the small and simple community serves as a tutorial village.\nAfter the events at Helgen, they are directed to either Alvor, had they followed Hadvar, or Gerdur, if they sided with Ralof. The quest \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" has them arriving in Riverwood, receiving supplies from the respective source, and being urged to head to Whiterun to inform the Jarl of the return of the dragons.\nRiverwood also acts as a significant location and base during the first two acts of the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn can participate in several local economy and community jobs for the residents, such as &lt;a href=\"Chop%20Wood\"&gt;chopping wood&lt;/a&gt;, milling logs at the mill and &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; basic armor and weapons at Alvor's forge. These activities will allow the Dragonborn to freely take most items from the buildings associated with the resident who was helped, without it counting as stealing.

Otherwise, the village is defenseless discounting its basic walls. &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt; does not go unpunished, however, as the residents will attack the Dragonborn should they commit a crime. The residents will accept a yield, but a bounty will be added to Whiterun Hold regardless, and they may refuse another yield following further crimes.\nPoints of interest.\nOther.\nThe White River, on which Riverwood is built, is full of &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;. These fish are sought after by the area's &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunters&lt;/a&gt;, and can be used for food or sold for gold. With the plug-in, salmon leaping up falls also have &lt;a href=\"salmon%20roe\"&gt;salmon roe&lt;/a&gt;, a valuable alchemy ingredient.\nCharacters.\nThere are a total of sixteen residents (and one dog, as well as chickens and cows) in Riverwood."}

The Drum is found in a chest in the final room.\nBackground.\n\"Giraud Gemane of the Bards College has found a clue to the location of the legendary drum of Rjorn. He's asked me to go to Halldir's Cairn and retrieve it.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon entering the Cairn, a strange pillar of damaging energy will be seen with a few corpses around it. Nearby is a small pedestal with &lt;a href=\"Agrius%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Agrius's Journal&lt;/a&gt; and a key to a nearby door. The journal simply tells of the fate of the three bandits.\nGoing through the (Adept) locked door, one enters the Cairn proper. The Cairn is standard, containing mostly sleeping &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Part way through is a draugr sitting on a throne near a blocked door; the lever for the door is behind the throne.\nThis eventually leads to another burial chamber with a pillar puzzle. The proper glyphs for each pillar is on the wall facing it. After lining up the three pillars, the nearby lever will open the sealed door (as opposed to triggering an arrow trap).\nEventually, the Dragonborn will reach the final room and face &lt;a href=\"Halldir\"&gt;Halldir&lt;/a&gt; himself. Halldir has the annoying habit of summoning clones of himself that must be put down. At 75% health he will split into three clones that each cast fire, ice, and shock spells. Only after one defeats the three clones will the real Halldir return. He carries a &lt;a href=\"Halldir%27s%20Staff\"&gt;unique staff&lt;/a&gt;, and is near a chest containing &lt;a href=\"Rjorn%27s%20Drum\"&gt;Rjorn's Drum&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled loot&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, open the trap door in the middle of the room and drop down (using the staggered wooden platforms) to reach the entry chamber to the Cairn.\u00a0\nReturn Rjorn's Drum to Giraud at the Bards college to receive the reward: +1 to &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, Altman later forced Weaver out of the company, causing Weaver to sue for wrongful termination. Altman served as ZeniMax Media's chief executive officer and chairman on the board until his death. Altman and the rest of the board pushed Bethesda to increase profits to make the company look more lucrative for a buyout, and its purchase by Microsoft following his death resulted in the board being dissolved.\nHe worked as a lawyer in Washington, D.C. and was involved in a scandal surrounding the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. As a result, he was permanently banned from ever being involved with any banking institution after numerous fraud/bribery charges. He was married to &lt;a href=\"Lynda%20Carter\"&gt;Lynda Carter&lt;/a&gt;."}

The dreadful drake wiped out entire villages, burned cities and killed countless Nords. It seemed that no Tamriel could stop the monster.\nThis was a troubled time in Skyrim's history, for a bitter war of succession raged between the &lt;a href=\"holds\"&gt;holds&lt;/a&gt;. The Jarls might have been able to the beast if they had worked together, but trust was in desperately short supply.\nA skillful warrior named Olaf came forward and promised to defeat the beast. In some accounts, he is the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. In other versions of the legend, Olaf promises the people of Whiterun that he will capture the monster if they will name him Jarl. At any rate, Olaf ventures forth with a handful of his most trusted warriors and seeks the beast out, eventually finding Numinex in his lair atop . Needless to say, it's an epic battle.\nFirst, Olaf comes at the dragon with his &lt;a href=\"Axe%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. Some variants of the legend say that Olaf and the beast battled with blade and claw for days, but were too evenly matched for either to gain an advantage. Most accounts hold that Olaf, perhaps frustrated that his &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; are completely ineffectual against the dragon, finally casts them aside. Giving voice to the rage that has been building within him, Olaf unleashes a terrible &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere again, the stories diverge. Many accounts hold that Olaf did not realize he possessed the power of Dragon-speech, while others suggest that he had long possessed this gift, but wished to test himself against the dragon in martial combat first. Virtually all variations of the legend, however, agree on what happened next.\nUsing the awesome powers of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20language\"&gt;Dragon language&lt;/a&gt;, Numinex and Olaf engage in an epic shouting duel atop Mount Athor. So forceful are their words, they are said to shatter the stone and split the sky. Finally, Numinex collapses from a combination of injury and sheer exhaustion. Somehow - and this detail is conspicuously absent in virtually every account - Olaf manages to convey the dragon all the way back to the capital city of Whiterun.\nThe people of Whiterun are suitably impressed with Olaf's hostage. They build a huge stone holding cell at the rear of the palace, which they rename \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;.\" This enormous cell serves as Numinex's prison until his death.\nOlaf himself eventually becomes the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim, putting an end to the war of succession. Presumably, his great deed made him the only leader upon whom all the people could agree, and so the land once again has peace.\nAs a visitor to Skyrim, I find this tale both fascinating and highly entertaining. It is one of the most celebrated legends of the Nords, and one can easily understand why. It's a story of surpassing heroism, in which a resourceful and worthy Nord does battle with a truly terrifying adversary and emerges victorious by yelling him into submission. The only way in which this could have been even more of a Nordic tale would be if Olaf beat Numinex in a drinking contest.\nThe legend is not without its doubters, however. The bard &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt;, who lived during Olaf's reign, wrote and performed an alliterative &lt;a href=\"King%20Olaf%27s%20Verse\"&gt;verse&lt;/a&gt; that challenged Olaf's version of events. Enraged, the High King threw the rebellious bard in prison and destroyed all written copies of the verse. How I would love to lay hands on a copy of that verse! I admit, I am immensely curious to know what assertions Svaknir made about how Olaf really defeated Numinex.\nThere are a few ancient bard texts that provide one possible answer. These tomes suggest that Numinex was particularly foul-tempered because he was extremely old. In these accounts, the dragon spends his final years terrorizing the country side before flying off to the top of Mount Athor to die in peace.\nWhen Olaf finds Numinex, the dragon is weak to defend himself. Olaf and his men capture the beast without effort, but decide to take advantage of the situation by fabricating a heroic tale. It is worth noting that all of Olaf's warriors who were said to witness the shout duel went on to become wealth leaders during Olaf's reign as High King.\nHowever, it is equally likely that Svaknir had some grudge against Olaf, and his scandalous verse was an attempt to damage the High King's reputation. Alas, we will never know.\nI leave you now, good reader, with this gentle reminder: A good historian must remain impartial, and consider all points of view. Time has a way of distorting our record of events, so the closer you can get to the original sources, the better!"}

Many of them seat themselves by the fire, order their &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spirit of choice&lt;/a&gt;, and regale patrons the stories of their triumphs.\nIt is, however, a strange thing to watch such a tale write itself in front of you, but that is precisely what happened when two legendary warriors, Grenwulf the Brawler and Holrik Frost-Shield, sat down at the table beside me.\nPerhaps it was the mead that shortened their tempers, but it did not take long for a spirited argument to become heated. Grenwulf, a brawler famous for fighting only with his fists, had compared Holrik to a soldier who fires a trebuchet - a man who is only as dangerous as the tool he employs.\nHolrik, for his part, cut right through Grenwulf's claim. If the brawler relied only on his fists then he should drink his mead from his palms, and slice his &lt;a href=\"Bread%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; with his fingernails.\nNot to mention there are things in this world, Holrik said, that fists alone cannot kill, even if that fist belonged to &lt;a href=\"Randagulf\"&gt;Randagulf&lt;/a&gt; himself. Whereas his sword, the Ice Blade of the Monarch, was blessed by the strength of the frost itself, and could cut through the walls of ice that lined the edge of the world.\nGrenwulf scoffed at the notion, claiming that no man or beast had yet to survive a single punch.\nIt was then that the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps darker minds, offered a resolution. A warrior came bursting through the doors, claiming a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Frostbite%20Spider\"&gt;monstrous spider&lt;/a&gt; had taken root in &lt;a href=\"Cronvangr%20Cave\"&gt;Cronvangr Cave&lt;/a&gt;, claiming three in his hunting party. His widened eyes and frowned lips, telltale signs of fear, spoke volumes to us all. It was a warning few would fail to heed, but are two heroes saw it as something else entirely - an opportunity to settle their dispute.\nAnd so the next morning, they departed for Cronvangr Cave. Three weeks have passed since.\nIn my life I have written tales of valor and tragedy, and those that are one and the same. And while the final chapter of Grenwulf and Holrik has yet to be written, I fear this may fall into the latter category, as neither has saw fit to return."}

When in the Main Hall the dresser in between the two single beds counts as a chest for both possible children. Otherwise, if there are two child beds, there must be two child chests. If there are two beds but one chest, adoption will still not be allowed. Additionally, even if there are more than two beds and two chests available (as with multiple homes), a maximum of two children can be adopted by the Dragonborn.\nAdoptable children.\nChildren may be adopted either from cities, where they can be found roaming the streets, or from &lt;a href=\"Honorhall%20Orphanage\"&gt;Honorhall Orphanage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nCities.\nAdopting a child from a city simply requires asking them about their circumstances. After this, they can be asked if they would like to be adopted. If the prerequisites are met, they will display their gratitude and arrange to meet the Dragonborn back home.\nChildren who can be found in cities are:\nHonorhall Orphanage.\nAdopting a child from &lt;a href=\"Honorhall%20Orphanage\"&gt;Honorhall Orphanage&lt;/a&gt; is only possible if the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Lost\"&gt;Innocence Lost&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed and the headmistress, &lt;a href=\"Grelod%20the%20Kind\"&gt;Grelod the Kind&lt;/a&gt;, is dead. &lt;a href=\"Constance%20Michel\"&gt;Constance Michel&lt;/a&gt; takes over and sends out a letter urging people to consider adoption.\nIf choosing to adopt from Honorhall, she will be pleased but is required to first ask a few questions, one of which is what the Dragonborn's occupation is. The following answers are possible:\nReplying as Dragonborn, Harbinger or Arch-Mage will result in disbelief and eventually amazement from Constance. Thief and Assassin results in her complaining about wasting her time and Adventurer and Mercenary are met with indifference.\nShe then asks where the child will be living. If a suitable home is owned, including a child's bed and chest, then it will appear as a possible reply. Choose a home and she'll congratulate the Dragonborn on becoming a parent. She then asks that the Dragonborn can go meet the children and decide who to adopt.\nThe children who are available by default are:\nIf the prerequisites are not met, she will refuse adoption, mentioning that the life of an adventurer is not exactly a safe or reliable profession. She needs to be sure the child will have a safe and stable home to grow up in. She finishes by urging the Dragonborn to buy a house and furnish it, and then come back.\nOther.\nOther children from across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; are sent to Honorhall Orphanage if their parents die. Once they are at Honorhall, they can be adopted. Alternatively, one may be able to adopt them on the spot before they're sent to the orphanage. These children include:\nIf the child's parents are killed by the Dragonborn and the &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; is noted by the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; or observed by the child, adoption may not be possible. Children may be \"aware\" that their parents were killed by the Dragonborn even if the crime was committed while hidden, rendering adoption impossible.\nIt is possible, however, to guarantee adoption after killing a child's parents. Immediately after committing the crime, by &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;bribing&lt;/a&gt; the guards and &lt;a href=\"Calm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Calming&lt;/a&gt; the child for a certain period, it is possible for children to reach the \"acceptance\" phase, when it becomes possible to open dialogue with them again. They say things such as \"(sigh),\" and \"What...what am I gonna do?\" and at this point, it becomes possible to adopt them.\nIt seems there is limited space in the orphanage, it can hold eleven children altogether, including the four that have always lived there. If the orphaned child doesn't show up at Honorhall within a few days, they likely are still in the place they originally lived.\n&lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grimvar%20Cruel-Sea\"&gt;Grimvar Cruel-Sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lars%20Battle-Born\"&gt;Lars Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assur\"&gt;Assur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bottar\"&gt;Bottar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haming\"&gt;Haming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joric\"&gt;Joric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sond%20%28Child%29\"&gt;Sond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virkmund\"&gt;Virkmund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nelkir\"&gt;Nelkir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frothar\"&gt;Frothar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagny\"&gt;Dagny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agni\"&gt;Agni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adara\"&gt;Adara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fjotra\"&gt;Fjotra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kayd\"&gt;Kayd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mila%20Valentia\"&gt;Mila Valentia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Babette\"&gt;Babette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helgi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Helgi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Pelagius\"&gt;Little Pelagius&lt;/a&gt; cannot be adopted.\nInteractions.\nOnce a child has been adopted, they will tell the Dragonborn that they will go to their new home. Once there, there are a few possible interactions that can be made with them. These include:\nGifts.\nOccasionally, an adopted child may give their parent a gift. These include:\nMoving.\nAn adopted child can be moved to a different home. The dialog option \"It\u2019s time for us to move\" is used which opens a list of eligible homes. The child will respond with \"Okay, I'll meet you there,\" when the new location is selected (if the move is cancelled, the child will respond with \"Aw, stop teasing me.\"). The child will be at the new home when it is next visited. Any pet the child has will also follow."}

When killed however, the card goes back into the deck, and is sometimes redrawn at the start of random turns. The neutral aspect of the card allows it to be added to any matter of decks.\nAttacking.\nThe Adoring Fan is a good choice to apply items and other effects to. As it is one of the few cards that cannot be &lt;a href=\"Silence%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Silenced&lt;/a&gt;, any bonuses added to it cannot be removed. This makes it useful if one decides to take an aggressive approach, and adding cards such as &lt;a href=\"Heirloom%20Greatsword\"&gt;Heirloom Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Dagger%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Steel Dagger&lt;/a&gt; can increase the damage output without the risk of losing the traits. The weaknesses of this is that the enemy can still use &lt;a href=\"Actions%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Actions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lethal\"&gt;Lethal&lt;/a&gt;, or wound-related instant destruction to destroy the card. The Guard &lt;a href=\"keyword\"&gt;keyword&lt;/a&gt; allows enemies to attack it rather than your other cards.\nDefending.\nAs the Adoring Fan has Guard, it is a natural use for defense, and can sometimes be used as a last resort if randomly drawn for free. Since it has only one health, the card can be rendered obsolete quickly if the enemy decides to attack it with a creature or a mass destruction spell like &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the useful trait of being immune to Silence, Items such as &lt;a href=\"Maple%20Shield%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Maple Shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt; can be applied to it in order to increase its health, which cannot be removed without killing the card altogether."}

More importantly, talents people will pay for. Demand for people like us is high these days, so I took the trouble of writing down my best leads. Why? I couldn't take all these jobs if I wanted to, and selling these books is a nice little score on the side. If you stole this book, go and pay for it. Unless it's in a lending library, then steal it and we'll call it square. Moochers.\nCrafting Writs\nThey don't call me \"the Knife\" on account of my forge work, but when I'm in town between jobs it pays to check the notice boards. Grab a writ, hammer on some things, get paid, and find the tavern. Easy money.\nGuilds\nEasiest route to steady work? Join a guild. It's what they're there for. That might seem obvious and stupid to put in my book. Almanacs cover everything, stupid.\nIf you like solving problems with violence, legally, the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; has you covered, plus they've got guild halls all over Tamriel.\nI don't endorse the illegal sort of killing, but I hear the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; accepts all kinds of murder contracts for hire.\nMaybe blood isn't your thing, but riches definitely are. I could say, hypothetically, there might be a sort of &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; that organizes that sort of sneaky business. Again, almanac, just being thorough here.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; may seem exclusive, but they got needs too, so pay them a visit even if sorcery isn't your thing. They've got locations in most cities.\nNow if you're looking for a big score and maybe don't got a lot of sense, go get in the good graces of the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt;. They've got enclaves in the major capitols and treasure piled higher than &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; that they're just itching to give away\u2014provided you're crazy enough to do what they ask to earn it.\nWar\nThe Three Armies never stop fighting. Throw your lot in with an alliance, get to Cyrodiil and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and reap the spoils. Plenty to go around. For the victors.\nAnd don't forget folks in those war torn regions need more help than anybody. Whether you want to charge them is your business, but there are always towns out there in need of some help.\nRegions of Interest\nSome places just have more need for people like us than others. I don't just visit Wrothgar because it reminds me of home. Orsinium's got a big demand for tough types to go out and pacify the wilderness, and while I can't say it's conventionally profitable, &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; is such a crazy place that half the time the stars are falling and the other it's raining treasure.\nDon't forget to check the boards on the way out of town too, at least on the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt;. Bounties and all sorts of other odd jobs find their way onto the boards from folks who aren't picky about who solves their problems.\nThe Last Word\nThere you go. All the ways I know how to keep busy in this business. I'm not saying you've got to do all this stuff every day, but you could if you wanted to. And don't value sleep. Don't go thinking you can buy this copy and be done with it. Times change and when they do, Skordo the Knife's going to write it down. Save up.\nTips welcome."}

But I know a guy who says it does and, if you can get inside, there's plenty of work to be done that the creepy locals ain't got time to deal with. Or consider beneath their interest. You know, I don't care. People look down on us &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; all the time, but are happy to open their pouches when they need something's head smashed in. Losers.\nPit Fights\nNow we're talking! You hear about those new fighting leagues they opened up recently? Love. It. Action, bloodshed, beat downs, and winners take all. Just don't, you know, lose. You'll get pitted against the best, the worst, and the worst of the worst. You ever see a guy just run around in a fighting arena trying to figure out which end of his sword goes in the other jerk? It's a wonder these mooks can get into their armor.\nI always put my gold on the Pit Daemons, by the by. Easy money, long as there ain't an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; on their team. What're you gonna do, breath underwater? Ha!\nAnd We're Done\nThat's all you get from me this time, tusk bait. Maybe next time Uncle Skordo will serenade you with his awesome knowledge and experience once he finds out where the next bunch of jobs happen to be. Just don't horn in on my work if I'm on the same contract, you hear?\nStay frosty. Oh yeah, and tusk off, you losers!"}

I want my cut.\nIf running errands for a bunch of mudpanners doesn't excite you, the &lt;a href=\"Dead-Water%20Tribe\"&gt;Dead-Water Tribe&lt;/a&gt; is organizing Death Hunts for some of the nastiest things in Murkmire. It'll get your blood pumping. Out of your neck if you're not careful.\nMaybe the idea of wading through a bog getting eaten alive by bugs doesn't appeal. Can't imagine why. You can still get your dainty hands on some of that easy Cyrodilic Collections gold. You can find an Argonian organizing supplies for their expeditions. Goes by &lt;a href=\"Jee-Lar\"&gt;Jee Lar&lt;/a&gt;. He'll talk your ear off if you let him, but he's always got something that needs doing.\nDragons\nFinally, there're tusking Dragons raging across &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. If you're just getting this news from me, get out from under the rock you call home and get to work! The Northern Elsweyr Defense Force is recruiting any help they can get for their war effort against the scaly bastards. They've got people stationed in Daggerfall, Davon's Watch, and Vulkhel Guard.\nNow I ain't heard much more than rumors about Dragon hunting, but you can bet there's someone out there itching to bag a Dragon and willing to offer a reward. Personally, you couldn't pay me enough to tangle with one of those flying murder-lizards\u2014though you're welcome to try.\nThere you have it. Plenty of work for an enterprising adventurer-for-hire. Remember papa Skordo when you strike it rich. And if you strike it dead, go haunt the sorry sack who taught you to fight."}

{"id": "1502", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1502", "title": "Aedra", "text": "The Aedra (singular: Aedroth) are one of the two groups of immortals which took part in the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. Their name is from the old &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;ic language, and translates roughly into \"our ancestors,\" referring to their role as the progenitors of &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. To the majority of cultures on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Aedra are revered as gods.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; is the night sky on Tamriel, so the Aedra are considered by some to be the planets. The largest eight planets are considered by &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; society to be the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;, while the stars are the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the Aedra are the subject of many, often conflicting, creation myths. This account will endeavor to create a single narrative while highlighting where such variances occur.\nThe &lt;a href=\"et%27ada\"&gt;et'ada&lt;/a&gt; formed from the interplay of two primal beings, &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;. These were distinct types of being either from their creation, or from the moment of the creation of Mundus. The Aedra were those spirits who were persuaded or tricked by &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; into sacrificing part of themselves to create the world. They are distinct from the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, who created worlds within themselves, and from the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; and his followers, who withdrew from the creation of the world before it was complete. The flight of these Aedra created the sun and the stars.\nAfter the creation of Mundus, some Aedra returned to Aetherius, while others were unable to do so either died, became the &lt;a href=\"Earthbones\"&gt;Earthbones&lt;/a&gt;, the laws of nature, or bred with each other to sustain themselves. In this way the Aedra became the antecedents of all races on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. However, alternative accounts exist which claim that the progenitors of mortal races are not descended from the Aedra, but instead come from another world or worlds altogether.\nNature.\nIn a similar way to Daedra, the Aedra have certain spheres. The precise names of the Aedra that oversee each sphere may vary depending on the cultural pantheon in question, although there are several commonalities between various cultures' pantheons. However, the only constants are the dragon god of time, most commonly called &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, and the missing god, most commonly called &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are accounts claiming that there were two groups of Aedra on Mundus, following the creation of Mundus. Some, led by &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, fought against Lorkhan and his followers, eventually becoming the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; and from them the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;. Others joined with Lorkhan, and became men.\nUnlike the Daedra, the Aedra are bound to Mundus, and can possibly be killed, as may have happened to Lorkhan after the meeting at the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt;. However, another account suggests that Lorkhan was not killed, but instead condemned to exile and &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;his heart&lt;/a&gt; torn out.\nSimilarly to the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Daedra\"&gt;Lesser Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, minor Aedric Spirits do exist. However, unlike their Daedric counterparts, these spirits do not respond to mortals and consider Mundus as off-limits since Magnus' withdrawal from creation. Thus, there are no known successful attempts to contact these minor Aedric spirits.\nAedra worship.\nThe pantheon of gods worshiped by the various races is derived almost exclusively from the Aedra. (A notable exception are the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, who generally reject the gods of both men and other mer, and worship either &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.) Each race has chosen to deify a different set of Aedra, often with their own beliefs on creation.\nMannish worship.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; has been the most prominent set of Aedra worshiped by men and mer. The pantheon was created by &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; upon creation of the empire, as a means to unify the allies who helped her win Cyrodiil and the merish cultural practices of the slaves she liberated. At the time, there were Eight Divines, but at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; transcended mortality to become &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, the Ninth Divine. The majority of the original Eight Divines can be described as Aedra, as for the most part they were present.\nMost of the gods in this pantheon are shared between the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, since Alessia chose to adopt most of her Nordic allies' gods after overthrowing the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; slavers. Many of these gods are worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nMerish worship.\nMerish religion is more focused towards their ancestors than mannish pantheons, evidenced by the very use of the term Aedra to describe them. These Aldmeri ancestor-heroes include &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the pantheon.\nThe Altmer's pantheon includes a number of Aedra that are no longer considered \"part of\" Nirn. This includes Magnus, whose withdrawal from Nirn created magic, and Jode and Jone, whose death created the twin moons. The Altmer also worship those Aedra who withdrew from creation in time to maintain their divinity, and who cursed Lorkhan as a trickster. Chief among these is &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, though both Altmer and &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; legend state that Trinimac was transformed into the Daedra &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; religion is similar to that of the Altmer, though many of the names are different. Various Daedra, particularly &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, play a key role in the Khajiiti creation story, and thus are worshipped as gods. The Khajiiti also revere the moons above all other deities, in forms similar to that of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;."}

Daedra, who cannot create, have the power to change.\nAs part of the divine contract of creation, the Aedra can be killed. Witness &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; and the moons.\nThe protean Daedra, for whom the rules do not apply, can only be banished."}

Without &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;'s power behind it, however, the bow uses its own store of energy for its power. Once exhausted of this energy, the bow will vanish and reappear wherever chance puts it.\n&lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Auriel's Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Auriel's Shield&lt;/a&gt;, an Ebony shield said to have once belonged to the quasi-mythical Elvish deity &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, can make its wielder nigh-invulnerable. In its resistance to fire and magic, Auriel's Shield is unsurpassed. Like many artifacts of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the shield has a life and personality of its own, and does not feel bound to its user. A popular fable tells the tale of it abandoning one wielder in her greatest hour of need, but this is perhaps apocryphal.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail%20%28Armor%29\"&gt;Lord's Mail&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometimes called the &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail%20%28Armor%29\"&gt;Armor of Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; or the gift of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, this is an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality. It grants the wearer power to absorb health, resist the effects of spells, and cure oneself of poison when used. It is said that whenever &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; deigns the wearer unworthy, the &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail%20%28Armor%29\"&gt;Lord's Mail&lt;/a&gt; will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one.\n&lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Hammer%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Stendarr's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nStendarr's Hammer is a large, impossibly heavy hammer, believed to once be wielded by the &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;God of Mercy&lt;/a&gt; himself. No man could possibly wield the weapon in battle, as it is massive and incredibly heavy, nearly ten times the weight of a normal hammer. Should someone manage to wield the hammer, it would greatly decrease the wielder's fatigue and deal impeccable damage to its foes, however, it is incredibly fragile. The hammer appears to be crafted of wood and metal, with a massive head comprised of a large, flat spiked face and a short horned toe. It was last recorded to be seen on display at the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Artifacts\"&gt;Museum of Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt; in the Third Era, during the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;False Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chrysamere\"&gt;Chrysamere&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Paladin's Blade is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities surpassed only by its own defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one champion.\n&lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Amulet of Kings was a powerful &lt;a href=\"soul%20gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Chim-el%20Adabal\"&gt;Chim-el Adabal&lt;/a&gt;. During the 1E Alessia prayed to Akatosh to free her people from the slavery of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; took pity on &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and drew his heart's blood and put it in the Chim-el Adabal. With this covenant the doors of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; are shut to the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. The soul gem becomes the Amulet of Kings, with one large red\u00a0gem set in the middle surrounded by\u00a0eight smaller gems of differing colors\u00a0representing the\u00a0eight divines.\nThe amulet, however, was smashed during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; to halt &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion and seal the barrier\u00a0between Mundus and\u00a0Oblivion.\n&lt;a href=\"Brush%20of%20Truepaint\"&gt;Brush of Truepaint&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Brush of Truepaint is an artifact of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, rumoured to be woven out of her hair. The wielder of the brush can create worlds and objects within a canvas, by travelling into the painted world. It was once owned by &lt;a href=\"Rythe%20Lythandas\"&gt;Rythe Lythandas&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to become a famous painter.\n&lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Totem of Tiber Septim, was an item heavily sought after during the events of and acquiring it is one of the main objectives in the game. The device itself was required in order to control a great construct, the golem &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the immense power of Tiber Septim's golem, many believed that whoever controlled the device controlled the fate of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther artifacts.\n&lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Staff of Magnus is an ancient, extremely powerful staff created and used by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the God of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;. The Staff of Magnus is one of the elder artifacts of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and it is vastly powerful, capable of absorbing\u00a0magicka\u00a0and health. Legend tells that it is the only artifact capable of containing his immense power. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he or she becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical arcane balance it is sworn to protect.\n&lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Eye of Magnus is an ancient magical artifact that is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. It was first discovered by &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; settlers during the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, when the first group led by &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and built the city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. It is known that Magnus created the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, but it is currently unknown whether or not he actually created the Eye of Magnus.\n&lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Heart of Lorkhan is said to be the &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s ripped heart. After &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; slew Lorkhan, he took his heart from his chest. Auriel decided to fasten the heart to an arrow and he fired it into the sea. The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; grew where it landed. The Heart's power was (possibly unsuccessfully) used by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and later by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. In the late &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Heart thanks to &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt;."}

She is one of five members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;The Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Residing in &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; with the other Companions, Aela offers lycanthropy deep into &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29%23The%20Companions\"&gt;the faction's questline&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, she is an expert level &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a candidate for &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; after The Companions' main questline.\nBackground.\nWhen asked, Aela explains her reasoning behind joining The Companions:\n\"\"My mother was a Companion. And her mother. And all the women in my family, back to Hrotti Blackblade. I stayed with my father in the woods until I was old enough for my Trial. We hunted everything there was to hunt... Good training. Ma didn't live long enough to see me join, but I fight to honor her and all my &lt;a href=\"Shield-Sisters\"&gt;Shield-Sisters&lt;/a&gt; through time.\"\"\nRelationships.\nIt is rumored among the Companions that she and &lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt; have a very intimate relationship with one another; &lt;a href=\"Njada%20Stonearm\"&gt;Njada Stonearm&lt;/a&gt;'s conversations with Aela reveals this. However, Aela hastily and vehemently denies the relationship, to the point of even threatening Njada if she pays attention to them.\nOther ambient dialogue between her and Skjor reveals that the two go out at night to hunt in beast form. This is discouraged among the Companions and is the source of their secrecy as well as the rumors about them. She is furious upon finding Skjor's body when the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; attacks the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gallows%20Rock\"&gt;Gallows Rock&lt;/a&gt; and seeks to avenge his death. It is never confirmed that she and &lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt; were romantically involved. \nInteractions.\nIt is possible to encounter Aela before knowledge of The Companions is acquired. She may be found fighting a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Pelagia%20Farm\"&gt;Pelagia Farm&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Ria\"&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt;, usually if approaching from the &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Meadery\"&gt;Honningbrew Meadery&lt;/a&gt; after leaving &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;. She approves or disapproves of the action taken by the Dragonborn in helping to kill the giant, depending on the amount of assistance given in defeating it; only one successful strike on the giant by the Dragonborn is needed to gain her favor. Regardless, she suggests visiting Jorrvaskr and speaking to &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; about joining The Companions before she, Ria, and Farkas make their own way back to Whiterun and Jorrvaskr on foot.\nArchery training.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; becomes a full member of The Companions, Aela offers Archery training for a fee. She is an Expert trainer and can train up to Archery level 75. She will still offer training if married.\nLycanthropy.\nIn order to complete The Companions quest line, the Dragonborn must be initiated into The Circle by becoming a Werewolf. Aela willingly donates blood while in her Beast Form, which must be drunk. During the transformation, the Dragonborn has a few minutes to run around Whiterun. Both guards and civilians will be hostile, but there are no consequences for attacking anyone, though it would be wise to not kill anyone if they are needed for quests or other activities. After the transformation, the Dragonborn awakens outside of Whiterun, with Aela standing over them.\nShe offers her congratulations, noting how difficult the Dragonborn was to control upon them first becoming their Beast Form and divulges information about the Circle's rivalry with the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, a fierce group of werewolf hunters. Together with Aela, a nearby Silver Hand encampment located at &lt;a href=\"Gallows%20Rock\"&gt;Gallows Rock&lt;/a&gt; is raided. The raid does not go as planned, however, as Skjor is slaughtered prior to the raid and found dead in the final chamber with the Silver Hand's commander, &lt;a href=\"Krev%20the%20Skinner\"&gt;Krev the Skinner&lt;/a&gt;. Aela vows to slay whoever killed him. From that point, the Dragonborn can receive special assignments from Aela, who sends them on a series of quests intended to stifle the dramatically escalating feud.\nAfter the Silver Hand assassinates &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; in an ambush on Jorrvaskr that results in them also stealing the pieces of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;, the Companions agree that the Silver Hand must be eradicated, with Vilkas and the Dragonborn traveling to &lt;a href=\"Driftshade%20Refuge\"&gt;Driftshade Refuge&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate the Silver Hand completely and recover the shards of Wuuthrad. In an effort to cleanse Kodlak's spirit of the beast curse following his funeral at the Skyforge, Aela accompanies &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt;, Farkas, and the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, where she helps redeem Kodlak's spirit. A promotion to &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; is given to the Dragonborn after the completion of this quest.\nReturning Lycanthropy.\nIn , Aela is able to give lycanthropy again, if the Dragonborn decides to cure it in favor of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;. Points expended toward the Werewolf skill tree cannot be undone or moved to other skill trees, which includes the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; skill tree. She will only do this once, however.\nAfter destroying the Silver Hand.\nAfter destroying the Silver Hand, she becomes a follower and a candidate for marriage while wearing an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt; in her presence. She then offers the repeatable \"&lt;a href=\"Animal%20Extermination\"&gt;Animal Extermination&lt;/a&gt;\" missions, as well as the ability to collect the mythic &lt;a href=\"Totems%20of%20Hircine\"&gt;Totems of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, but only if the player character is still a Werewolf and had not cured themselves during \"Glory of the Dead\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Purity\"&gt;Purity&lt;/a&gt;\" when helping cure Vilkas or Farkas of their own lycanthropy.\nBlades.\nAfter escorting &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Aela can be recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. Along with two others, she roots out and fights &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. After becoming a Blade, Aela's default armor changes to &lt;a href=\"Blades%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades Armor&lt;/a&gt; and her residence shifts from &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollower.\nAs a follower, Aela tolerates &lt;a href=\"stealing\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;murdering innocents&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Trespassing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trespassing&lt;/a&gt;, she says that the Dragonborn \"should not be in here,\" but otherwise does not turn hostile.\nSkills.\nAela is a specialist and highly skilled in Archery. Her primary skills are &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;. Her secondary skills are &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that she is not good with a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, and will rarely use one if it is in her inventory.\nEquipment.\nAela is equipped with the following items when she first becomes a follower:\nWeapons.\nAela will accept and equip any melee weapon and shield that is better than her default equipment. She is most skilled with bows and one-handed weapons. Aela can use &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; and may pick them up from corpses. At higher levels, she replaces her &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hunting Bow&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Bow\"&gt;Imperial Bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nAela's default &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20Armor\"&gt;Ancient Nord Armor&lt;/a&gt;. If &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt;, a copy can be purchased from her &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt;. Aela will equip any armor better than her default set. Just like other followers, Aela will consider armor as \"better\" if its base value is higher. Also like other followers, Aela will not equip upgraded versions of her default armor, regardless of statistics or enchantments.\nEven though her default armor is Heavy Armor, she is unskilled in &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; usage and receives minimal protection from it. She is highly skilled in Light Armor, and benefits significantly from Light Armor.\nClothing.\nAela can be forced to wear &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;clothes&lt;/a&gt;, although the process must be repeated every time a new area is entered. First, armor must be forced into her shop inventory by giving her a better suit. Proceed to buy both sets of the Ancient Nord Armor, to finally replace the armor that was given to her at first by clothes.\nDismissing.\nWhen Aela is dismissed as a follower, she returns to Jorrvaskr by default. If she has been asked to move into a &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; through marriage, she returns there instead. If she has been recruited for &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Blades&lt;/a&gt;, she returns to Sky Haven Temple. When Aela has returned to her home, she unequips any weapon and armor she has received, keeping them in her inventory instead. Her inventory must be altered to re-equip the items.\nDialogue.\n\"If you wish to hunt with me, your feet need to be quick, and your eyes quicker.\"\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkjor: \"I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned.\"\nAela: \"Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing.\"\nSkjor: \"Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.\"\nAfter talking to Aela:\nSkjor: \"Farkas!\"\nFarkas: \"Did you call me?\"\nAela: \"Of course we did, icebrain. Show this newblood where the rest of the whelps sleep.\"\nFarkas: \"New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me.\"\nKodlak's Burial.\nEorlund: \"Who will start?\"\nAela: \"I'll do it. Before the ancient flame... We grieve.\"\nEorlund: \"We grieve.\"\nFarkas: \"We grieve.\"\nVilkas: \"We grieve.\"\nEorlund: \"At this loss... We weep.\"\nAela: \"We weep.\"\nFarkas: \"We weep.\"\nVilkas: \"We weep.\"\nVilkas: \"For the fallen... We shout.\"\nAela: \"We shout.\"\nEorlund: \"We shout.\"\nFarkas: \"We shout.\"\nFarkas: \"And for ourselves... We take our leave.\"\nEorlund: \"We take our leave.\"\nAela: \"We take our leave.\"\nVilkas: \"We take our leave.\"\nAela: \"His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nVilkas: \"The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.\"\nAela: \"Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.\"\nVilkas: \"That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean. He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.\"\nAela: \"And you avenged him.\"\nFarkas: \"Kodlak did not care for vengeance.\"\nVilkas: \"No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about. We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood.\"\nAela: \"You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it.\"\nVilkas: \"Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death. You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.\"\nAela: \"There the souls of Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel. We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years.\"\nEorlund: \"And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim. Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be. The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired.\"\nVilkas: \"Is that? Did you repair the blade?\"\nEorlund: \"\"This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here. \"The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered.\" The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more. As the one who bore the fragments, I think should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle. The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak.\"\"\nAela's leisure time.\nAela: \"You wanted to see me?\"\nKodlak: \"I worry that you've been spending too many nights out.\"\nAela: \"Where I go is my business. If you have a concern about my honor, bring it before the Circle.\"\nKodlak: \"You forget yourself, young one.\"\nAela: \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap. Just... these hunters. We're all on edge.\"\nKodlak: \"That's why it's best to not mistake foolhardiness for bravery.\"\nGlorious hunt.\nKodlak: \"How goes the hunt?\"\nAela: \"Skjor's heard rumors of a bear the size of a mammoth in Hammerfell. We're going to seek it out.\"\nKodlak: \"What glorious prey. Come back alive, and with stories to tell!\"\nAela: \"Always.\"\nFoolish younglings.\nSkjor: \"All these younglings scampering around.\"\nAela: \"Worried one of them is going to take your place?\"\nSkjor: \"Some of them might try. But that's not what I'm worried about.\"\nAela: \"What then?\"\nSkjor: \"That they might get themselves killed.\"\nAela: \"By you?\"\nSkjor: \"They should be so lucky.\"\nTonight's hunt.\nSkjor: \"Are you prepared for tonight's hunt?\"\nAela: \"I've been thinking we need to be more... discreet.\"\nSkjor: \"There's nothing wrong with what we're doing.\"\nAela: \"You know the old man doesn't like it. Let's just not be too obvious.\"\nWhispers of intimacy.\nNjada: \"I've heard some rumors... about you and Skjor.\"\nAela: \"And if you want to keep having ears, you'll pretend you didn't.\"\nNjada: \"Is it not allowed?\"\nAela: \"It's not exactly forbidden, but even so... it's not true. So that's that.\"\nSteadfast defense.\nAela: \"How do you manage to hold your ground like that?\"\nNjada: \"You have to remember, it's not about strength. It's about leverage.\"\nAela: \"But strength doesn't hurt.\"\nNjada: \"Well, no. I'm just saying there's more to defense than muscle.\""}

Unlike my contemporary, &lt;a href=\"Phrastus\"&gt;Phrastus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, who alienates readers with his self-serving agenda, I find that starting with an unbiased, concrete example works best as an introduction. Studying Aetherial fragments naturally leads to the broader topic of the planes.\nSurely you have seen a shooting star. This occurs when a piece of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, spirit-plane and source of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, becomes dislodged and falls to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Two types of materials, meteoric iron and glass, may be found after such an event. The magical potential of both is extraordinary. In this text, I focus on the rarer meteoric glass, including its uses through history and its various manifestations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; that ruled &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; until the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, made extensive use of these sky-stones. With their advanced understanding of the magical arts, they created blue &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Welkynd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varla Stones&lt;/a&gt; to harness the power of starlight from Aetherius and store magicka, power enchanted items, or provide unending light. Some even held &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20Staff%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells as a type of automated defense.\nThe secrets of producing these stellar vessels have been lost. The Ayleids were able to create them in considerable numbers by replicating and enchanting meteoric glass. Attempts to synthesize new Welkynd or Varla Stones, or even to reproduce uncharged meteoric glass, have failed. Frequently, the original stones crumble to useless dust upon experimentation, further frustrating research and necessitating dangerous expeditions into Ayleid ruins.\nThe modern &lt;a href=\"Malondo%20Stone\"&gt;Malondo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Culanda%20Stone\"&gt;Culanda&lt;/a&gt; stones, golden in color, are similar to blue Ayleid fragments. A product or discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;, they are most frequently found in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Malondo Stones, which can be recharged, can be tapped by spellcasters as a source of magicka replenishment or to restore a charge or charges to enchanted items. Culanda Stones provide a bright golden light. They can trigger magical effects or store magicka, but are always destroyed upon use or depletion.\nYou may read claims by Phrastus, who is blindly enamored of Elven culture, that the Altmer have unlocked and improved upon the secrets of the Ayleids. He even suggests that they are cultivating Malondo and Culanda Stones as a farmer might grow wheat. The more reasonable theory is that, through tinkering with existing Ayleid stones and raw meteoric glass, a more reliable method of recharging has been discovered.\nSky Prisms, another type of Aetherial fragment, can be seen splitting into shards as they fall to Nirn during specific lunar alignments. When three shards meet, they re-form into a silvery prism by some unknown process and confer the power unlocked by the merger to a nearby being. Like other sky-stones, they are relatively rare, and it is difficult to obtain specimens for investigation. Though they originate in the heavens they are often found underground, brought there by denizens of the depths who find their light-emitting properties useful.\nWith enough study and experimentation, it is my hope that the keys to producing these useful items will be uncovered, and a more full understanding of the planes and their power will be achieved."}

Alchemically, it is inert and research suggests it was required to be stored outdoors as it was harmonically volatile.\nDwemer study.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"1E%20221\"&gt;1E 221&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwemer of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; discovered a considerable source of raw Aetherium in Blackreach.\nAn alliance between four Dwemer cities of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raldbthar\"&gt;Raldbthar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mzulft%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;, and Bthar-zel (now known as &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Folk%20Crossing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Deep Folk Crossing&lt;/a&gt;) was created to oversee the extraction, processing, and study of the rare crystal.\nThe city of Arkngthamz led the project and served as the primary command and research center, while the city of Raldbthar, which happened to be located directly above Blackreach, dealt with the mining operations. Mzulft was used as a storage site, but it is unknown what role Bthar-zel took. The Aetherium Forge was constructed under the city of Bthalft in order to smelt it under precisely controlled conditions.\nThe research into the crystal and the items it produced by the forge was a major success. The items produced by the Forge were artifacts of immense power, imbued from the moment of their creation with powerful enchantments. The dwarven alliance shattered almost immediately, as the four city-states and their rivals attempted to claim the Forge. The conflict later became known as the Aetherium Wars and it lasted for several decades. Years of internal disputes and infighting decimated the Dwemer states and was the primary reason for their sudden collapse, which in turn paved the way for High King &lt;a href=\"Gellir\"&gt;Gellir&lt;/a&gt;'s subsequent conquests.\nArtifacts.\nAetherium can be used to create extremely powerful items that are imbued with enchantments. Known examples are the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Crown\"&gt;Aetherial Crown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Staff\"&gt;Aetherial Staff&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Shield\"&gt;Aetherial Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20to%20the%20Ages\"&gt;Lost to the Ages&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only known location of Aetherium in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; are the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Shard\"&gt;shards&lt;/a&gt; found in Arkngthamz, Raldbthar, Mzulft, and Deep Folk Crossing."}

Arkngthamz was assigned the role as the primary command and research center, to oversee the Aetherium's extraction, processing and study, while Mzulft was used as a storage site and with Raldbthar being used as the primary source of Aetherium, which came directly from Blackreach (Raldbthar was located directly above the main entrance to Blackreach).\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Forge\"&gt;Aetherium Forge&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was built deep beneath\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Bthalft\"&gt;Bthalft&lt;/a&gt;; the city of Bthalft and the Aetherium Forge are over 4,000 years old, ancient even by Dwemer standards. The results of the Aetherium project were \"nothing short of spectacular;\" the Aetherial artifacts which were created by the Aetherium Forge were incredible artifacts with immense power.\nThe War Begins.\nIn just a short amount of time, the four city-states that participated in the Aetherium project attempted to take control of the Forge, each for their own. Civil war erupted and a new conflict emerged in the history of Tamriel and of the Dwemer civilization: the Aetherium Wars. Quickly, war spread across Skyrim, and decades of conflict began to weaken the Dwemer city-states of Skyrim.\nThe Rise of High King Gellir.\nSoon, &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gellir\"&gt;Gellir&lt;/a&gt; led his armies across Skyrim, conquering the land and taking over many Dwemer cities along with his conquering of Skyrim in just three years.\nAftermath.\nA century later, the Dwemer civilization would recover and reclaim most of their cities and territory which they had previously lost. The Aetherium project was most likely not continued, as the costs were too great, and there is no evidence that they ever resumed the project."}

Aetherius is the source of magic and of all creation in &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. It can be construed as the inverse of Oblivion, from which the Daedra originate; conversely, Aetherius is the realm from which the Aedra are connected. Oblivion is considered the dualistic inverse of Aetherius.\nIt is the plane of pure &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;ka, and is the realm where magicka originates. Common belief is that souls ascend to this location upon death. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Geographic%20Society\"&gt;Imperial Geographic Society&lt;/a&gt; has this to say about it:\n\"\"It is aetherial energy that infuses our daily existence, from highest to lowest, and gives all the races of men, mer, and beast common purpose. Its magic brings the rain to the fields, love to our hearths, and scientific principles to our technological industries. It gives us the very Sun itself. Finally, Aetherius is the home to the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, those cornerstones of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; whose aspects we see in the temple, in lordship, and the high walk of heroes.\"\"\nRealms within Aetherius.\nThough it is known that Aetherius contains a large number of planes within itself, only four are specifically known.\nReaching Aetherius.\nIt is substantially more difficult to reach Aetherius than it is to reach the void of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The only two successful trips there occurred firstly during the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, and secondly by the \"&lt;a href=\"Sun%20Birds\"&gt;Sun Birds&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. From the Reman Dynasty, the Royal Imperial \"Mannanauts\" were obtained, and from the Sun Birds, the &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. It is also rumored that the Dwemer may have reached Aetherius in the past, as well. Some believe that the stars, including Nirn's sun, Magnus, are laminar tears through Oblivion that were created by &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt; who fled from Nirn during its creation, that allow light and magic from Aetherius to reach Mundus. During the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; travelled to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; , a realm of Aetherius, through the portal at &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Shores\"&gt;Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;, another realm of Aetherius, through the portal at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Hall of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, and visited a shard of Aetherius that became coterminous with the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ezduiin\"&gt;Ezduiin&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Meldil\"&gt;Meldil&lt;/a&gt;'s amulet. Also, the agent sent by Uriel Septim to Daggerfall to ensolve the murder of King &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; was transported to Aetherius by Nulfaga in Castle Shedungent in order of find the Mantella. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; reached &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, to defeat &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nScenes that mention Aetherius.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; entered Aetherius' sub-realm Mantellan Crux to extract the Mantella for use against the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;. The realm exists as a massive labyrinthine puzzle. &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; is encountered here, in his parlor. Although, in &lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;later titles&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath became associated with the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, Aetherius' converse, he was not included as such in \"Daggerfall\".\nIn , Aetherius is mentioned in passing in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Heaven%20Stone\"&gt;Heaven Stone&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Aetherius%20Stone\"&gt;Aetherius Stone&lt;/a&gt;.

Is it a story of heroes and beasts?\"\nThe Grandfather looked patiently at the Child. He was growing into a fine boy. Soon he would see the value in the stories, the lessons that were taught to each generation. \"Just listen, Child. Let the story take root in your heart.\"\nIn a time before now, long before now, when the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; were new, there was peace in the Land. The sun was hot and the crops grew long, and the people were happy in the peace that the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt; provided. But, the Skaal grew complacent and lazy, and they took for granted the Lands and all the gifts the All-Maker had given them. They forgot, or chose not to remember, that the &lt;a href=\"Adversary\"&gt;Adversary&lt;/a&gt; is always watching, and that he delights in tormenting the All-Maker and his chosen people. And so it was that the Adversary came to be among the Skaal.\nThe Adversary has many aspects. He appears in the unholy beasts and the incurable plague. At the End of Seasons, we will know him as &lt;a href=\"Thartaag\"&gt;Thartaag&lt;/a&gt; the World-Devourer. But in these ages he came to be known as the Greedy Man.\nThe Greedy Man (that is what we call him, for to speak his name would certainly bring ruin on the people) lived among the Skaal for many months. Perhaps he was once just a man, but when the Adversary entered into him, he became the Greedy Man, and that is how he is remembered.\nIt came to be one day that the powers of the Skaal left them. The strength left the arms of the warriors, and the shaman could no longer summon the beasts to their side. The elders thought that surely the All-Maker was displeased, and some suggested that the All-Maker had left them forever. It was then that the Greedy Man appeared to them and spoke.\n\"You of the Skaal have grown fat and lazy. I have stolen the gifts of your All-Maker. I have stolen the Oceans, so you will forever know thirst. I have stolen the Lands and the Trees and the Sun, so your crops will wither and die. I have stolen the Beasts, so you will go hungry. And I have stolen the Winds, so you will live without the Spirit of the All-Maker. \"And until one of you can reclaim these gifts, the Skaal will live in misery and despair. For I am the Greedy Man, and that is my nature.\" And the Greedy Man disappeared.\nThe members of the Skaal spoke for many days and nights. They knew that one of them must retrieve the Gifts of the All-Maker, but they could not decide who it should be.\n\"I cannot go,\" said the Elder, \"for I us must stay to lead the Skaal, and tell our people what is the law.\"\n\"I cannot go,\" said the Warrior, \"for I must protect the Skaal. My sword will be needed in case the Greedy Man reappears.\"\n\"I cannot go,\" said the Shaman, \"for the people need my wisdom. I must read the portents and offer my knowledge.\"\nIt was then that a young man called Aevar lifted his voice. He was strong of arm, and fleet of foot, though he was not yet a warrior of the Skaal. \"I will go,\" said Aevar, and the Skaal laughed. \"Hear me out,\" the boy continued. \"I am not yet a warrior, so my sword will not be needed. I cannot read the portents, so the people will not seek my counsel. And I am young, and not yet wise in the ways of the law. I will retrieve the Gifts of the All-Maker from the Greedy Man. If I cannot, I will not be missed.\" The Skaal thought on this briefly, and decided to let Aevar go. He left the village the next morning to retrieve the Gifts.\nAevar first set out to retrieve the Gift of Water, so he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Stone%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Water Stone&lt;/a&gt;. It was there the All-Maker first spoke to him. \"Travel west to the sea and follow the Swimmer to the Waters of Life.\" So Aevar walked to the edge of the ocean, and there was the Swimmer, a &lt;a href=\"Horker\"&gt;Black Horker&lt;/a&gt;, sent from the All-Maker. The Swimmer dove into the waters and swam very far, and far again. Aevar was strong, though, and he swam hard. He followed the Swimmer to a cave, swimming deeper and deeper, his lungs burning and his limbs exhausted. At last, he found a pocket of air, and there, in the dark, he found the Waters of Life. Gathering his strength, he took the Waters and swam back to the shore.\nUpon returning to the Water Stone, the All-Maker spoke. \"You have returned the Gift of Water to the Skaal. The Oceans again will bear fruit, and their thirst will be quenched.\" Aevar then traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Stone\"&gt;Earth Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and there the All-Maker spoke to him again. \"Enter the Cave of the Hidden Music, and hear the Song of the Earth.\"\nSo Aevar traveled north and east to the Cave of the Hidden Music. He found himself in a large cavern, where the rocks hung from the ceiling and grew from the ground itself. He listened there, and heard the Song of the Earth, but it was faint. Grabbing up his mace, he struck the rocks of the floor in time with the Song, and the Song grew louder, until it filled the cavern and his heart. Then he returned to the Earth Stone.\n\"The Gift of the Earth is with the Skaal again,\" said the All-Maker. \"The Lands are rich again, and will bear life.\" Aevar was tired, as the Sun burned him, the trees offered no shade, and there was no wind to cool him. Still, he traveled on to the Beast Rock, and the All-Maker spoke. \"Find the Good Beast and ease his suffering.\"\nAevar traveled through the woods of the Isinfier for many hours until he heard the cries of a &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; from over a hill. As he crested a hill, he saw the bear, a &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;'s\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; piercing its neck. He checked the woods for the Falmer (for that is what they were, though some say they are not), and finding none, approached the beast. He spoke soothing words and came upon it slowly, saying, \"Good Beast, I mean you no harm. The All-Maker has sent me to ease your suffering.\"\nHearing these words, the bear ceased his struggles, and laid his head at Aevar's feet. Aevar grasped the arrow and pulled it from the bear's neck. Using the little nature magic he knew, Aevar tended the wound, though it took the last bit of his strength. As the bear's wound closed, Aevar slept.\nWhen he awoke, the bear stood over him, and the remains of a number of the Falmer were strewn about. He knew that the Good Beast had protected him during the night. He traveled back to &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Stone\"&gt;Beast Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the bear by his side, and the All-Maker spoke to him again. \"You have returned the Gift of the Beasts. Once again, the Good Beasts will feed the Skaal when they are hungry, clothe them when they are cold, and protect them in times of need.\"\nAevar's strength had returned, so he traveled on to the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Stone\"&gt;Tree Stone&lt;/a&gt;, though the Good Beast did not follow him. When he arrived, the All-Father spoke to him. \"The First Trees are gone, and must be replanted. Find the seed and plant the First Tree.\"\nAevar traveled again through the Hirstaang Forest, searching for the seeds of the First Tree, but he could find none. Then he spoke to the Tree Spirits, the living trees. They told him that the seeds had been stolen by one of the Falmer (for they are the servants of the Adversary), and this Falmer was hiding them deep in the forest, so that none would ever find them.\nAevar traveled to the deepest part of the forest, and there he found the evil Falmer, surrounded by the Lesser Tree Spirits. Aevar could see that the Spirits were in his thrall, that he had used the magic of the Seeds and spoken their secret name. Aevar knew he could not stand against such a force, and that he must retrieve the seeds in secret.\nAevar reached into his pouch and drew out his flint. Gathering leaves, he started a small fire outside the clearing where the Falmer and the ensorcelled Spirits milled. All the Skaal know the Spirits' hatred of fires, for the fires ravage the trees they serve. At once, the Nature of the Spirits took hold, and they rushed to quell the flames. During the commotion, Aevar snuck behind the Falmer and snatched the pouch of Seeds, stealing away before the evil being knew they were gone.\nWhen Aevar returned to the Tree Stone, he planted the tree in the ground, and the All-Maker spoke to him. \"The Gift of Trees is restored. Once again, the Trees and Plants will bloom and grow, and provide nourishment and shade.\" Aevar was tired, for the Sun would only burn, and the Winds would not yet cool him, but he rested briefly in the shade of the Trees. His legs were weary and his eyes heavy, but he continued on, traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Stone\"&gt;Sun Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the All-Maker spoke. \"The gentle warmth of the Sun is stolen, so now it only burns. Free the Sun from the Halls of Penumbra.\"\nAnd so Aevar walked west, over the frozen lands until he reached the Halls of Penumbra. The air inside was thick and heavy, and he could see no farther than the end of his arm. Still, he felt his way along the walls, though he heard the shuffling of feet and knew that this place held the Unholy Beasts who would tear his flesh and eat his bones. For hours he crept along, until he saw a faint glow far at the end of the hall.\nThere, from behind a sheet of perfect ice, came a glow so bright he had to shut his eyes, lest they be forever blinded. He plucked the flaming eye from one of the Unholy Beasts and threw it at the ice with all his might. A small crack appeared in the ice, then grew larger. Slowly, the light crept out between the cracks, widening them, splitting the ice wall into pieces. With a deafening crack, the wall crumbled, and the light rushed over Aevar and through the Halls. He heard the shrieks of the Unholy Beasts as they were blinded and burned. He ran out of the Halls, following the light, and collapsed on the ground outside.\nWhen he was able to rise again, the Sun again warmed him, and he was glad for that. He traveled back to the Sun Stone, where the All-Maker spoke to him. \"The Gift of the Sun is the Skaal's once again. It will warm them and give them light.\" Aevar had one final Gift he had to recover, the Gift of the Winds, so he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Stone\"&gt;Wind Stone&lt;/a&gt;, far on the western coast of the island. When he arrived, the All-Maker spoke to him, giving him his final task. \"Find the Greedy Man and release the Wind from its captivity.\"\nSo, Aevar wandered the land in search of the Greedy Man. He looked in the trees, but the Greedy Man did not hide there. Nor did he hide near the oceans, or the deep caves, and the beasts had not seen him in the dark forests. Finally, Aevar came to a crooked house, and he knew that here he would find the Greedy Man. \"Who are you,\" shouted the Greedy Man, \"that you would come to my house?\"\n\"I am Aevar of the Skaal,\" said Aevar. \"I am not warrior, shaman, or elder. If I do not return, I will not be missed. But I have returned the Oceans and the Earth, the Trees, the Beasts, and the Sun, and I will return the Winds to my people, that we may feel the spirit of the All-Maker in our souls again.\" And with that, he grabbed up the Greedy Man's bag and tore it open. The Winds rushed out with gale force, sweeping the Greedy Man up and carrying him off, far from the island. Aevar breathed in the Winds and was glad. He walked back to the Wind Stone, where the All-Maker spoke to him a final time.\n\"You have done well, Aevar. You, the least of the Skaal, have returned my gifts to them. The Greedy Man is gone for now, and should not trouble your people again in your lifetime. Your All-Maker is pleased. Go now, and live according to your Nature.\" And Aevar started back to the Skaal village.\n\"And then what happened, Grandfather?\"\n\"What do you mean, Child? He went home.\"\n\"No. When he returned to the village,\" the Child continued. \"Was he made a warrior? Or taught the ways of the shaman? Did he lead the Skaal in battle?\"\n\"I do not know. That is where the story ends,\" said the Grandfather.\n\"But that is not an ending! That is not how stories end!\"\nThe old man laughed and got up from his chair.\n\"Is it not?\""}

Tolfdir fears it is a side-effect of Ancano's meddling with the Eye of Magnus, and has asked that I look into it. He suggested I take the Staff of Magnus with me, just in case.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe location of the anomaly may vary each time the quest is done. When the Dragonborn arrives, an anomaly is found spawning Magic Anomalies which are highly resistant to magic. The Dragonborn must defeat all of the apparitions to close the anomaly. Despite Tolfdir's recommendation to bring the Staff of Magnus, the Staff is not actually needed and, in some cases, seems to have no effect at all.\nPossible locations.\nThe locations of the rifts creating the magic anomalies are always in one of three locations of one of the nine holds, and most are sufficiently away from any location that they cannot be directly fast travelled to.\nThe coordinates of these locations are the following:\nRepeating.\nEvery three days, Tolfdir can be asked about any tasks that need completing. He then marks the map with the location of a new rupture. Alternatively, when traversing the world, a rupture can be found, and closing it will automatically start the quest.\nRewards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s are paying the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; for clearing out the anomalies throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.

However, if the location of the magic anomalies were in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold Hold&lt;/a&gt; then there will be no reward, as the inhabitants of Winterhold are already displeased with the College."}

He does not initiate dialogue with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; until the quest \"The Cursed Tribe\" starts. He differs from many Orsimer because of his laziness and cowardice in battle.

If the Dragonborn chooses not to, Yamarz will be killed by the giant immediately, but if they do choose to kill the giant, then Yamarz will do the following. Yamarz asks the Dragonborn to keep whatever happened at the camp from the members of the stronghold. When the Dragonborn agrees or disagrees, Yamarz will attack them on sight.\nAfter returning to Largashbur with &lt;a href=\"Shagrol%27s%20Warhammer\"&gt;Shagrol's Warhammer&lt;/a&gt;, they will tell the stronghold of Yamarz's fate.
