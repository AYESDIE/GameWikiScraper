Corda's actions had led to the end of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the 29th of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, Corda was an initiate of the &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha Conservatorium&lt;/a&gt;, a religious school within the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;. For quite some time, her sister, Rijja, was a consort of Reman III, who had been very paranoid with the times of war with the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%27s%20Festival\"&gt;Merchant's Festival&lt;/a&gt; had rolled by, Rijja had been imprisoned at the &lt;a href=\"Thurzo%20Fortress\"&gt;Thurzo Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, with Reman believing she was a spy. Reman III had taken an interest to Corda, much to the dismay of Rijja, who had scratched his eye out when proposing the idea. Corda arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; on the 21st of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, a month after Rijja's execution, which Corda learned not long after arriving. As time went on, Corda joined the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, planning her execution of Reman III with &lt;a href=\"Savirien%20Chorak\"&gt;Savirien Chorak&lt;/a&gt;. On the 6th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, Corda had slit the Emperor's throat with razor-sharp parchment with the symbol of the Morag Tong. Corda had taken a writ from the late &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Empress Tavia&lt;/a&gt;, who was originally imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;. With a vast bounty on her head, Corda met the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, where she would take a voyage to &lt;a href=\"Vounoura\"&gt;Vounoura&lt;/a&gt;, where all Morag Tong agents go to retire. From then on, Corda has never seen again."}

Corgrad was heavily afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;, and has been abandoned ever since. Corgrad eventually started to sink into the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nCorgrad Wastes is located along the northwestern coast, which is in between the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Lillandril\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;. Corgrad was originally a port town, but when a sinkhole opened in the center of town, much of the architecture had fallen into the underground. On the surface, there are several traditional &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; homes, but either sunken into the water or covered in layers of seaweed and moss. Nothing else is worth noting about the surface, but the underground is large. The biggest entrance into the underground is through the sinkhole, which has already been covered up. The only other way to the underground is from any of the homes, which has paths leading into it. The caves are vast and very open. The main chamber is where cavern dwellers inhabit.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Corgrad was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Kinlord%20Nemfarion\"&gt;Kinlord Nemfarion&lt;/a&gt;, who made a grave decision to combat the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;. The Plague was a disease originating from the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; that has the afflicted constantly drink until they vomit and die from the excess. Nemfarion issued a decree that the people of Corgrad would never leave their homes, nor the settlement until the disease had passed through, but unfortunately, Corgrad had ultimately succumbed to the disease. Corgrad had laid dormant and abandoned. A sinkhole had opened in the middle of Corgrad Wastes, swallowing the city-state and flooding the buildings. From then on, the curse of Corgrad Wastes had spread across the province, and scavengers began to inhabit the outskirts.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of the Corgrad nobility, &lt;a href=\"Faidur\"&gt;Faidur&lt;/a&gt; had returned to Corgrad to claim his birthright, meeting with the scavengers on the outskirts. Faidur sought the help of a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;newcomer&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the ruins, only to discover more clues on Corgrad's fate. Eventually, the two delved deep into the underground caverns, only to find a sect of cavern dwellers led by &lt;a href=\"Arillas\"&gt;Arillas&lt;/a&gt;. These dwellers were among the original inhabitants of Corgrad, worshipping their \"Saviors,\" the ones that had disposed of the Thrassian Plague from them. When Faidur and the newcomer arrived at their camp, Faidur was taken away to be sacrificed to the \"Saviors.\" It is revealed that the Saviors were the first nobility, among them was Kinlord Nemfarion, who planned to use Faidur's youth to restore them back to health, all the while leaving their descendant in the ruins. But fortunately, the newcomer defeated Arillas and escaped with Faidur and several scavengers. Corgrad Wastes remained abandoned ever since then.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, which he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel. The staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the village of Corgrad Wastes in their quest to recover the pieces."}

Cormount was known for a scandal regarding the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; when members of the Clan begun to live in Cormount, using it as a hideaway from the populous.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nCormount is one of the largest settlements in the region of Grahtwood, comparable with other &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;Graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; trees in the same area (i.e., &lt;a href=\"Gil-Var-Delle\"&gt;Gil-Var-Delle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;). Cormount is an important trading town, as it bridges the gap between Elden Root, and the northern border region of &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;, with the nearest city being &lt;a href=\"Rawl%27kha\"&gt;Rawl'kha&lt;/a&gt;, which in itself connects &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, both prominent cities their respective provinces. Cormount is one the high ground of the region of &lt;a href=\"Green%20Hall\"&gt;Green Hall&lt;/a&gt;, with the minor town of &lt;a href=\"Karthdar\"&gt;Karthdar&lt;/a&gt; hanging below its majesty. The land eventually closes in the north from Cormount, where the border pass into Reaper's March is located. The land surrounding Cormount is not used, considering the Wood Elves' strict laws known as the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, but several Ayleid ruins are found in an around the city, such as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cormount%20Memorial\"&gt;Battle of Cormount Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn, can be seen as a part of a larger ruin known as the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Reliquary of Stars&lt;/a&gt;.\nCormount is surrounded by the Graht-oak in the middle, which extends into the forest-skies of Grahtwood. On the highest branch is the local &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt; that governs the settlement. The bottom of the tree is the center of commerce in Cormount, which is typical with other Graht-oaks. Directly south of Cormount is large ravine with three bridges that go over it to connect with the roads that continue south into the heart of Grahtwood. All around the Graht-oak are the traditional Bosmeri tree-pods, which wind around the valley and connect to each other. The road north leads into Reaper's March, as well as, &lt;a href=\"the%20Gorinir%20Estate\"&gt;the Gorinir Estate&lt;/a&gt;, the summer home of a cadet branch of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gorinir%20Family\"&gt;Gorinir Family&lt;/a&gt;. There is an offshoot from Cormount that leads into an undisclosed cave southeast of the city.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fully-Fledged Trading Cities of Valenwood &amp; the Treethanes.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Borgas\"&gt;High King Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; invaded Valenwood when they denied the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt; and killed amidst the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Valenwood under the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; waged war with each other for several years. Once the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Reform\"&gt;Alessian Reform&lt;/a&gt; was dispelled, the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; would join the Alessians in their battle against the Camoran's Valenwood. Although in &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;, a plague from distant &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; had hit Valenwood, leading to Valenwood's defeat at the hands of the Alessian Empire. But the Camoran Dynasty was still a notable figure, and so to prevent a rebellion, the Empire granted the &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt;s of the Dynasty full independence in the Empire. One of these settlements was Archen Cormount, &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;. These settlements grew from simple trading posts to fully-fledged power.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Camoran Scandal &amp; the Migrants of New Joy.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20406\"&gt;2E 406&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed in a scandal that Cormount houses potential heirs of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, considering that the ancient family have used the trading town as a hideaway from the local populous, as it is far from both Elden Root and &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;. With the fact that most were at a reasonable age for marriage, the population of Cormount had increased tenfold in just one week. For several months later, weddings had become a daily occurrence. Cormount had even grown more so when young Wood Elves that lived beyond Valenwood moved into the town, hoping to keep their Imperial fortune, all the while, cling to their spiritual home, some of these newcomers would establish a ramshackle village off Cormount called &lt;a href=\"New%20Joy\"&gt;New Joy&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this migration, the locals were not so favorable of the migrants, considering how much the latter flaunts their \"backwoods\" nature despite their weak grasp at the will of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, seeking easy pleasure from the trade flowing through Cormount. This proved to be the migrants' downfall.\nRazing of New Joy &amp; The Blacksap Movement.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20420\"&gt;2E 420&lt;/a&gt;, the Wood Elves of Cormount had razed the village of New Joy, and the people were blindly slain, including a visiting Camoran noble. While nobody took credit for the slaughter, many point to the radical followers of the Green Pact as the cause. In the small years before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Truce\"&gt;Long Truce&lt;/a&gt;, the Camoran Elves used the Razing of New Joy as a crutch to air their grievances. Following this in &lt;a href=\"2E%20489\"&gt;2E 489&lt;/a&gt;, a group had appeared from Cormount, the &lt;a href=\"Blacksap%20Movement\"&gt;Blacksap Movement&lt;/a&gt; had become a prominent faction in the region of &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, being one that attempts to formalize the Green Pact, so that another tragedy such as the Razing of New Joy would not happen again. The Blacksap Movement had been spearheaded by the Camoran Dynasty that lived out in Cormount with the first iteration led by &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Gelthior\"&gt;Camoran Gelthior&lt;/a&gt;, the cousin of the then King of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Aeradan\"&gt;Camoran Aeradan&lt;/a&gt;. The Wood Elf had ruled over Elden Root for quite some time, and things would drastically change, for better or for worse in &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt; when Aeradan had signed the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Accord\"&gt;Elden Accord&lt;/a&gt;, formally creating the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, with Elden Root as the capital. The Blacksap and Cormount would be affected greatly in the following two years.\nThe Massacre at Cormount &amp; the Jade Butcher.\n&lt;a href=\"General%20Endare\"&gt;General Endare&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Dragoons\"&gt;Jade Dragoons&lt;/a&gt;, an elite militia of the Dominion. Her troopers were initially stationed in the port-city of &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; until they went inland and eventually arrived into Cormount. At the dead of night, Endare had burned down the trees of Cormount and had started what would become known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Massacre%20at%20Cormount\"&gt;Massacre at Cormount&lt;/a&gt;.\" It has been described as horrifying. When the people had attempted to flee the destruction, Dragoon cavaliers went on horseback and killed them on the streets. Rounding up children and strangling them in front of their parents, as &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Gorinir\"&gt;Camoran Gorinir&lt;/a&gt; described it. The Blacksap Movement had gathered their forces and driven the Altmer into the ruins west of Cormount, calling to the Green for their help. However, Endare had ordered her mages to poison the Green, and without the help, the Jade Dragoons continued their attack on Cormount. Endare had gone down in history as the \"Jade Butcher\" and continued her service with the Aldmeri Dominion, much to the dismay of the Gorinir Clan in Cormount. This event had become memorialized with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cormount%20Memorial\"&gt;Battle of Cormount Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, in the ruins west of Cormount. It had also served as inspiration for the Blacksap Rebellion, under the command of Gelthior's sons, Gorinir and &lt;a href=\"Lorchon\"&gt;Lorchon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blacksap Rebellion; Gorinir's Folly.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the township of Cormount was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Treethane%20Iirdel\"&gt;Treethane Iirdel&lt;/a&gt;, who, along with Camoran Gelthior are attempting to take down the Blacksap Rebellion in their plan to overthrow Camoran Aeradan. The &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Rangers\"&gt;Vinedusk Rangers&lt;/a&gt; had become involved in the effort and have taken to the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;wandering hero&lt;/a&gt; in their efforts of defeating Lorchon and Gorinir. The Hero was able to gain an audience with Lorchon at the Battle of Cormount Memorial. It was there, the two engaged in combat where the former was able to apprehend Lorchon, taking him to his father. Gorinir had taken refuge in an unmarked cave off the main road, where he was able to amass his forces for an assault on Cormount, against the Dominion soldiers stationed there. Gorinir's &lt;a href=\"Lurcher\"&gt;Lurcher&lt;/a&gt;s had attacked the Dominion but he was ultimately stopped by the Hero. Cormount had been saved from another threat and continued under the Dominion. Fortunately for the Camoran brothers, Endare would be slain by the Hero at the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Winter%20Site\"&gt;Falinesti Winter Site&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchen Cormount during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the village of Archen Cormount in their quest to recover the pieces."}

Symptoms generally include a number of cancerous growths and, in the diseases' later stages, violent insanity; those in the late stages of the disease become stronger and are referred to as &lt;a href=\"Corprus%20Stalker\"&gt;Corprus Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s. Some, whose growths are more debilitating, are called &lt;a href=\"Lame%20Corprus%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Lame Corprus&lt;/a&gt; Beasts. Corprus is considered incurable by the inhabitants of Morrowind.\nBackstory.\nCorprus is spread by the Ashstorms and can be considered a deadlier version of (if not a relative to) &lt;a href=\"Ashblight\"&gt;the Blight&lt;/a&gt;, as both were created by Dagoth Ur and are spread in the same fashion, via the Ashstorms, and can also be contracted from Corprus-afflicted individuals. It also allows the sufferer to become susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;'s dream messages (referred to by Morrowind denizens as \"Soul Sickness\"), which could possibly lead the victim to joining the Sixth House Cult.\nCorprus is called \"the Divine Disease\" and its sufferers \"Children of His Flesh\" by members of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, as they believe it to be the evolution of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; race, bringing them unity and immortality, and protecting them from all outside influences, mainly the Empire. In the Seven Trials of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, it is also referred to as the \"Curse-of-Flesh.\"\nA magical barrier, the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;, was created by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, for the purpose of containing the Blight and Corprus disease within the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; region. However, as the barrier slowly began to weaken, the Blight epidemic spread outside the Ghostfence, and both it and Corprus spread throughout many places in Morrowind. Tel Fyr also houses a Corprusarium, where the victims of Corprus can find refuge and live out the remainder of their lives in relative peace. It is possible that they seem to keep at least some sort of awareness of themselves.\nEffects on player.\nDuring the course of the game, the main character performs a quest in which they are infected with corprus. Infection is unavoidable\u2014if they are not infected in the natural course of the quest, they are automatically infected upon its completion. They seek a potion from &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt; on the east coast of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The potion removes the negative symptoms of the disease while retaining its two positive symptoms, immunity to age and all other diseases (&lt;a href=\"Ashblight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; and common diseases). The Nerevarine is certainly cured due to the prophecy as Divath Fyr mentions after the quest that it killed the other subjects. One of the trials for becoming accepted as the Nerevarine is proving the Nerevarine's ability to resist the Corprus disease.\nSpells.\nThe following spells consist of a Corprus effect. They may include additional effects. See articles for details.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Disease%20Carrier\"&gt;Disease Carrier&lt;/a&gt; - as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; the Nerevarine must convince &lt;a href=\"Tanusea%20Veloth\"&gt;Tanusea Veloth&lt;/a&gt; to go to the Corprusarium to avoid infecting other people.\nCorprusarium.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Corprusarium\"&gt;Corprusarium&lt;/a&gt; is an asylum for victims of Corprus. Due to the extremely contagious and untreatable nature of the disease, along with the fact that the infected develop aggressive behavior, the most effective non-lethal method of prevention of the disease is the incarceration of all victims of the disease away from society.\nPurpose.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; wizard &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, seeing the need for some measure of comfort to these unfortunate victims (and seeing the disease as a fascinating and potentially useful phenomenon), constructed the Corprusarium beneath his tower of Tel Fyr. Located on one of the many small islands near Sadrith Mora, it is the only establishment aside from &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; where Corprus sufferers are not persecuted.\nDescription.\nThe Corprusarium itself is actually a rather unpleasant dungeon, but the inmates, having long since gone completely mad, do not require many creature comforts. The only luxury they seem to appreciate is the occasional drum playing done by their caretaker, Uupse Fyr (one of Divayth Fyr's clones), something that significantly reduces their violent outbursts. Visitation is allowed but not recommended, obviously because you may contract Corprus. Any violence toward any inmate is strictly prohibited. The Corprusarium plays a vital role in the main storyline of the game, as well. Also, there are many powerful and valuable artifacts found there for any thief willing to try their luck against the dungeon; you may also meet \"the last living Dwarf,\" who has seemingly overcome the disease's psychotic nature and has taken up residence in the Corprusarium's deepest chambers."}

This may cause problems when high disposition is needed.\nCross through land and go to &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, where there is a boat in Gnaar Mok which can transport Nerevarine to &lt;a href=\"Khuul\"&gt;Khuul&lt;/a&gt;. From there, take a &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; and another one to Balmora. In the &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; city, go to Spymaster Caius Cosades and inform him about the disease. The Spymaster will be very preoccupied with Nerevarine's condition. The Spymaster knows\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fast%20Eddie\"&gt;Fast Eddie&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, who\u00a0said that &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, an old and wise Telvanni wizard, currently studies the disease and maybe he can help Nerevarine. Caius will give a Dwemer artifact to Nerevarine, in order to gain the wizard's sympathy. The Spymaster will give 1000 drakes and &lt;a href=\"Levitate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt; potions too, for Telvanni Towers require them.\nA 4000 Year Old Wizard.\nThe new objective is &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, Divayth's Tower, the place is next to &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;. The fastest way to get there is the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;'s teleporter to Sadrith Mora, or alternatively using the Silt Strider and boat services to reach the city. Cross the archipelago to the southwest until Tel Fyr appears.\nInside the tower, go right and enter the Hall of Fyr. There is a traditional Telvanni hole in the roof, use the Levitate potion or spell to climb and reach the second floor.\nDivayth Fyr is standing next to an open book, gain his disposition giving him the Dwemer artifact. Divayth Fyr knows much about the divine disease and will offer a potion that may cure corprus or kill the Nerevarine. The wizard will only give the potion if the Nerevarine does a task for him; he wants the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Boots%20of%20Flying\"&gt;Dwemer Boots of Flying&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt;, one of his corprus victims who he houses in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Corprusarium\"&gt;Corprusarium&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorprusarium.\nGo back to Onyx Hall and find the way to Corprusarium, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; guard &lt;a href=\"Vistha-Kai\"&gt;Vistha-Kai&lt;/a&gt; will advise to not harm the inmates. Take caution in Corprusarium, as corprus monsters can be aggressive and enter the &lt;a href=\"Corprusarium%23Corprusarium_Bowels\"&gt;Bowels&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorprusarium Bowels.\nYagrum Bagarn is standing in a spider-machine which resembles the &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Spider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Centurion Spiders&lt;/a&gt; next to &lt;a href=\"Uupse%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Uupse Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, one of Divayth's daughters. Talking to Uupse will reveal that her playing a &lt;a href=\"Guarskin%20Drum\"&gt;Guarskin Drum&lt;/a&gt; soothes the inmates and there is one around somewhere. The drum is back in the Corprusarium proper by a campfire on the east branch, however, any guarskin drum will do if the Nerevarine has one in their inventory. There is no audible sound effect for the results, but the effect makes all of the corpus creatures in both the Corprusarium and the Bowels non-aggressive.\nSurprisingly, Yagrum Bagarn is a Dwemer, he is the last of his race alive and was tainted with corprus in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. He will give the Nerevarine the boots and can be asked about his race and what he thinks happened to them.\nThe Cure.\nYagrum will give the Dwemer Boots of Flying. Go back to Divayth Fyr and give him the boots, and he will gladly hand over the potion, but with one condition: the Nerevarine has to drink the potion in front of him. The potion will cure the Corprus disease or kill the Nerevarine. Drink the potion when ready. After drinking the potion, the corprus is not cured, but all the negative effects of the disease are lost. Divayth Fyr says he never wanted to cure the Nerevarine of corprus, as they are meant to have corprus and immunity to other diseases.\nReturn to Spymaster Cosades for his last order."}

Thus, the acquisition of corpses on which to experiment is often difficult.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; who have served the Empire are given the corpses of criminals and traitors to use legally. This provides those who have acquired such a post with a fresh supply of corpses, most of them young, strong, and intact.\nIn Morrowind, the outlawing of Necromancy would make its practice impossible were it not for the fortunate institution of slavery. While the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; will investigate obvious signs of Necromancy such as hastily emptied graves or ash stolen from one of their ashpits, a careful and discrete Necromancer can thrive in Morrowind by taking slaves at a modest rate. Most will assume the slave escaped or died in the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinding suitable corpses in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; is nearly impossible due to their rapid decay. There are also diseases, &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; tribesmen, and other difficulties that must be dealt with. I know of only a few &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; Necromancers who operate successfully in Black Marsh, and even they stay near coast.\nWhile the forests of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; pose some of the same problems as those of Black Marsh, the deserts preserve corpses for hundreds of years in a way that requires very little preparation. &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of the desert tribes are often buried with only a small cairn of stones which are easy to find and uncover. The Khajiit show remarkably enlightened indifference to graves being uncovered. It is said that in the port of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, one may purchase anything one desires. This is true if you desire fresh corpses.\nWhile few &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; perform &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;'s rituals when burying the dead, the more primitive Bosmer still practice cannibalism upon their enemies, which reduces the number of available corpses. As would be expected from such a backwards people, they have an intolerance of Necromancy that goes beyond all reason. Many Necromancers who practice our Arts in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; become \"one with the trees\" themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; is even worse in some ways. Some &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; born into the most respected noble and scholarly families are actually allowed to study the dead in the open. Their research, however, seems to be centered on finding ways to extend their lives even further rather than the more practical uses of our Art. A Necromancer of any other race caught in Summerset Isle can expect the worst possible punishments.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, where worship of Arkay is strongest, the dead are almost always subject to Arkay's Law. There are exceptions after large battles or in remote areas where death occurs far from meddlesome priests. Fortunately, the dangerous terrain and creatures in the deserts and mountains of Hammerfell makes the acquisition of corpses possible, though they are often in poor condition and require special care in preparation.\nThe newly formed &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; presents a unique opportunity. As you know, &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; corpses are among the most sought after for the durability of their skin and the strength of their bones. If King &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog&lt;/a&gt; will listen to reason, we could offer the services of our Art in defense of his young nation in exchange for disposing of the Orcish dead. A mutually beneficial arrangement as I'm sure the Orcs will agree. To this end, a delegation has been sent to Orsinium, though we have not yet heard any word on the state of these negotiations.\nIn my native &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, traditions dating back to the witch kings and nomadic horsemen mandate cremation of the dead. This is practiced almost without exception in the north, through an Imperial burial in a tomb or city cemetery is more common in the south. There are still many corpses easily taken from the battlefields of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; and the lawless times that followed. There are even rumors that King &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; may institute the Imperial practice of donating the corpses of criminals for Necromantic study as a deterrent to the bandits and pirates that still threaten the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the cold weather and isolated terrain allow a few Necromancers to operate freely. Alas, the availability of corpses is limited to &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; who die from exposure or in battle. While the cold is preservative, the snow makes these corpses difficult to find. More research dedicated to the magical detection of corpses would be invaluable to the Necromancers of Skyrim.\nThe Sload are the most famous Necromancers, but little is known of their native &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, Sload only practice Necromancy on other races. It is uncertain whether this is true in Thras as well. If so, it would explain the number of slaves that are purchased in &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt; by Sload merchants and the rumors of Sload &lt;a href=\"airships\"&gt;airships&lt;/a&gt; carrying corpses from Senchal.\nThese difficulties lead many Necromancers to create their own corpses. While I prefer to work with those who have died a natural death, a more expedient approach is sometimes necessary to further the study of the Art.\nWhile the Arts of Necromancy can be practiced on animals, such experiments rarely produce interesting results. The servant's ability to follow directions seems to be related to the subject's intelligence in life. While raising the corpse of a man, elf, or beastman can produce a useful servant, the corpses of animals produce mere guard dogs at best. Often a raised animal is unable to distinguish its master from the rest of the living and many amateur practitioners have been torn apart by the animal servants they created. Let such stories be a lesson to you."}
{"id": "6681", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6681", "title": "Corpse Preparation v II", "text": "Corpse Preparation v II is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nWhen raising a skeleton servant, it is most important that the body of the skeleton be complete. If the skeleton is missing crucial bones, the results can be frustrating. One should only attempt to raise skeletons when you are sure that all or nearly all the bones are present.\nWhile the magic involved in raising a skeleton will assemble the bones in the proper order, skeletons may be strengthened considerably by the addition of support on their joints. The most common are leather straps that bind the bones together more tightly. Some practitioners also drive metal spikes are between the joints, which is more expensive and time consuming, but they protect the servant where it is weakest. The details of this are unimportant as even an amateur can strengthen a skeleton significantly. Only practice will reveal the best methods of binding and reinforcing the skeletal servant. Amateurs often make the mistake of binding the bones too tightly, limiting the skeleton's movements and making it useless. Again, only practice can give the necessary experience in these matters, though it is best to err towards tight bindings. One may always loosen them at a later date.\nOne more note to the student: While most undead can be raised again and again, skeletons are often damaged in ways that make raising them again impossible. This is another reason that care should be given to the skeleton's preparation. Too many young &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; raise every skeleton they see with little or no preparation at all. Given the difficulty of obtaining corpses, this kind of inefficiency cannot be tolerated."}

If their decay is advanced, or if you wish a skeletal servant instead, place the corpse along a coast or in a swamp or marsh. Animals are the Necromancer's greatest allies when it comes to stripping the flesh from a corpse. The ravenous mudcrabs of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; can strip a corpse down to its bones in a matter of days. Lesser crabs in other provinces can do the same in a matter of weeks.\nIf you wish to create a zombie servant, one need only bring the corpse to a suitable site and enact the proper rituals. However, there are a few tips that a young Necromancer might want to know. For instance, a decayed servant may be raised many times, even if they have been dismembered by those who do not appreciate our Art. If one of your servants comes to an unfortunate end, you may raise the servant again by carefully gathering as many parts as you can find, binding the bones with leather straps, and sewing the flesh (if it not too decayed) with catgut. Your servant may be weaker each time this is done, but with care and maintenance, one may raise zombies dozens of times.\nHowever, creating a mere &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; is a method best left to lazy or desperate practitioners. With only a bit more time and effort, one may create a far more useful mummified servant.\nThe first step to creating a mummified servant is to soak the decaying corpse in a bath of salt or natron for at least one month. This will halt the decay of the corpse, and if the corpse is fresh enough to have an unpleasant odor, the salts will remove that as well. In a moist climate, such as &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;, you may have to apply more salts if they become saturated. Some Necromancers remove the vital organs before or after this process, but I have never found any practical reason for doing this.\nThe next step is to wrap the servant in cloth or linen. This will further preserve the body against decay and, if done properly, will offer some protection as well. Do not worry if the corpse seems too stiff or desiccated to be a useful servant, the proper rituals will imbue the mummified corpse with the strength to move itself. Most importantly, you will have a much stronger servant who will follow your commands with more independence and understanding."}

His quarters are reached through the barracks which are in the tower southwest of the exit of the main hall of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;Castle Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. The best time to break in to Ulrich's room is at night, as Ulrich is asleep in the upper floor with the other guards, thus avoiding getting caught. On a dresser will be an &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Letter\"&gt;incriminating letter&lt;/a&gt; that states the high fines are being pocketed to finance Ulrich's new estate outside Cyrodiil. The letter should be on top of a book on the dresser, but the letter may have dropped from the dresser, so if the Hero does not immediately find it, search carefully.\nTake the letter to Garrus, who uses it to oust Ulrich, and is promoted to Captain of the Guard. Garrus will ask that the Hero of Kvatch meets him in the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Bridge%20Inn\"&gt;Cheydinhal Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt; in two hours. Meet him there and get a leveled gold reward.\nAfter the quest, Llevana says that although she is happy Ulrich was removed from his post, she is still saddened that there was not true retribution for Aldos. She believes in the code of an-eye-for-an-eye and it is hard for her not to see that through. However, she and everyone else appreciates what the Hero has done for them. One can also visit Ulrich in the dungeon where he will accuse the Hero of coming to gloat and threaten them if he ever gets out.\nMethod Two.\nTalk with Llevana again, and she says she will 'take care of' Ulrich. Talk with Ulrich and prompt him to go to Llevana's house. Once inside, Llevana &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralyzes&lt;/a&gt; Ulrich and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;summons&lt;/a&gt; giant rats to kill him. Llevana says she has no regrets.\nAfterward, talk with Garrus. He will arrest Llevana, but will do his best to lighten her prison sentence. He will ask that the Hero of Kvatch meets him in the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Bridge%20Inn\"&gt;Cheydinhal Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt; in two hours. Meet him there and get a gold reward depending on the Hero's level. However, it will be less than if using method one.\nMethod Three.\nIf they are to Kill Ulrich, the quest will still be considered complete once Garrus has been spoken with. However, killing him is considered a crime and will incur a bounty that must be paid. Completing the quest this way will result in no reward other than the loot from Ulrich's body.\nMethod Four.\nUse detect life. Go swimming in the canal near the Nibeny Basin gate. One will find Ulrich underwater near a bridge. He refuses to speak with the hero. Kill him, which will result in an invitation to the Dark Brotherhood. Upon speaking to Garrus again, he does not approve of the Hero's methods, but agrees something needed done. He will then ask for a reduced sentence."}

We are all that remains of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. We were entrusted by the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; to preserve what they sacrificed so much to create. Those who have remained true to our traditions have kept their heritage pure and our civilization unspoiled. Those who have strayed from the path the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; laid out for us, on the other hand, have been debased. They have become degenerates, unrecognizable from the Divines that created them.\nThose who would call themselves Mer beyond these sacred Isles are nothing but the twisted remains of the Aldmer. When you look into the ruddy eyes of a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt;, do you see anything of yourself there? Of course not. All you see are the ashes of something greater, utterly destroyed by the False Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; and shaped into repugnant shadows by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; he served. When you see the hideous, malformed &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, do you see a creation of the Aedra? No! What you see is only the feculence of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. Leavings so loathsome that they had to sculpt their own dung-god from filth to give their existence any meaning.\nBut it is not just these pitiable wretches we must learn from, for it is not only those who are foolish enough to be seduced by the Daedra who threaten to warp our way of life. Look upon the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; and see how even the misguided worship of the Divines can pervert our lineage. There is a difference between appreciating the forest and becoming a beast. Now these wayward cousins are barely more than savage barbarians who devour their own kin. I am grateful none of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Folk\"&gt;First Folk&lt;/a&gt; remain to see how corrupted their perfection has become.\nThe lesson is clear. To stray, even slightly, from the ways of our ancestors will have dire consequences. Knowing that, can you acquiesce to throwing open the gates and welcoming corruption into these holy lands with a smile? The &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Unforeseen Queen&lt;/a&gt; is the harbinger of our destruction. We must resist her heresy!"}

Take a moment to consider your options.\"\nAfter stealing the documents:\nCosh: \"Well?\"\nCaptain Evani: \"What choice do we have? We're in.\"\nCosh: \"Good. Then I shall make your documents disappear. What? My papers were here! Did they fall behind the \u2026. I'll attend to that after my meeting with Chief Inspector Rhanbiq.

{"id": "516851", "revid": "35838578", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=516851", "title": "Cosmology", "text": "What are planets?\nThe planets are &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;the gods&lt;/a&gt; and the planes of the gods, which is the same thing. That they appear as spherical heavenly bodies is a visual phenomena caused by mortal mental stress. Since each plane(t) is an infinite mass of infinite size, as yet surrounded by the Void of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, the mortal eye registers them as bubbles within a space. Planets are magical and impossible. The eight planets correspond to the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. They are all present on the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Observatory\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt;, along with the mortal planet, Nirn.\nWhat is Nirn?\n&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; ( for 'Arena') is a finite ball of matter and &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; made from all of the god planets at the beginning of time, when &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; tricked/convinced/forced the gods to create the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;mortal plane&lt;/a&gt;. Nirn is the mortal plane and the mortal planet, which is the same thing. Its creation upset the cosmic balance; now all souls (especially the Aedra-Daedra/Gods-Demons) have a vested interest in Nirn (especially its starry heart, &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhat are moons?\nSmall planets, insofar as one infinite mass of infinite size can be smaller than another. Planets do have orbits, or at least lunar orbits are perceived to happen by mortals. Moons are regarded by various cultures as attendant spirits of their god planet, or minor gods, or foreign gods. The moons of Nirn are &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;. Moons are not represented in the Dwarven Orrery.\nWhat are Masser and Secunda?\nMasser and Secunda ('Jone' and 'Jode' in the Ehlnofex), the moons of Nirn, are the attendant spirits of the mortal plane. They are like the mortal plane in that they are temporal and subject to the bounds of mortality; in fact of this, the moons are dead and died long ago. The moons used to be pure white and featureless, but today their 'skin' is decaying and withering away. Their planes are likewise dying. Mortals perceive this as the moons being spheres with patches of their 'surfaces' completely eaten away; as the moons spin, they seem to become slivers or ragged crescents. These are not caused by shadows, because you can see stars through the black patches of the lunar spheres.\nWhat is space?\nSpace is the interpretation of Oblivion, which is black and empty and surrounds the mortal plane. Space is infinite, but it acts just like a planet, in that Oblivion is 'surrounded' by &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. You can see Aetherius by the stars.\nWhat are stars?\nThe stars are the bridges to Aetherius, the magic plane. They are perceived as holes on the inside surface of space. Because they are on the inside of a sphere, all stars are equidistant from Nirn. Larger stars, therefore, are not closer to the mortal plane, they are just larger tears in Oblivion. The largest tear in Oblivion is &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the sun.\nWhat are shooting stars, then?\nA misnomer. Shooting stars are bits of matter and magic, either from Oblivion or Aetherius, that sometimes move through the cosmos. The largest shooting stars are really planets with independent orbits, like &lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt; the Rogue Plane.\nWhat are constellations?\nConstellations are collections of stars. Since each star is a bridge to magic, constellations are very powerful phenomena, and are revered. There are generally accepted to be thirteen constellations. Nine of these are made up completely of stars. Three others are called guardian constellations, as they are each governed by a Dominion Planet. The Dominion Planets are &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; (eye of the Warrior), &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; (eye of the Sage), and &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; (eye of the Thief). The last constellation is made up of unstars, and is called the Snake.\nWhat is the sun?\nMagnus is the sun, the largest hole in Oblivion, and the gateway to magic. Magnus was present at the creation of the mortal plane, and, in fact, was its architect (Lorkhan was its advocate and inspiration). Prehistoric (before ME2500, startyear) Nirn was a magical place, and highly unstable to the first mortals. Magnus then left, some say in disgust, and Oblivion filled in the void with the Void. His escape was not easy, and tatters of Magnus remain in the firmament as stars.\nWhat is the sky?\nThe sky is another visual phenomenon caused by mortal mental stress, the night sky in particular. The sky is as impossible as planets; in essence, when you look into the sky, 'you look outside the material plane'. At night, Nirn is surrounded by Oblivion. The day sky is the multicolored elemental cloak of Magnus the sun. It changes colors as elemental influences rise and fall. Thus, when one looks at the day sky, they see into the raiments of Aetherius, and stare at magic.\nHow was the universe created?\nThose phenomena of the spirit realm that inhabitants of Nirn interpret as a universe came into being during the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;. It was created through magic and myth, and this process is interpreted in a variety of ways too numerous to mention here. These myths can be accessed elsewhere."}

The princes of Tamriel would dissolve their armies or face his wrath.\nThe next thirty-seven years were perhaps the bloodiest in the violent history of Tamriel.\nReasons.\nThe Council of Bardmont was convened to discuss the problem of private and royal armies. Because they had private armies, the nobles of Tamriel did not pay their taxes to the Potentate, resisted Imperial forces, and raided Imperial interests in the provinces. The Council was convened after a raid destroyed the Potentate's private refuge at &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;. The Potentate incensed convened the Council and declared universal and catholic martial law.\nEffects.\nThe Council of Bardmont was not very effective, for many princes kept their armies. The council did, however, prevent more bloodshed than what happened, because some nobles took heed to this warning and disbanded their armies. The princes who did not were attacked by the Imperial Legion and destroyed."}

The council's headquarters are located in the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The head of the council is the Arch-Mage.\nMembers.\nThey are headquartered in the second floor of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Lobby\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Lobby&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the conflict between the Mages Guild and &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; many members of the guild felt &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; should be permitted in order to stop Mannimarco. Others felt that the guild was in danger of being overpowered and their relics would be used for evil and therefore should be hidden elsewhere.\nThis led to members of the Council breaking off from the guild. Irlave Jarol and Caranya both took relics and left, each with their own goals.\nIrlave took the &lt;a href=\"Bloodworm%20Helm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bloodworm Helm&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Teleman\"&gt;Fort Teleman&lt;/a&gt; to study it in hopes of finding a way to fight Mannimarco. However, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; found out about this and laid siege to the fort. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; made it to the fort and found members of the Mage's Guild had been killed and the place was overrun with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and necromancers. The helm was found on the corpse of Irlave.\nCaranya had different plans on what to do with the artifact in her possession. She took the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Amulet%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Necromancer's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ontus\"&gt;Fort Ontus&lt;/a&gt; not to study or protect it, but to hand it over to Mannimarco. The Hero arrived to the fort in the hopes of bring the Amulet back. When Caranya saw that this was his goal she revealed her own plans and attacked them. The Hero took the amulet and fought their way out of the fort."}

Whatever the reason, writing my thoughts as though I'm talking to you calms me and helps me think through the problems of the day.

I'm not looking forward to performing this gruesome ceremony, but I know of no other way to employ the services of these assassins. Uncle, do not be disappointed in me. I can truly claim that Fortunata has left me no alternative.\nWith any luck, the next time I write to you, it will be to tell you that Kvatch is safe again. I miss you, Uncle, every day.\nCarolus"}

Carolus' grandfather and Varen's father was a &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; Duke. In his childhood, Carolus was quite close to his uncle, having idolized him. Carolus resided in Kvatch on the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren's Rebellion.\nVaren left the Gold Coast with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Legion\"&gt;Second Legion&lt;/a&gt; during his rebellion against the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;. He built a wall around the Gold Coast, later dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;,\" to protect his home domain from the Empire's troops. Carolus wanted to march with Varen to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but Varen instead instructed Carolus with the defense of Kvatch. Disappointed that he would not be fighting alongside his uncle, Carolus nevertheless accepted.\nShortly after Varen and a majority of the Second Legion departed the Gold Coast, Count &lt;a href=\"Ephrem%20Benirus\"&gt;Ephrem Benirus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; sent troops to seize Varen's holdings. Carolus rallied the troops of the Second Legion whom stayed behind, as well as the Kvatch Vigilants, and briefly fought Anvil's forces. Anvil's troops were now greatly reduced, and retreated to the city.\nAfter Varen successfully took the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; in the final months of &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, Carolus was officially recognized as the &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; of Kvatch, and fashioned the symbolic wolf on the city's banner into his own title, after the city had been cheering him on as the \"Wolf of Kvatch.\" Shortly afterwards however, &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius%20Ponticus\"&gt;Primate Artorius Ponticus&lt;/a&gt; began to challenge Carolus' rule, having ambitions to rule the city by his own hand.\nThe Pirate Queen.\nWith Anvil's forces suffering from heavy casualties and defeats by Carolus' armies, Captain &lt;a href=\"Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; sailed into the port. She and her army of pirates quickly took control of the city, with Fortunata becoming the ruling Provincial Governor. Fortunata then proclaimed that the Gold Coast would become its own separate state from the Empire, and began to pressure Carolus to join her. Carolus refused, swearing loyalty to his uncle.\nAfter Varen's disappearance during the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt;, Fortunata exploited Kvatch's isolation and made her demands more forceful. With Carolus still remaining against the idea of a separate Gold Coast, Fortunata sent bandits and raiders along the roads and farms surrounding Kvatch. The Vigilants of Kvatch were dispatched, but failed to defeat the bandits who had escaped on the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;. They returned in greater numbers, resulting in refugees travelling to Kvatch for safety.\nDespite the violent threats, Carolus refused to negotiate with Fortunata. Infuriated, the Pirate Queen sent out the Anvil Guard to formally annex Kvatch into her vision of the independent Gold Coast. Carolus responded by sending out the Vigilants upon the city's walls and sending a cohort to face Fortunata's armies. The opposing forces met at the &lt;a href=\"Gottshaw%20Inn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gottshaw Inn&lt;/a&gt;, and the cohort managed to scatter the Anvil invaders. However, the situation wasn't as it seemed, turning out to truly be a trap. Fortunata's pirates outnumbered the cohort six to one, with the latter being annihilated by the invaders in what came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Gottshaw%20Massacre\"&gt;Gottshaw Massacre&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith no choice left, Carolus relentlessly agreed to Fortunata's terms. Artorius managed to rise in power as well, establishing a more powerful foothold into Kvatch's politics, with the radicalist Order of the Hour dominating the religious make-up of the city. Carolus in turn became more of a figure-head of Kvatch, with his goals to keep the civilians of Kvatch safe crushed by the opposing leaders' threats.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Signed%20in%20Blood\"&gt;Signed in Blood&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarolus is initially encountered at &lt;a href=\"Jarol%20Estate\"&gt;Jarol Estate&lt;/a&gt;, as his conversation with Fortunata and &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Jarol\"&gt;Quintus Jarol&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Special%20Request\"&gt;A Special Request&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarolus is later met at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Castle Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Marcus%20Scipio\"&gt;Commander Marcus Scipio&lt;/a&gt;, under Fortunata's orders you are instructed to inform Count Carolus. He is found in his room, unexpectedly performing the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt;, before he grew disillusioned with &lt;a href=\"Rada%20al-Saran\"&gt;Rada al-Saran&lt;/a&gt; and his methods to save vampires from the shackles of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nVerandis is fought in &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Council\"&gt;The Gray Council&lt;/a&gt; if he is summoned in &lt;a href=\"Grayhome\"&gt;Grayhome&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn , he acts as a follower during some main story quests.

Baron Montclair asks Verandis to use his vampire powers to turn his wife into a vampire so that she would not die from her illness. Verandis tries to save Baron Montclair's dying wife. However, once she is a vampire, she turns uncontrollable, and has to be killed by Verandis as a result.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Blood-Splattered%20Shield\"&gt;The Blood-Splattered Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nVerandis asks the Vestige to pass on a warning to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Janeve\"&gt;Captain Janeve&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt;'s whereabouts. \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Concealing%20Veil\"&gt;The Concealing Veil&lt;/a&gt;.\nVerandis asks the Vestige to visit &lt;a href=\"Lorkrata%20Hills\"&gt;Lorkrata's Ruins&lt;/a&gt; with him to locate a relic of some kind.\nConversations.\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"You sent the Guard west? To chase a rumor? We need those troops to protect Shornhelm!\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"Only some of them, Baron. My father would have done the same. Captain Janeve will discover the truth and report back.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Countess, Baron, please. We must remain focused. As long as Montclair controls the upper city, the whole region remains at risk.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"How can we trust you, Count Ravenwatch? Your friendship with Montclair is well known. What did you offer those captains to betray us?\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"I care for the Count even less than you, Baron, but he hasn't done anything to warrant such accusations\u2014yet.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"We must end this debate and take action! Make an example of the two traitors and retake the upper city! How can the two of you not see that?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"I do not disagree, Baron, but we need to proceed with caution. There is more to this situation than meets the eye. I know I make you both nervous. Perhaps we should continue this after our blood has cooled.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"Mind your tempers, gentlemen. We have a visitor. Come forward, friend, and state your business.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Bah! You both try my patience. I can almost understand what drove Montclair to abandon our triumvirate.\"\nEat too fast:\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Gwendis, my child, slow down. You eat too fast. You don't want to harm poor Kallin.\"\nGwendis: \"We need to eat to get stronger. When Montclair shows up, I want to be ready!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"That is not our way, child, and you know it. Stop feating. Now!\"\nGwendis: \"Fine. Whatever. I mean, I'm sorry, Count Verandis. You know I only want to help.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Of course, my child. Now, let's clear away our meal and welcome our friend. Kallin, as always, I thank you for sharing your life's blood with us.\"\nKallin: \"I live to pelase, my lord.\"\nGwendis' behavior:\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Adusa, please make sure Gwendis behaves herself. Poor Kallin needs time to recover.\"\nAdusa-daro: \"The little one gets no dessert this evening. Adusa will make sure.\"\nThe first memory:\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"I must say, it's rather strange seeing you as \u2026 me.\"\nLleraya Montclair: \"Mother \u2026 please. You have to take the medicine. Reezal-Jul can help you!\"\nBaroness Leilla Montclair: \"Oh, sweet daughter, I can't go on like this. I don't want to spend my final days as an experiment. Instead, let me spend them with the ones I love.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Even in retrospect, reliving this is difficult. Her pain, her suffering. She had so much courage.\"\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"There has to be something more we can do. Verandis, can I talk to you for a moment?\"\nThe second memory:\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"Three cheers for Verandis! He gave me the means to save my beautiful wife!\"\nBaroness Leila Montclair: \"Yes, to our dear friend, Verandis! How can we ever repay him?\"\nGwendis: \"He is great, isn't he? And so handsome! But I want to cheer about this wine. By the Divines, this stuff is delicious!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"We were so happy at this moment. We were all together, friends and family, enjoying each other's company. For the final time \u2026.\"\nBaroness Leila Montclair: \"Verandis, may I speak to you for a moment? Alone.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"I \u2026 I don't recall speaking with Leila. Why can't I remember that?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"You must do exactly as I taught you. The power of the Remnant will call to you, tempt you. You must be strong enough to withstand that lure.\"\nGwendis: \"I'm ready for this. You know that. Stop treating me like I'm a novice, Verandis. I won't fail you. I won't let you down.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"You have never disappointed me, Gwendis. But the Remnant is more powerful than you can imagine. Be on your guard. Now head inside. I'll join you in a moment.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"This is where it happened. Where Leila died and Montclair \u2026 changed.\"\nGwendis: \"Where are Montclair's forces? I thought for sure we'd have to fight a horde of bloodfiends to make it through this place.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Montclair is a strategist. He's waiting for us to make a mistake that he can take advantage of. I fear tat mistake is about to be made.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Soldiers, spread out! Secure the chamber!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"You should have heeded my warning, Baron. This is no place for you.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"You would deny our moment of glory, Count? The Light shines on us this day!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"There is no light here, Countess. Only darkness and death.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"Arkay protect us! What is that?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Baron Montclair. He's here.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Troops! On my command!\"\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"Welcome, Verandis! And like a good guest, I see you've brought me gifts to play with. Allow me to grant my blessing to your army.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"This is exactly what I feared! He's turned our own troops into bloodfiends!\"\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"\"How does it feel to watch those who you care about turn against you, Verandis? How does it feel?\"\nAfter the battle:\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"My wife \u2026 my daughter \u2026 you've taken everything I ever loved, Verandis!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Wylon, I'm sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen.\"\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"My daughter loved you, Verandis. She loved you!\"\nGwendis: \"\"The Remnant \u2026 the power. It drove Lleraya insane! Are those giant skeletons?\"\nAfter the second battle:\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"You've grown strong, Verandis. Your allies grant you strength.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Come out and face us, you coward! You can't hide from us forever!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Wylon, please. We can find a way to free you from this power.\"\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"To what end, my old friend? My wife is dead. My daughter, killed by your own hand. What do I have, if not this power? I think I'd prefer to let you experience my pain. My suffering. To let you see what it's like to lose everything you hold dear!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"No, Montclair! Stop this madness!\"\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"Come, Gwendis. You look famished. Allow me to prepare you a feast fit for my new queen!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"No, Montclair! Please!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Gwendis? What has he done to you?\"\nGwendis: \"Verandis \u2026 help. Please, help me. Their blood \u2026 smells so good! These restraints. They won't hold me back much longer.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"You must control yourself, Gwendis. We'll find a way to get you out of there. Show yourself, Wylon! Tell me what you want! Damn you Montclair! Answer me! I'm sorry, my friend, but it seems we're going to have to play Montclair's game to free the others.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"The power is dropping! Gwendis, are you all right?\"\nGwendis: \"I \u2026 I did it. I resisted! I didn't feed. Wait, what happened to the nobles? Did \u2026 did I remember wrong?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"They're fine. Merely unconscious. I'm proud of your restraint, Gwendis.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"What's going on in here? Is the Countess all right?\"\nSkordo the Knife: \"Damn it, Darien! Slow down! Wait for me, you long-legged bastard.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"The Baron and the Countess are fine. But you both arrived just in time to move them to safety.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"Take them out? But we just got here. We want to help take down Montclair! Neither of us had a good fight in \u2026 well, it's been at least a couple minutes.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"No, Darien. This battle is not one that you and Skordo can win. Leave Montclair to us.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"But \u2026 but \u2026 oh, very well! But I get to help take down the next would-be world conquerer we come across. Deal?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"As you wish, brave Darien, as you wish. And now, my friend, the time has come to face Montclair.\"\nWhen he arrives:\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Gwendis, what have you done?\"\nGwendis: \"Verandis! What are you doing here?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Who do you think sealed this place, child? I came as soon as my wards were disturbed.\"\nGwendis: \"Verandis, you should have told me about the Gray Council!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"So you know, Gwendis? Come, let us all speak outside.\"\nAfter finishing the quest:\nGwendis: \"So, any other thousand-year-old secrets I should know about?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Do you really want to hear all the sordid details of my past, Gwendis?\""}

They are the descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;, from which the name &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; was adapted, who first landed on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to pave way for the Na-Totambus or &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; after the sinking of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. They were in a civil war with the Crowns over dominance in Hammerfell until they united to drive back and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Forebears are seen as more adaptable and progressive than the Crowns, who are more traditional. Weddings between the two factions are tense due to cultural issues, in part due to either family being ignorant of which allegiance the couple will have.\nThey appear in , where they have temporarily ceased hostilities with &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;The Crowns&lt;/a&gt; due to the threat from &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe Forebears have a different religion than the Crowns do. Their pantheon is largely attributed to the good relations the Forebears had with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, other say that the Forebears adopted the Cyrodiilic gods because of the Second Empire ruling over Hammerfell. Whatever the case, their pantheon is listed below.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally formed from the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Forebears are one of the two militaristic and political powers of Hammerfell. The Forebears first landed in the city of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, which they had conqeured from the native &lt;a href=\"Betmer\"&gt;Betmer&lt;/a&gt; who lived there. Shortly after, the Forebear &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Sword-Singers&lt;/a&gt; started to expand along the coastline, and claimed the city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, which was then occupied by men and elf. Sword-Singing was originally a part of Forebear culture, but started to fade away in later years.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Alliance War, king &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; of the Forebears ruled over Hammerfell. Crown loyalists saw him as a usurper, and said he was guilty of working with the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt;, an order dedicated to slaying the undead if they were to appear in Hammerfell. Due to the Redguards seeing the dead as honored, this somewhat tainted the king's reputation. The decision of King Fahara'jad to join the Covenant, while fiercely supported by the Forebears, was heavily opposed by the Crowns.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt;, the Forebear &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Sulma\"&gt;Magistrate Sulma&lt;/a&gt; had made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to save Bergama from a Withered Hand invasion. In order to defend the city, she had to sacrifice numerous civilians of the city. While the Magistrate disproved of the deal, she performed it out of necessity. Attempting to somewhat limit the damage of the deal, the Magistrate solely used vagrants and criminals for the deal.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, after the death of King &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt;, Hammerfell was plunged into &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. The Forebears were succesful at first, claiming the city of Sentinel in a massacre, which resulted in Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; of the Crowns sailing to the mainland from &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in order to reclaim it, resulting in one of the bloodiest massacres of Tamrielic history. After this defeat, the Crowns started winning the Civil War as they pushed the Forebears back across the deserts of Hammerfell. To avoid getting beaten by the Crowns, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Forebears at the time, signed a pact with &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. In return for the aid of Septim's &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; would be granted some border territory of Hammerfell. Septim sent his Legions to fight the Crowns, crushing their armies, and eventually slaying the Prince during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt;. However, just before the war ended, Baron Volag had dissappeared, which resulted in the Empire creating its own, new, terms for the treaty, which resulted in all of Hammerfell falling to the Empire. However, after a rebellion on &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, and the death of &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;, Tiber Septim discussed the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;, who led the Crown resistance, and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt;, who had come out of hiding.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;, the Forebears asked the Crowns for aid, but were denied. According to the Redguards &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; would have been able to easily stop the Usurper, but they were proven wrong. Only two weeks later word got out that the cities of Rihad and Taneth had been obliterated by the Usurper, who seemed unstoppable. Until the defeat of the usurper, the lands of the Forebears were ravaged by his armies.\nAs a result of the lack of aid for the Forebears during the events of the Camoran Usurper, the Forebears did not answer the Crown's call for aid during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; and half of &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; getting conqeured by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early days of the Fourth Era, Hammerfell had seceded from the Empire, though it was later reclaimed by &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"4E%20168\"&gt;4E 168&lt;/a&gt;, the Crowns and Forebears had been at Civil War again, until the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; took place three years later. Shortly after the war broke out, Forebear and Crown alike lost many cities, as almost every city along the southern coastline was conqeured by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20172\"&gt;4E 172&lt;/a&gt;, only the city of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; still held out. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;4E 173&lt;/a&gt; a rare event occured, where a Forebear army from Sentinel broke the Aldmeri siege on Hegathe, which was a Crown city. Due to this act of kindness, the Crowns and Forebears stood united. At the same time, the city of &lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt; was conqeured by other Aldmeri forces. When the Empire signed the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, Hammerfell saw it as a betrayal and refused to sign the treaty, resulting in the province being renounced and the Empire getting hatred from the Redguards. The Great War in Hammerfell lasted for five more years than in the Empire, as it lasted until &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;. It ended with the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. The Redguards claim that the Dominion could have truly been defeated had they stood united with Hammerfell.\nHoldings.\nThe terrain traditionally held by the Forebears are in the southern parts of the province, where the Ra Gada originally landed. The following are the cities which are associated with the Forebears."}

How the Hero got captured is unknown. During the fight, Tyr saw that the Hero was a good warrior, and they became companions in order to escape the pit. In the process, they fought against a dozen daedric cultists as well as Reive.\nJourney to Laaneth.\nAfter their escape, they journeyed north to meet &lt;a href=\"Laaneth%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Laaneth&lt;/a&gt;, a sorceress friend of Tyr's. Tyr and the Hero were eventually ambushed by bandits, who demanded a toll. After defeating the bandits, they continued on with their journey, until they were halted by Dominion Guards. When they had defeated the guards, they chose to avoid the roads. When they eventually arrived at Laaneth's house, it was crawling with daedric cultists, who had already started transporting Laaneth away north, to use her to help them bring about &lt;a href=\"The%20Culling\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt;.\nSearch for Laaneth.\nIn order to catch up with the cultists, they needed a ship. The Hero and Tyr tried to board one, having it on good authority that the ship was empty. However, the captain of the ship, &lt;a href=\"Swims-at-Night%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Swims-at-Night&lt;/a&gt;, was aboard and put up some resistance. After a Dominion Guard asked what was going on, on the ship, the captain and the Hero realized they had a common enemy. The captain joined the companions and agreed to sail north in search of the sorceress.\nPirates and crash.\nOn the sea, the companions encountered pirates and the daedric cultists, but during a storm the ships crashed onto the shore. Laaneth nowhere to be found and was assumed to have died, either by the crash or by &lt;a href=\"spriggan\"&gt;spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s, who lived close to the crash site. After the companions had beaten the spriggans, they continued their search for Laaneth. They found her, along with some cultists, in an ancient ruin. The Hero and his companions rescued Laaneth from the creatures inhabiting the ruins.\nInforming the Emperor.\nLaaneth had learned that the cult was secretly led by Lord Naarifin. To bring about The Culling, he intended to sacrifice all the inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. In order to reach&lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;the Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and inform him of Naarifin's plot, they had to go to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their arrival in Skyrim they were told by the local &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; where to find the Legion. While the companions were searching for the Legion, a group of Nordic Imperial deserters blocked their way. The deserters were running from &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Cassia\"&gt;Legate Cassia&lt;/a&gt;. When the deserters were beaten, Legate Cassia joined the hero and his companions.\nInfiltrating the Imperial City.\nAfter informing the Emperor of Lord Naarifin's plan, the companions went to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Arena\"&gt;Imperial City Arena&lt;/a&gt;, posing as gladiators in order to infiltrate the city. After their infiltration, they went through crypts until they reached the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Inside Lord Naarifin's study, they learned that Lord Naarifin had used the Orb of Vearmina to track the Imperial army. Lord Naarifin and Reive, however, arrived at the study and the companions had to fight them. Reive had been granted &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the companions.\nAssassination.\nAfter their success in the Imperial City, they went back to the Emperor, who had been attacked by assassins. Too weak to lead the assault himself, the Emperor asked the Hero to wear his armor and go in his stead. In the Emperor's armor, nobody would realise that it wasn't the Emperor who was fighting.\nThe Battle of Red Ring.\nFree from prying eyes, the Legion launched a surprise attack from the west, followed by a similar attack from &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero would then lead the charge to the city gates. Lord Naarifin, however, had already started the Culling. The Hero and his companions had to fight Naarifin and his minions. They were successful in disrupting the Culling and retaking the Imperial City.\nGallery.\nThere is also some unused avatars."}

Travel there, and they'll find a shipwreck called Emma May populated by &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wraiths&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Log%20of%20the%20Emma%20May\"&gt;The ship's log&lt;/a&gt; details a mutiny, during which Blakeley was locked in the hold. The ship was then dashed on the rocks, causing the loss of all hands.\nThe Traitor.\nOn the bottom deck of the Emma May, a purple wraith by the name of Gable the Traitor with a powerful &lt;a href=\"Burden%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Burden&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Drain%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Drain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; touch spell is found. The simplest way to defeat Gable is to lure him outside and use &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic on him as he moves slowly, and does not cast distance spells.\nDefeating him allows the Hero to unlock the brig with a key found on the wraith's corpse, and to free the Forlorn Watchman from his bonds. He will then appear, and give them a map to a sunken chest containing treasure as a reward for freeing his spirit.\nTreasure.\nThe treasure is at the bottom of the river just southwest of the docked boat near &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dog%20Camp\"&gt;Black Dog Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The chest contains level-dependent gold, gems, and some &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted items&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; is sent to kill former Mages Guild student &lt;a href=\"Baltham%20Greyman\"&gt;Baltham Greyman&lt;/a&gt;, a man who \"lacked the loyalty\" needed to remain with the Guild.\nThis quest is the first in a three-part storyline dealing with the Grayman and his lust for magical knowledge. \"The Former Student,\" unlike most of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20K%27avar\"&gt;Lord K'avar&lt;/a&gt;'s quests, is still only included in the of \"Daggerfall\".\nBackground.\nAfter completing several mundane tasks for the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and improved their magical skills, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; will be accepted as a member of the Guild. &lt;a href=\"Guildmagister\"&gt;Guildmagister&lt;/a&gt;s will therefore begin to offer the Agent more difficult tasks, rewarding them with random &lt;a href=\"items%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; or and a boost to their reputation, meaning they can climb further through the Guild's ranks.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen speaking with a &lt;a href=\"Guildmagister\"&gt;Guildmagister&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; will be asked if they are a \"loyal member of the Mages Guild\". If the Agent believes that they are, the then Guildmagister will reveal that a not-so loyal member of the Guild, a former protege named &lt;a href=\"Baltham%20Greyman\"&gt;Baltham Greyman&lt;/a&gt;, has been conducting some \"unsanctioned\" research in a nearby town. The Agent is duly sent to kill the traitorous Mage.\nA Question of Loyalty.\nThe Agent is sent to the town that Greyman has most recently been seen in, although they will have to ask around the locals to find where the ex-Guild mage is staying. Once found, Greyman will make a short speech, questioning why the Agent wishes to work for the Guild with \"blind obedience\". He offers the Agent a choice: Fight him; or join him.\nDefeating Temptation.\nRefusing the offer will see Greyman replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, who will attack the Agent relentlessly. If the Agent fails to kill Greyman quickly, the latter will teleport outside of the building, with the Agent needing to chase them outside. Another fight ensues, although this time Greyman will utter when first struck:\nRejecting the second offer leads to another fight, where Greyman will teleport away if not killed in a small amount of time. Another pattern of offer-rejection-fight follows, before a fifth and final offer is made by the desperate mage:\nRejecting the final offer means that Greyman will fight to the death, making it ultimately possible to kill the mage. Once the rogue mage lies dead, the Agent must return to the Guildmagister before the time limit expires.\nAn Alternative Path.\nAccepting anyone of Greyman's five offers will end the fight prematurely, with the rogue mage immediately making clear that they have future plans for the Agent. Greyman will also hand them a &lt;a href=\"Baltham%20Greyman%27s%20Letter\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to hand to the Guildmagister, which should convince the Guild that Greyman has disappeared. Greyman will then make his escape, leaving the Agent to return to the Guildmagister with the letter.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; from the Guildmagister for their efforts, alongside the boost to their &lt;a href=\"reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; within the Guild, regardless of whether the Agent killed Greyman or not. The penalties for failing the quest are relatively high by comparison, but will also see gains among some anti-Mage Guild factions:"}
{"id": "54584", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=54584", "title": "The Forsworn Conspiracy", "text": "The Forsworn Conspiracy is a &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; available in in which the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must assist &lt;a href=\"Eltrys\"&gt;Eltrys&lt;/a&gt; in investigating a conspiracy in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; involving the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20family\"&gt;Silver-Bloods&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"I've received a note from a man named Eltrys in Markarth. He wants me to meet him at the Shrine of Talos, presumably to talk about the recent murder in Markarth's marketplace.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon first entering Markarth, the Dragonborn is witness to an argument in the market. After a man called Weylin shouts, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;!\", he attempts to kill a woman named &lt;a href=\"Margret\"&gt;Margret&lt;/a&gt;. The failure or success of his attempt depends on whether the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; intervenes before he gets close enough to trigger the animation of him stabbing Margret in the back with his dagger. At the moment that the attacker draws his weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Markarth City Guard&lt;/a&gt;s rush towards the attacker and slay him. Afterward, a man named &lt;a href=\"Eltrys\"&gt;Eltrys&lt;/a&gt; approaches the Dragonborn and hands the Dragonborn a note asking to meet him in the Shrine of Talos.\nIt is possible to save Margret in the market. There is no significant difference to the plot between saving Margret or allowing Weylin to kill her, although if Margret is saved, she rewards the Dragonborn with a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Emerald%20Necklace\"&gt;silver emerald necklace&lt;/a&gt;. The way of gathering information about Margret changes, as do some dialogues, but the rest of the quest remains the same.\nGo to the Shrine of Talos.\nAt the Shrine of Talos, Eltrys explains that his father was killed by the Forsworn and that he has been trying his whole life to find out why. He asks the Dragonborn to investigate Margret's background at the Silver-Blood Inn and Weylin's room in the Warrens.\nSilver-Blood Inn \u2013 Margret's room.\nIf Margret is dead, and the Dragonborn obtained Margret's room key from her body, the room can be approached directly. Otherwise the Dragonborn must ask the barkeeper Kleppr about Margret. The Dragonborn can also speak to his &lt;a href=\"Hroki\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt;, rent the room for 10 gold, bribe, intimidate, persuade, or pickpocket Kleppr to get the key. The key is not strictly necessary, since the lock can be picked. \"&lt;a href=\"Margret%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Margret's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" is inside her room in the end table next to the bed. Reading it will update the quest log. The journal mentions Thonar Silver-Blood, and the next objective becomes \"Find evidence about Thonar.\"\nIf Margret is alive, she will be seated by the fireplace. She can be persuaded or intimidated, revealing that she is an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; investigator for &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;. She mentions Thonar Silver-Blood, which also activates the objective, \"Find evidence about Thonar.\"\nAfter exiting the inn, a guard will approach the Dragonborn and warn them to \"stay out of [their] business, or there will be trouble.\" Once the dialogue ends, proceed to the Warrens next.\nThe Warrens \u2013 Weylin's room.\nHead down to the Warrens, and talk to &lt;a href=\"Garvey\"&gt;Garvey&lt;/a&gt;. Garvey can be bribed, intimidated, pickpocketed, or persuaded to hand the key over. As with Margret's room at the Silver-Blood Inn, the lock on Weylin's door can be picked. Weylin's room is the last one on the right side. Look into the chest and find \"&lt;a href=\"Weylin%27s%20Note\"&gt;Weylin's Note&lt;/a&gt;\" signed with the letter \"N.\" The Dragonborn will have to find out who this mysterious \"N\" is. When the Dragonborn exits the Warrens, &lt;a href=\"Dryston\"&gt;Dryston&lt;/a&gt;, a mercenary, will approach stating that the investigation has gone too far into somebody's business. There is no option to avoid the brawl; defeat Dryston, and he confesses that he was sent by &lt;a href=\"Nepos%20the%20Nose\"&gt;Nepos the Nose&lt;/a&gt;, or \"N.\" The quest log updates to finding evidence about Nepos.\nIf the Dragonborn is wearing any sort of enchanted armor that does proximity damage (such as the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt;), it will cause the guards to attack. Another option is to lose the brawl. Dryston will go to Weylin's room and sit in a chair. With decent sneaking, the Dragonborn can kill him without alarming the Markarth guards. He will drop \"&lt;a href=\"Dryston%27s%20Note\"&gt;Dryston's Note&lt;/a&gt;\", which will update the quest log when it is read. The note can also be pickpocketed if the Dragonborn would rather not kill Dryston.\nUpon returning to Eltrys, the Dragonborn will receive level-dependent amount of gold for both investigating Margret's and Weylin's rooms. If evidence is discovered about Nepos or Thonar before receiving the reward, the next quest stage will be triggered without receiving the reward.\nFind evidence about Thonar.\nThonar is located in the Treasury House. Talk to &lt;a href=\"Rhiada\"&gt;Rhiada&lt;/a&gt;, and learn that Thonar does not want to be disturbed; although, she can be convinced with persuasion, a bribe, or intimidation. The door can also be opened by &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;picking the lock&lt;/a&gt;. His room is to the left and then straight ahead. Once inside, Thonar is sitting at the table. He will say something about not wanting visitors. Regardless of the response, he will tell the Dragonborn to get out. As soon as the conversation is finished, there is a commotion outside in the main room. Thonar gets up and runs down the hall where there is fighting going on. &lt;a href=\"Betrid%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thonar's wife&lt;/a&gt; is murdered by &lt;a href=\"Nana%20Ildene\"&gt;Nana Ildene&lt;/a&gt;, at which point &lt;a href=\"Donnel\"&gt;Donnel&lt;/a&gt; will join in the attack. Nana and Donnel are actually undercover Forsworn agents, so it is safe to kill them. At this point, talk to Thonar, and he will reveal the truth about &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt; while seething in fury at the Forsworn murdering Betrid when he had an agreement with Madanach.\nAnother approach involves pickpocketing Thonar's Journal from him, so his wife does not die, and Donnel and Nana Ildene do not attack anyone. The Dragonborn has to avoid any conversation with Thonar, as this triggers the attack. If the Dragonborn speaks to Thonar, it is not possible to save his wife; her death is scripted. Even if both Forsworn attackers are dead, she is still murdered, even though there was no one to kill her. If the Dragonborn has a high bounty, Betrid Silver-Blood and other characters will become hostile towards the Dragonborn, but this can be fixed with a basic calm spell. The Dragonborn can bribe one of the guards to remove the bounty by being part of the Thieves Guild or having the speech ability to bribe guards.\nFinding evidence about Nepos.\nFind evidence about Nepos by going to Nepos' house. There the Dragonborn will be greeted by a woman named &lt;a href=\"Uaile\"&gt;Uaile&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0telling them to go away; however, Nepos quickly calls from the background and tells her to let the Dragonborn pass. Talk to Nepos and he will reveal the existence of the Forsworn in Markarth, his involvement with the Forsworn and that he does not plan to let the Dragonborn leave the house alive. Make sure to exhaust all dialogue options about Madanach and his plan. After the conversation with Nepos, everyone in the house attacks the Dragonborn.\nAn alternative, more silent and safe way, is to quickly pickpocket Nepos' Journal from Nepos (instead of talking to him), and then run outside. If done correctly (without being seen at all after pickpocketing the journal) no one will attack the Dragonborn.\nNote that there is some reasonable loot available in Nepos' house, especially in the bedroom on the right (for example, there are at least five &lt;a href=\"silver%20ingot\"&gt;silver ingot&lt;/a&gt;s). The residents also have good loot on them to either take after killing them or to pickpocket. Lingering too long after the theft here will result in everyone becoming hostile.\nReturn to Eltrys.\nReturn to the Shrine of Talos to meet Eltrys, and find three guards standing over Eltrys' body. One guard says the Dragonborn has caused a lot of trouble and a lot of work for them. He informs them that they will pin all the murders and troubles made on the Dragonborn. At this point, the Dragonborn can choose to go quietly or resist arrest. Fighting them will not prevent the next quest, \"&lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;No One Escapes Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;,\" with the exception of attacking them before any conversation takes place and killing all of them. At this point, the questline will not proceed until the Dragonborn speaks with a Markarth guard. Despite a message saying that the last witness was killed and the bounty removed, any Markarth guard that the Dragonborn talks to will arrest them and throw them into Cidhna Mine. Usual Thieves Guild options for buying one's way out are presented in dialogue with the guard, but the guard will refuse them."}

The &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; built this fortress into the side of a mountain so as to have an impregnable base, from whence columns of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Legionnaires&lt;/a&gt; could be sent out to patrol the borders. The location offered elevation and good source of stone to build the walls of the outside fortress. The result was a large bastion with defensive walls, towers, and a subterranean series of halls, rooms, and dungeons built into the bowels of the mountain. It is said that the Legionnaires outfitted their fortress with many traps of cunning and clever design, to defend themselves should the walls ever be breached.\nFort Sphinxmoth was abandoned by the Legions after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, then was traded back and forth for a generation between warring &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmeri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; tribes, suffering additional damage every time it changed hands. Finally a landslide destroyed much of the upper works, and the fort was vacated by both sides. Word of mouth says that nothing worth looting was left in Fort Sphinxmoth, and today it's no more than an overgrown ruin that's been bypassed by history."}

This you certainly know! But in the interest of understanding the magnitude of this accomplishment, you must first understand the man who brought it to fruition.\nZantonius was born the eldest son of a &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; farmer from &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. After her tragic death, Zantonius took a commanding role in his family. Despite these humble upbringings, he was always the bright and cheerful man you may know today!\nAs Zantonius' younger siblings came into adulthood, he tired of his life as a farmer. He soon set out to make a name for himself, traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and enlisting in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nZantonius' rise in the legion's ranks was swift. His commanders said he was strong as a bear and swift as a fox. Eventually Zantonius was assigned a post in northern &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, where he would prove he had a tactical mind matching the greatest generals of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;!\nOne dark night in the month of Second Seed, while Zantonius stood ever-vigilant watch in Reman's Bluff, he single-handedly stopped a &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Orc\"&gt;Wood Orc&lt;/a&gt; raid upon his camp! For his merits in battle, Zantonius was given command of a cohort of soldiers and sent to build a fort for the glory of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. At the head of these troops, Zantonius marched south into the Kingdom of Grahtwood.\nIt was the beautiful plot of land at the southernwestern tip of Grahtwood where Zantonius thrust the point of his spear into the soil. \"From this day forward, I declare this land to be known as Southpoint. Though sent to build a stronghold of Imperial might, I will instead built a fortified town! All in the Kingdom of Grahtwood will know Southpoint's name.\"\nCan anyone doubt Governor Zantonius' word? He has given the citizens of Southpoint strong walls, swift response to &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; insurrectionists, and a port that sees far more ships than the backwater trading post of Haven. Next month, Governor Zantonius shall break ground on what will one day become the greatest cathedral in Valenwood!\nWhy, every citizen of Southpoint owes Governor Zantonius for their safety, security, and prosperity! We shall support him in his rightful stewardship of Southpoint, his valiant efforts to make Southpoint the center of Imperial culture in Valenwood, and the increase in taxes which shall take effect at month's end. Though we owe so much to Governor Zantonius for our town, all he asks in return is our loyalty, our comity, and one gold for every twelve earned.\nFor the Empire!"}

They went to the very best tailors, shared the same tutors, played in the same exclusive company. When his mother died, and his father discovered that the money they had been living on was based on a thief's salary, he suddenly found himself on a very different kind of society, one that he had been ill-equipped to deal with. They were poor.\nOin eventually learned to make a living at the only skill he seemed to be well-suited for: gardening. In time, he had grown an impressive garden of willow anther, gold kanet, chokeweed, white bloatroot, and trama shrubs. He had also grown himself into a remarkably uninteresting man\u2014aside from his gardening, he had little to say for himself. Unlearned, uncharismatic, unathletic, uncoordinated. And yet he yearned. Specifically, he yearned for a girl he had known before all his trouble, a sweet thing with curly locks and a joyous laugh named &lt;a href=\"Benitah%20Gorgoth\"&gt;Benitah Gorgoth&lt;/a&gt;. Once when at play he had pushed a bully away who was trying to hurt her, and the look of appreciation she gave him was enough to make all his days since then worth their while.\nAs he tended his garden one springtide, not very many years ago, he heard some people talking through the thick tall &lt;a href=\"trama\"&gt;trama&lt;/a&gt; shrubs about the marriage of Sedura &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Pavflek%20Mamoona\"&gt;Indoril Pavflek Mamoona&lt;/a&gt;, one of the wealthiest and most respected nobles in Gnisis, and Serjo Benitah Gorgoth. His heart fell. She had found another, a mere nine years since she had given him that look while at play.\nAs spring turned into summer and summer into fall, Oin began to sell his herbs, including some to Kena Yakin Bael, a prominent &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; in town. He had been a tutor to both Benitah and Oin, and told the young man that the lady's husband was not very well. Oin held back his happiness and continued on his errands.\nNot long afterwards, Sedura Indoril Pavflek Mamoona fell ill and died, despite all the skills of the great healers, including Yakin Bael. When Oin came to deliver the herbs that day, he said, \"If you are still in communication with Benitah, please give her my sympathies.\"\n\"'Nchow,\" said Yakin. \"If I could get a word in with all her counselors. They are trying to find her a new husband, and she has made it clear that she will only marry the strongest man in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Who is that?\" asked Oin.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Horath%20the%20Strong\"&gt;Horath the Strong&lt;/a&gt;,\" replied Yakin. \"It is said that he can lift a wagon with but his forefinger and thumb.\"\n\"You can teach me a spell that will &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Attribute%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;fortify&lt;/a&gt; my own &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Oin. \"I beg you to teach it to me now.\"\n\"Very well,\" replied Yakin. \"But in return, I want your next season's worth of trama root, all to myself.\"\nOin agreed, and Yakin taught him the spell to fortify his strength. It took him some time to master it, visualizing magicka streaming through his body, pumping through the very fibers of his muscles for a time, giving him strength far beyond the puny power nature had intended. When Oin met Horath on the street of Gnisis, he cast the spell and challenged him to a duel of strength.\n\"I am Horath the Strong,\" said Horath the Strong, predictably, \"Witness as I lift this wagon with but my thumb and forefinger.\" And he did so.\n\"I am Nimlom the Mighty,\" said Oin, taking some artistic liberty. \"Witness as I lift the stable that houses your wagon with but my forefinger.\" And he too did so.\nThe word went out quickly throughout Morrowind: the strongest man alive was in the province. Oin went to visit his friend, Yakin Bael.\n\"Her lady Benitah has heard of the strength of Nimlom the Mighty, and has said that she was mistaken. She was not looking for a man of strength to marry, but a man of &lt;a href=\"intelligence%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, a great scholar. The greatest in all Morrowind.\"\n\"Who is that?\" asked Oin.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Kena%20Warfel%20Tomasin\"&gt;Kena Warfel Tomasin&lt;/a&gt;,\" replied Yakin. \"It is said that he can best any man or woman in a battle of wits.\"\n\"You can teach me a spell that will fortify my own intelligence,\" said Oin. \"I beg you to teach it to me now.\"\n\"Very well,\" replied Yakin. \"But in return, I want your next season's worth of white bloatroot, all to myself.\"\nOin agreed and for the next couple of weeks, Yakin taught him the spell and trained him in its use. He taught him how to entrench his mind for the sudden assault of awareness and aptitude that would assail it, how to give himself to the sudden thoughts and theorems that would invade his consciousness. When he met Warfel Tomasin in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, he cast his spell and gave the challenge.\n\"I am Kena Warfel Tomasin, and I can prove that &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; are one,\" said Warfel, writing out the mathematical formula that showed it was so.\n\"I am Kena Zombel Mokafa, and I can prove that you do not exist,\" said Oin. He wrote out the mathematical formula, which proved correct, and Kena Warfel Tomasin vaporized on the spot.\nThe word went out quickly throughout Morrowind: the most intelligent man alive was in the province. Oin went to visit his friend, Yakin Bael.\n\"Her lady Benitah has heard of the intelligence of Kena Zombel Mokafa, and has said that she was mistaken. She was not looking for a man of intelligence to marry, but a man of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;endurance&lt;/a&gt;, a rock. The greatest in all Morrowind.\"\n\"Who is that?\" asked Oin.\n\"I would say, Master &lt;a href=\"Combova\"&gt;Combova&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Yakin. \"They say he can stand in blue flames for twenty minutes.\"\n\"You can teach me a spell that will fortify my own endurance,\" said Oin. \"I beg you to teach it to me now.\"\n\"Very well,\" replied Yakin. \"But in return, I want your next season's worth of &lt;a href=\"chokeweed\"&gt;chokeweed&lt;/a&gt;, all to myself.\"\nOin agreed, and for the next several weeks, he learned the spell to make his endurance like that of the oldest stone. He learned how to shrug off the effects of frost, poison, fire, and charges of lightning, pulling the pain into a reservoir of magicka and expelling it. The lesson learned, he came across Master Combova at the &lt;a href=\"Madach%20Tradehouse\"&gt;Madach Tradehouse&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"My name is Master Combova,\" said the fellow, nudging the witch next to him. \"Kena Leles, cast a ball of blue flame for me.\" And he sat in the inferno of flame for twenty minutes before he left.\n\"Master Combova, my name is Master Vomph,\" said Oin. \"Kena Leles, cast a ball of blue flames for me.\" Oin sat in the inferno of blue fire for very nearly an hour before he left.\nThe word went out quickly throughout Morrowind: the toughest man alive was in the province. Oin went to visit his friend, Yakin Bael.\n\"Her lady Benitah has heard of the endurance of Master Vomph,\" he said, not entirely approving of Oin's latest sobriquet, \"And has said that she was mistaken. She was not looking for a man of endurance to marry, but a man of &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt;, a nimble acrobat. The greatest in all Morrowind.\"\n\"Who is that?\" asked Oin.\n\"I would say, &lt;a href=\"Funcrazot%20Priif\"&gt;Funcrazot Priif&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Yakin. \"They say he is the greatest shield-blocker and pickpocket in Morrowind.\"\n\"You can teach me a spell that will fortify my own agility,\" said Oin. \"I beg you to teach it to me now.\"\n\"Very well,\" replied Yakin. \"But in return, I want your next season's worth of &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Kanet\"&gt;gold kanet&lt;/a&gt;, all to myself.\"\nOin agreed, and Yakin taught him the spell that would fire his impulses with magicka. Over several weeks, he learned how to supplant his own natural energy with the spell's, how to view the world at the slower pace a man with advanced agility sees. In time, Oin came upon Funcrazot in a field outside the city, doing his regular exercises. Oin cast his spell and approached the acrobat.\n\"Ah, behold the power of the amazing Funcrazot Priif,\" said the afore-mentioned, and prompted his sparring partner to attack him with his sword. He blocked the blows effortlessly with a shield for ten minutes, and then revealed afterwards that he had picketpocketed the young man's purse.\n\"Very impressive, Ser Priif. Now, behold the power of the remarkable Gazouf Mough,\" said Oin, and prompted Priif's sparring partner to attack him with his sword. After twenty minutes of blocking the man's blows with his shield, he revealed that he had pickpocketed Funcrazot Priif's purse.\nThe word went out quickly throughout Morrowind: the most agile man alive was in the province. Oin went to visit his friend, Yakin Bael. The door was closed this time and he heard voices within.\n\"Have you heard about the remarkable Gazouf Mough?\" Yakin Bael was asking. \"He sounds like a very promising suitor.\"\n\"The truth is, kena, that I have no more interest in him that I had in Nimlom the Mighty, Kena Zombel Mokafa, or Master Vomph,\" replied a feminine voice that seemed familiar to Oin. \"I will have to invent a new test for suitors, while I search for my true love.\"\n\"You don't wish to marry the strongest, most intelligent, toughest, most agile suitors?\" asked the old Healer.\n\"No, not at all,\" said the woman. \"I had to make some kind of test to rebuff the advances of so many men interested in my money and the money of my late husband. The truth is that I've never forgotten the young boy who was so kind to me when I was a little girl, and so brave fighting off the bullies. His name was &lt;a href=\"Oin%20Parnafacasis\"&gt;Oin Parnafacasis&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOin burst into the room and was reunited with Benitah. They were married at once. A week later, he returned to &lt;a href=\"Yakin%20Bael\"&gt;Yakin Bael&lt;/a&gt; and learned how to fortify his personality in exchange for next season's worth of &lt;a href=\"willow%20anther\"&gt;willow anther&lt;/a&gt;. Then they lived happily ever after."}

How did this occur and what should the Dominion do about it? Allow me to provide a few pertinent observations.\nEarlier that same year, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; legalized the worship of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; throughout the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Empire of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, which immediately sparked a rebellion. As &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; began his own push to take control of the Empire, Euraxia Tharn was sent on a diplomatic mission to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Taking advantage of the confusion, she hired a massive force of &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries and marched into Rimmen as a welcomed ally. As part of the Empire, &lt;a href=\"King%20Hemakar\"&gt;King Hemakar&lt;/a&gt; of Rimmen did not think twice about accepting an envoy of the Emperor. That turned out to be a deadly mistake.\nEuraxia had King Hemakar and the rest of the Royal Family executed and declared herself Queen of Rimmen. Her mercenaries, now wearing the livery of Euraxians, spread out and quickly conquered all of Northern Elsweyr, claiming the territory from &lt;a href=\"Riverhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt; to Rimmen. Once in power, Euraxia worked quickly to consolidate her position. She hired additional mercenaries, acquired the services of a cult of &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, and established a perimeter of siege weapons to maintain her hold over Rimmen. The &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; people have not fared well under Euraxian rule. In every meaning of the word, her reign has been nothing short of tyrannical.\nOnce the dust settled and what was happening became clear, the Khajiit formed a militia to combat the Euraxians and attempt to reclaim Anequina. When Queen Ayrenn established the alliance and formed the Dominion, she promised the Khajiiti people that they would have her support in regaining control of Northern Elsweyr. However, before any forces could be mustered in that regard, the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; broke out. Except for a handful of military advisors and some much-needed gold, the Khajiiti Defense Force has been primarily on its own. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gharesh-ri\"&gt;Lord Gharesh-ri&lt;/a&gt;, Speaker of the Mane, traveled to Anequina to take command of the militia, and under his guidance they are close to liberating the town of Riverhold and most of the territory beyond the walls of Rimmen.\nUnfortunately, Rimmen remains a bastion for Euraxia, primarily due to the siege weapons that ring the palace and are aimed directly into the city below. Her threat, which Gharesh-ri has no reason to doubt, is that she will destroy the city if her rule there is challenged in any way. Until those siege weapons are dealt with, I expect Euraxia will maintain hold of the Rimmen throne.\nWhile the Three Banners War rages on, Dominion forces cannot be diverted to deal with the tyrant the Khajiit call the Usurper Queen. We must hope that by providing funds and advisors, the Khajiiti militia can hold out until the alliance conflict comes to an end. Otherwise, the Dominion may wind up facing a threat from within its own borders once the war against the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; ends."}

It is located a very short distance to the north-northwest of the regular entrance. However, the Hero will have to walk back to the \"proper\" exit (the one entered through), because there is a rock wall that cannot be opened from the inside of the cavern, only from the main entrance.

Instead, he was forced into a protracted siege.\nThe long siege dragged on into spring, when the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a mutual defense pact, sworn by all the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms at the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20Invasion\"&gt;Reachmen Invasion&lt;/a&gt;\u2014finally paid dividends, drawing &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; into the fray. Some counseled letting Wayrest fall, but trade with the richest city in the region was too important to allow that. Attacked from the city and the surrounding countryside, Ranser's army stood firm; his mercenaries were well paid and prepared for bloodshed. But the crimson sails and battalions of elite Redguard warriors from across the bay turned the tide. Ranser's forces were routed, and Shornhelm was already ablaze when Ranser returned. This was the work of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; under the blood-rule of &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaught between the Breton hammer and the Orcish anvil, Ranser's troops were utterly annihilated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;. Ranser hadn't counted on Emeric's canniness; the King of Wayrest had sent emissaries into the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgar Mountains&lt;/a&gt; with a pledge to return &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; to the Orcs if they attacked their hated enemy in Shornhelm. Rivenspire was despoiled, and some Orcs remembered how the Bretons of Shornhelm had led the assault that toppled Orsinium some 135 years before. These debts were paid to Shornhelm in full. Ranser's War built the Daggerfall Covenant as it is today: &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, Rivenspire, and &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; are all indelibly marked by these events."}

Now to read it and learn more of Miraak's knowledge.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest begins after retrieving the \"\" from &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt; with Neloth in the previous quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;The Path of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReading the Black Book in the Nchardak Reading Room will bring the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reading the book, Neloth parts with \"\"Oh good. Be sure to say hello to &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; for me if you see him.\"\"\nOnce in Apocrypha, if not having entered beforehand via one of the other &lt;a href=\"Black%20Books\"&gt;Black Books&lt;/a&gt; found around Solstheim, Mora will appear to speak to the Dragonborn, welcoming them to his realm, and explain how to leave if they choose to do so. The dialogue will vary depending on if \"&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed beforehand. After he departs, activating the scrye will unroll a bridge to an oscillating tunnel. At the other end of the tunnel, the platform against the north wall can be reached. Activating the scrye in that platform causes the bridge leading west to unroll. Stepping back onto the moving tunnel allows the Dragonborn to access the bridge, which leads to a platform on the west edge of the room containing a large book. The book acts as a door to Chapter II.\nChapter II.\nActivating the scrye at the north end of the tunnel unfolds the tunnel to reveal a larger room where &lt;a href=\"seeker\"&gt;seeker&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"Lurker\"&gt;Lurker&lt;/a&gt; will attack. Once they have been defeated or avoided, another scrye on the east side of the room under a &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;Font of Magicka&lt;/a&gt; can be activated. It opens the gate across the room on the west side, which leads up steps to Chapter III.\nChapter III.\nThe pathway leads around and up the several sets of stairs, with Seekers along the way. Another Font of Magicka is at the top. After stepping into the oscillating tunnel, a scrye is found that, when activated, opens the gate ahead. A Seeker is at the south end, and then the tunnel turns left (east). This end of the tunnel also oscillates, but can be exited via an unrolling bridge with a Lurker at the other side. Continuing north leads to another oscillating tunnel that exits onto a platform with another scrye. Upon activating it, a gate ahead opens to a circular room with a pool in the middle that contains a whipping tentacle. Continuing on to the south, more Seekers can be found. Chapter IV is at the end of the tunnel.\nChapter IV.\nActivating the scrye in the initial platform unfolds a large housing chamber where the Epistolary Acumen is held. After opening the book, Hermaeus Mora himself will appear in front of the Dragonborn as a mass of eyeballs and tentacles, and greets them:\n\"Well done, my champion. Your journey towards enlightenment has finally led you here, to my realm, as I knew it would.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nWhat do you want of me this time? \"You have entered my realm. You have sought out the forbidden knowledge that only one other has obtained. You are Dragonborn, like Miraak before you. A seeker of knowledge and power.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nWhat do you want of me, my lord? \"Your progress since obtaining my Oghma Infinium has been rapid. And now, I find you here, following in my servant Miraak's footsteps. You also are Dragonborn. You also seek to learn how to bend the world to your will.\"\nIf the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;\" has not yet been completed and the \"&lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt;\" is not read, Hermaeus Mora will instead introduce himself:\n\"All seekers of knowledge come to my realm, sooner or later.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nYes, I came here to learn Miraak's secrets. \"\"All that he knows he learned from me.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nI won't serve you, monster. I just want to defeat Miraak. \"You will serve me, willing or not. All who seek after the secrets of the world are my servants.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nI don't need your help. I'll learn Miraak's secrets on my own. \"No. Look around. You have done nothing here on your own. You could spend a hundred lifetimes searching my library, and you will never find what you seek.\"\nTell me what you want my lord, and I will bring it to you. \"You please me champion. Your loyalty will be richly rewarded. The Skaal have withheld their secrets from me for many long years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my library.\"\nReturn to Solstheim.\nWith his parting line, Hermaeus Mora will disappear, for now, and three glowing orbs will appear from the Epistolary Acumen. Activating any of these orbs will present the choice to choose an ability:\nOnce a reward has been selected, read the book again to return to Nchardak. Neloth will approach and ask:\n\"What happened? What did you see? Different people have very different experiences when reading these books.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nI talked to Hermaeus Mora. \"You're still acting surprisingly sane, too. What did he have to say? He must have wanted something from you.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nI learned the second Word of the Bend Will shout. \"No wonder the Dwemer were so interested in that book. It was indeed one that Miraak used to advance his power as Dragonborn. But I assume there's some bad news? It would be unlike Hermaeus Mora to allow anyone to gain such knowledge without exacting a price.\"\nAlternatively, should the Dragonborn die within Apocrypha before interacting with Hermaeus Mora, this option is presented instead:\nI found myself in another place. \"\"That's a fairly common experience, at least for those who remain coherent enough to report what they've seen. You were in Apocrypha. Or at least your consciousness was - your body remained here of course. You should read the book again until you reach what appears to be the \"end\" - then you will have fully understood the knowledge it contains.\"\"\nMiraak's Ambush.\nUpon exiting Nchardak, Miraak has sent a Dragon named &lt;a href=\"Krosulhah\"&gt;Krosulhah&lt;/a&gt; to attack. He hovers above the ruins and bellows:\" \"Miraak has commanded your death. So it shall be.\"\" before attacking. After he is defeated, it is possible that, instead of the Dragonborn absorbing the Dragon Soul, a spectral image of Miraak appears. He says, \"Did you ever think of the pain? Of having your soul ripped like that?\", then absorbs the soul himself before leaving. The quest continues at the &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt; by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Storn%20Crag-Strider\"&gt;Storn Crag-Strider&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecrets of the Skaal.\nStorn can be found meditating outside his hut. If \"&lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20the%20Stones\"&gt;Cleansing the Stones&lt;/a&gt;\" has not been completed, Storn will ask the Dragonborn to cleanse Solstheim while he thinks on his course of action. Otherwise, he can be asked about the secrets of the Skaal.\nI spoke to Hermaeus Mora. He asked for the \"secrets of the Skaal.\" \"Hermaeus Mora... old Herma-Mora himself. So he is the source of Miraak's power. Of course. We have many tales of Herma-Mora trying to trick us into giving up our secrets to him. And now he comes again for what we have long kept from him.\"\nHe can also be asked exactly what these secrets are. He replies by explaining they are ancient lore, handed down from shaman to shaman since ancient times. They are how the Skaal \"talk to the wind\" and \"listen to the earth\".\nHe explains the only reason Hermaeus Mora wants this knowledge is because it is in his nature to hoard secrets to himself. Their value to him is of no consequence to him, and the fact that the Skaal have kept knowledge from him has only increased his desire to have it.\nAfter a discussion of the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt;, Storn will take the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Frea\"&gt;Frea&lt;/a&gt; will plea with him not to go ahead.\nFrea: \"\"Father, you must not do this. That book is... wrong. Evil. Against everything that you have taught me my whole life.\"Storn: \"\"I must, Frea. It is the only way to free Solstheim forever from Miraak's shadow. There comes a time when everything must change. Nothing that lives remains the same forever. Do not fear for me my daughter. This is the destiny that the All-Maker has laid out for me.\"Frea: \"\"I stand beside you, father, as always.\"Storn: \"I am ready for whatever their foul master of this book has in store for me.\"\nHe will then open the book and begin to read it. Suddenly the book will begin to float and tentacles will appear from the pages and impale Storn. Hermaeus Mora appears as a mass of floating tentacles and gloats:\nHermaeus Mora: \"\"At last, the Skaal yield up their secrets to me.\"Storn: \"\"You... liar... gah! ... I won't... not... for you...\"Frea: \"\"Do something!\"Hermaeus Mora: \"\"Dragonborn, you have delievered me the gift I requested. In return, I keep my promise, as befits a Prince of Oblivion: I give you the Word of Power that you need to challenge Miraak. You will be either a worthy opponent or his successor, as the tides of fate decree.\"Storn: \"Nooo...\"\nAs Storn is killed, the final word of &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; is learned. This quest is completed, and the next, \"&lt;a href=\"At%20the%20Summit%20of%20Apocrypha\"&gt;At the Summit of Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;\", begins. Frea will rush to her father's corpse and cry out:\nFrea: \"Father! What have you done! Go. My father sacrificed himself so that you could destroy Miraak and lift his master's shadow from the land. Go, then. Kill Miraak. Do not fail.\"\nThe whole village will then one by one walk over to the corpse of Storn and say a few final words:\nFanari Strong-Voice: \"\"Goodbye, old friend. We will miss you, but do not worry. Frea will guide us well, thanks to you.\"Edla: \"\"We won't forget what you did for us, Storn Crag-Strider. Walk with the All-Maker.\"Deor: \"\"Frea... I'm sorry.\"Aeta: \"\"It can't be... please, All-Maker, send him back to us...\"Baldor: \"\"I... uh... you'll be missed, old man.\"Finna: \"\"May the All-Maker guide your soul to the next life.\"Niklaus: \"\"Frea...what happened? What was that thing? I thought the village was safe now.\"Wulf: \"\"Return to the All-Maker, old one. The Skaal will never forget your sacrifice.\"Morwen: \"\"I don't really understand what you did, but I trust you did it for the good of the village. So... thank you.\"Tharstan: \"By the gods... I've never seen anything like it...I, uh... I don't think this will go in my book.\""}

The scroll in question can be found in the south of the room. Once you have it, head outside and look for a sleeping cultist to use it on. They will be guarded by several awake cultists, so you will have to kill those first. Use the srcoll on the sleeping cultist to bind him to your will, and lead him back to the cave. Once they are in the trap, speak with Master Muzgu. Muzgu will tell you that the Daedra will consume the victim and then head through a portal back to &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you to follow the daedra to Quagmire and kill it there. \nActivate the Daedric contraption you trapped the cultist in. He will die, and a portal will open.

It was added by &lt;a href=\"Update%2030\"&gt;Update 30&lt;/a&gt; in June 2021, replacing the original tutorial quest &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven%20in%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Soul Shriven in Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; and the chapter-specific tutorial quests &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Bonds\"&gt;Broken Bonds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mind%20Trap\"&gt;The Mind Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bright%20Moons%2C%20Warm%20Sands\"&gt;Bright Moons, Warm Sands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bound%20in%20Blood\"&gt;Bound in Blood&lt;/a&gt;. Soul Shriven in Coldharbour was altered slightly and is now started by encountering the &lt;a href=\"Hooded%20Figure\"&gt;Hooded Figure&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nLook around a bit, then go to the cell door and talk to Norianwe. Wait for her to unlock the door, then exit the cell. Follow Norianwe to the north end of the room and talk to her again. She tells you to take your pick of the weapons on the stone tables nearby:\nTake any or all of the weapons and equip one to your main hand. If you equip a sword or dagger, you can equip a second one-hand weapon or shield to your off hand.\nWhen you're ready, follow Norianwe into the next room. She activates an Animated Armor and guides you through some practice combat. Press the indicated controls when prompted. You can repeat the practice combat as much as you want, switching weapons between fights. Tell Norianwe when you're ready to move on, then go through the door and up the stairs.\nYou'll see a &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Invoker\"&gt;Golem Invoker&lt;/a&gt; pounding on a door at the far end of the hall. Your destination is down the side corridor so you can easily avoid the golem; on the other hand if you defeat it and unlock the door (Trivial lock), you can enter the Balfiera Armory which contains full matched sets of armor (light, medium, and heavy), shields, and weapons of all types. Your inventory is too small to take it all, so just take and equip what you want; none of it has any sale value, though it may be useful as deconstruction fodder later.\nLeave the armory and go down the side corridor, through a door, and down another corridor, passing few more sets of armor in case you skipped the armory. Exit through the far door.\nOutside you'll start to encounter &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat\"&gt;Sabre Cat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Champion\"&gt;Golem Champion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Invoker\"&gt;Golem Invoker&lt;/a&gt;s. Some golems pose as statues until they detect you, so be careful.\nWork your way across to the east side of the map and enter the Keywright's Gallery. Cross the room, head up the stairs, and talk to Norianwe. She says you'll need a new Skyshard, so go back outside and enter the Skyshard Building to the south. The Skyshard is dead ahead, emiting a column of light. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;. When you try to take the Skyshard, you instead absorb its energy, but Norianwe decides the energy will suffice. Return to the Gallery foyer and repair the cracked Skyshard, then talk to Norianwe. She warns that the Daedric creature is just beyond the next door, so take care of any preparations you want to make now.\nUpon passing through the door you're faced with Shyazzel the Traveler, a &lt;a href=\"Harvester\"&gt;Harvester&lt;/a&gt;. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinue through the next door into a hallway lined with bookcases. Check them all for the book &lt;a href=\"Sep%27s%20Kiss\"&gt;Sep's Kiss&lt;/a&gt;, which raises your Alchemy skill by 1 point. Then proceed down either staircase and enter the Keywright's Gallery. Talk to Norianwe to complete the quest.\nAfter the quest.\nAt this point you must decide where to go next. This is a one-way trip: there will be no way to return to Balfiera. The Gallery contains one-way portals to the starting islands for the three alliances and all DLC chapters. However you can only interact with a portal if you own that DLC or have an ESO Plus subscription; other gates will be blocked by chains.\nFurthermore, as of Update 41 (March 2024), the first character on a new account can only use the gate to their alliance's starter island; after that, subsequent characters on the same account will be able to use portals to any chapter zone available on that account.\nYou can examine each portal to hear Norianwe's summary of that region before you make your final decision. The portals you can choose from are:"}

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; assists an &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; in uncovering a plot to harm not only &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, but all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. \nBackground.\n\"When I approached the gates of Solitude, a &lt;a href=\"Brondold\"&gt;wounded&lt;/a&gt; man stumbled out, fleeing for his life. He left me a bundle of papers and told me to keep them safe before he died.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen the Vestige first enters the area surrounding Solitude, they will be approached by a wounded &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; wandering around premises. Upon speaking to him, he will tell them the following:\n\"Ugh, there's no time. Take this. Keep it safe.\"\nUpon which Brondold will fall to the ground and die. Before the Vestige can read the note handed to them by Brondold, however, they will be interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Shield-Corporal%20Thjol\"&gt;Shield-Corporal Thjol&lt;/a&gt;, Shield-Corporal of the Solitude city guard. Suspicious, he will ask the Vestige if they are a spy and inquires about Brondold's conversation with them. When the Vestige tells him about the &lt;a href=\"Icereach%20Coven\"&gt;Icereach Coven&lt;/a&gt; and their intentions, he will reply in disbelief and suggests the Vestige doesn't stick their nose where it doesn't belong.\nThe Vestige can now read the note that Brondold handed to them. The note, written by an anonymous author, tells of a marked shipment of crates arriving at the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim%20Docks\"&gt;Western Skyrim Docks&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, it contains cryptic directions to a location where they left a surprise for Brondold and instructions as to where the author will be waiting for him.\nNow that the Vestige has read the information that Brondold wanted them to read, they will have to make their way to the docks in order to investigate the marked crates detailed in the note. One of the crates can be found at the northern corner of the shipyard. Upon opening the crate and its hidden compartment, the Vestige will discover that the bottom is littered with urn fragments covered in a strange ash or dust.\nAfter this, the Vestige must make their way to the marshes south of Solitude, where the author left something for Brondold. Upon entering the ruins containing the item, they will be attacked by two &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating them, the Vestige can access the bag titled \"Brondold's Hidden Belongings\" and discover his journal. Now that the Vestige has found the marked shipment and the journal, it is time for them to meet the author of the note. They must make their way to the stables just outside of Solitude, where they will be greeted by &lt;a href=\"Korvynn\"&gt;Korvynn&lt;/a&gt;, brandishing a dagger. When speaking to her, she will tell them the following:\n\"\"I mean it! One step closer and I'll stick you like a &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horker&lt;/a&gt;!\"\"\nIt appears Brondold was investigating Icereach Coven activity on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, after which he was supposed to deliver his findings to the Blue Palace. The Vestige must travel to the Blue Palace and meet with Lyris Titanborn in order to deliver his belongings and inform her of his fate. When spoken to, she will tell the Vestige the following:\nThe conversation will be interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Gerhyld\"&gt;Queen Gerhyld&lt;/a&gt;, wife of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Svargrim\"&gt;High King Svargrim&lt;/a&gt;. Upon speaking to her, she will say the following:\n\"I am Gerhyld, Queen of Skyrim. Allow me to welcome you on behalf of our kingdom, our city, and our hold. Who might you be?\"\nWhile the queen believes the Vestige, she thinks Lyris and them will have to gather more proof before her husband will believe an envoy from Jorunn the Skald-King. The Vestige must now speak to Lyris and inform her of Brondold's fate. After handing over his possessions, Lyris will ask the Vestige if they will help her investigate this matter as she is short a good investigator. Because Brondold mentioned some locals who may have information in his earlier contact with Lyris, she proposes to go see them.\nThe first local is &lt;a href=\"Greyga\"&gt;Greyga&lt;/a&gt;, a local snitch. She can be found in a back alley of Solitude, gambling with &lt;a href=\"Birjhan\"&gt;Birjhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carmara\"&gt;Carmara&lt;/a&gt;. When speaking to her, she will react disinterested and hostile. After pressing her for information on Brondold, the Vestige has a chance to persuade her or let Lyris do the talking. She will inform them of a local smuggler, &lt;a href=\"Kasalla\"&gt;Kasalla&lt;/a&gt;, who has a warehouse on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim%20Docks\"&gt;Western Skyrim Docks&lt;/a&gt; and handles all smuggling in Solitude.\nNow that Greyga has given the information, Lyris and the Vestige will have to go to &lt;a href=\"The%20Lonely%20Troll\"&gt;The Lonely Troll&lt;/a&gt; to talk to &lt;a href=\"Maugh\"&gt;Maugh&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, Lyris will approach the intoxicated Maugh and press him for information. However, she is interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Svana%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Svana&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Gerhyld\"&gt;Queen Gerhyld&lt;/a&gt; and princess of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. When spoken to, she will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"Who gave you the right to walk in here and bully my friend? Did my father send you?\"\nNow that the Vestige has learned of the smuggler accepted by Kasalla and the mysterious Breton encountered by Svana, they will have to speak to Lyris and go over their plan of action. She proposes they deal with the smuggler first, and directs the Vestige towards &lt;a href=\"Kasalla%27s%20Warehouse\"&gt;Kasalla's Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; on the Western Skyrim docks. There, they will be stopped by Kasalla's sentry, &lt;a href=\"Huzodir\"&gt;Huzodir&lt;/a&gt;, who informs them he will be happy to keep Lyris company once Kasalla has returned from her business. As Kasalla doesn't allow visitors while she isn't present, Huzodir will not let the Vestige pass. However, using Lyris' fame and renown, they can convince Huzodir to fetch his scabbard for an autograph from Lyris.\nAfter picking the lock and having gained access to Kasalla's warehouse, the Vestige must search it for more of the marked crates Korvynn mentioned in her note to Brondold. Once the Vestige has gathered the ritualistic contents of all 3 crates, Kasalla will enter the building with her bodyguards. She will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"I had a feeling it wasn't just an opportunistic thief trying to steal my cargo. What are you after?\"\nThe unnamed collector that Kasalla describes matches the description Svana gave. After discussing it with Lyris, she instructs the Vestige to search the lodge Kasalla said the collector took the crates to. She will circle around from the opposite direction in case the collector is already on the move. Once the Vestige has made their way to the lodge up in the mountain ridge north of Solitude, they will immediately be attacked by &lt;a href=\"Pentarch%20Zaros\"&gt;Pentarch Zaros&lt;/a&gt;; the collector. After disposing of the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige must investigate the lodge and search for clues. Once inside, they will find a scribbled letter on a desk in the corner lodge. The letter is addressed to Pentarch, and the author instructs him to send the latest shipment to &lt;a href=\"Kilkreath%20Temple\"&gt;Kilkreath Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving learned of the location of the shipment, the Vestige must now return to Lyris to brief her of what they have learned:\n\"All I found were these Reachmen stalking the pass. Decided they'd rather die than talk, so I obliged. They don't look like they're from Icereach, but they are wearing the coven's medallions. Anyway, did you find the lodge?\"\nWhile Lyris head to Solitude to warn the High King, the Vestige will now have to travel to Kilkreath Temple to try and warn the priests there of what is to come. Once the Vestige arrives there, they will be stopped by &lt;a href=\"Fennorian\"&gt;Fennorian&lt;/a&gt;, who requests to speak to them:\n\"\"Don't be alarmed. I mean you no harm, but there are &lt;a href=\"harrowfiend\"&gt;harrowfiend&lt;/a&gt;s swarming around Kilkreath Temple who do. Head back to safety before they find you!\"\"\nThe Vestige must now examine the witch pikes erected in the areas surrounding the temple with Fennorian. Defeating the vampiric creatures guarding them and examining the strange objects will lead them to discover they are covered with an alchemic residue. Fennorian will explain the witch pikes expended significant power, and are used to summon a &lt;a href=\"Harrowstorms\"&gt;harrowstorm&lt;/a&gt;. The pikes play a significant role as focal points for the ritual and Fennorian was able to sense a lingering energy; including a Daedric one. Fennorian wants to take a closer look at the residue found on the pikes, but he notifies the Vestige of a band of pilgrims leading a cart away from the temple right before the storm hit that he wants to find first. Taking the road south of the temple will lead the Vestige to a pair of dazedly wandering pilgrims, seemingly drained of all life energy. In the back of their cart, however, is a crate filled with dust and ashes; a sign that they were transporting the ritualistic urns before the storm hit them.\nFennorian speculates the pilgrims were perhaps unknowingly transporting the artifacts, as it played a significant role in the harrowstorm that impacted them. Together, they must now travel back to the temple grounds and enter the ruins to observe the target area of the storm.\nOnce the Vestige and Fennorian have reached the statue of Meridia, they must turn right towards the platform. After defeating the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; there, they will stumble upon a mass of corpses spread on the platform; the storm has taken a heavy toll on the temple's inhabitants.\nSpeaking to Fennorian about the massacre will lead them to say the following:\n\"I'll need to perform more tests, but from what we've seen I believe the storm affects mortals in three distinct ways. It kills them, transforms them into harrowfiends, or leaves them mindless. I suppose I'd say it harrowed those poor pilgrims.\"\nAfter fighting their way through the &lt;a href=\"harrowfiend\"&gt;harrowfiend&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vampiric%20sabre%20cat\"&gt;vampiric sabre cat&lt;/a&gt;s, the Vestige and Fennorian will eventually locate Fennorian's alchemical equipment. Once there, they will be confronted by Lyris, who is hostile towards the Vestige's new vampire companion. Upon speaking with her, it becomes apparent she was under the impression Fennarion was about to harm the Vestige. Once the Vestige explains Fennorian's standing, she calms her nerves and informs the Vestige she spotted a coven witch not too far from where they are who calls herself &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Ambritt\"&gt;Sister Ambritt&lt;/a&gt;. She urges the Vestige to make their way to the cliff overlooking the temple, where the witch was last located.\nWhen the Vestige and Lyris arrive at the cliff, Sister Ambritt can be heard commentating on her recent ritual, saying: \"Not even harrowed? It seems the ritual needs refinement.\" She will subsequently teleport to the temple grounds and summon two &lt;a href=\"Death%20Hound%20%28Online%29\"&gt;death hounds&lt;/a&gt; that will assist her in battle. In combat, Sister Ambritt uses a combination of frost attacks, ranged attacks with her bow, leaping attacks and summoning death hounds.\nAfter defeating the coven witch, Fennorian remarks he found something nearby. When spoken to about his findings, he will say the following:\n\"Do you see? These are the same as the urns smuggled from Bangkorai. They didn't just shatter, they exploded. I can sense traces of magicka clinging to the shards that match the energy used in the storm ritual. These other fragments though \u2026.\"\nThe Vestige must now discuss Fennorian's findings with Lyris in order to find out if she thinks they have gathered enough evidence to convince High King Svargrim. After telling her Fennorian believes the harrowstorm creates the harrowfiends and the harrowed, she will reward them with what was originally Brondold's reward and the quest will be completed."}

He had three sons: Mikrul, Jyrik, and Sigdis. Resentful and jealous, they murdered him, stole his amulet, and divided the power among themselves.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Gauldur Amulet is a necklace which grants +30 to &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a weight of 0, when most amulets weigh 0.5 or 1. While it increases Stamina, it does not increase carrying capacity.\nAcquisition.\nThere are three Gauldur Fragments located in three separate dungeons: &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Geirmund%27s%20Hall%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Geirmund's Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Each fragment individually grants +30 to one of the three main stats: Health, Magicka, and Stamina. The fragment in Saarthal can only be found by joining the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; and completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Under%20Saarthal\"&gt;Under Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAfter all three fragments have been obtained, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must go to &lt;a href=\"Reachwater%20Rock\"&gt;Reachwater Rock&lt;/a&gt; to reforge the amulet, which requires once more defeating the three keepers of the Fragments."}

Though the land was not fully formed, and was so underpopulated as to make me feel lonesome at all hours, I decided to settle down in the little town.\nI explored its abandoned buildings, its thriving marketplace, its bountiful farms. But my favorite place, the one I frequented most often, was that of the fishing-hole near the graveyard. Its quiet beauty and calm waters did wonders for my soul.\nI spent many days fishing there, simply enjoying the quiet and peace. It was on such day that I first saw it - the figure of a &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;, barely visible against the grass opposite the docks. Having never seen another animal in all of Clickyville, I was naturally startled, but the beast did not seem to mind. It merely stood there, surveying its territory. As I approached it, however, it bounded off - startled by my movements, I suspect.\nThat was not the last I saw of the ghostly stag, but it did not appear everyday. Rather, its appearance continued to be a rarity, visiting perhaps once a week. There were times I had company on the docks, and the stag would show itself to me, but not to my companion, or the stag would reveal itself to him and not to me. I never was able to approach it without it starting, and so I resolved to enjoy its company at a distance, whenever it would see fit to grant it. I feel that I will never understand the ghostly stag fully."}

Doing this he betrayed his wife. Rosalind's vision runs out and Leon is upset. Talk to him to hear what he has to say.\nHe admits he was to weak to trust Stendarr so he gave them all to Molag Bal.

This is not to say that the groundbreaking work of the Venerable Kigyo of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; and Professor &lt;a href=\"Barst\"&gt;Barst&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shad%20Astula\"&gt;Shad Astula&lt;/a&gt; are to be entirely discounted, merely that their objectivity has been colored and undermined by their cultural assumptions of male superiority.\nTo be clear, it is not the fact that I am a woman that makes me somehow emotionally better suited to understand the sisterhood of the Glenmoril Wyrd. On the contrary, it is my proven ability to be objective in the context of traditional gender roles, as shown in my celebrated tract, \"Saint and Slave-Queen: &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and the Lens of Gender,\" that makes me uniquely qualified to address the subject of a single-sex society like that of the Wyrd Sisters.\nThe Glenmoril Wyrd are a loose association of female witch covens who revere nature and the natural world and incline toward &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-worship. &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Racially&lt;/a&gt; they are almost entirely &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, though some covens include human hybrids such as &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;hagravens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lamias&lt;/a&gt;, who usually rule the covens they live in. Their preference for life in the wilderness means their covens are usually located far from the agricultural or pastoral enclaves of \"civilized\" people, which contributes to the lack of understanding of their true natures. This has led to the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Coven\"&gt;Glenmoril covens&lt;/a&gt; nearly always being described in terms such as uncanny, reclusive, dangerous, inimical, and evil.\nIn fact, the Glenmoril Wyrd are all of these things\u2014except, I would argue, evil. It is true that they are unswervingly committed to a rejection of civilization and civilized ways; it is true they admit no male members to their covens; it is true they regard themselves as enforcers of certain \"laws of nature\" which only they recognize. This does not make them evil, just strict adherents to moral codes that are different from our own.\nThe fact that the Glenmoril covens seem able to maintain their populations without admitting men into their number is also an object of suspicion for those who live in their vicinities. There is an age-old libel that the Wyrd Sisters replenish themselves by stealing girl-children from neighboring farms, but such a practice has never been documented (except in the case of the notorious &lt;a href=\"Fen%20Witches\"&gt;Fen Witches&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;\u2014but they worship &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and child-abduction is the least of their objectionable habits). My inquiries, which have been extensive, lead me to the conclusion that in most cases covens gain new members when unwanted girl-children are brought to them by distressed parents. (What happens to unwanted boy-children in the northern regions is probably a question best left unasked.)\nThough the Glenmoril Wyrd are numerically few, geographically they are widespread, from the easternmost &lt;a href=\"Greenspring%20Coven\"&gt;Greenspring Coven&lt;/a&gt; in central &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to the westernmost coven in the &lt;a href=\"Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the eight or so known covens are adherents of Hircine, but the &lt;a href=\"Hagfeather%20Coven\"&gt;Hagfeather Coven&lt;/a&gt; of western &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; reveres &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Sisters\"&gt;Markarth Sisters&lt;/a&gt; (the only urban coven) worships &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, and the aforementioned Fen Witches of Hjaalmarch are followers of Molag Bal.\nRelationships with the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, the other main Daedra-worshipers of the northern wilds, vary from coven to coven and from &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; Clan to Reach Clan. The Hagfeather Coven, the &lt;a href=\"Rimerock%20Wyrd\"&gt;Rimerock Wyrd&lt;/a&gt;, and the Markarth Sisters all have cordial relations with the Reachmen, but the western covens of the Ilessan Hills and &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Woods\"&gt;Viridian Woods&lt;/a&gt; have a history of conflict with the Reach Clans that dates back thousands of years. This may be accounted for by the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Ilessan\"&gt;Ilessan&lt;/a&gt; and Viridian Wyrd venerate the less-feral aspects of &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, and have even been known to provide cures for &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the Reachmen prefer Hircine's more vicious side, celebrating lycanthropy as a gift rather than a curse.\nThis, then, is a summary of what is known about the widespread but elusive sisters of the Glenmoril Wyrd. Many questions, certainly, remain unanswered, and much research remains to be done. To address these issues properly, it might even be necessary to leave &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; and mount a personal expedition into the northern wilds\u2014assuming a generous patron steps forward to finance such a worthwhile scholarly effort."}

Known as the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt; (and, obliquely, as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother's&lt;/a&gt; Kiss) the otherwise simple dagger is a symbol of their order and icon of their dark patrons. The dagger, named for the apocryphal blade wielded by the Night Mother when she supposedly sacrificed her own children, is made available to the devotees of the Dark Brotherhood to carry out their grisly work. I have heard conflicting reports that the entire Brotherhood somehow shares a single blade and that each individual weapon is crafted upon the pattern of the original. I suspect the latter is closer to the truth than the former, but the legend persists.\nThe Blade of Woe, sacred to the Dark Brotherhood's patron deity, the Dread Father &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, supposedly contains a special power to send the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of those it kills directly to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. My own studies of similar artifacts have found no evidence of any such &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;ka. It's possible only a follower of Sithis can invoke these alleged properties, but I find it more likely that the blade simply holds special religious significance to its wielder, bu no practical application in these regards. And since the victims of the Dark Brotherhood meet their ends in every way imaginable, including by poison and sabotage, they must believe, at least, that every death they inflict somehow finds its way to Sithis.\nGiven the secretive nature of the Dark Brotherhood, acquiring information is all but impossible and research on the subject is suspect at best and extremely hard to come by. I hope that by bringing this topic out into the open, other diligent scholars will investigate these mysterious killers and help to remove the shroud of mystery that surrounds their beliefs and act.\n[intentionally cut off here]"}

He will inform the Nerevarine that rumors have surfaced that the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Morrowind\"&gt;King of Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Hlaalu%20Helseth%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt;, has trained a Goblin Army. Hler tasks the Nerevarine with finding this army and destroying it, if they can find out its location (and if it is real). He suggests that the Nerevarine ask around the town about the Army.\nInto the Sewers.\nAsking around the town will reveal that any likely hiding place for a Goblin would be in the town's sewer system. The Sewers can be accessed in the &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt; district of Mournhold. Initially, the Nerevarine will not encounter any Goblins. However, when the enter the West Sewers are entered, the Nerevarine will be attacked by Goblins from that point forward. The Nerevarine must work their way through the sewers in search of the Warchiefs and Trainers.\nOnce inside the West Sewers, look for the doors labeled Battlefield. Go through them and into the large chamber beyond. On the south side of the chamber is a door labeled City Gate. Go through this and then through the door on the right named Armory Ruins. Continuing forward, there are three &lt;a href=\"Adamantium\"&gt;Adamantium&lt;/a&gt; nodes on the far side of the waterfall room and eventually, the door to Tears of Amun-Shae.\nThe Tears of Amun-Shae holds the two Warchiefs of the Goblin Army. Inside, the Nerevarine will encounter numerous Goblins protecting their leaders. Durgoc can be found in one of the rooms of the cave system, while &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Kurog\"&gt;Kurog&lt;/a&gt; can be found patrolling the pathways outside of it. Once those two have been dealt with, the Nerevarine can either head back to Hler (for a smaller reward) or head on to kill the Trainers.\nTeran Hall.\nTeran Hall can be accessed through the Residential Ruins or the Abandoned Passageway. There is a door below the waterfall in Tears of Amun-Shae that leads to the Residential Ruins and the Abandoned Passageway can be entered from the Battlefield. Inside, the Nerevarine will have to fight numerous Goblins protecting their Trainers, before finding both the Trainers, &lt;a href=\"Yarnar\"&gt;Yarnar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armion\"&gt;Armion&lt;/a&gt;, in the lower portion of Teran Hall. After both have been killed, the Nerevarine may return to Hler or (if they had not done so earlier) proceed to kill the Warchiefs before returning to Hler."}

Neither had been back in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, let alone in their favorite woods for four years. The trees had changed little even if they had. Stryngpool had a handsome blond moustache now, stiffened and spiked with wax, and Templer seemed to be a completely alien creature to the young lad who searched for adventure in the ancient grove. He was much quieter, as if scarred within as well as without.\nThey each carried their bows and quivers with extra care as they maneuvered their way through the clusters of vine and branch.\n\"This is the path that used to lead to your house, isn't it, old boy?\" asked Stryngpool.\nTempler glanced at the overgrowth and nodded, before continuing on.\n\"I thought so,\" said Stryngpool and laughed: \"I remember it because you used to run down it every time you got a bloody nose. I know I can't offend you, but I have to say, it's hard to believe that you ended up a soldier.\" \n\"How's your family?\" asked Templer.\n\"The same. A bit more pompous, if that's possible. It's obvious they wish I'd come back from the academy, but there's nothing much for me here. At least not until I collect my inheritance. Did you see I got a gold ribbon of merit in archery?\" \n\"How could I miss it?\" said Templer.\n\"Oh yes, I nearly forgot that the family's put it in the Great Hall. Very ostentatiously. I suppose you can actually see it through the picture window. Silly, but I hope the peasants are impressed.\" \nThe clearing opened up before them, where the mist settled on the grass, enveloping it in an opaque, chilly vapor. Burlap targets were arranged around in a semi-circle, several meters apart, like sentinels.\n\"You've been practicing,\" observed Templer.\n\"Well, a bit. I've only been back in town for a few days.\" said Stryngpool with a smile. \"My parents said you got here a week ago?\"\n\"That's right. My unit's camped a few miles east, and I thought I'd visit the old haunts. A lot's changed, I could hardly recognize anything at all.\" Templer looked down at the valley below, to the vast empty tilled ground, stretching out for miles around. \"It looks like a good planting.\" \n\"My family's rather spread out since yours left. There was some discussion I think about keeping your old house up, but it seemed a little sentimental. Especially as there was fertile ground beneath.\" \nStryngpool strung his bow carefully. It was a beautiful piece of art, darkest ebony and spun silver filigrees, hand-crafted for him in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. He looked over at Templer stringing his bow, and felt a twinge of pity. It was a sad, weathered utensil, bound together with strips of fabric.\n\"If that's how they taught you to string your bow, you need some advisors from the academy in that army of yours,\" said Stryngpool as gently as he could. \"The untightened loop is supposed to look like an X in an O. Yours looks like a Z in a Y.\" \n\"It works for me,\" said Templer. \"I should tell you, I won't be able to make an afternoon of this. I'm supposed to join my unit this evening.\" \nStryngpool began to feel annoyed by his old friend. If he was angry about his family losing their land, why couldn't he just say it? Why did he come back to the valley at all? He watched Templer nock his first arrow, taking aim at a target, and coughed.\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't in good faith send you back to the army without a little new wisdom. There are three types of draw, three-fingers, thumb and index, thumb and two fingers. Then there's the thumb draw which I like, but you see,\" Stryngpool showed Templer the small leather loop fastened on the cord of his bow, \"You need to have one of these thingies or you'll tear your thumb right off.\" \n\"I think I like my stupid method best.\" \n\"Don't be pigheaded, Templer. They didn't give me the gold ribbon of merit for nothing. I had demonstrated shooting from under a shield, standing, sitting, squatting, kneeling, and sitting on horseback. This is practical information I'm imparting for the sake of our friendship which I, at least, haven't completely forgotten. Sweet &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, I remember when you were just an oily little squirt, begging for this kind of honest guidance.\" \nTempler looked at Stryngpool for a moment, and lowered his bow. \"Show me.\" \nStryngpool relaxed, shook away the tensions that had been building. He did his exercise, drawing the bow back to his eyebrow, his moustache, his chest, his earlobe.\n\"There are three ways of shooting: snatching and releasing in one continuous motion, like the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; do; holding with a short draw and a pause before releasing like the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;; and partial draw, pause, final draw,\" Stryngpool fired the arrow into the center of the target with cool precision, \"And release. Which I prefer.\" \n\"Very nice,\" said Templer.\n\"Now you,\" said Stryngpool. He helped Templer select a grip, nock his arrow correctly, and take aim. A smile grew on Templer's face\u2014the first time Stryngpool had seen such a childlike expression on the war-etched visage all afternoon. When Templer released the arrow, it rocketed high over the top of the target and into the valley below where it disappeared from sight.\n\"Not bad,\" said Templer.\n\"No, not bad,\" said Stryngpool, feeling friendly once again. \"If you practice, you should be able to focus your aim a little bit.\" \nThe two shot a few more practice bolts before parting ways. Templer began the long trek east to his unit's camp, and Stryngpool wound his way down through the woods to the valley and his family's mansion. He hummed a little tune he learned at the academy as he passed the great lawn and walked up to the front door, pleased with himself for helping his old friend. It entirely escaped his attention that the large picture window was broken.\nBut he noticed right away when he came into the Great Hall, and saw Templer's wild-shot bolt sticking in his gold ribbon of merit."}

She will ask you to keep their sacred relic, the Golden Claw, safe from the cult. To reach the claw, you will need the blessings of Jone and Jode, which you can get from priests that the Stonefire Cult has captured. \nHead across the bridge to the monastery. On either side of the main building, you will find a smaller structure with one of the priests inside. Free them, and they will give you the blessings you need.

The quest can be activated either by entering &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt; and overhearing the bandits discussing the claw, entering &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Valerius\"&gt;Lucan&lt;/a&gt;'s shop and asking what went missing, or by letting the local innkeeper, &lt;a href=\"Orgnar\"&gt;Orgnar&lt;/a&gt;, tell the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; the latest rumors and/or gossips.\nBackground.\n\"Lucan Valerius in Riverwood is offering me a gold reward if I retrieve his antique Golden Claw, stolen by bandits camped in Bleak Falls Barrow.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20Trader\"&gt;Riverwood Trader&lt;/a&gt; is entered, Lucan and &lt;a href=\"Camilla%20Valerius\"&gt;Camilla Valerius&lt;/a&gt; are in a heated argument about whether or not a valuable item that has recently been stolen from their shop should be retrieved. Upon inquiry, it is learned that a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Claw\"&gt;Golden Claw&lt;/a&gt; has been stolen from the shop by bandits. More curious yet, is the fact that the claw was the only item stolen, despite that numerous other valuable items in the shop which are worth just as much . The &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; are thought to be holed up in Bleak Falls Barrow.\nRetrieve the Golden Claw.\nBleak Falls Barrow can be found by following the path Camilla lays out up the mountain west of &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;. Several bandits are found guarding the entrance, as well as two bandits inside, who can be overheard talking about someone called &lt;a href=\"Arvel%20the%20Swift\"&gt;Arvel&lt;/a&gt;, who seems to have gone ahead of the rest of the group.\nAfter killing or sneaking by the bandits and continuing through Bleak Falls Temple, another bandit is seen who pulls a lever and is cut down by a volley of poisoned darts. This introduces a turn-stone puzzle, whose solution can be deduced by studying the order of carvings on the stone faces, going from left to right (Snake, Snake, Whale). Once the trap has been deactivated, the &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;\" can be taken from a table just past the portcullis.\nCut Arvel down.\nThe voice of Arvel the Swift can be heard crying out for his comrades help (these include Bjorn and Soling), despite running ahead with the claw. Upon investigating the cries, a large &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Frostbite%20Spider\"&gt;Wounded Frostbite Spider&lt;/a&gt; descends from the ceiling to guard its trapped prey. Once the spider has been killed, Arvel asks to be set free. He states that he knows about the markings on the claw and the stone door and that he'll share in the power that the ancients have hidden away once he is free.\nDespite all of his promises, Arvel is nothing but a bandit and tries to run once he has been cut free. Since he has the claw, he must be cut down (or let the trap and Draugr up ahead do it). His corpse has the Golden Claw as well as &lt;a href=\"Arvel%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Arvel's Journal&lt;/a&gt; on it. To avoid the impending chase, Arvel can be killed as soon as he is free, as he will stand still for a moment or two after dropping to the floor. Another way that he can die is if he survives the draugr, he can run into a spike trap, killing him instantly. Alternatively, the player can use the Calm spell to make him fall into a trance, allowing a few seconds to slay him.\nFind the secret of Bleak Falls Barrow.\nPast where Arvel was ensnared is the start of the crypts and the first encounters with the many ancient draugr that inhabit the barrow, as well as a number of deadly traps. There is a closed gate with water running through it that can be opened by activating the chain next to it. Eventually, the doorway down to Bleak Falls Sanctum can be found. It is guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Restless%20Draugr\"&gt;Restless Draugr&lt;/a&gt; at lower levels. Behind the door is a swinging axe trap, with two draugr behind it. Eventually, there is an iron door that leads to the Hall of Stories, a long, low arched vault with stone murals on the sides. Here, the ancient Nords processed their dead for their voyage to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the hall is the keystone that the Golden Claw unlocks. The combination can be seen on the palm of the claw: bear, moth, owl from top to bottom (which can be seen when viewing the claw in the &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; view). Activate the outer, middle, and inner rings to rotate the radial turn stones on the door. Once they match the claw, activate the keyhole, which will insert the claw as the key. Once through, the passage will open up into a great chamber with a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shout\"&gt;Dragon Shout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;. While learning the shout, a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Overlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Overlord&lt;/a&gt; will emerge from the nearby crypt. Once defeated, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt;, a quest item, can be taken from his body. Warning: Once taken, the Dragonstone, as a quest item, cannot be dropped, stored or given to a follower until it is presented to &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to complete the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt;.\" With a weight of 25, it takes up a considerable percentage of the Dragonborn's carrying capacity, especially early in the game, and presenting the Dragonstone sets in motion events that significantly change the game world, making it more difficult for players who are still early in the game. It is recommended the Dragonstone be left with the Overlord, and the location noted, until the player is ready.\nBring the Golden Claw to Lucan.\nWith the secret of Bleak Falls Barrow uncovered, Lucan will be awaiting his prized possession. Following the stairs to the left of the Word Wall will lead to a handle that will reveal a secret passage to a one-way exit from the sanctum (the final room after the one-way drop has a chest and some &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;purple mountain flowers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;red mountain flowers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;blue mountain flowers&lt;/a&gt;). Return to the Riverwood Trader where Lucan will be pleased to have his prized trinket back, and in return, happily pays the promised gold. Camilla becomes a &lt;a href=\"marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; prospect as well."}

Dragon humours have all sorts of uses, and leaving them to soak into the dirt is a crying shame. Whenever you're butchering a Dragon, remember a pan or something to catch all the good bits.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Blood\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt;\nAll that hot red stuff leaking out the Dragon's corpse. Goes without saying. Provided you left any in the beast before you killed it, slip a sturdy dagger between the scales on the throat and give a squeeze. Unless you've got a way to string it up like a pig, you'll need to do the same for the arm pits, thighs, and base of the tail to extract the most out of it.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Bile\"&gt;Bile&lt;/a&gt;\nThis one isn't so easy. You'll want to drive a blade into the Dragon's groin and cut in the direction of its head until you hit the ribs. Don't cut too deep or you'll hit the stomach and spill acid everywhere. Reach in under the ribcage until you find a muscly tube and follow that until you reach a melon-sized organ. Give it a squeeze. If it's spongy, yank it out. If it's firm, that's the stomach, and you don't want to rupture it. The spongy organ should be full of pure bile. Ring it out like a dishrag until you've got nothing but pulp in your hands.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Rheum\"&gt;Rheum&lt;/a&gt;\nTechnically, you don't need to kill a Dragon to collect its rheum, but good luck scraping mucus off its face while sleeping.

If you are prepared to face the dangers of the Gorge, it will prove to be an invaluable means of passing undetected by the mortal world.\nAt a place where the barrier between Nirn and Oblivion is thinnest, bind an anchor to the material world by offering the Gorge the things it craves the most. The aspects of your own vital essence: Anima, Ego, Incalescence, and Mortality.

Should you desire to move your anchor, you must snuff the sigils of your offerings in the order they were cast. This will return the anchor to the material world, allowing you to employ its power elsewhere."}

His open maw now stands as an entryway, open only to the worthiest among the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;. They walk before this towering beast, the fallen foe of their ancestors. There is no music or drink, but rather solemn contemplation and prayer. I only hear their murmured voices and the crackle of the flames.\nThe Ashlanders say little to an outlander such as myself. They hold no love for any outside of their tribe, and a burning hatred for &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; who follow the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.

I feel there would be little hesitation among the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; Dark Elves, should an opportunity arise for war.\nI try to understand their ways, their customs. Their history with the horrid beast, the house of their council, a shrine of their past. How was Skar defeated? Why is his corpse used as their meeting grounds? My questions are met with silence by most. Those willing to speak do so for the promise of food or gold, and even they have little to say.\nWhat I do know is that their ancestors defeated Skar in battle, though I'm not sure how. Some speak of a spear, but not of who wielded it. Who was this &lt;a href=\"Dranoth%20Hleran\"&gt;mysterious warrior&lt;/a&gt;? I would expect him to be well revered, honored among the Ashlanders. Why do none know his name? The oral traditions passed, those shared among the campfires I'm allowed to attend, they hold extraordinary details. Why does this name escape their memory?\nThe morbid grounds where the Ashlanders meet hold great importance as well. It reminds me of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;thanes&lt;/a&gt; that mount their kills above their thrones, a show of power and triumph. As the Ashlanders think upon their past victories, they also gain hope for future glory. They were the &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; who felled this beast, the mighty Skar. What can they not accomplish, should the day come?\nI look upon Skar's carcass, a shudder running through me. It fills me with dread, yet for these Ashlanders I believe he is a sign of hope, of strength. My gaze runs along their campfires and I wonder. What will come of that strength, of that pride? What future is in store for these tribes? Perhaps another Skar will rise and they will be the ones to defeat him. Or perhaps they will be the ones who are defeated. Only the passage of time will reveal that truth."}

It is part of the prologue for the DLC.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon finishing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ravenwatch%20Inquiry\"&gt;The Ravenwatch Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Gwendis\"&gt;Gwendis&lt;/a&gt; will ask you to come with her to &lt;a href=\"Grayhome\"&gt;Grayhome&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt; presence on the island. Take the cart there and talk to Gwendis. She will suggest that you search the island for clues surrounding the Gray Host and &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt;'s connection to them. When the conversation is finished; she will run ahead; follow her and you will come across some kind of crystal. Talk to Gwendis about it and she will say that they're probably part of a ward designed to keep non-vampires away. The presence of a vampire has activated them, so they should be easy to dismantle now. Gwendis will ask you to dismantle all of these crystals while she keeps watch.\nThere are three more crystals besides the one you found. The northern crystal will be in the tower up ahead. The eastern and western crystals will be in similar structures on the east and west of the island. When approaching the location of the eastern crystal, you will be attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;, who packs quite a punch, so come prepared. Once the crystals are destroyed and the ward is down, head for the castle. Once inside, talk to Gwendis and she will suggest an unconventional means of gathering the information you need. She brought a vial of Count Verandis's blood with her, which she can use to create a Dream-Walk Potion, a potion that allows you to experience someone else's memories. \nDrink the potion. You will find yourself in the body of Count Verandis, in an old version of the castle. You will be approached by a woman named &lt;a href=\"Steward%20Faustine\"&gt;Steward Faustine&lt;/a&gt;, who will inform you that Exarchs &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Tzinghalis\"&gt;Tzinghalis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Ulfra\"&gt;Ulfra&lt;/a&gt; want to speak with you. You can speak with Steward Faustine to find out the locations of the Exarchs. Exarch Ulfra will be on the western balcony; head north out of the room, turn left, then turn right. You will have a discussion with her about whether mortals should be seen as prey to be hunted. After you have spoken with her, head to the north and up the staircase, then right into Tzinghalis's laboratory. With him, you will discuss the morality of using mortals as test subjects, as well as whether vampires and mortals are equals. In both of these discussions, you, as Count Verandis, will defend the side of mortals. Tzighalis will also mention an artifact found in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; that might be interesting to vampires, but he will not disclose the details.\nOnce you have spoken with the exarchs, head for &lt;a href=\"Rada%20al-Saran\"&gt;Rada al-Saran&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber on the second floor, to the south. There, speak with al-Saran; you will discover that he and count Verandis are old friends, but that they differ greatly in their views on the relationship between vampires and mortals. Verandis wants peace and an alliance with Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt;; al-Saran simply wishes to leave the mortals be. Once this conversation is done, Faustine will appear and tell you that Verandis's study is ready; head out of the room and into the eastern hallway; it will be the first door on your left. On the desk, you will find &lt;a href=\"Verandis%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Verandis's Journal&lt;/a&gt;; try to read it, and you will hear Gwendis tell you it is time to wake up. Grab the Dream-Walk Potion on the desk and drink it to return to modern times. \nOnce you are back in the second era, speak with Gwendis and tell her what you have learned. She will ask you to lead her to Verandis's study to find the journal. Head up there, but beware the traps on the floor. Once you have reached the study, read the journal and you will find that Verandis conducted experiments to bring mortal souls back from the dead, but he considered these a failure when his test subject went insane and would not experiment further. He also mentions stationing a reliquary with some of his life essence here in the castle; this reliquary is necessary for his experiments. Tell this to Gwendis and she will suggest using Verandis's experiment as a means to resurrect one of the original leaders of the Gray Council and ask them what is going on. \nHead downstairs to go get the reliquary. It will be in an ancient chest in the central room. The halls are now filled with spectral enemies and a Gargoyle will attack you once you approach the chest, so take care. Once you have the reliquary, head to the ritual chamber, in the north. In the chamber, you will find a stone husk with four candles around it. Light these candles to start the ritual, then place the reliquary in the circle. You will see the ritual take place, after which &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Turvon\"&gt;Exarch Turvon&lt;/a&gt; will emerge. He will be hostile and very powerful, so this will be a difficult battle. Once he is defeated, Count Verandis will appear; He was the one who placed the wards around the castle, and hurried here the moment they were disturbed. He will ask to speak to you outside the chamber.\nHead outside and speak with Verandis. He will confirm that he was once friends with Rada al-Saran, and had tried to sway him to take a different course; to avoid war. He will tell you that House Ravenwatch will continue to look into the matter of the Grey Host returning, and will contact you if something comes up. Speak with Gwendis after this to finish the quest."}

He gets his name from his &lt;a href=\"Stealth%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneakiness in thievery&lt;/a&gt; and from the gray mask, the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Cowl of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, that he wears. The first Gray Fox stole the cowl from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; herself. The title of Gray Fox is passed from leader to successor by giving the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal to the successor. Since the successor then becomes the Gray Fox, many think that he has been alive for over 300 years.\nIn the book \"&lt;a href=\"Purloined%20Shadows\"&gt;Purloined Shadows&lt;/a&gt;\", a young female thief is enlisted to help a master thief. During a ritual performed by witches, Nocturnal is summoned, and she removes her cowl during the ritual. The young thief is hiding there, waiting for the master's signal to steal the cowl. Suddenly, the master's voice cries out, warning Nocturnal of the young thief's presence. Nocturnal turns and begins to strangle the young thief. The young thief, before she dies, notices that the cowl has disappeared. It is presumed that the master thief then dons the cowl and becomes the Gray Fox, activating the curse of the cowl in the process.\nIt is unknown whether the book is true or not, but it tells possibly the only full story of how the Gray Fox came to be in possession of the cowl. The names of both thieves are never revealed in the book; however, at the end of the Thieves' Guild quest line, the current Gray Fox names &lt;a href=\"Emer%20Dareloth\"&gt;Emer Dareloth&lt;/a&gt; as the true thief of the cowl.\nIdentity.\nIt is revealed later that the current Gray Fox is &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;Corvus Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, the Count of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. The curse of the Cowl caused his real identity to be erased from history, forcing him to continue his life known only as \"The Stranger\". Though he had been missing for ten years, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;, he lifts this curse from himself at the end of &lt;a href=\"The%20Ultimate%20Heist%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Ultimate Heist&lt;/a&gt; and returns to his wife, the Countess of Anvil &lt;a href=\"Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Millona Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;. He passes down the Cowl to the Hero to succeed him as Gray Fox and the Grandmaster of the Thieves Guild, thus they become the new Gray Fox.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Turning%20a%20Blind%20Eye\"&gt;Turning a Blind Eye&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Methredhel\"&gt;Methredhel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Amusei\"&gt;Amusei&lt;/a&gt; tells the Hero that the Gray Fox wants an audience with them at &lt;a href=\"Helvius%20Cecia%27s%20House\"&gt;Helvius Cecia's House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.

To do so, she traveled to the Stone of Hosiven. There, she discovered Grey Mehnir, a giant standing stone. While still amazed by its size, words started appearing in it:\nHeed the Stars, O pilgrim, and undertake their quest. Seek their six virtues, hewn into stone. Bear each command with a noble heart and return with the utmost speed. For only the swift and the just shall receive celestial favor.\n After reading the words carved into the rock before her, she swore to undertake the quest in order to gain the favor of the Stars.\nAfter reading the book, the Vestige will be tasked with an identical quest; Visit Grey Mehnir and complete the pilgrimage. After reaching Grey Mehnir, the Vestige will have to visit six prayer markers, all located deep within &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;'s most dangerous caves and tombs, they will have exactly two hours to do so.\nThe Pledge of Vigilance.\nThe Pledge of Vigilance is located within &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Nest\"&gt;Serpent's Nest&lt;/a&gt;, in northern Craglorn.

The caverns are populated by several &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as multiple &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; members. The prayerstone can be found in the northwestern corner of the caverns.\nThe Pledge of Simplicity.\nThe Pledge of Simplicity is located within &lt;a href=\"Exarch%27s%20Stronghold\"&gt;Exarch's Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Scars\"&gt;Valley of Scars&lt;/a&gt;.

To find the prayerstone, the Vestige will have to cross this bridge and make it to the area &lt;a href=\"Agganor\"&gt;Agganor&lt;/a&gt; is located in. The prayerstone can be found in the same area.\nThe Pledge of Piety.\nThe Pledge of Piety is located within &lt;a href=\"The%20Howling%20Sepulchers\"&gt;The Howling Sepulchers&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient Nedic burial ground populated by &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;.

Fort Amol serves as the regional bulwark for &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, but it is the second largest settlement in Eastmarch, bridging Eastmarch with &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nFort Amol is located in the southern forests of Eastmarch, where the White River meets the Darkwater River. Amol takes the traditional Nordic stronghold layout, with a large courtyard in the center, and the main building on the other side of the entrance. But Fort Amol is more than a fort. Amol Keep is used by a &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, who is well-revered in their home. Outside of the Amol Walls, is several encampments and minor buildings created by the Nordic travelers moving between the major cities. These buildings are located on the road between the two rivers. &lt;a href=\"Deldwine%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Deldwine's Inn&lt;/a&gt; was an inn that operated out of Fort Amol. East of Amol Town is an encampment where several groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; would operate in Fort Amol. The land itself houses various resources, prompting several settlements to be built around the area, including &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Knife%20Cave\"&gt;Lost Knife Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Fort Amol was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Harvald\"&gt;Thane Harvald&lt;/a&gt;, who was a well-respected member of Windhelm and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. Fort Amol became a host of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt;, a meeting between the leaders of the Ebonheart Pact, including &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic leader of the Pact. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Clan\"&gt;Stormfist Clan&lt;/a&gt; had arrived into Eastmarch and attempted several assassination attempts on Jorunn the Skald-King. During the Moot's visit at Fort Amol, strange occurrences accorded in the area, prompting a search throughout the stronghold. Eventually, Jorunn was found poisoned by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vurlop\"&gt;Lord Vurlop&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Skald-King's entourage, who was a secret member of the Stormfist. Jorunn was poisoned by powerful Daedric magic, forcing the Pact to give him powerful spiritual healing, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Ternion%20Monks\"&gt;Ternion Monks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mistwatch\"&gt;Mistwatch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dreamwalker\"&gt;Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt;. Lord Vurlop was assassinated by an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt;, an Agent of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Amol in their quest to recover the pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress of Amol was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Bandit\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt;s of the region, losing the significance it once had before the war. During the Civil War, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Windhelm amassed the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, a political faction active throughout the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;. The Stormcloaks retook Fort Amol from the local Bandits, using it as a bulwark from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. At one point or the other, Fort Amol was occupied by the Imperial Legion when they advanced into Eastmarch. It is unknown how long they garnered control but regardless, Fort Amol has generally been territory under the Stormcloak Rebellion of the Old Holds. Fort Amol was the center of militaristic control in Eastmarch Hold."}

Fort Ash is an important stronghold that is crucial in capturing the entirety of Central Cyrodiil. In recent years, the fort has fallen asunder and it is a shadow of its former self.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nFort Ash is located in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Road\"&gt;Orange Road&lt;/a&gt;, in between the town of &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;. Ash has a large keep that safeguards with a large wall, like the other strongholds in the area. During the Alliance War, Central Cyrodiil was split into three regions occupied by the different alliances. Fort Ash was located in the area held by the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and it was on the edge of that territory.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; led a rebellion against the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; in an event called the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt;. One of the first battles was a skirmish near Fort Ash where Aquilarios lost to Leovic's militia. Afterward, Varen took control of the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20Chorrol\"&gt;Legion of Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; and pushed Leovic's forces into the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt;. The Kings of the Colovian Estates banded together to truly fight against Leovic's reign.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Central Cyrodiil was split into three regions that were controlled by the three factions fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. The area around Fort Ash was under the control of the Daggerfall Covenant and it served as their protection from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in the south. Fort Ash was berated several times by both the Covenant and the Dominion and even the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, which has territory on the other side of the province. Ash along with other forts in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt; was essential for complete control in the region. If an alliance were to control, Fort Ash and those other forts, the most powerful warrior were named the Emperor of Cyrodiil. This position constantly shifted between similar candidates and this continued for several years.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter years of war, the formerly great Fort Ash was ransacked and destroyed, reduced to nothing but a ruined watchtower. Many denizens of the Great Forest inhabit the ruins and use it as a redoubt until they can no longer benefit from it. During the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of Fort Ash was inhabited by the local &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s."}

The fort can only be accessed via &lt;a href=\"Dayspring%20Canyon\"&gt;Dayspring Canyon&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;Stendarr's Beacon&lt;/a&gt;.

The Jarl's son, through his overly confident and adventurous pursuits, contracted &lt;a href=\"vampirism\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;. The Jarl refused to kill his own son, so instead commissioned the construction of the fort and contracted a large mercenary force, named the \"Dawnguard,\" in order to keep his son quarantined.\nDisbandment and disrepair.\nHistorical accounts vary on the years that followed. Some believe the Dawnguard were forced to put down the Jarl's son, in doing so they were banished from the &lt;a href=\"hold\"&gt;hold&lt;/a&gt; and officially disbanded. They later continued their work as vampire hunters, until they broke up, as people increasingly disregarded the threat of vampires, weakening the power of the Dawnguard. Other accounts claim that the Dawnguard, seeing the immense power that being a vampire gave, decided to become vampires themselves. They were said to have preyed on the people of the Rift until they were hunted down.\nEither way, the fort fell into a state of disrepair and was eventually abandoned.\nRestoration.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isran\"&gt;Isran&lt;/a&gt; came to the fort and repaired it with hopes of reforming the Dawnguard. Soon after in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Vigilant\"&gt;Hall of the Vigilant&lt;/a&gt; and killed numerous &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilants of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Carcette\"&gt;Keeper Carcette&lt;/a&gt;. In opposition to these vampires, the new Dawnguard would continue to grow, occupying the fort as their permanent base.\nArchitecture.\nFort Dawnguard has the appearance of a large castle with several towers. The masonry work inside the fort is not only very precise but the stone surfaces have the appearance of a slight shine to them. The tall arched hallways are supported by huge, decorative rectangular pillars. The inside of the fort itself has an arched theme to it, from the ceiling to the blind arches on the walls.\nInterior.\nMain lobby.\nThe main lobby is a large circular area littered with barrels and crates. Eight banners adorn the walls displaying the symbol of the Dawnguard. The floor consists of weathered cobblestone and decorative slabs that line the edges of two curved iron grates. Straight ahead is a hallway that leads to all the major ground floor rooms in the fort. When standing in the middle of the circle facing away from the main entrance, the second floor is to the right, the small balcony is another right. The large balcony is to the left, and left again.\nDining area.\nTo the west is the main dining area. The rectangular room is littered with general clutter and barrels of food. A grand fireplace decorated with banners and animal skulls sits to the side of the large dining table. Two cooking spits are available for use. Adjacent to the fireplace are two shelving units containing general silverware. Behind the shelving is a storage area of sorts. Barrels, bags and crates line the walls, along with several bales of hay and two disused kegs covered in cobwebs. A map of Skyrim is on a desk by a small table in a side room.\nCrafting area.\nThe crafting facilities are further west. To the left is a small room with an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;. The shelves contain some basic ingredients and potions, along with several animal &lt;a href=\"Skull%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skulls&lt;/a&gt;. Adjacent is a fully fitted smithy, including a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"smelter\"&gt;smelter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tanning%20rack\"&gt;tanning rack&lt;/a&gt; are on the lower level. The forge, arcane enchanter and alchemy lab will only be available if the Dawnguard are joined and the quests \"&lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Order\"&gt;A New Order&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Bolstering%20the%20Ranks\"&gt;Bolstering the Ranks&lt;/a&gt;\" have been completed.\nHeading past the smithy, the fort opens up into a large cave. Opposite the smelter is a small wooden pen built against the cave wall where Gunmar keeps his &lt;a href=\"armored%20troll\"&gt;armored troll&lt;/a&gt;s. To the south are two archery targets. Heading back west along the main hallway leads to the sleeping quarters.\nSleeping quarters.\nThe large square room features a dining table and another grand fireplace. Animal hide rugs line the floors and the walls are adorned with several mounted deer and bear heads. There are four cots on the western side of the room, and five cots on the opposite side. Shelving units on the western wall hold pieces of Dawnguard armor and weapons. Most members of the Dawnguard sleep here, aside from Isran, who sleeps upstairs, and Mogrul, who patrols the interior and rooftops of the fort.\nTraining area.\nHeading further west, the fort walls again end and open up into a large cave. This section is used as a training area and three training dummies are on a wooden platform against the north wall. In addition, a small dog pen is in the far corner, holding &lt;a href=\"Sceolang\"&gt;Sceolang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bran\"&gt;Bran&lt;/a&gt;. This cavern also leads to Dead Drop Falls. Beleval and Ingjard can be found here during the day training on the dummies.\nDead Drop Falls.\nDead Drop Falls is a series of caves that run deep into the mountains.\nMaster bedroom.\nThis room is on the second floor and is cluttered with boxes, barrels, and sacks. The room has a pillar in the middle, and contains a cot, a table, and a shelf. As the Dragonborn progresses through the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; storyline this room is upgraded into a master bedroom. The cot is replaced with a bed, then four wardrobes and a &lt;a href=\"mannequin\"&gt;mannequin&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0are added complete with Dawnguard armor. Dawnguard banners, candles, rugs, and mounts with wolf and moose heads decorate the room. A weapon rack is added, and there are two troughs which hold weapons and ingredients. Five steel ingots and two bolt quivers are also in the room for the taking.\nTorture room.\nA blood-splattered room up on the second floor. There are various torture devices in the room, along with blood and bones everywhere. Human skulls sit on two shelves while eight deer skulls are mounted on the wall. There is plenty of &lt;a href=\"Nord%20Mead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord mead&lt;/a&gt; on the wall and some &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt; as well. On the table, there are several torture tools, as well as a single septim. Large cobwebs hang from the ceiling as with much of the rest of the fort.\nRooftop.\nThere are three sets of stairs that lead to different parts of the roof. Two sets of stairs each open to a small circular battlement with two &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bedrolls&lt;/a&gt; and a chest. There are two weapon racks parallel to each other on each rooftop. On the rooftop nearest to Dead Drop Falls, there is a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lusty%20Argonian%20Maid\"&gt;The Lusty Argonian Maid&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20helmet\"&gt;Dawnguard helmet&lt;/a&gt;, and a pair of &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20gauntlets\"&gt;Dawnguard gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;. On the rooftop nearest to the entrance and the stairs to the second floor, there is a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Talos%20Mistake\"&gt;The Talos Mistake&lt;/a&gt;\" and an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Talos%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Talos&lt;/a&gt; sitting on two barrels. Beside one of the bedrolls, the skill book \"&lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2001%20-%20Morning%20Star\"&gt;2920, vol 01 - Morning Star&lt;/a&gt;\" is located. The third set of stairs goes to a part of the roof that is significantly larger. On this rooftop there are five weapon racks, two chests, a tanning rack and a grindstone. There is also a table with two chairs, a bedroll, a &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20shield\"&gt;Dawnguard shield&lt;/a&gt;, and a pair of &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20boots\"&gt;Dawnguard boots&lt;/a&gt;.\nExterior.\nInitially, fast traveling to the fort places the Dragonborn some distance from the building itself, around where they met up with &lt;a href=\"Agmaer\"&gt;Agmaer&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Dragonborn's decision at the end of \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodline\"&gt;Bloodline&lt;/a&gt;,\" where they chose to side with Isran and the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;, returning to the fort over the course of the following quests \"&lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Order\"&gt;A New Order&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Prophet%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;\" sees the path leading up to the fort's main doors fortified with several sturdy wooden walls, each one guarded by a Dawnguard member, and the fast travel point bumped up to just outside the main doors. After the fortifications are done, a group of refugees set up camp at the base of the path leading to the main doors.\nCharacters.\nOutdoors.\nThe following members can be found scouting the outer walls in Dayspring Canyon:"}

There is a shelf on the northwest wall of the first room holding leather strips, four random books, a salt pile, and two potions of minor healing. In the second room, there is a table, with a leveled dagger and the book, \"The Black Arrow, v1\", on top, among other food items. After dispatching the chief/leader, grab the Fellhammer Mine Key from the corpse, loot the boss chest behind him and head back out to the fort.\nFort Fellhammer Mines.\nThe door to the mines is at the rear of the fort courtyard. Pick the expert lock, or use the key looted from the leader's corpse. There will be four bandits/Silver Hand inside. The mine is spiral-shaped, looping around and under itself before ending abruptly. A shaft connects the two levels. A tripwire/rock fall trap can be found on the lower level, although it is likely an enemy will activate this before it is reached. There are ten &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ore veins&lt;/a&gt; within the mine, and ten iron ores. Four of them are in a wheelbarrow located at the beginning of the mine, to the left, between two crates. There's a shovel over top of them; simply move it off to access them easily. The next three are on the second downward ramp into the mine (two at the top, one midway down). These ones may move slightly if they were kicked around during the skirmish. At the bottom of this same ramp, is another wheelbarrow with the last three iron ores inside (these are the only two wheel barrows in the mine, so they should be easy to locate). Around the corner from here is a table (the only table in the mine) with the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skill Book&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20and%20the%20Orcs\"&gt;Orsinium and the Orcs&lt;/a&gt;\" on top.

The road actually runs through the fort's courtyard, making the trip from Riften to Shor's Stone perilous if the fort is held by enemies. There is, however, a path that goes around the fort to the east.\nInteractions.\nInitially, Fort Greenwall is occupied by a group of &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. However, during the Civil War questline, it will be garrisoned by &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and become a quest objective given by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; to capture it to secure Imperial control over Riften and the Rift.\nIf\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is turned over to the\u00a0Empire\u00a0during\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;\" it will be garrisoned by Imperials and be a quest objective for the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nSublocations.\nThe fort has four interior sections. The main Fort Greenwall interior section is located on the north side of the fort. The south section includes the prison and the captain's quarters (which are connected). Finally, a &lt;a href=\"Greenwall%20Cave\"&gt;small cave&lt;/a&gt; is accessible from a well in the center of the courtyard.\nFort Greenwall.\nIf the fort is inhabited by bandits, this section will contain several dead bodies, presumably the bandits victims. A locked cage has a dead alchemist with a leveled alchemy ingredient. In the downstairs section, a wall-mounted cage contains more Alchemy ingredients. A &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; is available in the middle section.\nFort Greenwall Prison.\nThe downstairs section of the prison contains some &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt;. When occupied by either Stormcloak or Imperial soldiers, this area is cleaned up, and all evidence of the spiders removed.\nFort Greenwall Captain's Quarters.\nThe captain's quarters contains a skill book, a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Shrine of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, and a locked chest with &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; items. It has a direct access to the prison.\n&lt;a href=\"Greenwall%20Cave\"&gt;Greenwall Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cave has two entrances: one in the courtyard and one outside the fort in the rocky hill on the north side. The outside entrance can be used to sneak into the fort undetected. The cave has numerous &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Mushroom%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;glowing mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;. Past an expert-level locked gate is another large pool of water. The corpse of an Imperial Soldier floats near the ladder up into the fort and an unlocked chest is below him, underwater; next to the chest can be found a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; that reveals some details about the dead soldier's backstory. A bear may spawn here depending on the players level."}
{"id": "57057", "revid": "24908786", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=57057", "title": "Fort Greymoor", "text": "Fort Greymoor is an abandoned fort in which has become occupied by a group of &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. Although, it can be controlled later on by either\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, based on who the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has sided with during the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn remains neutral and clears the fort, it will be garrisoned by Imperial Legionnaires after several days anyway.\nWithin the fort's interior, there is a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; maid named &lt;a href=\"Agnis\"&gt;Agnis&lt;/a&gt; who will not be hostile by nature. She is a target for a kill contract should the Dragonborn join the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nThe fort is to the west of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;, and south of &lt;a href=\"Dustman%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Dustman's Cairn&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nInitially, the fort is occupied by bandits. The exterior of the fort is patrolled by six; one of which will not join the skirmish until approached closely enough. Within the courtyard, is found a shack and two horse stalls. The shack has a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt; inside. Behind the right-side stall is a chest with some loot. Another chest is inside the north tower (the one that remains undestroyed). To the left of this tower is a platform where the aforementioned bandit is found. Be sure not to neglect him, or the fort will not be cleared. In total, there are five entrances to the interior of the fort.\nSublocations.\nFort Greymoor.\nThere are three entrances to this area. One is obvious, seen on the large stone platform in the courtyard. Another is atop this same wall behind a pile of rubble, at the base of the ruined tower. A third entrance is found on the west side of the fort's exterior, dividing a stream from the base of the fort. Using the local map will make finding all entrances to this fort easier to find.\nIf entered from the courtyard, there will be three directions to choose from to progress through this area, all with bandits in the next room. Any of these skirmishes are likely to alert some bandits from the other paths. The paths that go straight and right are connected, leading back to this area.\nHeading right will be a large room, seemingly a large kitchen. Agnis is found in this part of the area. To the right is a wooden door with a bandit inside the room. Within this room is a bed, a dresser, and a bookshelf. Clothes, &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; are found in here. Straight ahead is a winding staircase where a bandit is patrolling. To the left is a small storage room. Some potions can be found among the shelves. Head down the staircase and into the lower level. Move along the wooden balcony to find some &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Pelt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolf pelts&lt;/a&gt;. Underneath this balcony is a chest with an adept-level lock. Three &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bear traps&lt;/a&gt; are on the ground here as well. At the end of the corridor, there are two paths. To the right, an exit to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. To the left, continues through the fort. When taken, there will be doorway with a tripwire to the right, leading to a staircase where a bandit patrols. The staircase leads to a room back on the upper level. A few potions and some coin are found on a small table to the left, a chest with a novice lock is under a larger table to the right of the next doorway. Proceeding through the doorway leads back to the first part of the area (with the three paths).\nProceeding through the unexplored path leads to a large dinning room with a bandit. There are two other doorways in this room; one leading to Fort Greymoor Prison (detailed below), and the other leading to an upward staircase (with a patrolling bandit) to the next room (with another bandit). This room has a boss chest (to the right), another exit to Skyrim (to the left), and the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Rislav%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Rislav the Righteous&lt;/a&gt;\" (on a pulpit near the next doorway ahead). The next, and last, room is a simple bedroom with a bed, a bookshelf, and a dresser. Some books and apparel are found here, along with a corpse of an Imperial soldier.\nFort Greymoor Prison.\nFrom the fort's exterior, there are two entrances to the prison, both leading to the same room. One is at the south corner of the courtyard, the other is atop this structure on the platform thereof. There is a third entrance accessed through the Fort Greymoor area mentioned above; it also leads to this same room, so it makes no difference how the prison is entered.\nIf entered from the courtyard, then the Dragonborn or their follower will likely trigger a bear trap the moment they move. There is a large cage in this room with an apprentice-level lock. The dead hunter inside may have some wanted loot. Leaving this room will lead to a short, winding staircase, where a bandit is patrolling unless already alerted somehow from the previous room. Next, is a hallway where the prison's cells are found, two of them containing more corpses. At the end of this hallway await two bandits around the corner. There, will be found a dead &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; sprawled out on a table. Also in this room is a chest to the left of the table, and to the left of that is a cage on the wall with a master lock (potions inside)."}

{"id": "56756", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=56756", "title": "Fort Neugrad", "text": "Fort Neugrad is a &lt;a href=\"Forts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt; in . It is one of the many forts in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline, the fort will be occupied by a group of &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has not taken a side in the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; yet and clears out the bandits, upon returning, the fort will now be garrisoned with &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legionnaires&lt;/a&gt;, with the tattered green banner that hung next to the fort's entrance removed and replaced with a pair of Imperial ensigns. If a side has already been chosen, the bandits will respawn after several in-game days, even if cleared out after a side is picked.\nDescription.\nThe fort is composed of a jail and a main hall. The fort is initially held by bandits. Upstairs in the southeast room is a boss-level bandit leader, possibly a &lt;a href=\"bandit%20chief\"&gt;bandit chief&lt;/a&gt;, who will remain inactive until their door is opened. They also hold the Fort Neugrad Library Key, which opens an otherwise pickable lock in the south side of the dining hall downstairs. Inside is a hostile NPC mage by the name of &lt;a href=\"Brandish\"&gt;Brandish&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Jornibret%27s%20Last%20Dance\"&gt;Jornibret's Last Dance&lt;/a&gt;\", a light armor &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt;, is in the library section of the main hall.\nAs a Stormcloak, the next objective after freeing the prisoners is to take out the remaining Imperials (about 10), and the Fort Commander with the help of &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt;. Up the stairs inside the building in one of the rooms is a ladder on one of the walls (easy to overlook).\nUp the ladder, on the roof, is a &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Maps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;treasure map&lt;/a&gt; named \"&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Neugrad%20Treasure%20Map\"&gt;Fort Neugrad Treasure Map&lt;/a&gt;\" (one of the twelve found throughout the entire game) that will lead to a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; across the lake.\nEarly in the game, the fort is occupied by bandits. The key can be obtained from the chief. After completing the Rescue From Fort Neugrad quest during the Liberation of Skyrim, the fort is occupied by the Stormcloak force that previously occupied the Falkreath Stormcloak Camp. This leads to the disappearance of the Falkreath Stormcloak Camp from the World Map and Skyrim. The fort is upgraded in the same fashion as Fort Greymoor after the \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Stormcloaks%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe bandits may still inhabit the facility even after completing the full Civil War questline if the player joined the Imperials, indicating they never sent troops to reclaim the fort once the \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Imperial%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;\" was completed.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20from%20Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;Rescue from Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn is given the task of gaining entrance to the fort, either by sneaking in via an underwater passage in the lake near the dock, or barging in the front gates, and freeing a group of Stormcloak prisoners.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;The Battle for Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must aid the Legion in reclaiming Fort Neugrad.

The entrance lies in the center of the collapsed central keep. A &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the central ruins as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Morning%20Glory%20Root%20Pulp\"&gt;Morning Glories&lt;/a&gt; growing along the outer walls are the only &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s of note.\nA &lt;a href=\"Fine%20Steel%20Bow\"&gt;Fine Steel Bow&lt;/a&gt;, as well as six &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Arrow%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;steel arrows&lt;/a&gt; and two shock-enchanted steel arrows can be found near a skeleton on top of a partially collapsed platform outside of the fort. Near the skeleton also lies a gold and emerald ring and a scroll, regardless of the player's level. Since Fort Nikel is located near the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and on the road to Chorrol, new players may want to take the time to collect the loot, as they may find it useful.\nSublocations.\nFort Nikel.\nIt's a grand example and one of the few locations where &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; fighting &lt;a href=\"Marauder%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marauders&lt;/a&gt; can be witnessed. Not much loot to be had totaling six chests and seven enemies, but witnessing the two sides battle can be enjoyable.\nQuests.\nNath Dyer.\nNear the back of Fort Nikel is a small lake. If examined, a rotten and severed body can be found floating in the water. It is the remains of &lt;a href=\"Nath%20Dyer\"&gt;Nath Dyer&lt;/a&gt;. If searched, &lt;a href=\"Primrose%20Leaves\"&gt;Primrose Leaves&lt;/a&gt; and a letter can be found. However, these items will trigger a &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; that can't be completed. The developers probably left this as an incomplete quest.\nIt is possible that Nath was killed by the bandits living in Fort Nikel. It seems that the letter was meant to be sent to an unknown woman in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, telling her to meet &lt;a href=\"Nath%20Dyer\"&gt;Nath&lt;/a&gt; inside the town, though apparently he never made it there to have the letter delivered or meet her."}

The fort consisted of a large, elevated bastion with defensive stone walls and towers, and a subterranean series of halls, rooms, and dungeons built into the bowels of the mountain. The Legionnaires outfitted their fortress with many traps, both mundane and magical, to defend themselves should the walls have ever been breached.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFort Sphinxmoth was abandoned by the Legions after the fall of the Second Empire in &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt;, then was traded back and forth for a generation between warring &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmeri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; tribes, suffering additional damage every time it changed hands. The fort was vacated by both sides after a landslide destroyed much of the upper works, and word of mouth says that nothing worth looting was left behind. By the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Fort Sphinxmoth was no more than an overgrown, forgotten ruin, occupied only by a &lt;a href=\"Sphinxmoth%20Bandits\"&gt;band of outlaws&lt;/a&gt; who made their home in the underground chambers. Their leader stored personal treasures in an ancient vault deep within the ruins, and the bandits refurbished many of the fort's old traps.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany northern skirmishes between the Bosmer and Khajiit during the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt; were witnessed at Fort Sphinxmoth, which was once again under Legion control. In the spring of &lt;a href=\"3E%20396\"&gt;3E 396&lt;/a&gt;, the war moved closer to the fortress, from which parts of the conflict could be observed.

The Vestige discovered the soldiers were rotting, and that the Covenant &lt;a href=\"General%20Serien\"&gt;General Serien&lt;/a&gt; had been raising dead soldiers at night to fight the Pact.\nGaryn then directed the Vestige to a hidden tunnel that led into the fort. Within, a Pact commander named &lt;a href=\"Walks-in-Ash\"&gt;Walks-in-Ash&lt;/a&gt; had a plan to unlock the sealed door and allow Pact forces entry: her grandsire had developed a potion that allowed the drinker to temporarily become a wisp-like entity. The Vestige slipped though a crack in the walls and unlocked the doors, and Pact soldiers attacked from bellow. The Vestige then proceeded to unbar both of the main gates, and Pact forces secured the courtyard.\nThe Pact forces then discovered that General Serien had also been raising dead Pact soldiers to fight for him. The way to the inner keep was thick with reanimated &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;.

The General transformed himself into a &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt;, but was still slain. Upon his death, his spirit cast a final spell that killed Garyn. Tanval, mad with grief over the loss of his son, attacked Holgunn and stole the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Heart\"&gt;Coral Heart&lt;/a&gt;.

Outposts can be travelled to using the Transitus Network like the fortifications. They do not count towards any of the Home Keep or Enemy Keep Bonuses.\nMechanics.\nCapture.\nAttackers must occupy two flagged locations within a\u00a0fortification\u00a0for a period of time in order to gain control of it. Utilizing &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Weapons\"&gt;siege weapons&lt;/a&gt;, every inner and outer wall, and the\u00a0fortifications' doors, can be destroyed. Guards appear once a\u00a0fortifications\u00a0is claimed, although the damage that the structure has sustained won't be repaired instantly.\nEach\u00a0fortification\u00a0is surrounded by three resource structures, within 60 seconds of travel time on foot, which control specific upgrades for it. Farms upgrade guards by giving them better abilities, mines upgrade walls, and lumber mills upgrade the fortification\u2019s doors. In addition to walls and doors gaining more hit points, there are also some visual upgrades. All of these upgrades occur over time while the same Alliance owns the resources and the\u00a0fortification. There are capture banners at each resource, and resources are captured independently of\u00a0fortifications.\nDefense.\nWhen a\u00a0fortification\u00a0is under attack, everyone in the zone will see an icon on the map that indicates the\u00a0fortification's assault\u00a0status once a section of its wall is damaged to 50%.\u00a0Fortifications in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; are linked together in a transit line. If an Alliance holds several linked\u00a0fortifications, its\u00a0members can fast-travel from one to another, unless that\u00a0fortification\u00a0is under attack. Masonry and woodworking kits can be purchased to help repair a\u00a0fortification's damaged gates and walls more quickly. Alliance wide bonuses are also awarded for taking and maintaining the territory of\u00a0fortifications, and these are applied in Cyrodiil\u00a0and Alliance territories outside the province.\nBonuses.\nIf an alliance control its six home fortifications, it earns the Home Keep Bonus, which gives a 5% boost to experience, alliance points, and gold earned. After an alliance controls its six home fortifications each fortification they capture after that provides the Enemy Keep Bonus, which provides the same boost to the Home Keep Bonus, but scales depending on how many keeps are owned, and at Enemy Keep Bonus II and up also increases Weapon and Spell Criticals. This goes up to a maximum of Enemy Keep Bonus IX.

{"id": "169211", "revid": "24124884", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=169211", "title": "Fortify Magicka (Skyrim)", "text": "The Fortify Magicka enchantment on an item increases the amount of &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; the wearer has, and by proxy, it also increases the rate at which Magicka refills when depleted, as long as the piece of apparel is worn.\nIngredients.\nThe following alchemy ingredients can be used Fortify Magicka:\nItems.\nEnchanted apparel with this effect can be found, purchased or crafted at an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; once the enchantment has been learned. The following items bear a Fortify Magicka effect:\nItems with the enchantment that cannot be disenchanted include:\nEffects.\nMagicka regenerates naturally at 3% of the Dragonborn's maximum magicka reserve per second. Fortify Magicka, for this reason, not only increases the maximum magicka reserve (\"MMR\"), but also the rate at which magicka regenerates.\nFortify Magicka Regen does not increase the MMR, but it does increase the rate of magicka regeneration.\nIn most cases where the Dragonborn &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;makes&lt;/a&gt; a potion or &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchants&lt;/a&gt; their gear\u00a0themself, the Fortify Magicka effect does not increase their MMR enough to increase the rate of magicka regeneration to the same degree that the Fortify Magicka Regen effect would. Fortify Magicka, then, provides the Dragonborn with more maximum magicka and slightly greater magicka regeneration, whereas Fortify Magicka Regen gives no extra maximum magicka but a larger increase than Fortify Magicka in magicka regen.\nFor example; someone with a MMR of 200 magicka points and no Fortify or &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Magicka%20Regen\"&gt;Damage Magicka Regen&lt;/a&gt; effects placed on them, able to enchant a piece of apparel with a Fortify Magicka effect for 20 points, would then receive an additional 6/10ths of a magicka point per second. The same character might be able to enchant the piece of apparel with Fortify Magicka Regen for a 30% increase in magicka regeneration. 30% of 3 is 0.9, so their magicka regeneration rate would be increased to 3.9% of their MMR. 0.9% of 200 is 1.8, so they would regenerate an extra 1.8 points of magicka per second, far more than the increase from the Fortify Magicka enchantment. (These numbers are not exact.)\nUsefulness.\nThe increased MMR from fortify magicka allows dual-casting spells that could only be single-cast before, and the casting of spells that cost too much magicka to be cast before. Thus, at the start of a battle, the Dragonborn's catalog of usable spells, and thus, tactical options, are greater. They can also sustain non-stop spell usage for a longer period of time and train the &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; for the schools of magic more quickly.\nThe increased magicka regeneration from fortify magicka regen allows the Dragonborn to resume casting spells after losing their magicka much more quickly. This increases their potential spell output more than a comparable fortify magicka effect and helps them recoup magicka lost because of hostile spells and attacks faster than a comparable fortify magicka effect would. Fortify magicka regen is a good way to level the Alchemy skill fast.\nCharacter Synergy.\nIf the Dragonborn lacks a large and diverse potion supply, does not receive significant spell cost decreases from their skill levels in the schools of magic or from perks or enchantments and has fewer spell options and spell uses at their disposal, Fortify magicka is very useful because it allows them spell options they otherwise would not have and gives them a little bit of extra magicka regeneration.\nIn the Effects section, it is stated that fortify magicka regen effects created by the Dragonborn generally increase their rate of magicka regeneration more than the fortify magicka effects they create.\u00a0This difference is proportional to their MMR. This is because the extra maximum magicka from fortify magicka, which is additive, is significant to lower level characters in terms of mathematical proportion to their MMR, because their MMR is small. However, as they level up and their MMR increases, the extra maximum magicka becomes less significant. The increase in magicka regeneration from fortify magicka regen, by contrast, is multiplicative, which means that it is weak when the Dragonborn's MMR is small, but increases as their MMR becomes larger.\nFortify magic becomes less useful as the Dragonborn's level increases for other reasons as well. As their base MMR increases, they receive spell-cost reductions due to their skill level in a given school of magic and applicable perks, and they acquire gear with relevant enchantments, they become capable of casting more, and eventually all, of the spells for any given school, as well as dual-casting them. This renders obsolete the advantages of fortify magicka that were so useful before.\nBy contrast, fortify magicka regen becomes more useful as the Dragonborn's level increases. Once they are capable of using most or all spells, they no longer have the option of moving on to more powerful spells in order to increase their effectiveness in combat. The only option at this point is to increase their spell output, which is important because, as they level, enemies become stronger but the power of the spells remain the same. However, enchanted apparel can make fortifying magicka regeneration unnecessary.\nIn general, fortify magicka is most useful for low-level magic-users who use a majority or all of the schools of magic to approximately equal degrees, and fortify magicka regen is most useful for high-level magic-users who do the same. As a magic user levels up, they may wish to transition from fortify magicka effects to fortify magicka regen effects."}

It is located southwest of Winterhold, somewhere around the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;. The nearest settlements to the Fortress of Ice are the townships of &lt;a href=\"Helarchen%20Creek\"&gt;Helarchen Creek&lt;/a&gt; and the city of Winterhold, with the ruins being not far from the road in between Winterhold and &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;.

Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in Oblivion. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the ruins of the Fortress of Ice in their quest to recover the pieces.\nAfter retrieving the first piece of the Staff from &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, the Eternal Champion was sent to the city of Winterhold after hearing rumors from the locals and being told through dreams by &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thelen%20Kaarn\"&gt;Thelen Kaarn&lt;/a&gt;, a mage of the Winterhold Mages Guild, knew where the next piece was located in Skyrim, but would only tell the Champion if they retrieved an ancient tablet from the Fortress of Ice. The Champion would then travel to the ruins and obtain the tablet from the monsters of the ruined fort. Kaarn would then point the way to the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, a vast ruin located near the city of &lt;a href=\"Snowhawk\"&gt;Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt;."}

There are also multiple flooded tunnels near the waterways, suggesting leakage and poor maintaining of the waterway.\nThe second floor is accessible through an ice staircase, and is the second bulk of the fortress. More extensive underground tunnels are dug here, but is generally similar to the first floor.\nThe second floor has new walls, with certain carved patterns, generally painted with some type of signifying color. An example being the \"&lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt; pen\" to the north of the second floor's entrance, marked with red walls with two red symbols. The chamber contains multiple Hell Hounds, and has a locked, fenced door. It's also possible that, sometimes, these chambers and specially-designed rooms won't have any purpose at all, such as the white, marked and stylized room off to the side of the \"Hell Hound pen.\"\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; on the journey to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress was kept running by a group of hostile Knights. The fortress was kept generally well-tended to. Although most of the doors have been heavily damaged, the wall designs and wall patters were well preserved.\nHistory.\nThe Fortress of Ice was originally the personal fortress and home to the legendary &lt;a href=\"Archmagus\"&gt;Archmagus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;, in turn with his personal testing grounds being his &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Arena%20Location%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Shalidor's time, the fortress was taken over by a group of hostile Knights, acting as bandits. These knights worked side-by-side with towering &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Golem\"&gt;Ice Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, making them almost unstoppable to the basic adventurer.\nDuring the Imperial Simulacrum of the Third Era, the Knights of the Fortress of Ice attacked an extremely important caravan destined to the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.

The Champion's encouraged to leave the area they're in, and sleep outside or in a dungeon so Tharn can, angrily, come to them in a dream bridge.\nEnraged the Champion is attempting to save &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, the proper emperor, across time and space Tharn will send a minion to ambush and attack the Champion, proving Ria's theory of Tharn's knowledge of you wrong.\nIf the Champion is not prepared, Tharn may send an opponent which is very difficult to kill. At lower levels, he simply should send a &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt; or the like. These minions could also look like basic Thieves, and Warriors.\nDue to how Tharn's chances of invading the Champion's dream bridges are rolled, it is possible that Tharn may not come in a dream at all. This is explained more thoroughly in the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Arena%20Quest%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; section of the quest, as it is not important as of now.\nAfter the possible ambush, the Champion should follow Ria's advice. Seeing she said to look for the Fortress of Ice, and seeing that the only lands of snow and possibly ice are in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Champion should travel to a city-state in Skyrim.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20Guard%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Belkarth Guard&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten%20Hall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Karthwasten Hall&lt;/a&gt;, the closest two towns, it's a 13-day journey. But, from Belkarth Guard to the nearest city-state, &lt;a href=\"Snowhawk%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt;, it's a 19-day journey. The Champion is encouraged to go to either the city-state or the town to begin searching for the Labyinthtian. Mages, priests, pedestrians, and street-entertainers should provide well enough information.\nWhile searching, the Champion will be told that there is a search going on for the Labyrinthian , giving note that the Champion should investigate around Winterhold.\nIf the Champion isn't already in Winterhold, they should travel to the city-state as soon as available.\nThe Mages' Guild.\nInterrogating the citizens of Winterhold will lead the Champion to Winterhold's Mages Guild, where they've apparently fallen on harder times after a caravan attack, and that the guild may tell the Champion about the Labyrinthian for a favor.\nWest of the city's gates the Mages Guild can be found; a large blue building. Inside, a mage can be found searching at the far back of the room, by the name of Thelen Kaarn. When spoken to, he will speak warmly to the Champion, a significant change from Queen Blubamka:\n\"\"Welcome, (Player's name), to Winterhold. I trust the weather has not affected you adversely? Well, it has come to my attention there have been certain inquiries about the Labyrinthian. My name is Thelen Kaarn, and I find this quite interesting. Few have sought out this legendary place, many less have found it. Perhaps we can do each other a favor. Allow me to explain. A few days ago, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; from the Fortress of Ice attacked a small caravan destined for our Guild. This caravan was to deliver to us an object of unimaginable importance, a missing tablet that would help decipher a part of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. This piece completed a map to the Labyrinthian. No doubt the knights returned their booty to their fortress, and are by now deeply ensconced within its walls. We could not hope to get in there and recover that tablet piece. We are not prepared for such an endeavor. If you would agree to attempt this, I would gladly tell you the location of the Labyrinthian. All I need is the missing piece to solve the puzzle. Will you agree to help us?\"\"\nThe Champion should accept the offer, and Kaarn will be pleased:\n\"\"I am pleased to see that you do not shy from danger. Enough talk then, here is the location of the Fortress of Ice. When you have the missing piece, return here with it and I will share with you the location of the Labyrinthian...\" Thelen gestures once and the location of the Fortress of Ice is magically inscribed onto your map.\"\nPreparation.\nProceeding the talks with Kaarn, the Champion should henceforth stock up on supplies. Kaarn will dispense potions and magical items to the player like any normal Mages Guild wizard. Inns are similar everywhere else except &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;: black brick buildings with crescent moon-shaped shutters on windows and a sign over the door with a mug of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Weapon shops look like blue brick shops with the sign of a sword over the door.\n&lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Strength%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Potions of Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Cold%20Resist%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Potions of Cold Resist&lt;/a&gt; are recommended, as are mages to purchase the &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Cold%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Resist Cold&lt;/a&gt; spell from the Mages Guild, as many monsters that wield ice-based attacks are found inside the fortress and can be very dangerous to a non-&lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; character. Being a Nord isn't required, though. The Champion should also stock up on &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Potions of Healing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Heal%20True\"&gt;Potion of Heal True&lt;/a&gt;, as there are almost no niches or raised platforms to sleep on in the fortress, excluding the Knights' Quarters (which have to be purged of Knights first). Healing spells such as &lt;a href=\"Heal%20True\"&gt;Heal True&lt;/a&gt; are also beneficial.\nFor both mages and non-mages, it's recommended to get an item ending in \"of Light\" to remove visibility fog. Some of the Fortress of Ice's ice-based enemies can't be seen with the low visibility, leading in many unfair deaths-by-ranged-projectile. This item can be found as an unnamed &lt;a href=\"Mark%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Crystal&lt;/a&gt; in dungeons, which can be identified through the Mages Guild for a hefty price, or simply by buying a pre-identified one through the Mages Guild.\nIt's also recommended to buy a sword of &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Weapons%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt;-rank or higher, if available. The towering &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Golem\"&gt;Ice Golem&lt;/a&gt; of the Fortress of Ice can only be damaged with Elven-make weaponry or of higher higher quality, such as &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Weapons%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Weapons%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Mithril&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Adamantium%20Weapons%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Adamantium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere's also no shame in raiding all past dungeons the Champion has visited, whether they be randomly generated in the wilderness or an important dungeon like Fang Lair or Stonekeep. Enemies and loot will always respawn when leaving to a city, and coming back to the dungeon.\nStolen Tablet \u2013 First Floor.\nIt's worth noting now that if the Eternal Champion dies at any point after acquiring the first piece of the Staff of Chaos, Jagar Tharn will taunt them in death, instead of Ria Silmane wishing them peace:\nThis change does not revert.\nThe Fortress of Ice is relatively below &lt;a href=\"Stonekeep%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Stonekeep&lt;/a&gt; in level of complexity, and farther below &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt;, but is unfortunately far more difficult with its groups of ice-based enemies. The objective is to get to the second floor, through a stairwell at the north-central end of the dungeon, a blue dot on the map.\nThe starting hallway holds &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Snow Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, who launch powerful &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Bolt%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ice Bolt&lt;/a&gt; attacks, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hounds&lt;/a&gt; of Fang Lair and their &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Fireballs&lt;/a&gt;.\nStarting from the Fortress of Ice and onwards, the Champion should turn to the annotated map which is always provided for the fastest venture to the objective in a dungeon. Latter dungeons past Fang Lair are very difficult to explain in words, without being done poorly.\nThe Champion will likely be greeted by Knights on their way to the second floor. Knights are very dangerous opponents, and should be fought with caution, as even a single Knight is a tough opponent to defeat at earlier levels. Considering that there are usually multiple Knights in one location, spanning from two to three, caution is advised throughout the entirety of the first floor.\nStolen Tablet \u2013 Second Floor.\nOn the second floor, the way to the Tablet is far more linear, though that does not mean it's easier to find. The objective is a small room at the north-western end of the floor.\nIt is very easy to get lost and go to corridors that lead to dead-ends. Again, the Champion should refer to the provided map for the rest of their adventure.\nThe Champion should beware of the numerous Ice Golems and Snow Wolves on the way there, as both have almost doubled in amount. Both can take the Eternal Champion down in seconds if they are not prepared, especially Snow Wolves, which spawn in pairs of two.\nAfter reaching the chamber door which guards the Tablet, the door will speak to the Champion and will give a riddle to open it:\n\"I touch your face,\"\n\"I'm in your words,\"\n\"I'm lack of space,\"\n\"And beloved of birds...\"\n\"What am I?\"\nThere are multiple answers:\nIf answered incorrectly, nothing will happen, the door will stay shut. When answered correctly, a \"roleplaying message\" will prompt:\n\"The door before you swings wide...\"\"\nOnce the riddle is answered correctly, and the Ice Golem standing guard inside is slain, the Tablet can be claimed from the floor. A roleplaying message appears, a reminder for the Eternal Champion:\n\"You have found the Tablet that Thelen Kaarn spoke of. Once he has hold of it, he can use it to decipher the location of the Labyrinthian...\"\nThe Champion should make their way out of the Fortress of Ice at their own pace, and carefully. They can choose to explore more for better loot and experience, but the Champion should return to Winterhold, and speak to Thelen Kaarn.\nThe Elder Scroll.\nUpon returning to Kaarn, he will happily greet the Champion, and praise them:\n\"\"I had hoped and prayed for your safe return. I see you were successful. Your deeds will be sung among the tales of heroes. If you will wait a moment, I will give you what I promised...\" Thelen fits the piece into a larger tablet, then reads what is written. He gestures for your map. With a feather pen, he inscribes the location of the Labyrinthian, somewhere in the Skyrim \"\", onto your map...\"\nSignalling the Champion is to leave, the Champion must stock up again on supplies, and make their way towards the infamous testing grounds of Archmagus Shalidor's Labyrinthian."}

Old Master &lt;a href=\"Ugbak\"&gt;Ugbak&lt;/a&gt; once said that relates to his upbringing in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone can see that Durak is small for an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;, and one could speculate that his brothers' bullying led him to pursue a mystical path, one unusual for Orcs.\nAs Ugbak tells it, Durak's story begins in Orsinium, where his lot was hard and lonely. Durak's life changed when he first heard whispers in the night\u2014whispers from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. Azura said Durak would accomplish a great task: he would come to Stormhaven and found an order of worshipers in her name. These \"&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Wardens\"&gt;Spirit Wardens&lt;/a&gt;\" would prepare for a time of chaos, when Stormhaven's people would suffer from a madness of nightmares.\nDurak knew better than to share these whispers with his brothers. He already faced ridicule for his study of magic and lack of physical prowess. Soon after, he left his home in Orsinium and struck out on the long journey to Stormhaven, carrying nothing more than his staff and the clothes on his back.\nDurak found his way to Stormhaven, but he had no idea how he was to found this order of \"spirit wardens\" or where they would live. Soon he despaired. One night, as he took shelter beneath the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Giant\"&gt;Weeping Giant&lt;/a&gt;, the whispers came again. The silken voice of Azura spoke of a path hidden in the hills west of &lt;a href=\"Moonlit%20Maw\"&gt;Moonlit Maw&lt;/a&gt;. At its top, Durak found an ancient abbey, abandoned and overgrown. This, he knew, would be the home of the spirit wardens\u2014and so it became our temple to Azura.\nUnder Durak's leadership, we are prepared for &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;'s plague of dreams. We were founded to protect Stormhaven from its nightmares, and we will do so to our dying breaths."}

The Agent will therefore have to seek out one of their Covens, and request that they summon the Huntsman.\nThe Miserable Blessing.\nSuccessfully summoning Hircine will result in the Agent receiving a vision of the Daedric Prince, whom will off the Agent \"a most excellent reward\" should they accept their quest. This quest, should the Agent accept it, is to put a \"child\" of Hircine \"out of his obvious misery.\" To do so, the Agent must track the \"child,\" a &lt;a href=\"wereboar\"&gt;wereboar&lt;/a&gt; to its lair and kill it, before heading to an apostle of the Prince to receive their reward: &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Hircine's Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith that, the Agent is off to slay the wereboar, whose lair is little more than one of the &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;. Due to Daggerfall's random spawning mechanics, the wereboar may not be the only example of Hircine's work, meaning that the Agent may have to keep slaying the Prince's progeny before they receive this notification:\nWith that, the Agent must escape the dungeon and speak with Hircine's apostle, residing in a nearby town. Doing so before the time limit expires will successfully complete the quest, with the Agent receiving their infamous reward from the apostle.\nRewards.\nSuccessfully slaying Hircine's \"child\" and meeting with their apostle will result in the Agent being rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Hircine's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful Daedric artefact. Furthermore, the Agent will receive a &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; boost with the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt; that summoned Hircine on their behalf, most likely the Glenmoril Witches. Conversely, failing the quest will not only see the Agent go unrewarded, but also cost them a reputation with the Coven.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

A thief in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, for example, might expect to be imprisoned for a number of days. By comparison, a murderer might sit for years in a dank cell awaiting some petty lord to decide his guilt.\nBe therefore careful in exacting your wrath upon those who wrong you. Though swift justice is to be lauded among civilized people, it is often misinterpreted as brawling\u2014or worse, grievous assault\u2014where local custom is used to a less efficient response.\nSimilarly, the rules of such far off lands do not appreciate\u2014or even allow\u2014challenges from below.

A central belief in the active participation of &lt;a href=\"Deities\"&gt;Deities&lt;/a&gt; in mundane matters can be challenged by the evidence of apathy on the part of Gods during times of plague or famine.\nFrom intervention in legendary quests to manifestations in common daily life, no pattern for the Gods of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; activities is readily apparent. The concerns of Gods in many ways may seem unrelated or at best unconcerned with the daily trials of the mortal realm. The exceptions do exist, however.\nMany historical records and legends point to the direct intervention of one or more gods at times of great need. Many heroic tales recount blessings of the divinity bestowed upon heroic figures who worked or quested for the good of a Deity or the Deity's temple. Some of the more powerful artifacts in the known world were originally bestowed upon their owners through such reward. It has also been reported that priests of high ranking in their temples may on occasion call upon their Deity for blessings or help in time of need. The exact nature of such contact and the blessings bestowed is given to much speculation, as the temples hold such associations secret and holy. This direct contact gives weight to the belief that the Gods are aware of the mortal realm. In many circumstances, however, these same Gods will do nothing in the face of suffering and death, seeming to feel no need to interfere. It is thus possible to conclude that we, as mortals, may not be capable of understanding more than a small fraction of the reasoning and logic such beings use.\nOne defining characteristic of all Gods and Goddesses is their interest in worship and deeds. Deeds in the form of holy quests are just one of the many things that bring the attention of a Deity. Deeds in everyday life, by conforming to the statutes and obligations of individual temples are commonly supposed to please a Deity. Performance of ceremony in a temple may also bring a Deity's attention. Ceremonies vary according to the individual Deity. The results are not always apparent but sacrifice and offerings are usually required to have any hope of gaining a Deity's attention.\nWhile direct intervention in daily temple life has been recorded, the exact nature of the presence of a God in daily mundane life is up to great speculation. A traditional saying of the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; goes \"One man's miracle is another man's accident.\" While some gods are believed to take an active part of daily life, others are well known for their lack of interest in temporal affairs.\nIt has been theorized that gods do in fact gain strength from such things as worship through praise, sacrifice and deed. It may even be theorized that the number of worshippers a given Deity has may reflect on His overall position among the other Gods. This my own conjecture, garnered from the apparent ability of the larger temples to attain blessings and assistance from their God with greater ease than smaller religious institutions.\nThere are reports of the existence of spirits in our world that have the same capacity to use the actions and deeds of mortals to strengthen themselves as do the Gods. The understanding of the exact nature of such creatures would allow us to understand with more clarity the connection between a Deity and the Deity's worshipers.\nThe implication of the existence of such spirits leads to the speculation that these spirits may even be capable of raising themselves to the level of a God or Goddess. &lt;a href=\"Motusuo\"&gt;Motusuo&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Seminary\"&gt;Imperial Seminary&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that these spirits may be the remains of Gods and Goddesses who through time lost all or most of their following, reverting to their earliest most basic form. Practitioners of &lt;a href=\"the%20Old%20Ways\"&gt;the Old Ways&lt;/a&gt; say that there are no Gods, just greater and lesser spirits. Perhaps it is possible for all three theories to be true."}

With that, the Agent is given the name of the vampire, its lair, and the location of Peryite's apostle as the Prince disappears.\nInside the vampire's lair, a &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in the same &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; that Peryite was summoned, the Agent will have to track down the vampire ancient. As there may be multiple vampires wandering the halls of the dungeon, the Agent will have to keep slaying the undead beasts until they receive the following notification:\n\"You have slain [Ancient vampire's name]. Peryite's revenge is complete.\"\"\nWith that, the Agent must escape the dungeon and meet with Peryite's apostle, located in as building in the town mentioned by Peryite. Should the Agent get to them before the time limit expires, the apostle will hand them Spell Breaker and complete the quest.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt; by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. Conversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

But since the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; is a separate entity from the eponymous city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor had intervened, where Ancano was appointed the advisor of the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;. Ancano's presence in the College was unwelcomed, many of the students and teachers were displeased, and he would be in constant clash with the Master Wizard, &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, a new &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; of the College had arrived, taking part in an expedition with &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; teacher, &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; to the excavated ruins of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. From there, the College retrieved an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, a large, mysterious orb of magical properties. This was the beginning of Ancano's plot against the College.\nAs time went on, both the College and Ancano started to study the Eye of Magnus, as the Apprentice sought information on the Eye, even commuting with the &lt;a href=\"Augur%20of%20Dunlain\"&gt;Augur of Dunlain&lt;/a&gt;, a student of the College many years ago. When the Apprentice had finally gathered enough data, Ancano had proceeded his plan, taking control of the Eye and casting out Savos Aren and Ervine from the Hall of Elements. After the two were able to break the barrier and confronted Ancano. Before they could do anything, Ancano released an explosion, killing the Arch-Mage and releasing magical anomalies in Winterhold. As the College subdued the threat in the city, the Apprentice was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, where they garnered the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. Ancano had sent &lt;a href=\"Estormo\"&gt;Estormo&lt;/a&gt;, an Agent of the Thalmor to defeat the Apprentice, but it proved in vain. With the Staff of Magnus, Ancano was killed and the College was saved. The &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; had appeared before the College and eventually took the eye back to &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; for further study.\nLegacy.\nBecause of Ancano's actions, hate towards the College of Winterhold had increased. Considering Winterhold's already weakened state, the explosion caused by Ancano's tampering with the Eye of Magnus had worsened Winterhold's condition. But on the positive, Ancano's tampering prompted the Psijic Order to take action, bringing it to faraway Artaeum. With the Eye of Magnus in far more capable hands, the magic world could very well learn more from it. But with the death of both Savos Aren and Mirabelle Ervine, the Apprentice was promoted to Arch-Mage, and Tolfdir was made into a Master Wizard. The Dominion had lost their connection with the College of Winterhold and was unable to garner any information on the Eye of Magnus, but with their Agent dead, the College would have likely been targeted by the Dominion."}

Tolfdir volunteers to join the Dragonborn with entering the College and dealing with Ancano once and for all.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;The Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Tolfdir aiding them, the Dragonborn breaches the magical barrier Ancano has surrounded the College with and enters the Hall of the Elements to confront Ancano, who mocks their efforts to try and stop him when he believes himself to be invincible now thanks to the Eye. When Tolfdir tries to hit him with a &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; spell, Ancano retaliates with a &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Paralysis\"&gt;Mass Paralysis&lt;/a&gt; spell, incapacitating Tolfdir so he can face the Dragonborn alone, and opening the Eye to render himself invulnerable to damage until the Dragonborn can close it with the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. After the fight, Ancano falls to the Dragonborn and is slain, and the Eye is taken by the Psijic Order to ensure its power does not fall into the wrong hands ever again.\nDialogue.\n\"Another new Apprentice, I see.

This magic is what makes them valued by the Cult of the Ancestor Moths, who live deep within the Jerall Alps at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moths\"&gt;Temple of the Ancestor Moths&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, Ancestor Moths are attracted to the grounded bark of the &lt;a href=\"Canticle%20Tree\"&gt;Canticle Tree&lt;/a&gt;, which are exclusively found in &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Glades\"&gt;Ancestor Glades&lt;/a&gt; throughout Tamriel. There is one sanctuary per province, such as the one in Skyrim, found in the Jerall Mountains of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, the Cyro-Nords revere the Ancestor Moth, as they produce &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Silk\"&gt;Ancestor Silk&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn, is made into clothing and even Light Armor. According to myth, Ancestor Moths collect the singing and hymnal spirits of the deceased, becoming Ancestor Silk, which is in a bright crimson. Making items from Ancestor Silk has been a tradition in the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; since their earliest years. The Monks of the Cult of Ancestor Moths would undergo a ritual, enchanting the silk. The Monks must chant the mantras to maintain skin contact with the Moths, should they be interrupted. The Moths blow up gloriously, only to return so that the Monks would continue their chants. As mentioned before, Ancestor Moths maintain a connection to Ancient Magic, which makes them emit a harmonious sound that gives a person that ability to read the sacred symbols of an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so would prevent someone reading the Scrolls from going blind, as did many Moth Priests that were unable to gather the Moths. The entire process is known as the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Ritual of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt;. Their chrysalises are green, and a smell of fresh grass and clean water."}

The knowledge and power of departed ancestors benefits the bloodlines of &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Houses\"&gt;Dunmeri Houses&lt;/a&gt;. The bond between the living family members and immortal ancestors is partly blood, partly ritual, partly volitional. A member brought into the House through marriage binds himself through ritual and oath into the clan, and gains communication and benefits from the clan's ancestors; however, his access to the ancestors is less than his offspring, and he retains some access to the ancestors of his own bloodline.\nThe Family Shrine\nEach residence has a family shrine. In poorer homes, it may be no more than a hearth or alcove where family relics are displayed and venerated. In wealthy homes, a room is set aside for the use of the ancestors. This shrine is called the Waiting Door, and represents the door to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere the family members pay their respects to their ancestors through sacrifice and prayer, through oaths sworn upon duties, and through reports on the affairs of the family. In return, the family may receive information, training, and blessings from the family's ancestors. The ancestors are thus the protectors of the home, and especially the precincts of the Waiting Door.\nThe Ghost Fence\nIt is a family's most solemn duty to make sure their ancestor's remains are interred properly in a City of the Dead such as &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;. Here the spirits draw comfort from one another against the chill of the mortal world. However, as a sign of great honor and sacrifice, an ancestor may grant that part of his remains be retained to serve as part of a ghost fence protecting the clan's shrine and family precincts. Such an arrangement is often part of the family member's will, that a knucklebone shall be saved out of his remains and incorporated with solemn magic and ceremony into a clan ghost fence. In more exceptional cases, an entire skeleton or even a preserved corpse may be bound into a ghost fence.\nThese remains become a beacon and focus for ancestral spirits, and for the spirit of the remains in particular. The more remains used to make a ghost fence, the more powerful the fence is. And the most powerful mortals in life have the most powerful remains.\nThe Great Ghost Fence created by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; to hold back the Blight incorporates the bones of many heroes of the Temple and of the Houses &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; who dedicated their spirits to the Temple and Clan as their surrogate families. The Ghost Fence also contains bones taken from the Catacombs of Necrom and the many battlefields of Morrowind.\nThe Mortal Chill\nSpirits do not like to visit the mortal world, and they do so only out of duty and obligation. Spirits tell us that the otherworld is more pleasant, or at least more comfortable for spirits than our real world, which is cold, bitter, and full of pain and loss.\nMad Spirits\nSpirits that are forced to remain in our world against their will may become mad spirits, or ghosts. Some spirits are bound to this world because of some terrible circumstances of their death, or because of some powerful emotional bond to a person, place, or thing. These are called hauntings.\nSome spirits are captured and bound to enchanted items by wizards. If the binding is involuntary, the spirit usually goes mad. A willing spirit may or may not retain its sanity, depending on the strength of the spirit and the wisdom of the enchanter.\nSome spirits are bound against their wills to protect family shrines. This unpleasant fate is reserved for those who have not served the family faithfully in life. Dutiful and honorable ancestral spirits often aid in the capture and binding of wayward spirits.\nThese spirits usually go mad, and make terrifying guardians. They are ritually prevented from harming mortals of their clans, but that does not necessary discourage them from mischievous or peevish behavior. They are exceedingly dangerous for intruders. At the same time, if an intruder can penetrate the spirit's madness and play upon the spirit's resentment of his own clan, the angry spirits may be manipulated.\nOblivion\nThe existence of Oblivion is acknowledged by all &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; cultures, but there is little agreement on the nature of that otherworld, other than it is the place where the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; live, and that communication and travel are possible between this world and Oblivion through magic and ritual.\nThe Dunmer do not emphasize the distinction between this world and Oblivion as do the human cultures of Tamriel. They regard our world and the otherworld as a whole with many paths from one end to the other rather than two separate worlds of different natures with distinct borders. This philosophical viewpoint may account for the greater affinity of Elves for magic and its practices.\nForeign Views of Dunmeri Ancestor Worship and Spirit Magic\nThe &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i cultures also venerate their ancestors, but only by respecting the orderly and blissful passage of these spirits from this world to the next. That is, Wood Elves and High Elves believe it is cruel and unnatural to encourage the spirits of the dead to linger in our world. Even more grotesque and repugnant is the display of the bodily remains of ancestors in ghost fences and ash pits. The presentation of fingerbones in a family shrine, for example, is sacrilegious to the Bosmer (who eat their dead) and barbaric to the Altmer (who inter their dead).\nThe human cultures of Tamriel are ignorant and fearful of Dark Elves and their culture, considering them to be inhuman and evil, like &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, but more sophisticated. The human populations of Tamriel associate Dunmeri ancestor worship and spirit magic with &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;; in fact, this association of the Dark Elves with necromancy is at least partly responsible for the dark reputation of Dunmer throughout Tamriel. This is generally an ignorant misconception, for necromancy outside the acceptable clan rituals is a most abhorrent abomination in the eyes of the Dunmer.\nThe Dark Elves would never think of practicing sorcerous necromancy upon any Dark Elf or upon the remains of any Elf. However, Dark Elves consider the human and orcish races to be little more than animals. There is no injunction against necromancy upon such remains, or on the remains of any animal, bird, or insect.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Policy officially recognizes the practices of Dunmeri ancestor veneration and spirit magic as a religion, and protects their freedom to pursue such practices so long as they do not threaten the security of the Empire. Privately, most Imperial officials and traders believe Dark Elf ancestor worship and displays of remains are barbaric or even necromantic.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; \"Necromancy\"\nThe Telvanni are adept masters of necromancy. They do not, however, practice necromancy upon the remains of Dark Elves. Sane Telvanni regard such practices with loathing and righteous anger. They do practice necromancy upon the remains of animals and upon the remains of Humans, Orcs, and Argonians -- who are technically no more than animals in Morrowind.\nPublisher's Note\nThis book was written by an unknown scholar as a guide for foreign visitors to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Armistice&lt;/a&gt; was signed. Many of these practices have since fallen into disfavor. The most obvious changes are those regarding the practice of Necromancy and the Great &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; today regard Necromancy upon any of the accepted races as an abomination. The Ghostfence has forced many changes in the practice of ancestor worship. With the vast majority of ancestors' remains going to strengthen the Great Ghostfence around the mountain of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, there are very few clan ghost fences in Morrowind. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; discourages such practices among the Houses as selfish. The upkeep of family tombs and private Waiting Doors has also fallen into disfavor, as very few remains have been buried in these tombs and shrines since the Armistice. In recent years most Dunmer venerate a small portion of their ancestor's remains kept at a local temple."}

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; meets one of &lt;a href=\"Narsis%20Dren\"&gt;Narsis Dren&lt;/a&gt;'s assistants, and is tasked with aiding the adventurer in exploring several of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell's&lt;/a&gt; ancestral tombs.\nBackground.\n\"Elfbetta, a personal assistant to the famed explorer Narsis Dren, informed me that the adventurer is investigating the ancestral tombs that dot the Vvardenfell landscape. They apparently uncovered an old scroll that hints at hidden treasure.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon discovering the Dreloth Ancestral Tomb, the Vestige will encounter a Nord woman called Elfbetta. When spoken to, Elfbetta will tell them the following:\n\"\"One moment... let me finish this though... Hmmm, what's this word? I wish my dear Narsis would return so I could ask. His handwriting is atrocious! Ah, well, I'll just write \"inky-black darkness.\" That sounds like the tomb he described to me!\"\"\nThe Vestige is now tasked with locating Narsis within the Dreloth Ancestral Tomb. Once inside the tomb, by following the pathways, they will find Dren standing infront of an ancient altar. When spoken to, Dren will say the following:\n\"\"Can you smell it? The dust of ancient &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; permeates the very air of this old tomb. Ooh, that's a good phrase. I must remember it for my next book! But tell me, what brings you to this lonely place?\"\"\nDren wants the Vestige to find out what the creature's true intentions are before they can explore the rest of the tomb. After following the stairs to the lower levels of the tomb, the Vestige will see a large shadow on the wall. Nearing the creature will reveal that it is actually just a small spider, however, afterwich the message \"\"The ominous shadow belongs to a tiny &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; feasting upon a long-dead &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scamp&lt;/a&gt;. Neither one poses any threat whatsoever.\"\" will appear.\nNow that the creature's been dealt with, the Vestige can start exploring the tomb with Narsis. Following Narsis will lead them through several rooms with some basic loot (&lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ash\"&gt;ash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pristine%20water\"&gt;pristine water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blueprints\"&gt;Blueprint: Nord Cart, Hay&lt;/a&gt;), and eventually the Ancestory Prayer Room. Once inside, the Vestige must speak to Narsis again:\n\"This isn't right. Where's the treasure vault? The hidden chambers? This tomb deeply disappoints Narsis Dren.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of tombs. Are you sure this is the correct one? \"\"Are you questioning my expertise? Ancient Elven is like a second language to me and scholars across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; revere my ability to make sense of historic gibberish! Still, I could check my notes again, just to be sure...\"\"\nAfter going through his notes again, Dren will come across a translation issue, and will exit the room. Following him will lead the Vestige to a &lt;a href=\"Grievous%20Twilight\"&gt;Grievous Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Dren asks them to defeat the creature, and meet Elfbetta outside once they are done. Speaking to Elfbetta will reveal Narsis exited the tomb in excitement, saying he was going to \"find a mage to open a portal.\". Furthermore, he asked Elfbetta to tell the Vestige the scroll wasn't actually pointing towards the Dreloth tomb, but rather the \"Veloth\" tomb. The Vestige will have to make their way to the Veloth Ancestral Tomb, which is located on the west coast of Vvardenfell, south of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, they will have to locate Dren within the tomb. Upon entering the tomb and following the path, however, it is revealed Narsis has again managed to find himself trapped:\n\"\"Who's out there? No, never mind. I don't care. I just want to get out of here. It's dark and it's cramped and it smells like an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian's&lt;/a&gt; armpit.\"\"\nThe Vestige must enter the room right of the door behind which Dren is trapped, and select the third panel from the left. This will open the doors, and free Narsis. After being freed, Narsis will engage in conversation with the Vestige, thanking them for their \"relatively minor contribution\" and urging them to search the tomb for a hidden passage. Following Narsis through the tomb will eventually lead to a large burial chamber, with four altars, and a mysterious harp at the centre of it, completing the \"Locate the Hidden Passage\" objective. Speaking to Narsis will reveal the following:\n\"According to the ancient scroll, there's a secret entrance that leads to the hidden passage somewhere in this chamber.\"\nFollowing Narsis' instructions, the Vestige must investigate the old tomb and discover it is an account of the lives of several Velothi family members. After reading the tomb, they must proceed to the engraved pedestal at the centre of the burial chamber. Activating the pedestal shows a piece of engraved marble reading:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nThe harp, as silent as brave hearts\nStands guard over four valiant souls\nHonor their memories with offerings true\nLlirala Veloth\u2014Her kindness and grace reflected good upon her family name\nOndre Veloth\u2014Master Archer of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;\nValyne Veloth\u2014Toasted her enemies, to their deaths and hers\nElms Veloth\u2014Nourished all but himself during the hunger year\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nAfter reading the pedestal, the Vestige must pick up the four items placed in the sand below them; a hand mirror, an ornate goblet, a sack of grain and an ancient arrow. Each of the items serves as an offering to each of the four Velothi family members. Offering the right offerings to the right family members opens the hidden passage and will allow the Vestige and Narsis to exit the burial chamber:\nAfter placing each item on their corresponding tomb, the Vestige must play the metallic harp in the center of the chamber and open the secret passage to the undertomb. After entering the undertomb, Narsis will say the following:\n\"Isn't it exciting? We're the first living creatures to set foot down here in more than a hundred years! This will definitely get an entire chapter in my book!\"\nConvinced the Undertomb contains valuable treasure, the Vestige must follow Narsis deeper into the tomb, defeating a &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Flayer\"&gt;Bone Flayer&lt;/a&gt;s along the way, until eventually reaching the door to the Undertomb Mausoleums.\nAfter entering the undertomb, the Vestige will face another Wraith, several &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, the Vestige will have to free Narsis again, who has yet again managed to trigger one of the traps in the tomb, saying:\n\"Damn these trapped spaces and their tempting gaps! I hate to be a bother, but could you get me out of here please?\"\nSelecting the second wall plate from the left will open the doors of the trap and free Narsis. The Vestige must then follow Nersis into a different section of the tomb; the Mausoleums of the Elders. Once there, they will have to solve a pressure plate puzzle in order to advance to the next section of the mausoleum.\nAfter solving the floor puzzle, the Vestige must follow Narsis into the next chamber, which has a stone pedestal at the center, and a skull placed on top of it, covered in gold and emeralds. After Narsis takes the skull for himself, a pathway leading to the Tomb of the Matriarch will be revealed. Inside the tomb, the Vestige will have to face several waves of skeletons, Bone Flayers, &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Dead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Risen Dead&lt;/a&gt; and at the end of the tomb, a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bone colossus&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Matriarch%20Rathila\"&gt;Matriarch Rathila&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter defeating the creatures, the Vestige can proceed into the treasure vault, where Narsis will tell them the following:\n\"My translation was nearly perfect, so how could this be? Where are the relics? The treasure? There's nothing here but some old crates and a decrepit old well!\"\nThe Vestige is now offered two options; either trick Narsis into thinking the treasure is located inside the ancient well and pushing him in, or tell him he can likely make the entire adventure sound good on paper. Either way, the Vestige will be rewared with a set of pauldrons and a leveled amount of gold."}

When you do so, you will encounter his ancestor, Dranoth, who will test your worth by making you pray at shrines to show respect to the Hleran ancestors, even when they try to kill you. This will impress Dranoth, and you will be able to enter his Burial Chamber and once again speak to him.\nHe will ask you to take the House's sacred weapon, Calderas, and show it to Drelyth. This will shock the Ashlanders, as they will recognize the staff in their own history. Drelyth will now be able to settle in Ald'ruhn, and you will be able to complete the quest."}

The old, established families, specifically those with the most wealth and influence, constructed tombs in which to inter and honor their dead. These tombs, scattered throughout Vvardenfell, provide a place of sanctuary for the physical remains of the departed, as well as a place of contemplation, reverence, and meditation for the descendants of their interred ancestors.\nInside the tombs, burial urns hold the cremated remains of the dead, while ritual altars and items of significance to the departed decorate the interior spaces, including beloved tomes, sacred scrolls, and mementos of well-lived lives, such as jewelry, armor, weapons, household goods, and even gold. Tombs range from large, spacious vaults with multiple chambers to small vaults with a single burial chamber.\nSome ancestral tombs are sealed for any number of reasons, but the usual justification boils down to one of two situations: Either the tomb in question has reached its capacity, or the family has decided to seal the tomb to protect the contents. In the case of the latter, the seal will be broken and the tomb opened the next time a member of the family dies. Then it gets resealed after the interment is complete.\nThe ancestral tombs that remain open often see activity on a regular basis. Many families regularly visit to pay respects to their ancestors, to meditate, or to perform important rites connected to the aspects of ancestor worship that remain integral to Dark Elf culture. If the families responsible for these tombs must occasionally petition the Tribunal or hire mercenaries to clear out a vampire nest or stray Daedric creature, such is the cost of maintaining an ancestral tomb."}

He explains that he is worried about his aunt, who ventured into their family crypt to stop a necromancer but has not returned for hours. In order to start the quest, you need to agree to help Golldir rid the crypt of &lt;a href=\"Vals%20Veran\"&gt;Vals Veran&lt;/a&gt;, and find his aunt.\u00a0\nAfter Golldir unlocks the crypt, descend to a connecting hallway, where Golldir's worst fears are confirmed; his aunt Agna lies dead in a pool of fresh blood. The nearby door is barred from the other side, so continue west, to a cave-in and through a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;-infested tomb corridor. The tomb opens into a deeper and much larger mausoleum with more enemies.\nEnter a circular chamber with animal sign carvings. Golldir will say that his aunt &lt;a href=\"Agna\"&gt;Agna&lt;/a&gt; told him that \"The bear would show the way.\" Look around to find the sign of a bear, and on its right side is a pull chain that will open a passage through one of the coffins.\nGo through to find double iron doors that lead to the main crypt and an audience with the warlock Vals Veran. The challenge is twofold: killing Vals Veran and keep Golldir alive (optional).\nVals Veran uses the teleporting spell and may teleport to a room hidden from the battle chamber where he will recover his health. He will then again teleport back into the chamber to resume the fight, and will resurrect draugr that have been killed to help him.\nIt is possible to kill Vals while he and Golldir are still speaking. The remaining Draugrs will continue their attack and Golldir will need to be protected. The quest concludes after the battle. If Golldir survives, he gives the Hillgrund Chest Key as a reward.\nSearch Veran's corpse for a Crypt Key and the Chest Key on Golldir (if he died), along with two missives; read them to gain a better understanding of the threats Vals Veran was imposing. Use the Crypt Key to open the iron door (hard lock) atop the ceremonial stairs, which offers a quick exit. Golldir's chest in the antechamber beyond can be unlocked using the Chest Key. Assuming Golldir is alive, he may offer to become a Follower."}

I have heard him say as much, myself.\nBut Tharn is no idiot. I feel certain he suspects that he has outlived his usefulness. With his daughter on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; and Lord Mannimarco filling her head with delusions of grandeur, Tharn's power isn't worth the breath it takes to declare it. The &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Empress Regent&lt;/a&gt; is easily manipulated with trinkets, silks, and rare delicacies. She has little fondness for her father and, to my knowledge, hasn't even expressed curiosity regarding his absence. And despite his years of political experience in the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Court, the old man isn't half the manipulator that Mannimarco has proven to be.\nTharn's greatest miscalculation is that he believes he still has value here. In the grand scheme of things, we are all expendable, he most of all. All of the power in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; means nothing to the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lord of Brutality and Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut Tharn's impotent tantrums remain a source of great mirth. I imagine I will tire of them eventually. On that day, I will pour a glass of fine wine and take enjoyment watching him thrash about, as his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; is torn from his body, like so many thousands before him."}

However, the closest city will change based on the faction.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter joining the Fighters Guild, find the Guildmaster to hear what she wants. She explains they have accepted an unusual contract. They have agreed to eradicate Daedric &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Anchors&lt;/a&gt; when they drop from the sky. Wherever they appear, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal's&lt;/a&gt; minions soon follow. Two of her guardians, &lt;a href=\"Merric%20at-Aswala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Merric-at-Aswala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aelif\"&gt;Aelif&lt;/a&gt; are investigating rumored anchor sites. Meet up with them outside the city.\nHead outside the city to find the two lieutenants, they have just defeated some Worm cultists who caught them off guard. Merric is delighted to get some help from the Vestige. He should be heading north as another cell has reported of a new anchor site. He wants Aelif and the Vestige to search the bodies to find anything, a note perhaps.\nMerric heads off and after searching the bodies for clues, a vision appear of a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; woman. Speak with Aelif about it but she doesn't know who it was but apparently the woman has Merric's soul. He must be warned and Aelif heads off to find Merric while the Vestige should go back to the Guildmaster.\nWhen Sees-All-Colors hear about the vision, she is concerned. She sends the Vestige to find her lieutenants while she'll rally their forces here and try to work out what this \"Vivicus\" is, mentioned in the note.\nTravel to the location to find them being ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Help them fend off the attack. Merric is seen running off after some daedra that fled the attack. Speak with Aelif about sending for the Guildmaster but she says there is no need. She also recognized the dremora from the vision, it was &lt;a href=\"Doshia\"&gt;Doshia&lt;/a&gt;, and the note found mentions an \"island tower,\" maybe it means &lt;a href=\"Dourstone%20Isle\"&gt;Dourstone Vault&lt;/a&gt; (or alternatively, &lt;a href=\"Buraniim%20Isle\"&gt;Buraniim&lt;/a&gt; if Vestige is Aldmeri Dominion]]).\nHead after Merric to find him, follow the marker to find the island in question. A ghost appear outside and calls for the Vestige, speak with him. It is &lt;a href=\"Jofnir%20Iceblade\"&gt;Jofnir Iceblade&lt;/a&gt;, the former master of the Fighters Guild. He says Doshia has taken Merric beneath the island, into the vault. She drains his soul for her master's dark plans. Hurry to save him.\nDoshia fight.\nWhen the Vestige first encounters &lt;a href=\"Doshia\"&gt;Doshia&lt;/a&gt;, she looks like a regular human. However, damaging her past 50 percent of her health reveals her Daedric side.\nDoshia is actually a lamia, a half snake-half woman creature. She only has two attacks in this form: an unblockable drain health ability and a wave she sends out in front of her. Therefore, it is best to attack her from behind or the side, if possible.\nWhile fighting her, she may summon three orbs, called The Feast. Destroying the orbs will give the Vestige back the health she drained from them. However, if they reach Doshia, she will get the health.\nAvoid fighting her near walls since she may summon The Feast near the walls and get the health almost immediately. Each orb takes about one to two hits before it is destroyed. Try to avoid her wave attack and destroy the orbs as quickly as possible.\nWhen Doshia is defeated, Merric will be released, but he will need to recover. Talk to him and he'll say Molag Bal is interested in harvesting souls of the faithful for his dark plot. Grab the book and &lt;a href=\"Doshia%27s%20Journal\"&gt;the notes&lt;/a&gt;, as it might contain clues to the \"Mortuum Vivicus.\"\nHead outside with Merric to find the Guildmaster and the rally from the guild. Sees-All-Colors is pleased with bringing Merrick back, but is concerned to hear about Molag Bal. They'll be deciphering the journal and will be sending for the Vestige once they've decoded it."}

Alternatively, it is possible to reach the peak from the opposite direction, but this involves a lot of jumping and climbing. Eventually the Dragonborn can reach the peak directly behind the dragon. To use this route, from the door to &lt;a href=\"Bloodlet%20Throne\"&gt;Bloodlet Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn should head directly towards the marker for Ancient's Ascent. At a rock wall, proceeding to the left edge, with only a couple jumps the Dragonborn may slip over the rock face. If stealthy, this makes for a perfect sneak attack before the dragon awakens. A horse will make either climbing route significantly easier.\nAnother stealthy route is to approach from &lt;a href=\"Angi%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Angi's Camp&lt;/a&gt;. At the fork in the road, the Dragonborn should go to the right. Then the path can be followed to Ancient's Ascent.\nIn front of the Word Wall is a chest containing loot."}

It has the potential to deplete half of an opponents starting health, meaning that two direct attacks from it can end the game. The card has no keywords or effects and is thus vulnerable.
