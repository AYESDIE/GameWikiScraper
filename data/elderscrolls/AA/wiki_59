After a failed assassination attempt on &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; and the near-destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, it is time to finish the Brotherhood's greatest contract in centuries. This is the final contract-based quest in the Dark Brotherhood questline; however, it is not the final quest.\nBackground.\n\"The Night Mother has spoken to me once again. The true Emperor must be assassinated - the contract with Amaund Motierre must be completed.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest begins by talking to &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt; and telling him the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; has spoken, and thus the contract is still on. He will direct the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt;, who is hiding out in the back room of &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmaund will reveal that the Emperor is on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Katariah\"&gt;The Katariah&lt;/a&gt;\", which is a ship about to leave &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. He also mentions that &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Maro\"&gt;Commander Maro&lt;/a&gt; will be at the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Warehouse\"&gt;East Empire Company Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; docks, should the Dragonborn wish to pay him a \"visit.\"\nKilling Commander Maro.\nMaro can be found on the docks of the East Empire Company Warehouse, near an unnamed docked ship. He will be surprised that the Dragonborn is alive and will turn hostile. It is possible to walk onto the archway over the water and shoot him from afar, but unless he is killed with the first shot, he will start moving around, fighting with &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt;. A more direct way is to go down to the docks and kill him, then flee from the guards towards \"The Katariah\". However, this will earn a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; if witnessed, and there are very few hiding places on the docks for sneak attacks.\nAnother tactic is to approach the warehouse from the west, starting from either &lt;a href=\"Katla%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Katla's Farm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20Sawmill\"&gt;Solitude Sawmill&lt;/a&gt;. Go down the wooden stairs/walkway, but rather than going all the way to the dock, jump off into the water and swim toward the dock staying close to the rocks on the left. Upon reaching the area that is under the last landing before reaching the dock, there is a section of land large enough to stand upon. From this position, the Dragonborn can get a clear view of Maro, and can easily shoot him unobserved. Also, as already mentioned, one will need to kill him with the first shot, so it is best to use a high-damage bow and arrow.\nOne can also wait until nightfall and sneak up behind Maro from the inlet and knife him from behind. If one is wearing &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Gloves\"&gt;Shrouded Gloves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Hand%20Wraps\"&gt;Shrouded Hand Wraps&lt;/a&gt; and has a good &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; skill, he can be killed in one stab.\nThe simplest way is by talking to Maro with a clean bounty\u2014 he will attack, and the guards may help kill him (at the least, they will be indifferent and no bounty is incurred unless a guard is accidentally hit). If the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt; is finished, there will be Stormcloak Guards on the docks that will help kill Maro.\nKilling the Emperor.\nThe next step is to swim to \"The Katariah\", which is anchored in the water under Solitude. To get inside, the Dragonborn should swim around the hull to the anchor chain, then activate it. If is installed, and the Dragonborn knows all three words for the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout, riding a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; and landing it on the ship is also an option.\nOn board the ship, there will be several low level Sailors and more dangerous &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; agents. The winding, narrow passages inside the ship offer ample cover for a stealthy approach, but none of the ship's occupants are especially powerful. Alerting one will not necessarily alert the rest of the ship, but only those enemies who happen to be close by.\nProceeding south through a dining room leads to stairs up to the main deck. A locked door (expert) to the aft (north) cabins is at the top of these stairs. The key to this door (and all doors on the ship) is held by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Avidius\"&gt;Captain Avidius&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found in a forward cabin (in the southwest corner of the ship). The key can also be obtained by killing the lieutenant who is in the room directly below the Emperor. Either the key can be used or the lock\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;picked&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to allow entrance to the aft cabin area. Upon entering, there is a room to the left with one Penitus Oculatus agent, and one to the right with two that has smoke rising from the floor. At the north end of the area is another room with &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Salvarus\"&gt;Lieutenant Salvarus&lt;/a&gt;. Up the stairs in either the northwest or northeast corner is a master-level locked door to the Emperor's Quarters (that can be opened with the key).\nOnce inside, the Emperor will start talking. He accepts his death, stating that this is destiny. He will ask a favor however: kill whomever assigned the contract. He gets up from his chair and turns his back to stare out a window, allowing an easy kill.\nBefore leaving, the door to the left should not be overlooked. It leads to the Emperor's sleeping quarters with jewelry, gems, and armor to be taken. Two sets of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Robes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Emperor's Robes&lt;/a&gt; can be looted\u2014\u2014 one off of the Emperor and one set in the bedroom. It is a possible location for &lt;a href=\"Meridia%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;Meridia's Beacon&lt;/a&gt;.\nReport to Amaund Motierre.\nAfter the Emperor has been killed, there is a conveniently placed door to his right that leads outside. After jumping off and escaping the ship, the Dragonborn should return to the Bannered Mare to talk to Amaund. He reveals the payment is in a dead drop in &lt;a href=\"Volunruud\"&gt;Volunruud&lt;/a&gt;. In the same chamber where Amaund was first met, there is a 20,000 payment in an urn.\nKilling Amaund Motierre.\nOnce Amaund gives the location of the reward, he can be killed immediately. This can also be done after returning from Volunruud, or at any later date. This will yield no particular reward, except a handful of valuable gems which can also be pickpocketed from his inventory without killing him. If he is killed, his dying words are \"But we had a deal...\"\nReport to Nazir.\nAfter returning to Nazir at the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, he asks how much Amaund left as a reward. The Dragonborn can lie about the reward, but it does not change anything. Either way, Nazir will suggest speaking to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; about repairing the Dawnstar Sanctuary with the gold from the reward. In return, Nazir says that once the repairs are complete, he will start recruiting new members to the Dark Brotherhood. This completes the quest and begins the next, \"&lt;a href=\"Where%20You%20Hang%20Your%20Enemy%27s%20Head\"&gt;Where You Hang Your Enemy's Head&lt;/a&gt;.\" The gold is kept as the Dragonborn's reward\u2014 upgrading the Sanctuary is optional.\nWhen climbing the stairs to exit the Sanctuary after the quest is complete, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will speak to the Dragonborn, asking them to come close to her to receive her words.\n\"It is done.

They then married that same year. Hakan and Cyrus became good friends, with Cyrus looking up to him as somewhat of an older brother. Hakan often spoke to him of the political conflicts, influencing the young Cyrus. Izsara told Cyrus that Hakan was a wonderful husband, but at times he was often away busy with political matters or training with the Forebears. \n&lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20and%20Iszara%27s%20Father\"&gt;Cyrus's father&lt;/a&gt; wrote a play about the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; arriving from &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; driving away the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to make way for the High King.

Hakan, however, in a drunken state, called the old play-write a liar and Cyrus in turn challenged him to a duel. Iszara pleaded the drunken Hakan to stop what he was doing; in his response he struck her with his hand. Cyrus, enraged, pierced Hakan in the chest, killing him.\nAshamed and now an enemy of the Forebears, Cyrus ran away from Sentinel, an event that changed his life and reputation."}

He was supposedly a formidable warrior in combat and was said to charge into battle wearing a\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20Armor\"&gt;gleaming set of Stalhrim armor&lt;/a&gt; while wielding his twin &lt;a href=\"scimitar\"&gt;scimitar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bloodscythe\"&gt;Bloodscythe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soulrender\"&gt;Soulrender&lt;/a&gt;. He also was known for his rages and fits of madness. His own crew was said to tremble in his presence and he supposedly delighted in torture and murder for its own sake.\nA legend among the pirates and pirate kings of the north, he was said to have lived an unnaturally long life which led to several rumors of how he achieved this. Some believed he fed upon the blood and souls of those he killed to extend his life, others thought him a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, loosed upon the mortal world. Some tales even claim he made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; himself, and that the infamous scar across his face - the Deathbrand - was a seal of that pact.\nDespite his prolonged age, he was not immortal and as death approached he was expected to name a successor. To the surprise of his crew, he decided that none of his crew were either strong or worthy enough to take his place and treasure, even in his frail state. Instead he placed a curse upon the ship, his crew, his armor and his swords. His decree was until the day he could be bested in combat, nobody could have his treasure. His crew, deathly afraid of Haknir, had no choice but to accept.\nIn his final act, he then ordered the ship's quartermaster, &lt;a href=\"Garuk%20Windrime\"&gt;Garuk Windrime&lt;/a&gt;, to take a longboat to Solstheim and bury his &lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20Armor\"&gt;fabled armor&lt;/a&gt; in four separate locations on the coast. Meanwhile, he took his helmsman, &lt;a href=\"Thalin%20Ebonhand\"&gt;Thalin Ebonhand&lt;/a&gt;, and sailed to Gyldenhul Barrow. It was his wish that he be buried there with his treasure. Once he was put to rest, his men were free to do as they would.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Deathbrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe spirit of Haknir Death-Brand can be encountered deep within Gyldenhul Barrow at the conclusion of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Deathbrand&lt;/a&gt;.\" His skeletal remains can be found in the lower chamber, however located just behind him is a unique &lt;a href=\"Scimitar\"&gt;Scimitar&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Bloodscythe\"&gt;Bloodscythe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Bloodscythe is taken, the ghost of Haknir Death-Brand will appear. During battle he will summon several members of &lt;a href=\"Haknir%27s%20Crew\"&gt;his crew&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Garuk%20Windrime\"&gt;Garuk Windrime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalin%20Ebonhand\"&gt;Thalin Ebonhand&lt;/a&gt;, to aid him. Upon his defeat his other legendary scimitar, &lt;a href=\"Soulrender\"&gt;Soulrender&lt;/a&gt;, can be looted from his ghostly remains.\nCombat.\nHaknir Death-Brand is treated like a living being, as opposed to an undead like his generic crew. This is also true for &lt;a href=\"Garuk%20Windrime\"&gt;Garuk Windrime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalin%20Ebonhand\"&gt;Thalin Ebonhand&lt;/a&gt;. The spells &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Fire%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Sun Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Aura\"&gt;Stendarr's Aura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vampire%27s%20Bane%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Vampire's Bane&lt;/a&gt; are effective for dealing with his crew, but useless on these three. He is not, however, invulnerable to poison, which is also true for his named officers."}

I hastily assembled a lab in the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Saltbreeze%20Cave\"&gt;Saltbreeze Cave&lt;/a&gt;\u2014away from prying eyes. I fear that if my fellow &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; see her condition, they will simply quarantine her until it's too late.\nShe brought a friend with her\u2014a wiry &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt; named Gerwerdel. I fear that this woman may be too far gone. She paces constantly\u2014often muttering to herself. Already, dark, rigid splotches appear on her chest and arms. I will try to slow the disease's progress, but my first priority remains Norasea. She was a friend to me when no one else was. Now I finally have the opportunity to return that kindness. I hope we're not too late.\nEntry 2\nEmile and I brewed up a powerful antiseptic for Gerwerdel's stone-growths, but it's a palliative measure at best. Her behavior grows more erratic with each passing day. Despite Norasea's protests, we had to isolate her in one of our restraining chambers.\nNone of our curatives seem to have any effect on Norasea's symptoms. Emile and I work in concert, day and night. Honestly, I don't know what I'd do without Emile. It's only his love and attention that makes the long nights and constant failures bearable.\nEntry 3\nI thought we had it. Emile and I combined &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; condensate with a number of lesser reagents to create a highly-focused stone-shaping elixir. We thought that breaking up the keratous masses accumulating beneath the skin might halt the disease's progression. Instead, we seem to have simply broken the masses into smaller shards, encouraging a more rapid rate of spread. I'm at wits end. We may be too late.\nEntry 4\nEmile has an idea. I hesitate to commit it to paper. Our tests on the keratous growths indicated that they spread through vascular transmission. The disease converts elements of the blood into rigid grains that accumulate in the veins just beneath the skin, then calcify into larger and larger growths. It's the blood. The sickness is in the blood.\nOnce we arrived at that critical insight, Emile suggested he might have a solution: Porphyric Hemophilia-better known as &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;. I was aghast at the idea. But I trust his models. Vampirism, as we understand it, drastically alters blood composition. Theoretically, this reconfiguration could make it impossible for the keratous growths to form. We wouldn't be able to restore Norasea's eyesight, but we could very well halt the disease in its tracks. I must think on this.\nEntry 5\nAfter long consideration, I've decided to proceed with Emile's plan. I appraised Norasea of the details, and she agreed to go through with it. Now it's just a matter of reproducing the vampiric infection alchemically. The Sapiarchs would never approve of such a gambit, but I promised Norasea we would cure her. Sometimes tradition must make way for frightening innovation.\nEntry 6\nWe successfully completed the procedure. Norasea reacted predictably to the introduction of the vampiric affliction. As far as we can tell, our treatment was a success. We've seen no expansion of keratous growths, and her mental faculties seem totally restored. I told Emile that we must administer the treatment to Gerwerdel too. He seems very concerned about it, but I can't deny such a treatment to someone just because they are dangerous. I will give her the injection tonight. &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; help me."}

It attracted a considerable amount of the city's citizens, and as a result Uluscant's followers requested their leader be given more of a say in municipal matters.\nKing Dynar, a devout follower of &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, denied this request, refusing to share the leadership of Bisnensel with a group of scholars. Within a few months of his rebuff, Dynar was deposed as the ruler of Bisnensel, with he and his family fleeing to the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;.

He is the primary antagonist of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20in%20the%20East\"&gt;Rise in the East&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBackground.\nHe is the leader of a clan of pirates who call themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Horker\"&gt;Blood Horker&lt;/a&gt;s, who raid settlements on the northern coast of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, called the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Their attacks have nearly shut down the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Office\"&gt;East Empire Company Office&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;.

Anti-shock potions and enchanted apparel can be very helpful when attempting to eliminate him. Given that Haldyn relies purely on magic to fight, the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; can be especially useful for draining Haldyn's magicka to the point where he becomes harmless.\nAn alternative to this is to side-step all of his lightning while keeping a relative distance away from him so that one can safely attack him without him fighting back. It is advised to make sure that he is entirely out of magicka, as he can occasionally pause during his lightning onslaught.\nIf the Dragonborn wishes to choose a more a stealthy approach (and has a high enough &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; level), they may simply sneak behind Haldyn as he leans over his &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;, and stab him in the back. It is recommended that the Dragonborn dual-wields &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt; with the 15x damage \"Assassin's Blade\" perk (powerful enough daggers should kill him instantly) if they are ill-equipped to defend themselves against the barrage of lightning that Haldyn sends their way once he detects them.\nNotable items.\nHaldyn wears a full set of &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Plate%20Armor\"&gt;Steel Plate Armor&lt;/a&gt; (minus the &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Plate%20Helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;) and also carries &lt;a href=\"Horker%20Meat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horker meat&lt;/a&gt;, as is with most Blood Horkers. At lower levels, he may be wearing a set of Steel Armor (also minus the helmet), and if is installed, he wears &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Carved%20Armor\"&gt;Nordic Carved Armor&lt;/a&gt; on higher levels. In the room where he is found, there are various pieces of minor loot, (&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;, jewelry, and &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;), a scroll or spell tome, and a chest containing some level-dependent armor."}

Selene's Web is notorious for being one of the most dangerous regions in Valenwood and for being home to &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Changeling\"&gt;Changeling&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nSelene's Web is rather large than one can expect. Selene's Web is more known to be located on the southwestern edge of Reaper's March, the border region between Valenwood and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Selene's Web is also known to be located near the city of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, which is the epicenter of the &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; region, much further away than in Reaper's March. Selene's Web is home to all sorts of creatures, some of which are not seen in other parts in Valenwood, even in &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Giant &lt;a href=\"Hoarvor\"&gt;Hoarvor&lt;/a&gt; and the elusive Changelings are known to exist in Selene's Web, making the region very intriguing to the scholars of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Selene's Web is denser than the other forests and is heavily infested with swamps and decaying plant life.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, an expedition of Mages Guild members, led by &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20Carindon\"&gt;Warlock Carindon&lt;/a&gt;, set out into Selene's Web with the help of four adventurers. Deep within Selene's Web, the expedition encountered Selene's followers, ranging from primitive &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; to hostile fauna, as well as the various forms of &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\nSelene's followers were under the control of &lt;a href=\"Treethane%20Kerninn\"&gt;Treethane Kerninn&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating the Treethane and &lt;a href=\"Longclaw\"&gt;Longclaw&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Senche\"&gt;Senche&lt;/a&gt; tamer of the Web, the expedition proceeded against large forces of Selene's followers and came across a barrier that took quite some time to dispel. Deep in the forest, the expedition was ambushed, leaving only Carindon and the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; left. The expedition fought Selene deep in the forest as she used many of her forms including a giant spider and a Bosmeri Witch until she was ultimately defeated. Carindon captured her soul and took it back to the Mages Guild for study.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, Selene had escaped the Mages Guild sometime earlier and established a stronghold inside the forest. From there, she took the appearance of the High Priestess of &lt;a href=\"Shagrath\"&gt;Shagrath&lt;/a&gt;, a God of Spiders long forgotten by the denizens of Tamriel.\nSelene's actions began to manifest throughout Valenwood, specifically near the City-State of &lt;a href=\"Eldenroot\"&gt;Eldenroot&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Ulandra\"&gt;Queen Ulandra&lt;/a&gt;. After an ultimatum was delivered from Selene to Ulandra, \"...surrender Valenwood or die!\", Ulandra sought a way to eradicate the woman before she could cause any more harm.\nAt this time, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel was seeking the third piece to the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; in Valenwood and sought out Ulandra's help, hoping that she knew the piece's location\u2014the ancient &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Grove\"&gt;Elden Grove&lt;/a&gt;. The queen made a deal with the Champion: Ulandra would divulge the information, only if the Champion brought the \"Heart\" of Selene to her to have the upper hand on Selene.\nThe Champion ultimately raided Selene's Web, stole the \"heart,\" and gave it to the queen. In return, Ulandra pointed the way to the Elden Grove, the vast forest of Valenwood, where the next Staff of Chaos piece laid."}

The closest location to the Labyrinthian is &lt;a href=\"Stonehills%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Stonehills&lt;/a&gt;, north of the Labyrinthian. When sleeping, Ria will explain her divination of the location of the third piece of the Staff of Chaos:\nThe Champion should find somewhere less-safer to sleep than an inn, for Tharn awaits:\nAgain, it's also possible to for Tharn to stall for much later. When Tharn's ambush has been defeated, the Champion should remember Ria's task: searching for the Elven Elden Grove.\nThere are only three provinces in Tamriel that hold the Elven people: &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, home to the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Summurset%20Isle%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Summurset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, home to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;. The Champion should travel to one of these provinces and ask around for the Elden Grove, though there is a simpler method: simple analysis of each province's populated locations.\nDoing so will reveal a similarly named city-state to that of the Elden Grove in the center of Valenwood: \"&lt;a href=\"Eldenroot%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Eldenroot&lt;/a&gt;,\" about 2,200 Km from Stonehills in Skyrim. Traveling there, the Champion should interrogate the civilians about the Elden Grove.\nDoing so will reveal that the . The Champion should make their way to the palace at the north-eastern end of the city, conveniently to the left of the entrance gates, and have audience with Queen Ulandra of Eldenroot.\nQueen Ulandra.\nUpon seeking audience with Queen Ulandra, she will speak to the Champion about Selene, a high priestess to a \"Spider God,\" and her threats to destroy Eldenroot:\n\"\"You ask us for the location of the Elden Grove, birthplace of the sacred First Tree. Such knowledge has a price. Over the past year we have seen our beautiful Valenwood change. Parts have become unsafe for travelers, others have turned dark and sinister, leeching the very earthblood from the soil. Alerion, greatest of our Loremasters, found bodies of our people sucked dry of all fluid. They lay wasted, living dead that had no memories of their former existence. Sadly, they had to be destroyed. Ten of our &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20%28Class%29\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; left to search through the Valenwood forests hoping for a clue to this mystery. Two months later their severed heads were delivered to us by an emissary of someone who calls herself Selene, High Priestess of Shagrath, the God of Spiders. She delivered to us an ultimatum. Surrender Valenwood or die! We are not a fighting people, and have no standing army. We prefer to dwell here amongst the the trees and mother earth, rejoicing in the commune of the land. We cannot stand against Selene and her spider warriors. I fear an end to my people and our way of life. You seem to be a strong and formidable adventurer. I implore you, put an end to her threat against us. I will inscribe on your map the location her embassy referred to as 'Selene's Web', sight of our supposed surrender. Somewhere in those dark corridors lies the one thing that can safeguard us from her greed. Somewhere in her fortress lies her 'heart'. It is said to be a great jewel into which she has infused her lifeforce. If you bring us the jewel, she would dare not attack us with her life in the balance. If you are successful, we will share with you the sacred knowledge of the Elden Grove. Will you help us?\"\"\nThe Champion should accept her request, to which she'll be delighted:\n\"\"You are truly a compassionate soul. Know this, Selene's Web lies near the city of Eldenroot. I pray, be careful, she is a powerful sorceress who consorts with the undead. I wish thee luck on thy quest...\" Queen Ulandra inscribes the location of Selene's Web onto your map...\"\nThe Champion should leave Ulandra's audience chamber, and start preparing for their next raid.\nPreparation.\nSelene's Web is not much different than &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt; in comparison, for the dungeon is relatively unremarkable. The only true detriment is having to find multiple keys to achieve the objective: finding the Heart of Selene.\nIt should be noted however, that Selene's Web does introduce a powerful enemy into the normal mix: the &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;.\nWraiths have extremely high-powered &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; attacks which, when unexpected, will decimate even well-leveled characters. These Fireballs have an extreme range, so while likely that the Wraiths will kill themselves instead of the Champion, it isn't always the case.\nWith the regular upgrading and buying of armor, weapons and magic utensils, the Champion should invest some Gold into buying &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fire%20Resist%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Potions of Fire Resist&lt;/a&gt;, along with stockpiling some Gold to invest into buying the upgraded &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Potions of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Heal%20True%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Potions of Heal True&lt;/a&gt;. Mages will find it worthwhile to invest into buying better spells, and are encouraged to express creativity in creating new spells, as \"Arena\"'s spell-crafting system is easily exploitable.\nOnce ready, the Champion should head out to Selene's Web, home to the High Priestess of the Spider God.\nMating Dens \u2013 First Floor.\nThe closest civilized area is the city-state of Eldenroot, about a days journey from Selene's Web. The Village of &lt;a href=\"Archen%20Cormount%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Archen Cormount&lt;/a&gt; is two-days away, and the nearest town is &lt;a href=\"Wasten%20Brukbrook\"&gt;Wasten Brukbrook&lt;/a&gt;, four days away.\nSelene's Web is 80 Km southeast of Eldenroot, and in terms of size is comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20of%20Ice%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Fortress of Ice&lt;/a&gt;. The dungeon is relatively unremarkable\u2014except for the mass amounts of &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt; that live there, due to Selene's breeding grounds, but multiple &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Minotaurs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; and other creatures inhabit as well.\nThe first floor consists of a lock-and-key puzzle. The Champion must go to the flooded arena at the center of the first floor, defeat the spiders that inhabit there, and claim the key to the second floor. Once the Champion enters the arena, a \"roleplaying message\" will appear on the screen:\n\"Before you lies a small arena, surrounded by water. Something glitters on the stones of one island.\"\nThe Champion should be wary, as if they jump off the platform where the key is, the farthest right one from the entrance, four Minotaurs will spawn: one behind the Champion, two in front, and one on a diagonally-distant platform.\nOnce the key has been acquired, the Champions should proceed west, until they find a blue marking on their map: the door to the second floor.\nThe door itself is much out of place with the rest of the Web, a black metal door, that has a golden lock to it. Using the key, access to the second floor is granted, and the Champion should continue. The Champion could also use the &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt; spell to destroy the wall to the side of the door, or break it open with their weapon.\nSelene's Heart \u2013 Second Floor.\nThe entrance to the second floor is less-friendlier than the first, filled with the sound of Minotaurs.\nThe second floor is split into four quadrants, similar to that of a four-quadrant graph, split in the middle with a chamber. These quadrants\u2014with the exception of the fourth quadrant\u2014are immensely confusing\u2014all having winding tunnels, burrows, and a multitude of rooms.\nThe Heart of Selene is in the center of the quadrants, in a small central chamber, which is locked with a diamond-studded lock. This chamber can be opened with a spell, such as Passwall or a spell to open locks, but otherwise the Diamond Key must be found to open the door.\nThe Eternal Champion starts out in the first quadrant, the upper-left one. They should jump into the burrow to the right of the entrance, and proceed to the central hallway, near where the central chamber is. The Champion should follow a hallway past the chamber, which leads to the fourth quadrant, the lower-right-most one. When approached, a \"roleplaying message\" appears:\n\"\"DANGER!\"\n\"TRAINING AREA!\"\nThis hallway leads to the training rooms, where the Champion will be put through multiple gauntlets of Spiders to see if they can reach the Diamond Key, to claim Selene's Heart.\nFollowing the hallway and subsequent rooms will lead to a south-most chamber, which holds the Diamond Key, which is guarded by Barbarians and Wraiths. The Champion should drink a Potion of Fire Resist, as the Wraiths might instantaneously kill them.\nEntering the south-most room, two Barbarians will appear. After killing them, and approaching the right-most-side of the central-structure in the room, a \"roleplaying message\" will prompt:\n\"There is little dust here, and the footprints that exist are those of humanoids running toward this wall and jumping...\"\nThe Champion should lunge into the structure, and claim the key. Be wary, though. As soon as this message appears, two Wraith will appear in-front of the structure.\nAfter obtaining the Key, open the central chamber's door, and claim the Heart of Selene. Once the Champion has hold of it, they will monologue, reminding themself of the significance of winning the Heart:\n\"You have found the Jewel, the so-called 'Heart of Selene' that will protect the people of Eldenroot. You have only to bring it to the ruler there...\"\nThe Champion should make a hasty departure, and return the valuable to Queen Ulandra.\nUlandra's Gratitude.\nOnce Selene's Heart is delivered to Ulandra, she will be overjoyed and relieved:\n\"\"I and my people owe a debt we cannot begin to pay, (Player's name). You have given us a new hope, and for that we are eternally grateful. Come and stand before me...\" Queen Ulandra gently unrolls an ancient scroll, then takes a light feather pen and inscribes the location of the Elden Grove, somewhere in the Valenwood province, onto your map...\"\nThe Champion should take their leave, and start preparing themselves for the ancient home of the First Tree, the Elden Grove."}

A man who, once a &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;proud soldier&lt;/a&gt;, had become corrupted by a powerful artifact, and turned to a great darkness of deed. We fulfilled our commission, but not without great cost, as I alone survived the encounter.\nBut, in the many years that have followed this venture, I often wondered if our deed in ensnaring him was equally evil. For with our combined enchantments, we have bound him to an eternity of misery, for we bound him to the guardianship of the very thing that drove him insane, the artifact. A powerful weapon that now, despite his yearning for it, he cannot yield while he lives.\nIt is a cruel fate for once a great man, for he was just that until grief and anger laid him bare to such utter corruption and malice. That story is a sad tale indeed.\nBut now, these many years on, my heart sees the truth, and I would undo that which was done and free him from his misery. But alas, it is too late for me to take on such a quest. Therefore I pray that you, my son, will do this task in my stead. I beg you as a father's last wish, seek him out and set him free.\nYour father,\nSellonus"}

Eventually, Selveni snuck away from the Sanctum and made her way to &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to find and steal away Savela. However, the girl had already left the orphanage and was nowhere to be found.\nNot knowing what else she could do, Selveni returned to the Southfringe Sanctum, hoping that nobody noticed she had left. Bashnag, however, did take notice of her absence, and upon her return, accused her of trying to sell him out to the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, he cursed her ability to cast spells and chased her off into the depths of the sanctum, where she seemingly got caught in a web of one of the &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; that inhabit the cave.\nSelveni first asks to be cut down from the webs that hold her, and then requests further assistance so that she can escape the cave. After Bashnag and his circle of mages have been defeated, Selveni is told it is possible to escape through the cave's exit.

Eastern Senchal has a large variety of taverns and open-air markets on the three sides of the harbor. Senchal itself is infamously known throughout Tamriel, due to the amount of illegal trading from seafarers and &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; also buy fresh corpses from Senchal's black market to provide for their practices of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Black%20Keirgo\"&gt;Black Keirgo&lt;/a&gt; is especially known for being one of the most dangerous areas within Senchal, where many of its inhabitants become addicted to &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nA young &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt;, was born in the Black Keirgo District of Senchal. Rajhin stumbled upon a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20artifact\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. The ring would later make Rajhin one of the most infamous thieves in Tamriel, widely known for his many feats, including stealing &lt;a href=\"Empress\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim\"&gt;Kintyra Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s tattoo.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early First Era, Elsweyr was divided into sixteen independent realms. Dominance within the regions was determined by the phases of the moons. When the moons are at , Senchal is considered dominant among realms.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, Senchal was ruled by King &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Zel\"&gt;Dro'Zel&lt;/a&gt; and Queen &lt;a href=\"Hasaama\"&gt;Hasaama&lt;/a&gt;. On the day before &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Day\"&gt;Heart's Day&lt;/a&gt;, Dro'Zel was told a tale about a forbidden relationship that ended poorly. The tale left Dro'Zel very bitter and angry at the Bard that told him. As a result, Dro'Zel summoned the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; to demolish the city of &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt; at the time, was murdered in his palace in Senchal by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first recorded murder ordered by the Morag Tong. From that point on, Versidues's son, &lt;a href=\"Savirien%20Chorak\"&gt;Savirien Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, took his place as the Potentate of Cyrodiil.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, Senchal was the first location in Elsweyr inflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwords, it spread through the rest of Elsweyr. The flu had originated in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and later destroyed many civilizations in its wake, including the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, Senchal was sacked by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Legion\"&gt;Third Legion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The battle had been described by &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; as a massacre, as men, women, and children were murdered during the sacking.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; had at one point visited in the city in their quest for a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\nSenchal has had an incredible renaissance for twenty years that has made the moon sugar trade increase multifold. &lt;a href=\"Ya%27Tirrje\"&gt;Ya'Tirrje&lt;/a&gt; is said to have had a luxurious villa in the city.

I can feel massive &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; machinery still running beneath my feet, even as I write this, but I can find no way to get to it.

I wish we could study them while they are still active, but that is far too dangerous.\nI also heard a strange story about the centurion spider that we captured and sent back to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The ship captain I hired wrote to me with an odd story. He said that the spider nearly broke through its cage several times while near &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, but once he left &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, the centurion suddenly stopped working. What happened next shows that he had more wits than I gave him credit for. He ordered the ship turned about and as they approached Vvardenfell again, the centurion began moving just as suddenly. This is a curious phenomenon and certainly deserves more investigation.\nYour servant,"}

Sentinel is considered the guardian of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and has been the safe haven of the western world throughout the eras. Sentinel has been the modern capital of Hammerfell ever since the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, one of Hammerfell's political factions.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Sentinel is the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the more important regions located throughout the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom is located on the northwestern coast of Hammerfell, on the southern end of the mouth of the Bay. West of Sentinel is the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Myrkwasa\"&gt;Fiefdom of Myrkwasa&lt;/a&gt;, while to the east is the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Ayasofya\"&gt;County of Ayasofya&lt;/a&gt;, among other nations. Several smaller settlements live within the Kingdom including &lt;a href=\"Oso-Ij\"&gt;Oso-Ij&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zenotuza\"&gt;Zenotuza&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, the Kingdom of Sentinel expanded their borders well beyond their reach, taking regions from as far as the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Barony of Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Satakalaam\"&gt;County of Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt;. The local deity is the divine, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, who has the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Order of Arkay&lt;/a&gt; worshipping them around the city. The local knightly order is the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Candle\"&gt;Order of the Candle&lt;/a&gt;, who have protected the Kingdom of Sentinel for many generations. The &lt;a href=\"Selenu%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Selenu Vampire Clan&lt;/a&gt; are prominent in the region and other nations in the Iliac Bay.\nSentinel itself, is located on the northern peninsula of the Kingdom, overlooking the Iliac Bay. The city is rather large and well fortified from the east. The &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Bazaar\"&gt;Sentinel Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; is located on the lower end of Sentinel, underneath the bridge dividing the north and south end. The Sentinese Bazaar is one of the largest markets on this side of the Iliac, going across the Sentinel Canal and eventually the Sentinel Outskirts. East of the Bazaar leads into the eastern harbor of Sentinel called the &lt;a href=\"Wayfarer%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;Wayfarer's Wharf&lt;/a&gt;. There are ruins of Ancient Sentinel underneath the modern city which is where the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Outlaws%20Refuge\"&gt;Sentinel Outlaws Refuge&lt;/a&gt; is located. North Sentinel expands from the western harbor to the Forge. The Sentinel Square is located on the northern end of the bridge and houses the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sands%20Inn\"&gt;Sisters of the Sands Inn&lt;/a&gt;. South Sentinel is the home of the nobility as well as &lt;a href=\"Samuruik\"&gt;Samuruik&lt;/a&gt;, the Palace of Sentinel built by &lt;a href=\"Grandee%20Yaghoub\"&gt;Grandee Yaghoub&lt;/a&gt; during the Ra Gada Invasion.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nYaghoub the Seafarer; Foundation of Sentinel.\nDuring the first era, the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; traveled onto the deserts of Hammerfell and drove out the denizens of the province, forcing them into the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;. Many warriors of the Ra Gada would travel across the region, founding settlements for their people throughout the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yaghoub\"&gt;Yaghoub&lt;/a&gt; was a warrior from the Island of &lt;a href=\"Akos%20Kasaz\"&gt;Akos Kasaz&lt;/a&gt;, the main continent of Yokuda.

On the seventeenth of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, towards &lt;a href=\"the%20Steed\"&gt;the Steed&lt;/a&gt;, a Sentinel atop of Yaghoub's ship would notice a harborage on the northern coast of modern-day Myrkwasa, the location of modern-day Sentinel. Yaghoub named the area, Sentinel, after the person who had founded the area. The coast was riddled with patches of pomegranates, figs, and olives, making way for the warriors of the Ra Gada to land. The harbor was already taken by the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the region and the Yokudans had conquered them, making them the stonemasons and servants of the newly occupied Sentinel. Yaghoub had ordered the creation of &lt;a href=\"Samuruik\"&gt;Samuruik&lt;/a&gt;, the Palace of Sentinel and made it his domain. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; had followed &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt; that inhabited Sentinel and made Samuruik their home, many of the &lt;a href=\"Na-Totambu\"&gt;Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt; moved into Sentinel and eventually, the rest of the Alik'r. The Crescent Moon became the city symbol of Sentinel since the full moon loomed over the city gates.\nThe Order of Diagna &amp; the Siege of Orsinium.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Sentinel hosted the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Arena\"&gt;Imperial City Arena&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"King%20Joile\"&gt;King Joile&lt;/a&gt; sent a missive to Gaiden Shinji about the recent events regarding the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Kingdom of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Raids\"&gt;Bjoulsae Raids&lt;/a&gt; attacking several fishing villages such as the township of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. With the accumulative powers of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinel, and the Order of Diagna, the battle to take down Orsinium had commenced. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20950\"&gt;1E 950&lt;/a&gt;, the joint alliance began the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, besieging the walls of &lt;a href=\"Golkarr\"&gt;Golkarr&lt;/a&gt;'s fortress. Many of the Redguard forces tackled the fortress city of Orsinium, but also other Orcish strongholds throughout &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt;. Gaiden Shinji and the Order of Diagna fought the battle with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, the local knightly order in the Kingdom of Daggerfall. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt; of the Dragon was a close ally with Gaiden Shinji, both considering themselves brothers in arms.\nFall of Gaiden Shinji &amp; the Battle of Bangkorai Pass.\nKing Joile had a grander scheme planned out with the Siege of Orsinium. Not only did he want to destroy the growing Kingdom of Orsinium, but he craved the regions beyond &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; and desired the nations of the Alik'r Desert. Joile hired &lt;a href=\"Mercedene\"&gt;Mercedene&lt;/a&gt;, the Beast of the Reach to aid the Knights of the Dragon in the conflict, with plans for ending the life of Gaiden Shinji. Through manipulation, Mercedene had the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Sons\"&gt;Savage Sons&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt; partake in the battle and fight the Order of Diagna on the outskirts of Orsinium. Gaiden Shinji and Baloth Bloodtusk dueled each other valiantly, complimenting each other's fighting styles. Because of the honor of a duel, both sides of the conflict did not intervene in the duel, only watched as two warriors fought each other. Mercedene then gave the order to assassinate both warriors amidst their duel. She was fortunately defeated by a Knight of the Dragon. The Siege of Orsinium had lasted for thirty years and ended in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;. The forces of Sentinel were weak, playing into Joile's plan of conquest.\nThe forces of Sentinel were weakened and were retreating into the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; region, to rendezvous at the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. It was at the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt; the forces of Daggerfall under King Joile had cornered them, waging war against them. &lt;a href=\"Makela%20Leki\"&gt;Makela Leki&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singer\"&gt;Sword-Singer&lt;/a&gt; had led the retaliation force against King Joile. Leki charged into the Breton forces and cut off Joile's head with &lt;a href=\"Shehai\"&gt;Shehai&lt;/a&gt;, the Spirit Sword. While fighting back to her people, Leki was severely damaged, laid to rest on a rock where she drew her final breath.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Knahaten Flu &amp; Fahara'jad the Usurper.\nFor several years, the Kingdom of Sentinel has been under the control of the Forebears, dating back to the first era. During the early years of the Interregnum, the city-state of Sentinel was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Ramzi%20the%20Distrait\"&gt;Ramzi the Distrait&lt;/a&gt;, who was known as being one of the most pathetic rulers to inhabit Sentinel. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; had ravaged the western and southern worlds of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from far away &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;. The Flu had hit Sentinel greatly, and Ramzi saw this blight as a divine punishment for his failure as the King of Sentinel. As death approached Ramzi, he barricaded himself inside Samuruik, where he died alone, powerless, and food deprived. The plague had left Sentinel in a state of chaos, something that the Forebears took advantage of. Amidst the conflict, &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Antiphyllos\"&gt;Antiphyllos&lt;/a&gt; rose to power as the King of Sentinel, with his wife, &lt;a href=\"Za-Rifah\"&gt;Za-Rifah&lt;/a&gt;, the Flower of &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;. Many claimed that Fahara'jad was a usurper, a false leader, and many of the Crowns in the region believed that he was unbefitting of a leader. But he knew better, in order to instate his rule, he allied with the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuturah the Withered Hand &amp; the Ash'abah.\nDuring his reign, Fahara'jad had several advisors and royal viziers, each guiding them during his rule over Sentinel. One of these viziers was &lt;a href=\"Suturah\"&gt;Suturah&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the worst advisors but was secretly a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a forbidden art in Hammerfell. Suturah was insane and eventually killed off most of the other advisors and planned to kill Fahara'jad as well. But the King escaped his clutches and to avoid capture, Suturah escaped eastward, towards the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Tigonus\"&gt;Fiefdom of Tigonus&lt;/a&gt;. It was there, Suturah joined the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; and amassed an undead army called the &lt;a href=\"Ra-Netu\"&gt;Ra-Netu&lt;/a&gt;. With this unclean army, Suturah invaded the Kingdom of Sentinel. The forces of Sentinel issued the help of the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Marimah\"&gt;Marimah&lt;/a&gt;. The Ash'abah is a nomadic group that was exiled from Redguard society for not treating the deceased with the utmost care. Since traditionally the Redguards do not attack the dead, the Ash'abah were the only people who could fight against the army. Marimah slew Suturah and buried in the &lt;a href=\"Motalion%20Necropolis\"&gt;Motalion Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the Ash'abah remained exiles, living within the wastes of &lt;a href=\"Myrkwasa\"&gt;Myrkwasa&lt;/a&gt; till the end of their days.\nThe Dead Rising over Sentinel &amp; the Ansei Wards.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt; had risen throughout the Alik'r Desert, posing a threat to the denizens of the Daggerfall Covenant. Because of the abundance of Ra-Netu in the Sentinese Bay, the Withered Hand conjured an army of Ra-Netu and invaded the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Docks\"&gt;Sentinel Docks&lt;/a&gt;, having a minor holding in the city. The Covenant had luckily intervened, as they had landed on the Sentinel Docks after events occurring in &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of the Covenant had defeated the Necromancers at the Dock and saved the area. With news of this event spreading in Sentinel, the Vestige met with King Fahara'jad, to discuss the presence of the Withered Hand in Sentinel. Some of the Withered Hand had kidnapped the nobles of Sentinel including &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Azah\"&gt;Prince Azah&lt;/a&gt; to an alcove in the Sentinel Beach. The whole scenario was a distraction to enter the &lt;a href=\"Impervious%20Vault\"&gt;Impervious Vault&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Ward\"&gt;Ansei Ward&lt;/a&gt;s were stored. After entering the Vault, the forces of Sentinel discovered that the Ansei Wards were stolen, long gone in the Alik'r Desert. Fahara'jad gave the Vestige a quest, to find the Ansei Wards and to defeat the Withered Hand, he then sent the champion to &lt;a href=\"Morwha%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Morwha's Bounty&lt;/a&gt;, to locate the Ash'abah.\nThe Hammerfell Civil War &amp; the Siege of Sentinel.\nYears have passed since the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; and the man named &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; assumed the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the Emperor of Tamriel. As the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; conquered the land around them, the province of Hammerfell had their own problems to worry about. &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;The Crowns&lt;/a&gt; had their seat of power in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hegathe\"&gt;Old Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, on the western shores of &lt;a href=\"Khefrem\"&gt;Khefrem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt; had resisted the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; invasions to the east despite the declining kingdoms in their neighboring provinces. Things would take a toll for the worst when Thassad II was poisoned by the Forebears under &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Hammerfell Civil War&lt;/a&gt; ensued, divided the great nation even more. Leading the Crowns was Thassad II's son, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, who operated out of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Kingdom of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;, deep within the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict had begun with &lt;a href=\"Volag%27s%20Purge\"&gt;Volag's Purge&lt;/a&gt;, where the Forebears attacked their city when it was occupied by the Crowns, massacring the populous. The Prince was forced to retreat to Stros M'Kai, with many Crowns loyalist following suit. A'Tor sailed back onto Hammerfell later, slaying the Forebears and leaving a path of blood and vengeance.\nReconcile of two factions; the Imperial Province of Hammerfell.\nRealizing that they were on the losing side, the Forebears sought the aid of Tiber Septim, and so, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; had intervened, battling the Crowns. The Septim Armada was vastly superior to the Crowns, overtaking them in a matter of a second. In their wake, the Septim Army established Provisional Governments, to reinstate order in the war-torn kingdoms of Hammerfell. After seizing Sentinel from the Crowns, the Septim Army had left the Provisional Government under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Senecus%20Goddkey\"&gt;Senecus Goddkey&lt;/a&gt;, who help facilitate the control of the Forebears while Baron Volag had seemingly disappeared from the conflict. Goddkey was less of a tyrant than his Stros M'Kai counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;, who had ordered the assassination of Prince A'Tor. Goddkey refurnished Sentinel as a getaway paradise, where the Kings of Daggerfall and Wayrest can come and rest from their political affairs. After the death of Richton at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus the Restless&lt;/a&gt;, Baron Volag returned from hiding and retook Sentinel from the Imperials and Goddkey, in another siege. &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;, Baron Volag and Tiber Septim traveled for &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hunding\"&gt;Port Hunding&lt;/a&gt; and created the &lt;a href=\"First%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;First Treaty of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;, which made Hammerfell an official Imperial Province, with Sentinel as their capital.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Camoran Usurper; the Battle of Firewaves.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the kingdoms of Western Tamriel and was advancing into the Iliac Bay after besieging the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;. The Iliac Bay was practically defenseless since the major kingdoms had problems of their own. The Kings of Sentinel and Wayrest were in their minority while the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; had two contenders to the throne, both who were fighting each other for the rule. Even the Lord of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; was not able to fight against the invading force, due to suffering from a deathly illness. Only &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Othrok\"&gt;Baron Othrok&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat the Usurper, with the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"Phrygias%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kambria%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Kambria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ykalon%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Ykalon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; was where the Camoran Usurper was ultimately defeated. The naval force that defeated the Usurper was considered the strongest force in Tamrielic history, comparable to the naval force that invaded &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, which was led by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;.\nSentinel during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Sentinel was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Caacte\"&gt;King Caacte&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sad Tale of Arthago; the Third Prince of Sentinel.\nFor quite some time, the Kingdom of Sentinel was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Camaron\"&gt;King Camaron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom are members of the Forebears. The two had their first child whose name is &lt;a href=\"Arthago\"&gt;Arthago&lt;/a&gt;. Arthago was born with bad health, physically unable to be a fighter. Arthago was treated by the priests and apothecaries of Western Tamriel, to fix every cough, sneeze, and fever that the young prince would constantly gain. Camaron and Akorithi did not like Arthago's condition, seemingly disowning him in the process, his parents showed no love to this crippled boy. One of Arthago's closest friends, a priest of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; believed that he could have been the first scholar-king of Sentinel but this would not be the case. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20386\"&gt;3E 386&lt;/a&gt;, the royal couple had their second child, &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt;, who was athletic and vibrant, suitable for the throne than Arthago. Eight years later in &lt;a href=\"3E%20392\"&gt;3E 392&lt;/a&gt;, the royal couple had another child named &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt;, whose name is &lt;a href=\"Yoku\"&gt;Yoku&lt;/a&gt; for Strong King. Within a year later, the couple had their final child named &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;, whose name is Yoku for Second Child, basically ignoring Arthago's existence. Arthago's condition grew worse, disgusting his father, Camaron. Arthago would have been dealt with by order of the King.\nOn a leisure walk, Arthago was kidnapped by strange men as his nursemaid watched placidly as if nothing was happening. He was placed in a sack and carried out of the city-state of Sentinel, into a settlement called either &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Faallem\"&gt;Castle Faallem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20Fortress%20of%20Fhojum\"&gt;the Fortress of Fhojum&lt;/a&gt;. Arthago had no way out and regretted decisions he made that he could have used to escape his imprisonment. Undead creatures blocked the path to escape, and so he died alone, deep within the ruined castle. With Arthago's disappearance, the throne of Sentinel was left to Aubk'i but events, later on, would change this scenario.\nConflict across the Iliac; the War of Betony.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;, the island of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mogref\"&gt;Lord Mogref&lt;/a&gt;, who sought aid from &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall for monetary reasons. However, the controversy surrounding Betony would arise when King Camaron brought up a two-hundred-year-old agreement proclaiming that Betony is officially the property of the Kingdom of Sentinel. And so the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; would begin, with the Kingdom of Daggerfall having a winning streak throughout the conflict. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20K%27avar\"&gt;Lord K'avar&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel was a veteran of the Betony war. He would be scarred by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bridwell\"&gt;Lord Bridwell&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bluffs\"&gt;Battle of the Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, a peace meeting would be hosted by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Graddock\"&gt;Lord Graddock&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Treaty of Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; was underway. The writing of the treaty was coordinated by the scribes of Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"Vanech\"&gt;Vanech&lt;/a&gt;, a Priest of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. Vanech had deliberately created the deal in favor of Daggerfall, seemingly giving the island to Daggerfall. Luckily, Camaron knew better and saw the scheme from within the writings. In response, the &lt;a href=\"Riot%20in%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Riot in Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; commenced, killing the leaders of Reich Gradkeep. The conflict continued into &lt;a href=\"Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Cryngaine Field; Death of King Camaron.\nThe Kingdoms of Sentinel and Daggerfall encountered each other at Cryngaine Field, starting the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the battle, a vast, dense fog had shrouded the battlefield. It was created by &lt;a href=\"Skakmat\"&gt;Skakmat&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; familiar of &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, to prevent the death of Lysandus. However, Lysandus was killed by a stray arrow during the conflict, prompting the Daggerfall forces to retaliate. After hearing the news of his death, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Gothryd\"&gt;Prince Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; was named the new King of Daggerfall, as he marched into battle. Lord Bridwell slew King Camaron, leaving the Sentinel forces in shock, forcing &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Oresme\"&gt;Lord Oresme&lt;/a&gt; to surrender to the Daggerfall forces. With Betony in his possession, King Gothryd attempted to establish peace among the Iliac Bay, by marrying Princess &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel. With Camaron's death, Queen Akorithi became the fully-fledged leader of Sentinel. Many of the members of the Court of Sentinel felt that Queen Aubk'i was more of a prisoner of war, rather than an actual Queen of Daggerfall. Peace remained between the two kingdoms.\nSentinel during the Warp in the West; K'avar the Snake.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Akorithi ruled the Kingdom of Sentinel, with her two sons, Greklith and Lhotun. Akorithi proved to be a solid leader for the Kingdom, but a tyrant to several members of the public and even the Court. One such member of the Court was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20K%27avar\"&gt;Lord K'avar&lt;/a&gt;, a war veteran of the Betony War and leader of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Candle\"&gt;Order of the Candle&lt;/a&gt;. Lord K'avar hid away far from Sentinel, to plot a coup d'\u00e9tat against Queen Akorithi's rule. &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;An agent&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; was able to uncover this plot through several means. With Akorithi notified of K'avar's betrayal, the Agent was sent by Akorithi herself to capture Lord K'avar. It is unknown whether the Agent accomplished their mission, but it would not be the last time Akorithi would hear from K'avar the Snake.\nDemise of Lord K'avar; Targets on Queen Akorithi.\nSometime later, the Agent was called upon by the Court of Sentinel to deal with Lord K'avar ultimately. The Spies of Sentinel revealed that Lord K'avar retreated across the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; to the city-state of Wayrest, attempting to garner support for usurping the throne. In the end, the Agent dueled with Lord K'avar, in the end, he was defeated in the name of Sentinel. It is unknown whether K'avar survived the encounter or not, but his plot against the Akorithi and Sentinel was foiled. Despite this betrayal, Lord K'avar's contributions to Sentinel would go unnoticed, especially for his service in the Betony War and for leading the Order of the Candle with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhosek\"&gt;Lord Vhosek&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord K'avar was not the only person who wanted Queen Akorithi to be dead. Akorithi was a ruthless leader who created enemies throughout the Iliac Bay and apparently, nobles of the Iliac Bay had a vendetta against the Widow Queen of Sentinel. Akorithi would avoid assassination from a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; assassin by the hands of &lt;a href=\"Allena%20Benoch\"&gt;Allena Benoch&lt;/a&gt;, former master of the esteem Valenwood &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the future head of Uriel Septim VII's personal guard. Akorithi continued to rule over the Kingdom of Sentinel.\nSentinel and the Totem of Tiber Septim.\nQueen Akorithi ruled over the Kingdom of Sentinel and became an influential power. Around the same time, an Agent of Uriel VII had come into possession of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact that gives the wielder the power of &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, but only if the wielder has royalty in their bloodline. In one way or the other, Akorithi came into possession of the Totem. The event known as the Warp in the West had begun when the Agent traversed the &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Mantellan Crux&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, to jumpstart the Numidium. The Warp produced several timelines, one where Akorithi came into possession of the Totem, becoming the one true nation of the Iliac, bringing peace. In reality, an anomaly known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; caused all of the timelines to merge into one, resulting in all possibilities to occur at once. Sentinel grew, encompassing the Southern Iliac. There were initially twenty-three regions, but it dwindled to four kingdoms, one of them being Sentinel.\nSentinel advances across the Iliac South.\nThe Warp in the West had lasted for about a day, on the 9th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, but in that day, the Kingdoms of the Iliac had absorbed the smaller regions into their domain. Akorithi's Sentinel advanced towards the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, eventually arriving onto the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Bergama\"&gt;Barony of Bergama&lt;/a&gt;. The Sentinel warriors had planned a sneak attack on the city-state of Bergama, using the ravaging sandstorm as their cover. By nightfall, Castle Bergama was sacked by the Sentinese forces. In a matter of seconds, Sentinel had control of the Southern Iliac, as far as the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Satakalaam\"&gt;County of Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt;. Akorithi would continue to rule over Sentinel until she succumbed to an unknown disease, leaving her on her deathbed. Because Arthago was gone, and Aubk'i became the Queen of Daggerfall, the throne was left to Greklith. However, he too would die from this ungodly disease, leaving the throne to young Lhotun.\nThe Rise of King Lhotun; Enter the Lhotunic.\nLhotun took advantage of being the heir to the throne by becoming heavily involved in several political missions, ranging from the diplomatic variety to militaristic missions. His mission was to keep the nations of Sentinel, even though they were Crowns sympathizers, before being conquered by the Forebears of Sentinel. To benefit both parties, Lhotun established the &lt;a href=\"Lhotunic\"&gt;Lhotunic&lt;/a&gt;, the gray area between the Crowns and the Forebears where they respect the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; ideals of the Empire but revere the Yokudan traditions that the Crowns have held for generations. This plan had backfired, causing resentment from both the Crowns and the Forebears, and so, prominent members of both factions began to rebel against these ideas, through a variety of methods.\nUprising against the King; the Second Hammerfell Civil War.\nThe first notable person to rebel against Lhotun's actions was &lt;a href=\"Clavilla\"&gt;Clavilla&lt;/a&gt;, the Queen of the Forebears &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Taneth\"&gt;Kingdom of Taneth&lt;/a&gt;. Clavilla attempted to have the charters of the independent guilds of Sentinel to be revoked, using the argument that the free worship of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; is heresy in the eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. However, this plan had sadly failed. The next attempt to cripple Lhotun's actions was the High Priest of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayaan-si\"&gt;Ayaan-si&lt;/a&gt;. The Redguard Priest had gathered the True Crowns of Elinhir and &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; to rebel against the Kingdom of Sentinel. The Crowns Army was able to make substantial success, being able to capture the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Totambu\"&gt;Fiefdom of Totambu&lt;/a&gt; and establishing forays in Bergama and the &lt;a href=\"Dak%27fron%20Desert\"&gt;Dak'fron Desert&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, the battle shifted towards Totambu, where Lhotun's forces surrounded the fiefdom. Things would take a turn for the worst when the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; had occurred throughout the continent of Tamriel. It is unknown how the conflict had ended.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thalmor Persecution; Night of Green Fire.\nIn the aftermath of the Oblivion Crisis, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; had risen to power, equal in power to the Third Empire. The Thalmor became a radical and xenophobic group, much different than what the High Elves of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; may have been used to in the hands of the Septim Empire. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2042\"&gt;4E 42&lt;/a&gt;, many Altmer refugees had escaped the province when the Thalmor were slaughtering the dissidents of Alinor, those who opposed the Thalmor's control. A group of Altmer refugees had escaped to the city of Sentinel, where they resided in the Refugees District. One night, however, a group of Thalmor agents launched a covert assault on the district, causing the political refugees to desperately try to fight back. Both factions had attacked each other with fire magic, hence the name, leaving the area in ruins. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; had arrived, the Altmeri dissidents were all killed, including several casualties. The event would go down in infamy as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Green%20Fire\"&gt;Night of Green Fire&lt;/a&gt;. The Thalmor were harassing and assassinating refugees in the city around &lt;a href=\"4E%2048\"&gt;4E 48&lt;/a&gt;, all of which shared a pattern of either having mixed blood or associations deemed \"unclean\" by the Dominion.\nThe Great War; the Hammerfell Front.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;4E 173&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; had advanced into &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; from the province of Hammerfell and assaulted the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, the Crowns capital of Hammerfell. Hegathe was one of the last southern cities in Hammerfell to remain in control of the Imperial Legion. The Crowns were unable to hold their own against the Dominion until the Forebears of Sentinel advanced southwards to aid the Crowns. In the end, the city of Hegathe was secured by the Imperial Legion, but the Dominion under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt; was able to traverse the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; and enter the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil. Before this, the Dominion had taken the city of &lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt;, until it was retaken by the Imperial Legion, leaving the Dominion in a weakened state. Eventually, the Dominion continued into the Colovian West. In their conquest they took out the cities of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. The Crowns and Forebears had reconciled, entering the fray in the name of the Empire."}

First they landed at &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, which they freed of the affliction of the &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;beast-peoples&lt;/a&gt;. Then spread they bothwise along the coasts, seeking out goodly harbors and well-watered oases.\nTo the north and west went the warrior-sailors of the &lt;a href=\"Grandee%20Yaghoub\"&gt;Grandee Yaghoub&lt;/a&gt;, in the great ships they had brought from &lt;a href=\"Akos%20Kasaz\"&gt;Akos Kasaz&lt;/a&gt;, until they rounded &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Shira\"&gt;Cape Shira&lt;/a&gt;. Then was Yaghoub the first of the Ra Gada to behold the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and he deemed it laudable, and praised its excellences, and vowed to make his home thenceforth upon its shores.\nAnd as Yaghoub sailed toward the Steed at dawning of the seventeenth of Second Seed, his watchman cried out that he spied a desirable harborage. And Yaghoub, perceiving it, agreed, and said, \"This harborage shall belong to us, for we shall take it to be ours. And I do name it &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, after the one who first espied it.\"\nThen Sentinel (for thus ever after was it known) already contained a port on its harbor, which port was the haunt of low Elves, and Men who did consort with Elves. And the shores were green with the leaves of pomegranate, and fig, and olive, and the men of the Grandee saw this and were hungry, and sought to come ashore, despite the warnings and cries of the port-rabble.\nBut when Yaghoub landed with his warrior-sailors, with their bright swords and peaked helms, the port-rabble were cowed, and spake, cringing, \"What would you with us, O mighty &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;sword-singers&lt;/a&gt;? Slay us not, for we have done you no harm.\"\nAnd Yaghoub said to them, \"Nay, though you are infidels and partake of unclean practices, I will not slay you. For I have a thought to build me a palace upon the height above the harbor, and such labor is not meet for my noble warrior-sailors. Therefore you shall live, and become masons, and stonewrights, and servants of the house.\"\nAnd thus was the true port of Sentinel founded. The port-rabble found purpose in their new labors, and built the walls, and the marketplace, and the palace of Yaghoub. And this was &lt;a href=\"Samuruik\"&gt;Samaruik&lt;/a&gt;, of glorious name, and legendary are the mighty kings and queens who have reigned from it since. For &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; who followed the Forebears found Sentinel a worthy seat, and many were the &lt;a href=\"Na-Totambu\"&gt;Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt; who settled there.\nEven today, O Prince, above the city gates flies always a banner of the crescent moon, for this was the banner of the Grandee Yaghoub, which has become the symbol of Sentinel in remembrance of him. And the faithful celebrate the Grandee on the &lt;a href=\"Koomu%20Alezer%27i%20Yaghoub\"&gt;Koomu Alezer'i Yaghoub&lt;/a&gt;, every seventeenth of Second Seed, when we share pomegranates in honor of our esteemed ancestor."}

In Yokudan myths, he is often portrayed as &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt;'s helper. He was supposedly created from the dead skins of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; when Ruptga sought to create a helper to aid spirits in the &lt;a href=\"Walkabout\"&gt;Walkabout&lt;/a&gt;. However, since Sep was created from the shedded skins of Satakal, he also suffered from the hunger of the &lt;a href=\"Akel\"&gt;Hungry Stomach&lt;/a&gt;. He would often try to eat the spirits he was supposed to help, though Ruptga always got the spirits back out.\nSep eventually tired of helping Ruptga, and tricked many spirits into balling up the rest of the old skins to create a new world, promising that it would help them reach &lt;a href=\"The%20Far%20Shores\"&gt;The Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;. This was a trick though, and the spirits would have to live out the rest of their lives as mortals.\nWhen Sep tricked the spirits, he put one of the stars that Tall Papa had placed in his pocket. This star became a pearl, and somehow became linked to the Hunger.\nRuptga punished Sep for this trickery by squashing him with a big stick. As a result of this, Sep's hunger fell out of his mouth, and is now all that is left of him. The Pearl also fell from Sep's pocket at this point, becoming covered with sand. The other spirits could all attempt to reach the Far Shores, but Sep was stuck slinking around in his new world or floating in the sky, trying to eat the stars. He now lives on as a \"non-space\" that tries to prevent mortals from reaching the Far Shores.\nIn some stories, Sep's hunger is related to Avarice in men. These stories tell that the sinking of Yokuda was not caused by the &lt;a href=\"Hiradirge\"&gt;Hiradirge&lt;/a&gt;, but rather by Sep's hunger growing strong in men and leading them away from proper reverence of the divines. This caused Satakal to rise from the starry deeps and sink the continent of Yokuda. The hunger of Sep was left behind in sunken Yokuda, but it may make its return someday, as it can never be sated, and it is part of every mortal.\nIn other stories, when the pearl that Sep stole will be cleansed of it sand, the Hungry Stomach will at last be full, and Sep's hunger will be over.\nSep's Hunger is sometimes associated with &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20Beetle\"&gt;Assassin Beetle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn Hammerfell, Sep's name has been given to certain locations and animals, including &lt;a href=\"Sep%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Sep's Spine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sep%20Adder\"&gt;Sep Adder&lt;/a&gt;."}

The truly perfect assassination is one that remains undetected. I would not brag of those slain by my concoctions, for fear of breaking the tender illusion of \"natural\" death.\nI have penned down one of my favourite mixtures, in hope the reader will seek out more on there own. The preparation is unorthodox, yet it has served me well.\nI learned the name \"&lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt;\" from a sweet &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; lass I courted for a time. She was unfaithful, but her kiss still filled me with delight.\nPrepare a fire, burned down to coals. Atop that, place a large cauldron. This will be your crucible.\nAdd to this a drop of your own blood. It will sizzle when the pot is tempered. You only need the residue of blood for flavour and scent.\nScrape the salt from a mangrove leaf, and powder it with the spores from a yellow-knight mushroom. You can find these growing in almost any field if you lie down with your face to the soil.\nWhile the crucible is still hot, pour a decanter of treacle tea in, letting the steam escape. In a short time it will reduce, and to that sticky mess, you will add the aforementioned powder.\nOnce all the ingredients are combined, it's ready to use. On the skin, it breaks down strength in a matter of hours. For a faster reaction, ingestion or wounding is best.\nI have yet to calculate an antidote to this recipe, so I advise using the utmost caution when handling."}

{"id": "1527", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1527", "title": "Septim Dynasty", "text": "The Septim Dynasty was the first &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; dynasty of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and referred to the bloodline of &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;s and Empresses, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. They were the first ruling family of the Empire, ruling it for the whole duration of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of these rulers are considered to be Imperials unless otherwise stated. Its end was also the end of the Third Era.\nTiber Septim (2E 854\u20133E 38).\nTiber Septim was the founder of the Septim Dynasty. It was he who conquered &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; as the General of &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;. When Cuhlecain died at the hands of an unknown assassin (some say of Tiber himself), he became Emperor, declaring the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; at his coronation.\nAs well as initiating governmental reforms following his conquests, Tiber is also credited with the revival of the cult of the One, an ancient Nordic belief, and building a temple to it in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Wanting to make his newly formed and diverse empire feel more united, Tiber published the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20First%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;. \nTiber Septim, during his reign, made many changes. In &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; reconstruction of the entire province was made, ruined areas of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; were reconstructed, along with every other ruined road and city were rebuilt. Many of the old forts in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; were removed. In &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, Tiber established a monarchy to rule the province. Also during his reign, &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; petitioned Tiber to become an Imperial Territory. Tiber\u2019s answer is not known, but he most likely declined it because of his hatred of orcs.\nTiber ruled until &lt;a href=\"3E%2038\"&gt;3E 38&lt;/a&gt;, when he was succeeded by his grandson, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nPelagius Septim I (3E 38\u20133E 41).\nPelagius Septim I (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%2041\"&gt;3E 41&lt;/a&gt;) was the second ruler of the Septim Dynasty and grandson to Tiber Septim.\nPelagius Septim had a short rule when compared with his grandfather. He was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in the third year of his reign when he knelt at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nKintyra Septim I (3E 41\u20133E 48).\nKintyra Septim (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%2048\"&gt;3E 48&lt;/a&gt;) was the third monarch and first empress to rule Tamriel.\nKintyra was Pelagius' first cousin, and daughter of Tiber Septim's brother, &lt;a href=\"Agnorith%20Septim\"&gt;Agnorith&lt;/a&gt;. A former Queen of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, her reign was blessed with \"prosperity and good harvests, and she herself was an avid patroness of art, music, and dance.\"\nUriel Septim I (3E 48\u20133E 64).\nUriel Septim I (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%2064\"&gt;3E 64&lt;/a&gt;) was the fourth Emperor of Tamriel. Uriel I succeeded his mother, Kintyra Septim. He would be the first of seven Uriels to command the throne during the Third Era.\nThroughout his rule, Uriel I promoted lawfulness and furthered the establishment of Imperial organizations, including the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son, also Uriel.\nUriel Septim II (3E 64\u20133E 82).\nUriel Septim II (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%2082\"&gt;3E 82&lt;/a&gt;) was the fifth ruler of the Septim Dynasty.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%2064\"&gt;3E 64&lt;/a&gt;, Uriel Septim II succeeded his father. His rule was \"cursed with blights, plagues and insurrections.\"\nPelagius Septim II (3E 82\u20133E 99).\nPelagius Septim II (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%2099\"&gt;3E 99&lt;/a&gt;) was the sixth ruler of the Septim Dynasty.\nPelagius ascended the throne when his father died, and inherited a massive debt from his father's poor financial and judicial management. To recover the debt, he dismissed the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, and only allowed those able to pay great sums of money to resume their seats. He encouraged his vassals to do likewise, and during his 17-year reign, Tamriel returned to prosperity. He was succeeded by his son, Antiochus.\nAntiochus Septim (3E 99\u20133E 119).\nAntiochus Septim (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20119\"&gt;3E 119&lt;/a&gt;) was the seventh monarch to rule the Septim Dynasty.\nAntiochus was one of the more flamboyant members of the Septim Family. Caring more for his mistresses and his numerous wives than the running of the empire, his reign was rife with civil war, even more so than his grandfather, Uriel Septim II. Of particular significance was the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;3E 110&lt;/a&gt;, twelve years after he assumed the throne, in which &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; was only barely defeated by Antiochus' and the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nKintyra Septim II (3E 119\u20133E 121).\nKintyra Septim II (Dates disputed by differing sources) was the eighth monarch of the Septim Dynasty.\nKintyra had the most unhappy rule of all of the Septim Dynasty. First inheriting the throne at fifteen years of age, her cousin, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt;, son of Queen &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, imprisoned her, and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; begun.\nUriel Septim III (3E 121\u20133E 127).\nUriel Septim III, also known as Uriel Mantiarco (Born &lt;a href=\"3E%2097\"&gt;3E 97&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;), was the ninth ruler of the Septim Dynasty. Uriel Septim became Emperor after starting a coup against his cousin, Kintyra Septim II.\nHe was more accurately known as Uriel Mantiarco, and the tradition of being renamed \"Septim\" upon becoming ruler followed him. For the entirety of the six years that he ruled, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; was being fought by himself and his cousins. Pelagius Septim II's succeeding cousins, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; (his mother), &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, all fought against one another for control. (For more information, see &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;). Eventually, Uriel Septim lost and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt;.\nCephorus Septim I (3E 127\u20133E 140).\nCephorus Septim I (born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20140\"&gt;3E 140&lt;/a&gt;) was the tenth ruler of the Septim Dynasty.\nThe majority of his thirteen-year reign was marked by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; against his sister Potema Septim. Cephorus survived only three years longer than Potema herself. Having no children himself, he was replaced by his brother when he died in a horse accident.\nMagnus Septim (3E 140\u20133E 145).\nMagnus Septim (born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20145\"&gt;3E 145&lt;/a&gt;) was the eleventh ruler of the Septim dynasty.\nMagnus ascended to the throne when his brother, Cephorus I, died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20140\"&gt;3E 140&lt;/a&gt;. Already an elderly man by the time he became emperor, much of his time was spent punishing the traitorous kings during the War of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Diamond\"&gt;Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. His son, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;, then King of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded him as ruler.\nPelagius Septim III (3E 145\u20133E 153).\nPelagius Septim III (born &lt;a href=\"3E%20119\"&gt;3E 119&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20153\"&gt;3E 153&lt;/a&gt;) was the twelfth ruler of the Septim Dynasty.\nPerhaps better known as \"Pelagius the Mad,\" he was proclaimed emperor in &lt;a href=\"3E%20145\"&gt;3E 145&lt;/a&gt;. His eccentricities were noted by the court \"almost from the start.\" It is said that Pelagius Septim revered the Bretons over all other races.\nKatariah Septim (3E 154\u20133E 200).\nKatariah Septim (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20200\"&gt;3E 200&lt;/a&gt;) was the thirteenth ruler of the Septim Dynasty.\nKatariah Septim was initially appointed as Regent of Tamriel, whilst her husband, Pelagius, was institutionalized. A &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; by birth, some people consider her rule the \"true mark of the decline of the Septim Empire.\" However, her forty-six year reign is one of the most celebrated in Imperial history, traveling often and \"repairing much of the damage that previous Emperor's broken alliances and bungled diplomacy created.\"\nCassynder Septim (3E 200\u20133E 202).\nCassynder Septim (Born &lt;a href=\"3E%20147\"&gt;3E 147&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"3E%20153\"&gt;153&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20202\"&gt;3E 202&lt;/a&gt;) was the fourteenth ruler of the Septim Dynasty.\nHe inherited the throne on the death of his mother, already middle-aged and due to poor health. He left the care of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; province to his half-brother Uriel Lariat, though, as the only true blood relation of Pelagius Septim III, and thus &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, he was pressed into accepting the throne. He died after only two years of rule. His brother Uriel Lariat succeeded him and was crowned Uriel Septim IV.\nUriel Septim IV (3E 202\u20133E 247).\nUriel Septim IV, also Uriel Lariat (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20247\"&gt;3E 247&lt;/a&gt;), was the fifteenth monarch to rule Tamriel.\nUriel Lariat was the son of &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt; and her consort &lt;a href=\"Gallivere%20Lariat\"&gt;Gallivere Lariat&lt;/a&gt; (after Pelagius Septim III's death). Legally, Uriel was a Septim: Cassynder had adopted him into the royal family when he was King of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Many people considered him to be a bastard child, however, and his forty-five year reign was a \"hotbed of sedition.\"\nThere was little that Uriel Septim IV was able to achieve during his rule. During the rule of his mother, Katariah and half brother Cassynder, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; had assumed a great deal of power. Due to the moneymaking methods of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, it consisted of the wealthiest (and thus the most powerful) people in Tamriel, and he was unable to defeat them. The final victory of the Elder Council over Uriel was to deny his son, &lt;a href=\"Andorak%20Septim\"&gt;Andorak Septim&lt;/a&gt;, from becoming ruler.\nCephorus Septim II (3E 247\u20133E 268).\nCephorus Septim II (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20268\"&gt;3E 268&lt;/a&gt;) was the sixteenth monarch of the Empire of Tamriel.\nHe was voted into power by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20247\"&gt;3E 247&lt;/a&gt;, weeks after the death of his cousin and predecessor, Uriel Septim IV. Two significant events occurred during his reign. The first of these was a war with &lt;a href=\"Andorak%20Septim\"&gt;Andorak Septim&lt;/a&gt;, which was only resolved after giving Andorak's rulers the land of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, where they still rule today.\nThe more significant threat, however, was the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;. His ultimate defeat had little to do with the Empire, however, as he was already significantly weakened by his civil war with Andorak. (For full details, see &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;. When Cephorus died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20268\"&gt;3E 268&lt;/a&gt;, he was succeeded by his son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to the many previous Emperors, Cephorus was neither a Breton, nor had he grown up in High Rock, unlike the previous Emperors. Because of this, as well as deeper loyalties to Skyrim and Morrowind, resulted in High Rock being hesitant to form up against the Camoran Usurper.\nUriel Septim V (3E 268\u20133E 290).\nUriel Septim V (Born ?? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20290\"&gt;3E 290&lt;/a&gt;) was the seventeenth ruler of the Empire of Tamriel. He inherited the throne from his father, Cephorus Septim II, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20268\"&gt;3E 268&lt;/a&gt;. His reign was marked by several ambitious conquests, the last of which was to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. He was regarded as the greatest warrior Emperor since his ancestor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen he was away campaigning, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; continued to rule in his stead. During his rule, he conquered several kingdoms, including &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt; (271), &lt;a href=\"Cathnoquey\"&gt;Cathnoquey&lt;/a&gt; (276), &lt;a href=\"Yneslea\"&gt;Yneslea&lt;/a&gt;, (279) and &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt; in 284. He then proceeded on an ambitious plan to invade the continent of Akavir, which ended disastrously.\nUriel Septim VI (3E 290\u20133E 320).\nUriel Septim VI (&lt;a href=\"3E%20285\"&gt;3E 285&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20317\"&gt;3E 317&lt;/a&gt;) was the eighteenth ruler of the Empire of Tamriel.\nHis father, Uriel Septim V, died when he was just five years of age. As a result, his mother, &lt;a href=\"Thonica\"&gt;Thonica&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial consort, was named Regency until he \"reached his majority,\" with the Elder Council retaining the \"real\" power. The &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; denied him the power of Emperor until he was 22 years of age, but he had been slowly assuming duties for some time before this. Even then, the only real power the Elder Council allowed him was the power of veto. However, he used this power effectively, and used the \"defunct spy networks and guard units to bully and coerce difficult members of the council.\" By &lt;a href=\"3E%20313\"&gt;3E 313&lt;/a&gt;, he truly did rule Tamriel. When he fell off of a horse, his sister &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who had been instrumental in helping to influence the Elder Council, was crowned as Empress.\nMorihatha Septim (3E 320\u20133E 339).\nMorihatha Septim (&lt;a href=\"3E%20288\"&gt;3E 288&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20339\"&gt;3E 339&lt;/a&gt;) was the nineteenth ruler of the Empire of Tamriel.\nMorihatha, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;, finished the job her brother had started. She brought the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to the Imperial City, and created the Second &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; since the days of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe then endeavored to undo quell riots in the Provinces, as the \"open revolutions and civil wars had raged unchallenged since the days of her grandfather &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt;.\" Her campaigns were remarkably successful, but carefully coordinated so as not to overextend herself. The Elder Council was outraged by the slow pace of these, and she was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"3E%20339\"&gt;3E 339&lt;/a&gt;. The Argonian councilman &lt;a href=\"Thoricles%20Romus\"&gt;Thoricles Romus&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly outraged at her refusal to sent troops to bolster the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, was tried and executed for this crime.\nAnother noteworthy aspect of her reign was the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20Second%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire, Second Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nPelagius Septim IV (3E 339\u20133E 368).\nPelagius Septim IV (&lt;a href=\"3E%20314\"&gt;3E 314&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20368\"&gt;3E 368&lt;/a&gt;) was the twentieth Emperor of Tamriel. He succeeded his aunt, the Empress Morihatha, who was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"3E%20339\"&gt;3E 339&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius' mother, Eloisa, had died four years prior to his ascension.\nPelagius continued the work his aunt had done, and slowly brought \"back under his wing the radical and refractory kingdoms, duchies, and baronies of the Empire.\" Whilst not as successful as his aunt, he was nevertheless somewhat successful, and, \"after a notably stable and prosperous 29 year reign, Tamriel was closer to unity than it had been since the days of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20I\"&gt;Uriel Septim I&lt;/a&gt;.\nUriel Septim VII (3E 368\u20133E 433).\nUriel Septim VII (&lt;a href=\"3E%20346\"&gt;3E 346&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;) was the twenty-first ruler of Tamriel. Uriel VII was the son of Pelagius Septim IV. Uriel came to power in &lt;a href=\"3E%20368\"&gt;3E 368&lt;/a&gt; and reigned for several decades before his eventual death as an aged monarch in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;.

Since his release, he \"worked diligently to renew the battles that would reunite Tamriel.\" Evidence of this can be seen by his involvement in the Morrowind Prophecies, where he introduced the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; to Morrowind.\nUltimately, he was killed by assassins from the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; whilst attempting escape in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nMartin Septim (3E 433).\nMartin Septim (&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;3E&lt;/a&gt; ??? \u2013 &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;) was the illegitimate son of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;. Before &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, he never knew his parents, and lived much of his life as a priest. However, events during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; caused him to become Emperor, in order to stop the threat. His death signaled the end of the Septim Dynasty, as well as the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

He wrote the book while he was still a member of the College of Winterhold, departing after having read one of the Scrolls and becoming irrevocably mad.\nIsolation.\nLooking for &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20artifacts\"&gt;Dwemer artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, he wandered out on the small glacial islands north-west of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he proceeded to attempt to access a Dwemer contraption. He was believed to be driven insane by his own genius, and the long periods away from people, although he admits reading the Elder Scrolls caused his madness.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter speaking to &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; atop the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; learns that an Elder Scroll is needed to learn &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; created by mortals for the purpose of knocking Dragons from the sky.\n&lt;a href=\"Urag%20gro-Shub\"&gt;Urag gro-Shub&lt;/a&gt; supplies the Dragonborn with reading material on the Elder Scrolls, one of which is the book authored by Septimus. Suspecting that he is the most likely to know where an Elder Scroll may be, the Dragonborn locates him north of the College of Winterhold, at an outpost.\nOnce found and spoken to, he sends the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Lexicon\"&gt;Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;, a device created by the Dwemer that allows one to safely transcribe the text of an Elder Scroll without going blind or insane.\n&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeptimus believes that the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; is held within the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oculory\"&gt;Oculory&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt; is what is actually inside. The blood of a Dwemer is needed to open the contraption, but since there are no more Dwemer, Septimus says that the blood of every other &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; race will suffice, thus the blood of an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; must be collected.\nExiting the outpost reveals that &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; seeks the object within the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Mechanism\"&gt;Dwarven Mechanism&lt;/a&gt; and has only tolerated Septimus' involvement with it because it served his own plot. The Dragonborn can choose to aid Hermaeus or decline the Lord's offer. Neither option directly affects the outcome of unlocking the mechanism.\nOnce acquiring and giving the blood samples to Septimus, he opens the contraption in his outpost and is extremely disappointed to not see the Heart of Lorkhan. He then disintegrates into a pile of ash as he approaches the Oghma Infinium. The Dragonborn can then take the Oghma Infinium."}

She is known as one of the \"&lt;a href=\"Daughters%20of%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Daughters of Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;,\" and because of this, she is central to the &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt; in . After being encountered, she can be recruited as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;, unlocking a multitude of interactions.\nBackground.\nOrigins.\nSerana is the daughter of Harkon and Valerica. She grew up very close to her mother and distant from (but not opposed to) her father. Her relationship with her mother was as loving and nurturing as it could be, considering that they were both creatures of the dark. She learned necromancy and other sorts of magic at her mother\u2019s side, and she is a powerful mage in her own right.\nEven as a child, hers was a fairly lonely life. She\u2019s naturally somewhat defensive, though not cold. She can deftly avoid difficult topics and turn the conversation back around into something you thought you wanted to talk about. She\u2019s built up these defenses because she has a quick temper and strong passion, so she doesn\u2019t let people get too close lest they fall victim to them. She\u2019s been taught to genuinely care about those who befriend her, but only so much as they prove worthwhile. She also has a touch of self-deprecating humor and awareness. She\u2019s smart, but a bit na\u00efve. After being sealed in Dimhollow Crypt for around a thousand years, she is curious about what the world has become.\nHer mother sealed her away in Dimhollow Crypt to thwart her father\u2019s schemes. Serana was originally locked away in the mid-late &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, in between the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim&lt;/a&gt; Empires. When she awoke, she is surprised to see Cyrodiil as the seat of an Empire, as it lacked a proper one during the tumultuous &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is one of the few &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;pure-blood Vampires&lt;/a&gt; known to exist, and gained her vampirism through a ritual in which members of her family pledged themselves to Molag Bal. Females like Serana and her mother, Valerica, who survive the horrific ordeal are dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Daughters%20of%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Daughters of Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nProphecy.\nHer father, Lord Harkon, is leader of the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt;. He discovered an ancient prophecy called the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; which, if enacted, would allow vampires to roam the world freely without the fear of weakness from the sun, but to do so, he required three &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;, and Serana for a ritual sacrifice.\nIn response to this, her mother hid her away with one of the Elder Scrolls in a sealed sarcophagus within &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years, in order to protect her from her father. She then fled to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; with the other Scroll.\nPersonality.\nShe is enterprising and friendly, but also lonely due to her troubled childhood and her mother's self-exile, which is why she confides in the Dragonborn. She is wary of the Dragonborn at first meeting, refusing to share inventories, answer questions in detail, and not letting them travel too far ahead alone when told to wait. Because of her Vampiric weakness and time spent in Dimhollow, she will also complain to the Dragonborn about caves and the sun, yet also complain when the weather is anything but sunny as the sun is her preference. Although she complains a lot, she also acknowledges the beauty of Skyrim, especially areas featuring groves and rivers, stating that she is happy to be there with the Dragonborn.\nShe harbors a degree of resentment towards her mother, Valerica, for locking her away for centuries and is angry that her feelings were not taken into consideration.\nAs a child she was close with her mother, but once her parents began to fight, she felt trapped between both. Her mother would often feed her negative opinions of her father and after a time Serana began to believe them. She was never very close with her father, Harkon, before her family became vampires, but once they became followers of Molag Bal, her relationship with him only worsened as her parents became drunk with power and were always in conflict. Her father started to see her as a means to an end and would often state that \"power takes precedence.\" Despite this she still admits to loving him as he is still her father.\nShe feels trapped between the conflict that consumes her parents and sees herself as a pawn that they are using against each other. Deep down she wishes they were able to reconcile and become a family again, but realizes that it is not possible.\nWhen questioned about her vampirism, she can be defensive. She prefers not to talk about the actual ceremony as it was degrading, but she also does not seem to regret the power it has granted her, and rather sees it as a gift that she earned. The only regret she does seem to have is how it tore her family apart.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Awakening%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Awakening&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Vigilant\"&gt;Hall of the Vigilant&lt;/a&gt; was attacked and destroyed by vampires, the Dragonborn is sent to Dimhollow Crypt to investigate further. Serana is discovered in the crypt and set free after the Dragonborn has killed &lt;a href=\"Lokil\"&gt;Lokil&lt;/a&gt; and all his vampires and thralls that had been in the crypt looking for her. She asks the Dragonborn to help her get home to Castle Volkihar.\n&lt;a href=\"Chasing%20Echoes\"&gt;Chasing Echoes&lt;/a&gt;.\nSerana indicates her desire to locate her estranged mother, Valerica. She believes that she may have left a clue to her whereabouts somewhere in the courtyard of Castle Volkihar. The Dragonborn must travel with Serana and infiltrate the castle to discover the whereabouts of Valerica.\n&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20Death\"&gt;Beyond Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is discovered Valerica fled to the Soul Cairn via a portal in Castle Volkihar. The Dragonborn and Serana must travel there to retrieve the Elder Scroll Valerica took with her.\n&lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Visions\"&gt;Unseen Visions&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Dexion%20Evicus\"&gt;Dexion Evicus&lt;/a&gt;, the Moth Priest who read Serana's Elder Scroll, is now blind, the Dragonborn and Serana must travel to &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Glade\"&gt;Ancestor Glade&lt;/a&gt; and learn how to read the Elder Scroll that will show them where to obtain Auriel's Bow.\n&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;.\nSerana travels with the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt; to seek Auriel's Bow. Upon reaching the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and meeting &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt;, she discovers her role in the ancient prophecy her father was pursuing, and that Vyrthur was the one who created it out of revenge for being abandoned by Auriel when he was afflicted with vampirism.\n&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\nSerana travels with the Dragonborn back to Castle Volkihar to confront her father, Lord Harkon.\nFollower interactions.\nUnlike regular followers, Serana displays advanced behavior and situational awareness:\nSerana also displays specific reactions in some locations. When approaching &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s altar in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20House%20%28Markarth%29\"&gt;abandoned house&lt;/a&gt;, Serana kneels and protects her head with her arms. If taken to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, she will also kneel on the ground, but in a posture of prayer similar to the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;. If she is in the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, she will also curl up and cover her head with her arms.\nInitially, Serana has fewer follower commands than other followers during the \"Dawnguard\" questline. Once the questline is completed, she can serve as a regular follower with the same set of commands that other followers have. In some circumstances, however, she may refuse to follow a command, or accept it conditionally. Serana has no \"I need you to do something\" dialogue option, instead, holding down the \"activate\" button, when looking at her, should enter the command mode directly. This should also work from a distance.\nShe will equip enchanted rings, chains and circlets, as well as both light and heavy armor. When outdoors, however, she wears her hood which displaces any circlets.\nBloodcursed Elven Arrows.\nUpon completion of Touching the Sky, Serana will offer to make &lt;a href=\"Bloodcursed%20Elven%20Arrow\"&gt;Bloodcursed Elven Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s for use with Auriel's Bow. Note that if the Dragonborn cured Serana of her vampirism, this ability to make such arrows will be lost. This limits the supply of these arrows to the ones made before she was cured.\nConfer vampirism.\nShe can also be asked to bite the Dragonborn both before Beyond Death and after Kindred Judgment, which grants the ability to become a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, however this cannot be done if she has been cured of vampirism. While she is a follower, the Dragonborn's Vampire Lord Drain Life spell is significantly weakened.\nVampirism cure.\nOnce the \"Dawnguard\" questline is complete, she can be asked about curing her Vampirism. Should she agree, she leaves to see &lt;a href=\"Falion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falion&lt;/a&gt; for a cure. She will return to Fort Dawnguard after a few days, cured, however will still exhibit certain traits of her previous Vampirism:\nThe following does change:\nThe option to get her cured can be permanently lost by choosing the wrong dialogue options or by asking her during the main \"Dawnguard\" questline. If this occurs, every time she is asked about getting cured she replies \"I'm not talking about this with you anymore.\"\nIf this happens, the console command codice_1 can reset the cure conversation, allowing the Dragonborn to ask her about a cure again. Then choose the option saying, \"You could be your own person again.\"\nMultiple followers.\nDuring the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Chasing%20Echoes\"&gt;Chasing Echoes&lt;/a&gt;,\" Serana will ask the Dragonborn to search for ingredients. While this objective is active, the normal follower commands are unavailable. If the Dragonborn leaves the castle at this time, they may ask another character to follow them, who will agree. When the Dragonborn and their new follower go back to the castle and finish the objective, Serana will return to normal follower status, but the new follower will not be dismissed. The new follower can be dismissed and replaced as normal, but if Serana is dismissed and asked to follow, she will not unless the Dragonborn has no other followers.\nCombat.\nIn battle, Serana proves herself to be an extremely powerful &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. She will frequently raise the corpses of both humanoids and creatures, even very powerful ones such as &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Caitiff%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora Caitiffs&lt;/a&gt;. However, the bodies she raises will disintegrate into ash piles which prevents the Dragonborn from resurrecting them afterwards.\nShe prefers to dual wield &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt; spells, but may use &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; for attacking at range. At higher levels, she will switch to &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. She will switch to melee combat when her &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; runs dry, with her default weapon being an &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven Dagger&lt;/a&gt;. She will equip stronger &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; if given to her and will even wield two-handed weapons. Her &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Life\"&gt;Drain Life&lt;/a&gt; spells will persist even if cured of vampirism. As long as she remains a vampire, she will be resistant to any and all frost spells.\nSpecifically, the spells she uses will be contingent as following depending on the Dragonborn's level: \n&lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bows&lt;/a&gt; seem to be her least favored weapon. She will equip a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; if given one, but unequips it as soon as combat starts, so she can use a spell in each hand. She also uses a &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; if given a powerful enough one.\nShe has a high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill\u2014much more than many other followers. However, her aggressive behavior renders her unwilling to sneak effectively. Her level is capped at 50.\nShe uses &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Royal%20Armor\"&gt;Vampire Royal Armor&lt;/a&gt; by default with a +125% &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka Regen&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, and prefers &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;light armor&lt;/a&gt; with a higher base armor value or her own default armor that was improved by &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt;. Any other Vampire Royal Armor that is improved by smithing may not always be prefered by her.\nConversations.\nIsran: \"\"This vampire showed up while you were away. I'm guessing it's the one you found in Dimhollow Crypt. Says it's got something really important to say to you. So let's hear it.\"\n[After talking with Serana and Isran]\nIsran: \"You hear me? Don't feel like a guest, because you're not. You're a resource. You're an asset. In the meantime, don't make me regret my sudden outburst of tolerance and generosity, because if you do, your friend here is going to pay for it.\"\nSerana: \"\"Thank you for your kindness. I'll remember it the next time I'm feeling hungry.\"\n[After talking with Serana again]\nIsran: \"Some Imperial scholar arrived in Skyrim a few days ago. I was staking out the road when I saw him pass by. Maybe that's your Moth Priest.\"\nSerana: \"Do you know where he's staying now?\"\nIsran: \"No, and I'm not going to waste men looking. We're fighting a war against your kind, and I intend to win it. You want to find him, try talking to anyone who'd meet a traveler. Innkeepers and carriage drivers in the big cities maybe. But you're on your own.\"\nSerana: \"Mother? Mother!\"\nValerica: \"Maker... it can't be. Serana?\"\nSerana: \"Is it really you? I can't believe it! How do we get inside? We have to talk.\"\nValerica: \"Serana? What are you doing here? Where's your father?\"\nSerana: \"He doesn't know we're here. I don't have time to explain.\"\nValerica: \"I must have failed. Harkon's found a way to decipher the prophecy, hasn't he.\"\nSerana: \"No, you've got it all wrong. We're here to complete the prophecy our way, not his.\"\nValerica: \"Wait a moment... you've brought a stranger here? Have you lost your mind?\"\nSerana: \"No, you don't...\"\nValerica: \"\"You. Come forward. I would speak with you.\"\n[After talking with Valerica]\nValerica: \"This stranger may call\" \"vampire, but\" \"knows nothing of our struggle. Why should I entrust you to\" \"?\"\nSerana: \"\"This \"stranger\" has done more for me in the brief time I've known\" \"than you've done in centuries!\"\"\nValerica: \"How dare you! I gave up everything I cared about to protect you from that fanatic you call a father!\"\nSerana: \"Yes, he's a fanatic... he's changed. But he's still my father. Why can't you understand how that makes me feel?\"\nValerica: \"Oh, Serana. If you'd only open your eyes. The moment your father discovers your role in the prophecy, that he needs your blood, you'd be in terrible danger.\"\nSerana: \"So to protect me you decided to shut me away from everything I cared about? You never asked me if hiding me in that tomb was the best course of action, you just expected me to follow you blindly. Both of you were obsessed with your own paths. Your motivations might have been different, but in the end, I'm still just a pawn to you, too. I want us to be a family again. But I don't know if we can ever have that. Maybe we don't deserve that kind of happiness. Maybe it isn't for us. But we have to stop him. Before he goes too far. And to do that, we need the Elder Scroll.\"\nValerica: \"I'm sorry, Serana. I didn't know... I didn't see. I've allowed my hatred of your father to estrange us for too long. Forgive me. If you want the Elder Scroll, it's yours.\"\nSerana: \"Wait... I hear something!\"\nValerica: \"It's Durnehviir... he's here! Defend yourselves!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Did you really come here expecting to claim Auriel's Bow? You've done exactly as I predicted and brought your fetching companion to me.\"\nSerana: \"Wait, is he talking about me?\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"\"Which, I'm sorry to say, means your usefulness is at an end!\"\n[After killing the first wave of Falmer]\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"An impressive display, but a wasted effort. You delay nothing but your own deaths!\"\nSerana: \"Watch out! He's pulling down the ceiling!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"\"Finish them!\"\n[After killing the second wave of Falmer]\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"This has gone on long enough.\"\nSerana: \"Your life ends here, Vyrthur!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"\"Child, my life ended long before you were born!\"\n[After killing the third wave of Falmer]\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"No... I won't let you ruin centuries of preparations...\"\nSerana: \"Surrender and give us the bow!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"\"Death first!\"\n[After the collapsing of the chantry]\nSerana: \"\"Enough, Vyrthur. Give us &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;the bow&lt;/a&gt;!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur \"How dare you. I was the Arch-Curate of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, girl. I had the ears of a &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;!\"\nSerana: \"Until the \"&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Betrayed&lt;/a&gt;\" corrupted you. Yes, yes. We've heard this sad story\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"&lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;his kind&lt;/a&gt; are easily manipulated fools. Look into my eyes, Serana. You tell me what I am.\"\nSerana: \"You're... you're a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;? But Auriel should have protected you...\"\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"The moment I was infected by one of my own Initiates, Auri-El turned his back on me. I swore I'd have my revenge, no matter what the cost.\"\nSerana: \"You want to take revenge... on a god?\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Auri-El himself may have been beyond my reach, but his influence on our world wasn't. All I needed was the blood of a vampire and his own weapon, Auriel's Bow.\"\nSerana: \"\"The blood of a vampire... Auriel's Bow... It... it was you? You created &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;that prophecy&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"A prophecy that lacked a single, final ingredient... the blood of a pure vampire. The blood of a &lt;a href=\"Daughters%20of%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Daughter of Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nSerana: \"You were waiting... all this time for someone with my blood to come along. Well, too bad for you... I intend on keeping it. Let's see if your blood has any power to it!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"What trickery is this?\"\nHarkon: \"So, you've returned. Is your... pet keeping you entertained?\"\nSerana: \"You know why we're here.\"\nHarkon: \"Of course I do. You disappoint me, Serana. You've taken everything I provided for you and thrown it all away for this... pathetic\" \".\"\nSerana: \"Provided for me? Are you insane? You've destroyed our family. You've killed other vampires. All over some prophecy that we barely understand. No more. I'm done with you. You will not touch\" \".\"\nHarkon: \"So, I see this dragon has fangs. Your voice drips with the venom of your mother's influence. How alike you've become.\"\nSerana: \"No... Because unlike her, I'm not afraid of you. Not anymore.\"\nHarkon: \"\"And you...\"\n[During the fight]\nSerana: \"Tough day for you!\"\nSerana: \"Sorry it had to be this way!\"\nSerana: \"This won't end well for you!\"\nSerana: \"I won't fall for your tricks!\"\nSerana: \"It's time for you to suffer!\"\nHarkon: \"No... Serana... your own father...\"\nGaran: \"Lord Harkon, defeated. I never imagined I'd see the day. My lady, you have my deepest sympathies. I'm sure this was not easy for you.\"\nSerana: \"He was out of control, Garan. It had to be done. I'm not happy about this. He... he was still my father. But I suppose my father really died a long time ago. This was just the end of something else.\"\nGaran: \"Of course, my dear. All will be well now.\"\nHarkon: \"Serana, my darling. I see you still favor keeping a pet.\"\nSerana: \"You know why we're here.\"\nHarkon: \"Of course I do. You disappoint me, Serana. You've taken everything I provided for you and thrown it all away for this... pathetic being.\"\nSerana: \"Provided for me? Are you insane? You've destroyed our family. You've killed other vampires.

They threaten our lives, and our founder! Are you afraid of them? No! You're not. These dogs will learn the cost of war! They will learn what it means to face the Vinedusk Rangers!

He is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Virtuous%20Blood%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Order of the Virtuous Blood&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; hunting society. Through &lt;a href=\"Ralsa%20Norvalo\"&gt;Ralsa Norvalo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; meets Seridur, who asks them to hunt down and kill the dangerous vampire, &lt;a href=\"Roland%20Jenseric\"&gt;Roland Jenseric&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWhen first approached, Seridur claims to lead a small vampire-hunting group, and to be in search of a specific vampire, Roland Jenseric. He is involved in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Virtuous%20Blood%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Order of the Virtuous Blood&lt;/a&gt;,\" in which he tells the Hero Roland's location and requests that he be killed.\nHowever, Seridur is in fact a vampire himself. At some point, he came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Relfina\"&gt;Relfina&lt;/a&gt;, Roland's wife, whom he used. She supposedly had been cheating (possibly being controlled by Seridur) for some time. One night, Seridur met Relfina and attempted to bite her, but Roland, who was following them, revealed himself.\nHe attempted to stop Seridur, but the vampire was too strong, and knocked Roland unconscious. With Relfina dead, Seridur left Roland alive so that the blame could be cast on him. Roland, after waking up, retreated to his cabin for protection. Wanting to cover his tracks, Seridur contracts the Hero of Kvatch to kill Roland. However, knowing that Roland might convince the Hero of the true story, Seridur flees to his own hideout, &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Cave\"&gt;Memorial Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nAfter hearing the true story from Roland, the Hero goes to Memorial Cave, which contains several vampires. Seridur is encountered further inside. He gives a short speech saying that he'll take care of Roland later, and attacks the Hero, but is ultimately killed. Roland then takes over his role as leader of the Order.\nPersonality and traits.\nSeridur, like most Altmer, is an adept user of magicka. He is also very manipulative. He seduced Relfina, tricked the Order members into believing he was a vampire hunter, and even tricked the Hero of Kvatch into working for him. However, this turned out to be a mistake, since it lead to his eventual death."}

More intelligent than horses; guar have been used for many varying purposes besides mounts and pack animals: including tracking in a similar manner to scent hounds and serving in combat alongside warriors. As omnivores, the guar diet mainly consists of plant-based foods, but like their &lt;a href=\"Alit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;alit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kagouti%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;kagouti&lt;/a&gt; cousins, they have been known to occasionally consume flesh. Normally docile, some guars have been known to be vicious when provoked: one pack guar, named Bittergreen the Wild, went mad and slaughtered an entire convoy at &lt;a href=\"Caravan%20Crest\"&gt;Caravan Crest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.

They can be both striped and plain, and are especially so the former on the Deshaan Plains."}

It's demoralizing, especially when he keeps complaining about the pain in his knee. If I keep at this, though, I'm sure I can get a promotion to someplace better. Maybe my partner will put in a good word for me. Just in case, I'm showing up to my shift early and leaving late. I'm here before he gets here and I'm here after he leaves.\nFredas\nRumors of battles nearby. Our scouts have seen signs of &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Clan\"&gt;Stormfist&lt;/a&gt; troops. Still, the chances of them marching all the way out here seem slim. The next time I get a chance to drink with the other guards, I'm sure they'll be bragging and boasting about their war stories again. Sounds like casualties are increasing, but the stories sound glorious.\nLoredas\nWe've been deployed! The troops on the front line need reinforcements, so they're sending out some of the guards. Finally, a chance to make a name for myself! I know it's a risky job, and some of the soldiers are bitter about this, but I also know that if I work hard, my life will improve.

You want to live the life of a criminal, always one step ahead of everyone and pockets brimming with &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it appeals to you to try and earn a living by robbing some wealthy merchants or extorting your local shopkeepers? Let me give you a bit of advise - don't bother. For every skilled thief I've met in my day, I've seen a twenty who thought that they had what it took but ended up rotting in jail.\nBut if you're anything like me, you don't listen to advise. You do whatever you want and never let anyone else tell you otherwise. To Oblivion with the risks - all that matters is the coin. Sound familiar? If it does, then this book might just teach you the difference between acting like a petty thief and a master criminal.\nI know what you're thinking. Who's this Wulfmare? Who does he think he is telling me how to be a better thief? What makes him an expert? Simple. Maybe you heard about that heist in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, when Queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;'s crown went missing? Or perhaps the tale of an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; gone missing from the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold tower&lt;/a&gt; reached your ears. That's right... it was yours truly. I've done just about every kind of job you can imagine and I've got the septims put away to prove it. How else could an ex-thief find the resources to publish his own book?\nNow that I have your attention, let's start with two of the most fundamental skills you'll need to sharpen if you want to make it as a cutpurse - picking locks and picking pockets. And before you roll your eyes and throw this book aside in disgust, I can promise you that the easiest way you're going to get caught is by ignoring the basics - but if you can master these activities you'll find yourself swimming in coin.\n&lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Picking pockets&lt;/a&gt; is one of the easiest skills to learn, but you'd be surprised how often I've seen novice thieves muck it up. The lesson here is two-fold. First, know your surroundings and second, know your approach. Where and when you decide to go fishing is just as important as who you chose as your mark. Follow them a while, there's never a need to rush. Wait until they're somewhere isolated and out of earshot of any guards - but most importantly always know when to let the mark go.\nGetting pinched simply isn't worth the risk. There'll always be plenty of other marks who come along with their pockets full. As far as their approach goes, don't drop into your crouch until you are completely out of the mark's view - directly behind and preferably close to them. Don't spend too long deciding what you'll lift either. A good thief should be able to hit a mark and make off with something valuable in less than five seconds. Last of all, plying this trade at night will greatly reduce your chances of getting caught. If you have no other choice and you have to do it in the daylight, just make sure you aren't out in the open.\n&lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; is an art form that takes years to master. The important thing to remember is that no two are alike, each one behaving completely differently. As long as you keep your wits about you, and your patience, you'll find them easier to defeat than you'd initially expect. Good picks are always essential. Make sure you have plenty of them tucked away in your pockets. Always take your time and keep a light touch on the picks. When the tumblers begin to fall into place, you should feel the pick tremble ever-so-slightly - this means you're near the sweet spot. Slow down at that point, and only move the picks with the finest touch. If you blindly poke at the lock like an old man, all you're going to end up with is a bunch of broken picks and equally broken pride. As a last resort, if the lock is completely confounding you, there's always the option of smashing it. Just keep in mind that this is rarely successful and could potentially make a great deal of noise.\nBy using my techniques, I'm not merely suggesting you'll be a successful thief, I'm giving you a solid guarantee. All it takes is a little bit of patience and a great deal of practice then maybe, just maybe, you'll become as successful as Wulfmare.\nIn my next volume, we'll move onto another important tool in your arsenal - sneaking. I'll prove to you that the shadows can be just as potent of a weapon as your blade if you know how to bend it to your will."}

The three principal districts are Ald'ruhn town, Ald'ruhn-under-Skar, and &lt;a href=\"Buckmoth%20Fort\"&gt;Buckmoth Fort&lt;/a&gt;.\nAld'ruhn town is a large settlement in the Redoran village style, built of local materials, with organic curves and undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells of giant native insects. Most guildhalls, cornerclubs, and merchants are sited in the southwest corner of town, convenient to West Gate and the &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;strider port&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; is located on high ground to the east, and surrounded by a residential section.\n&lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn-under-Skar\"&gt;Ald'ruhn-under-Skar&lt;/a&gt; is the most distinctive architectural feature of Ald'ruhn -- a manor and council district sheltered beneath the shell of an ancient extinct giant crab. The large carapace encloses a central dome, from which radiate the entrances to the Redoran Council chambers, the &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%2C%20Manor%20District\"&gt;manors&lt;/a&gt; of the Redoran councilors, and shops of a few upscale merchants.\nBuckmoth Fort is the Imperial legion garrison for the district. The strong walls and towers of this Western fortress lies a short distance to the south of Ald'ruhn town, through South Gate behind the &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nServices.\nHouse Redoran services are in the Council House and Councilor's Manors of Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar. The Ald'ruhn Temple on the east side of town provides service for Temple . Buckmoth Fort offers services to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and devotees of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20cult\"&gt;Imperial cult&lt;/a&gt;, including an Imperial cult altar. The guildhalls of the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild are near the South Gate. Pricy but high-quality clothier, alchemist, and enchanter shops are under Skar as well. Commodities at reasonable prices, but with smaller selections, are available from the smith, clothier, trader, pawnbroker, and bookseller near the entrance to Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar. The &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Skar%20Inn\"&gt;Ald Skar Inn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20Council%20Club\"&gt;Council Club cornerclub&lt;/a&gt; are found to the west, near West Gate and the silt strider port. &lt;a href=\"The%20Rat%20in%20the%20Pot\"&gt;The Rat in the Pot&lt;/a&gt; cornerclub is in south Ald'ruhn, near the guildhalls.\nNotable figures.\nAll six Redoran councilors, &lt;a href=\"Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hlaren%20Ramoran\"&gt;Hlaren Ramoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Sarethi\"&gt;Athyn Sarethi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garisa%20Llethri\"&gt;Garisa Llethri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miner%20Arobar\"&gt;Miner Arobar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvyn%20Venim%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bolvyn Venim&lt;/a&gt;, have manor residences in Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar. &lt;a href=\"Edwinna%20Elbert\"&gt;Edwinna Elbert&lt;/a&gt; is the Mages Guild steward, and &lt;a href=\"Percius%20Mercius\"&gt;Percius Mercius&lt;/a&gt; has recently become the Fighters Guild steward. Old &lt;a href=\"Methal%20Seran\"&gt;Methal Seran&lt;/a&gt; is an eminent Temple priest and scholar. &lt;a href=\"Raesa%20Pullia\"&gt;Raesa Pullia&lt;/a&gt; is commandant of Buckmoth Fort, but &lt;a href=\"Imsin%20the%20Dreamer\"&gt;Imsin the Dreamer&lt;/a&gt; is the chapter steward. The Redguard &lt;a href=\"Hean\"&gt;Hean&lt;/a&gt; is priest of the Imperial cult. &lt;a href=\"Goren%20Andarys\"&gt;Goren Andarys&lt;/a&gt; is the guild steward of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, whose guildhall is found in Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar.\nTravel and Transportation.\nRoads lead northwest to &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; villages and by a circuitous western route to &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, and points south. The road to Balmora swings northwest to avoid the barren wastes, and curves around towards the west until it heads south again to Caldera. Between Ald'ruhn and Caldera are many sidepaths; watch for signposts, or you'll get lost. The silt strider port is along the western town wall, north of West Gate. Silt strider service goes from Ald'ruhn to Balmora, Gnisis, &lt;a href=\"Khuul\"&gt;Khuul&lt;/a&gt;, or Maar Gan.. &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Guides\"&gt;Guild guides&lt;/a&gt; at the Mages Guild teleport you to Balmora, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, Caldera, and &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; for a modest fee. &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt; is a LONG and exceptionally unpleasant walk west to the coast and then south; there are no trails or marked routes. Casual travelers ill-equipped for the attacks of wild beasts and brigands should keep to the roads and travel services."}

Wisdom and prudence dictate that simple disagreements are best settled through dialogue. Long and thorough consideration, combined with wine and fellowship often yield reconciliation in short order. Alas, some indignities cut so deeply that an honorable martial contest is the only route to rapprochement. In such cases, the aggrieved parties must abide by the following rules.\n1. Both parties must arm themselves with a traditional Altmer dueling foil. long swords, axes, flails and the like are not permitted by the sacred laws of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. Foils must be washed in mineral water, thoroughly dried, and well-polished.\n2. Prior to the duel, both parties must recite their adversary's full name\u2014taking care to call upon matrilineal, patrilineal, and clan honorifics where appropriate. Duelists who stumble over or mispronounce their adversary's name must stop and recite the name in its totality twice more.\n3. Duelists must ensure that a second is present for the duel. These witnesses are honor-bound to intervene should one of the aggrieved parties commit an honor-infraction such as casting dirt in their opponent's eyes, fleeing the field prior to the duel's conclusion, or using venomous words that might further inflame tensions between parties.\nThe victorious duelist must engage with their defeated opponent in a courteous and humble fashion\u2014availing them of family physicians, bandages, or any other appropriate service to dress their wounds. Defeated duelists are likewise required to admit error, and humbly request forgiveness for their actions. If the parties follow these rules, both emerge from the conflict with honor intact. And this is good, for nothing on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; counts more than honor."}

Bless us and our Children!\nMy name is &lt;a href=\"Alessia%20Ottus\"&gt;Alessia Ottus&lt;/a&gt;, and I'd like to tell you all about &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe seat of &lt;a href=\"County%20Anvil\"&gt;Anvil County&lt;/a&gt; is by the sea, and at first glance, is very pretty, but when you examine it closely, turns out to be quite unpleasant. The water views are charming, but on the docks and in the harbor district outside of town you will find many sailors and tramps and dirty persons of little worth. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Anvil\"&gt;Castle Anvil&lt;/a&gt; is clean and well- ordered, and within the town walls, some houses are bright and cheerful, but others are derelict and abandoned, or shabby and neglected, with plaster fallen in patches from the stonework, and lunatics and drunkards may be encountered everywhere.\nCastle Anvil.\nThe ruler of Anvil is Countess &lt;a href=\"Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Millona Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;. Her husband, &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;Corvus Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, disappeared many years ago, and most persons would agree that Her Ladyship is better off without him, for he was a light and frivolous person, and given to loose and riotous behavior likely to promote scandal. The Countess herself is a righteous and godly woman, and an excellent ruler, well-loved by the people. If only she could compel her Town Guard to drive the seamen, low-lifes, loafers, and thieves from Anvil's streets, Anvil might be a more tolerable place to live.\nDistricts of Anvil.\nConsider the five districts of Anvil. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Anvil\"&gt;Castle Anvil&lt;/a&gt; lies outside the town walls, south of town, overlooking the harbor, and is reached by gate from Chapelgate. Within the town walls are three districts: Chapelgate in the east, Westgate in the west, and Guildgate between Chapelgate and Westgate. Harborside lies outside the town walls, south of town, and is reached by gate from Westgate district.\nChapelgate.\nA more beautiful chapel may not be seen in all &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. A quiet garden for meditation with a fine statue of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; lies between the chapel and the town wall, and across from the chapel is a lovely garden and covered arcade where worshippers are protected from the elements. Regretably, the people of Anvil seem little inclined to appreciate these advantages, and are seldom seen worshipping in the chapel. Whether this is the fault of the primate, who is a vain and shallow woman, or the Countess, who does little to encourage regular chapel worship by her example, I am unable to judge.\nGuildgate.\nThe most prosperous part of Anvil is entered by Guildgate, or Main Gate, or North Gate. Here side by side may be seen the handsomest and ugliest of Anvil buildings. The guilds are kept clean and in good repair, and both &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; are unusually ambitious and industrious by Cyrodiil's common standard. The head of the Mages Guild, &lt;a href=\"Carahil\"&gt;Carahil&lt;/a&gt;, is a scholar of good reputation and an outspoken enemy of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, summoning, and the dark arts. The Fighters Guild here is well-staffed and active, and shows no sign of the fecklessness and poor morale of chapters elsewhere in Cyrodiil. However, next to the Mages Guild is a ruin, long boarded-up and abandoned, and an prominent eyesore.\nWestgate.\nThis is the residential district of Anvil. The houses here are shabby and ill-kept. The people are untidy and dull, with the exception of Anvil's famous citizen, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; authoress, &lt;a href=\"Quill-Weave\"&gt;Quillweave&lt;/a&gt;, who produces wretched books celebrating the misadventures and schemes of the lower and criminal classes. This person does her race no favor by confirming the prejudices of many who consider Argonians to be ungodly, dishonest, and worthless, and little better than beasts.\nHarborside.\nThe docks are rotten and in ill-repair, and all manner of smells issue forth from the holds of ships and ramshackled warehouses. Shiftless persons gather here to bask in the sun, gossip, chatter, and plot how to beg or steal &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wine and ale&lt;/a&gt;. Here a good woman named &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Monet\"&gt;Mirabelle Monet&lt;/a&gt; runs a house for homeless sailors, but, I'm sorry to say, her mistaken tender-heartedness and charity only encourages malingering and drunkenness. Instead, she should urge these wicked and idle men to improve themselves through industry and the teachings of the Nine. There is, however, a very appealing lighthouse south of the harbor, from which one may contemplate a distant and less-disagreeable view of Anvil's castle, town and its harbor setting.\nMay &lt;a href=\"the%20Nine\"&gt;the Nine&lt;/a&gt; guard and guide you!"}

Balmora's four districts are High Town, the Commercial District, Labor Town, and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Moonmoth\"&gt;Fort Moonmoth&lt;/a&gt;. High Town, on the hill to the west, has the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Hlaalu Council Hall, rich manors, better shops, and the Morag Tong guildhall. The Commercial District, just west of the river, is centered on the large plaza north of South Gate, with the strider port along the south wall, east of South Gate.

Labor Town, east of the river, where the commoners and poor live, has several modest cornerclubs and a few merchants. Fort Moonmoth, a long walk southeast of town, houses the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; garrison and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20cult\"&gt;Imperial cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nServices.\nHouse Hlaalu services are available at &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Council%20Manor\"&gt;Hlaalu Council Manor&lt;/a&gt; in High Town. Temple faithful seek solace and services at the &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20Temple%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the southeast. Outlanders must travel outside the town walls, through South Gate and east along well-marked roads to Fort Moonmoth for Imperial Legion and the Imperial cult services. The guildhalls of the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild are on the street north from the plaza in the Commercial District. &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; services are available at their guildhall in the extreme northwest of High Town. Better shops are in High Town on the hill, with numerous merchants in the Commercial District, west of the river, and a few traders in Labor Town, east of the river.\nNotable Figures.\nNone of the Hlaalu counselors live in Balmora. &lt;a href=\"Nileno%20Dorvayn\"&gt;Nileno Dorvayn&lt;/a&gt; at the Council Hall is the ranking &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; local.

The colorful '&lt;a href=\"Sugar-Lips%20Habasi\"&gt;Sugar Lips' Habasi&lt;/a&gt;, a freelance facilitator of no fixed address, is often rumored to be the local boss of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransportation.\nA good road leads south to &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, and Vivec.

Improved roads head north to Caldera and Ald'ruhn. The silt strider port is on the west side of the river near South Gate. Silt strider service goes to Ald'ruhn, &lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt;, Ald'ruhn, and &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;.

Make us hale and hearty! My name is &lt;a href=\"Alessia%20Ottus\"&gt;Alessia Ottus&lt;/a&gt;, and I'd like to tell you all about &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;.\nBravil is the dark grate of the sewer drain where foul and unappetising debris collects. It is the poorest and dirtiest of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s towns, the oldest and shabbiest, the most plagued by criminals, drunkards, and &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt;-eaters, and most popular with &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; and other foreigners. All Bravil lacks is a coven of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worshippers to make it the perfect pit of villainy... and many rumors suggest that even more evil and depraved worships are practiced in secret by Bravil's wicked heathens.\nThis town is gray, grim, and depressing. The climate is damp and the atmosphere foul because of the fetid channels of the &lt;a href=\"Larsius%20River\"&gt;Larsius River&lt;/a&gt; that serve as Bravil's sewers, and because of the rank swamps of the lowland margins of the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt;, where insects and diseases breed in abundance.\nThe architecture of the town is remarkable for its unequalled ugliness and disorder. The houses, shops, and guilds are built from cracked and splintered timbers soft from rot and green with mold and mildew. It is a pity that they do not fall down, for they might be rebuilt in a more pleasing manner, but rather they continue to grow on top of one another like mounded middens, reaching lofty heights of three and four stories. Beggars and thieves lounge indolently on balconies overhanging the streets and dump their refuse directly upon the unfortunate passers-by. Whole families live in teetering shacks on the tops of the buildings in unimaginable squalor.\nBravil's people are dirty and dishonest. They live little better than goblins in caves, squatting in filthy, tumbledown shacks. The town citizens are divided into two classes: the smugglers, skooma-eaters, &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, thieves, and murderers, and the wretched beggars and fools that these criminals prey upon.\nBravil is ruled by crime lords, and the town guard lives in the pockets of the skooma kingpins. You will not be surprised to find there are many &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; in this miserable place, since &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; are close by, but you may be surprised to find many &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; here. However, beastfolk are comfortable in the company of other beastfolk, as are thieves and brutes naturally drawn to the company of one another.\nBravil is not organized into orderly districts. However, some landmarks may serve to orient the unfortunate visitor. The castle is approached by rickety bridges over the river to the east. The chapel is to the west. The shops and guilds are arranged in a line with their backs to the east wall and the channels of the river. Between the chapel and the shops and guilds are Bravil's ramshackle slums and tenements.\nThe castle is the only sturdy, stone-built dwelling in Bravil. It is nowhere as dirty and ill-furnished as the timber shacks of the people, but it is still little better than the houses of the poorest paupers in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Count &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Terentius\"&gt;Regulus Terentius&lt;/a&gt;, from a respectable family, once a noted tournament champion, is now widely recognized by his people as a drunken wastrel and ne'er-do-well. And his son, &lt;a href=\"Gellius%20Terentius\"&gt;Gellius Terentius&lt;/a&gt;, is a strutting peacock who cultivates the society of crime lords and skooma-eaters.\nThe chapel stonework is in poor repair and covered with mold and mildew. The graveyard is surrounded by a ramshackle, unpainted wooden fence, and the graves are untidy and neglected. The primate is a good servant of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, but she is unequal to the task of driving sin and wickedness from this Nine-forsaken town. The priestess is wise and well-liked by those few who visit the chapel, but most people never pass once through the chapel's doors, except to beg and steal.\nThe inns are a disgrace. It is common to step over prostrate drunks and through pools of sick upon entering, and idlers, gamblers, and pickpockets swarm in the darkness and prey upon unwary travelers. A visitor foolish enough to sleep in these places should expect to be murdered in his bed.\nThe guilds, by contrast, are relatively clean, dry, and quiet, and one forced by necessity to spend a night in Bravil might be justified in joining the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, despite their savage and godless ways, simply to be assured of a safe place to sleep.\nThe shops are no worse than any other feature of Bravil, and you may be more safe in them from assault or murder on account of the prodigious provisions merchants must take to protect themselves from thieves.\nIf you are forced by circumstances to visit Bravil, you will very soon wish to leave, and you will wish to watch your back as you leave, to be sure you are not followed by parades of bandits and assassins.\nHonor &lt;a href=\"the%20Nine\"&gt;the Nine&lt;/a&gt; in prayer!"}

My name is &lt;a href=\"Alessia%20Ottus\"&gt;Alessia Ottus&lt;/a&gt;, and I'd like to tell you all about &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nBruma is understood to be a &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; county, but in truth it is more &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; than Nibenese, on account of its close proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; border, and on account of the terrible cold and discomfort of its location high in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Bruma is always cold and covered with snow, with braziers kept burning in every quarter to prevent the citizens from freezing to death. Everything is built in wood, since trees are so plentiful in the forests of the Jeralls, and even rich men live here in dark, dirty wooden huts. It is little wonder that Nords are such drunken heathen savages, for life is impossible in such a climate, and one might be tempted to drink into insensibility or sell one's soul to just to find sanctuary from the bitter cold and relentless wind.\n&lt;a href=\"Castle%20Bruma\"&gt;Castle Bruma&lt;/a&gt; is cold and drafty, carelessly decorated, and dark with soot from the perpetually burning braziers. The smell of smoke and cinders is overpowering. The high ceilings are grand, but impossible to heat, and one is never able to get warm. The ancient layers of soot and filth encrusting the stonework makes it difficult to appreciate the exceptional stonecarving. Except in its stonework and grand scale, the castle is like the log huts of the people -- cold, dark, drafty, and dirty.\nCountess &lt;a href=\"Narina%20Carvain\"&gt;Narina Carvain&lt;/a&gt; is a Nibenean Heartlander, a dutiful chapelgoer, and a respected ruler, though she is a cunning and ruthless negotiator, and has a reputation for sharp-dealing and treachery. Administration of the county is efficient and well-ordered, and a well- trained and aggressive town watch under command of a hard-nosed &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Nord captain&lt;/a&gt; that thieves and beggars are not very troublesome, though Nords are famous for drunkenness and rioting.\nAccess to the castle is through a gate west from the town into a courtyard. The shops, inns, guilds are located in the north, either on the western terrace near the castle gate, or below the terrace, north of the chapel. The chapel is the central feature of southern Bruma, with houses ranged along the inside of the walls along the east and south. The streets are cramped and barren, since few trees and plants can survive the cold, but the town is compact and quickly explored.\nBruma's Nibenean citizens faithfully observe chapel &lt;a href=\"Sundas\"&gt;Sundas&lt;/a&gt; rituals, but the lower classes are unregenerate followers of the heathen Nord gods, and they keep to their own secret superstitions and uncivilized practices.\nYou will not be surprised to find you can purchase good quality &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; here, for Nord smiths are famous for the quality of their wares. But you should not expect to be able to purchase books here, for Nords are ignorant and not fond of reading. The &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guilds&lt;/a&gt; are poor and short-staffed, for no one wants to be posted to such a gray and cold land, but at least the Mages Guild is kept good and warm (though I shrink from imagining what infernal engines are employed to produce and preserve that heat).\nMay &lt;a href=\"the%20Nine\"&gt;the Nine&lt;/a&gt; bless and save you!"}
{"id": "34054", "revid": "25646820", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34054", "title": "Guide to Cheydinhal", "text": "Guide to Cheydinhal is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\n&lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, bless my body and soul! My name is Alessia Ottus, and I'd like to tell you all about Cheydinhal.\nThe first impression of the visitor to Cheydinhal is of broad green parklands, graceful willows along the banks of the Corbolo, neatly groomed gardens and flowering shrubs. Cheydinhal looks prosperous, with clean, well-trimmed houses and neat stonework, ornamented with striking designs in glass, metal, and wood.\nBut what lurks beneath this pleasing appearance? Crime! Scandal! Corruption!\nCheydinhal is divided into three districts. To the north, on a hill, is the courtyard and inner keep of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;Castle Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. A road runs east-west below the castle from East Gate to West Gate. The &lt;a href=\"Corbolo%20River\"&gt;Corbolo River&lt;/a&gt; runs roughly north-south from this road, dividing southern Cheydinhal into two districts, Chapel in the east, and Market in the west. In Market District lie all the shops, inns, and guildhalls. In Chapel District are &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;the Chapel&lt;/a&gt; itself and Cheydinhal's residences. Bridges span the Corbolo in the north and south, with the south bridges connecting upon a pretty little island park in the middle of the river.\nThough Cheydinhal lies in the Nibenean East, its culture is shaped by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; immigrants who emigrated here in the past half century from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these immigrants were fleeing Morrowind's rigid society and heathen &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple theocracy&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; they hoped to find the stimulating commercial atmosphere inspired by &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;'s patronage.\nOne of these immigrants is now Count Cheydinhal. &lt;a href=\"Andel%20Indarys\"&gt;Andel Indarys&lt;/a&gt; was of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind, but he came to Cheydinhal searching for greater opportunity. His sudden rise into the highest ranks of Cyrodilic nobility is hard to explain, and most old families of Cyrodiil rightly regard him as a presumptuous upstart. However, the discovery of the Count's wife, Lady &lt;a href=\"Llathasa%20Indarys\"&gt;Llathasa Indarys&lt;/a&gt;, badly battered and dead at the foot of the County Hall stairs immediately attracted scandal, and rumors of the Count's dissipation, rages and infidelities suggest a darker mystery behind her death.\nThe Chapel of Arkay in Cheydinhal is poorly attended. The Count sets a poor example; he never sets foot inside the chapel. But perhaps it is from fear of divine judgement that he avoids placing himself under the eyes of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nine\"&gt;the Nine&lt;/a&gt;! Cheydinhal's primate, priest, and healer are goodly people, and staunch professors of the faith, but the most honored and respected of the chapel's clerics is &lt;a href=\"Errandil\"&gt;Errandil&lt;/a&gt;, the Living Saint of Arkay, a tireless crusader against the wicked practice of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic sorcery&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battle%20College\"&gt;Imperial Battle College&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth of Cheydinhal's inns appear respectable from the outside, but the &lt;a href=\"Newlands%20Inn\"&gt;Newlands Inn&lt;/a&gt; is owned by a wicked, profane Dark Elf ruffian, and the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Bridge%20Inn\"&gt;Cheydinhal Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt; is owned by a dignified, devout &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; matron, so I am sure you know which place will serve you good, reasonable food, and which will provide you with a safe, clean bed where you are unlikely to be murdered for your purse. The owner-proprietor of Cheydinhal's bookstore is &lt;a href=\"Mach-Na\"&gt;Mach-Na&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;, and a ruder, more disagreeable creature I have never met. Nonetheless, his selection of books is excellent, and his prices reasonable.\nThe poorest of Cheydinhal's residences are bright and clean, with well-groomed grounds, and the citizens think it no inconvenience when you step in to admire their furniture and appointments (provided you do this at a decent hour!). However, be warned! Many of these residents seem respectable to all appearances, but no sooner do they open their mouths than they reveal themselves to be evil brutes, shocking and rude, and more likely to murder you and bury you in their basements as to speak a civil word to you. That many of these rough, unpleasant people are &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; should be no surprise to you.\nHowever, you will not wish to miss the house of Cheydinhal's most notable citizen, the celebrated painter, &lt;a href=\"Rythe%20Lythandas\"&gt;Rythe Lythandas&lt;/a&gt;. He is often hard at work in his studio, and not to be disturbed, but his wife is gracious and hospitable, and may be persuaded to show you those of his paintings which hang on his own walls.\nFollow the Nine to Glory!"}

My name is &lt;a href=\"Alessia%20Ottus\"&gt;Alessia Ottus&lt;/a&gt;, and I'd like to tell you all about the town of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Castle%20Chorrol\"&gt;Castle Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;.\nChorrol is the county seat of County Chorrol, and is ruled by Countess &lt;a href=\"Arriana%20Valga\"&gt;Arriana Valga&lt;/a&gt;, a very proper woman, and mother of the beautiful and virtuous &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Alessia%20Caro\"&gt;Alessia Caro&lt;/a&gt;, Countess of Leyawiin.\nCountess Arriana is a devout and righteous follower of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, and sets a fine example for her people by her devotions in the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Chapel of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;. Her husband, Count Charus Valga, was a staunch Defender of the Faith and follower of Stendarr, and his death in battle against the heathen &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; clansmen of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; was greatly lamented by his people. Alessia Caro has been a good husband to Count Marius of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, and a dutiful daughter, and she is often seen visiting Chorrol and her saintly mother.\nI am also pleased to report that the castle mage is a righteous and goodly servant of the Nine (unlike so many wizards who neglect the Chapel and the Faith). &lt;a href=\"Chanel\"&gt;Chanel&lt;/a&gt; offers magical training for those eager to smite the ungodly, and it would be much better to go to her than to some wicked &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; hedgewizard.\nThe Countess holds court every day in the fine Great Hall (except on &lt;a href=\"Sundas\"&gt;Sundas&lt;/a&gt;, of course). She has a very fine herald and steward, and the castle is neat and well-ordered. It also has a strong dungeon jail for evildoers, though I'm sorry to say that the guards are often lax in their duties, and fail to arrest and lock up the various beggars and thieves and gamblers and cheats who idle in the streets.\nDistricts of Chorrol.\nThere are five main districts of Chorrol. When you enter the gate, you find yourself in Fountain Gate, before the fine pool and statue of the Saint of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, in memory of all who died in that great battle. Around the fountain are the two inns, the general store and the smith. One street leads east to the Castle, one north to Great Oak Place, one west to Chapel Street and West Chorrol. Chapel Street leads west to the Chapel, past the book store, and thence to the crude shacks gathered around the well of West Chorrol. Around Great Oak Place are the Mages Guild and Fighters Guild, and many fine houses.\nThe Chapel of Stendarr.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Chapel of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; is beautiful, and perfect for a traveler's mediations and prayer. Every Sundas morning you will find the best citizens gathered with their good countess for worship. You may be surprised to learn that not all people of Chorrol follow the model of their countess, for many are very idle and careless in their devotions. This is certainly the responsibility of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the Mages Guild, whose members fail to set a good example for Chorrol's citizens. The elderly priestess of the Chapel, &lt;a href=\"Orag%20gra-Bargol\"&gt;Orag gra-Bagrol&lt;/a&gt;, is a kindly, righteous soul, and it would be far better to purchase your spells from her than from the godless heathens of the Mages Guild.\nChorrol's Guilds.\nThe Fighters Guild's members, though led by the excellent and honorable &lt;a href=\"Vilena%20Donton\"&gt;Vilena Donton&lt;/a&gt;, are dirty and uncouth in their speech, and often to be found lazing about in their chapter house, or wandering the town and engaging in loose talk. How much better it would be if they improved their characters by regular attendance at the Chapel of Stendarr. Their excellent smith is an exception, being often seen at her devotions at the chapel.\nThe members of the &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Chorrol Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; are for the most part shiftless scholars and students who spend their time reading, quarreling, and brewing foul concotions. They are well-spoken and well-educated, but what good is such learning if they fail to improve their souls by penitence and prayer? You may purchase spells and potions from these persons, but it will only encourage them in their irreverent amusements and wicked idleness.\nGoods and Services.\nThe proprietor of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Goods%20and%20Trade\"&gt;Northern Goods and Trade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seed-Neeus\"&gt;Seed-Neeus&lt;/a&gt;, is an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike so many of her countrymen, she is clever, honest, and well-spoken. Isn't that remarkable? She is so accomplished that she offers training in the &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mercantile&lt;/a&gt; arts, but you will not purchase goods from her cheaply.\nI am told by those who know that the smith of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20and%20Steel\"&gt;Fire and Steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rasheda\"&gt;Rasheda&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;, is a very fine craftsman, who offers training in her craft, and she is always to be found at Sundas chapel worship, but she is fresh and disrespectful, and her manners and dress leave something to be desired.\n&lt;a href=\"Renoit%27s%20Books\"&gt;Renoit's Books&lt;/a&gt; is fairly clean, and has a wide selection of books, but would you believe that I found not a single copy of ', nor have I ever seen the proprietress in the Chapel of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;?\nThere are only two places where you may purchase food and lodging. One is proper and clean, frequented by decent citizens. The other is rude and dirty, and a meeting place for drunkards, thieves, and Orcs. The one is run by a well-dressed, dignified, and proper matron. The other is run by a careless young woman. The one is called the '&lt;a href=\"The%20Oak%20and%20Crosier\"&gt;Oak and Crosier&lt;/a&gt;'. The other is called '&lt;a href=\"The%20Grey%20Mare\"&gt;The Grey Mare&lt;/a&gt;'. I'm sure you know which one to visit if you want a clean and safe bed.\nNotable Citizens of Chorrol.\n&lt;a href=\"Casta%20Scribonia\"&gt;Casta Scribonia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"author\"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;, lives in Chorrol. She is a well-educated and well- traveled woman, but she writes books which I cannot recommend, for they are full of romance and gossip and other offensive and wasteful indulgences, and their heroes do not present to our children the proper models of virtue, duty, honor, and reverence that all followers of the Nine Divines must love and hold in our hearts.\nShameful Features of Chorrol.\nYou will often see townsfolk gathered in mischief and loose talk around the Great Oak near the Fighters and Mages Guilds. One man, very sly, named &lt;a href=\"Honditar\"&gt;Honditar&lt;/a&gt;, knows all about the surrounding lands, and he offers to teach skills for a fee, but one sees him in the chapel, and one suspects that he is given to profanity, strong drink, and brawling.\nThere are many &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;murderers&lt;/a&gt; in Chorrol. They even secretly teach their crafts for fees in their homes, and where is the &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20Guard\"&gt;Chorrol Guard&lt;/a&gt;? Nowhere to be seen, I'm sorry to say.\nThe beggars in Chorrol are dirty, but they are free of disease, cheerful, and polite. You may give a coin to one to ease your soul, but it does little to improve a beggar, for it will soon be squandered on gambling, strong spirits, and other mischief.\n&lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine gods&lt;/a&gt; and nine blessings!"}

There are trees and flowering shrubs everywhere, and peaceful plazas and ponds for quiet contemplation. Indeed, if it weren't for the raffish rabble of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; descent, Leyawiin would be a pleasant and safe place to visit.\n&lt;a href=\"Marius%20Caro\"&gt;Marius Caro&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; Leyawiin, and his recent bride, the lovely and cultivated &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Alessia%20Caro\"&gt;Alessia Caro&lt;/a&gt;, is the daughter of the righteous and reliable Countess &lt;a href=\"Arriana%20Valga\"&gt;Arriana Valga&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. The Count and Countess are energetic supporters of &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperialization&lt;/a&gt;, and they work tirelessly to bring the traditional values of hard-working, chapel-going, and law-abiding Nibenese &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt; Imperial culture to this frontier outpost.\nThe town itself lies with tall curtain walls on the west bank of the Niben. To the east through two gates lies the inner keep and &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Leyawiin\"&gt;Castle Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, straddling the deep channels of the river. The &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Zenithar\"&gt;Chapel of Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; lies in the northwest, near the West Gate. All the shops, inns, and guildhalls lie south of the chapel, in the western half of town, except for a fine bookstore and general trader north of the road traversing the town east-west from West Gate. The residential part of town runs along a single wide north-south boulevard, backed on the east by deep ponds created by impounding one of the meandering channels of the Niben.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Chapel of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; and the Count and Countess are partners in attempting to extend the benefits of heartland Nibenese culture to the benighted frontier populations of Blackwood and the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Niben\"&gt;Lower Niben&lt;/a&gt;. Trade and industry are strong in Leyawiin, thanks to the patronage of Zenithar, and notwithstanding the bandits troubling caravans and travellers along the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Road\"&gt;Green Road&lt;/a&gt; through the recently annexed Trans-Niben.\nLeyawiin boasts the finest collection of shops and tradesmen in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; (outside of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, of course). Even the craftsmen and trainers of the &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; are of a higher order of quality. Worth special mention is &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Books\"&gt;Southern Books&lt;/a&gt; -- a bookstore owned by an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;(!!!), always stocking multiple copies of \", a religious book appropriate for those ignorant of the mysteries of the faith, and adapted to the meanest understanding.\nRecently, a new competitor for the Fighters Guild, a mercenary hiring hall called '&lt;a href=\"The%20Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;The Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;', has commenced operations here in a striking new building. Despite being staffed almost exclusively by Khajiit and Argonians, the officers are polite, well-spoken, and deferential, and I'm told they aggressively compete with the Fighters Guild for price and service. (This is the Imperial way and pleasing to Zenithar\u2014to extend prosperity and security through enterprising commercial ventures.)\nI'm sorry to say that not all and Argonians in Leyawiin are as presentable and industrious as the members of the . Lizardmen and catfolk are to be seen in the streets at all hours, lounging and gossiping. If only these creatures would spend a little more time keeping themselves and their homes clean."}

Founded at the whim of Our Lord &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, the city is a model of the Madgod's own perfect vision.\nFirst-time visitors to New Sheoth are often impressed by the warmth, generosity, and general good humor of its residents. Visitors are welcomed with open arms, and generally made to feel as if they are a part of the large New Sheoth family. The sheer scope of the sights and sounds in the city can be daunting to the new visitor, and this Guide aims to make the transition as easy as possible for newcomers.\nVisitors will find the city is divided into three main sections: &lt;a href=\"Bliss\"&gt;Bliss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, and the Palace. Bliss and Crucible house the majority of residential and commercial buildings in the city, while the Palace area houses the magnificent Palace of Sheogorath, as well as the residences of the reigning Dukes of &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough located in the same city, visitors will find that the Bliss and Crucible areas of New Sheoth offer distinct experiences. The shining parapets and golden roads of Bliss stand in stark contrast to the rustic buildings and unpaved streets of Crucible. Travelers interested in a bustling nightlife and fine cuisine might prefer time spent in Bliss, renowned for its extravagant galas and spirited affairs. Visitors who seek a quieter experience would do well to spend their time exploring Crucible, where &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt; patrols encourage a more serene way of life.\nNo matter your tastes, New Sheoth promises an experience like no other. This Guide will give advice on how to best navigate the oft-confusing, though ultimately rewarding channels of this magnificent city.\nArriving in New Sheoth.\nTravelers to New Sheoth will arrive at its gates from either the highlands of Mania or the swampy lowlands of Dementia. Many make the mistake of hurrying directly to the gates of the city without exploring the beautiful and majestic countryside outside the city walls. This is certainly a mistake, as the forests and glades of the Shivering Isles are unlike those found anywhere else in all the realms. Some discussion of these areas is warranted, as exploring them is vital to experiencing all that the region has to offer.\nMania, Vibrant Land of Towering Flora.\nWalking amongst the giant mushroom trees of Mania is an experience any new visitor to the Shivering Isles is not soon to forget. Hours spent wandering in the forests of spore trees, breathing deeply of the spore-laden air-these are the times destined to remain a part of you forever. Feelings of peace and contentment wash over the body and calm the soul. It can seem as if you haven't a care in the world.\nTake the time to examine the beautiful plant life found in the region. Treat yourself to &lt;a href=\"Alocasia%20Fruit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fruit&lt;/a&gt;, which is known to have restorative properties, or pluck an &lt;a href=\"Aster%20Bloom%20Core%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Aster Bloom Core&lt;/a&gt;, which some locals believe has the ability to ward off the attacks of evil spirits.\nIf you plan on spending some time in the Mania countryside, consider visiting the small community of Hale. The residents are mostly local artists, and are very welcoming to weary travelers. Be sure to explore the lovely areas surrounding Hale, and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere.\nA cautious traveler is a safe traveler, though, even in the idyllic lands of Mania. While the paths that wind through the scenic countryside are generally safe, the surrounding regions pose some danger for the careless traveler. Mania is home to a number of indigenous animal species, some of which could be threatening to a less-seasoned adventurer. We recommend sticking to the clearly marked paths when traveling anywhere within the Shivering Isles.\nThe Slow Grace of Dementia.\nIt is often said, \"Time spent in Dementia is time not spent elsewhere.\" Truer words were never spoken.\nMany have spent days roaming the small islets of Dementia, enjoying the scenic views over the majestic lowlands. Travel over the quaint bridges that span the small islands of southern Dementia, and enjoy a beautiful sunset among the moss-covered trees.\nIf you're looking for a place to relax while exploring the lands of Dementia, we suggest a visit to &lt;a href=\"Deepwallow\"&gt;Deepwallow&lt;/a&gt;. The small community is a working farm, where the residents use a unique method of raising crops of some of the extraordinary local plant life. The residents of Deepwallow are private people, so care should be taken in approaching them. Once you've learned their customs, we've found them to be a most interesting group with whom to spend some time.\nTip: For an exciting day trip, visit the &lt;a href=\"Hill%20of%20Suicides\"&gt;Hill of Suicides&lt;/a&gt;, a site unlike any other in all the Shivering Isles. Located in central Dementia, travelers should not pass up the opportunity to take in the sights at this unique and fascinating location. There is no fee to visit the Hill, though some travelers have found it almost impossible to leave.\nGetting to the Shivering Isles.\nArrival to the Shivering Isles is solely at the discretion of Our Lord Sheogorath, Prince of Madness.\nGetting Around.\nThe best way to explore the Shivering Isles is by foot. Take the time to meander along the paths that stretch across the beautiful landscape. A weary traveler can often find a place to rest at one of the many campsites found dotted across the world.\nAccommodations.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Choosy%20Beggar\"&gt;The Choosy Beggar&lt;/a&gt;, Bliss. &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Biter\"&gt;Raven-Biter&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Sheer%20Meedish\"&gt;Sheer-Meedish&lt;/a&gt; run a fine restaurant and Inn in the Bliss district of New Sheoth. The rooms are nicely appointed, and the food is above-average for the area. We highly recommend trying the wine-it's some of the best in the city. Many travelers find lunch to be an especially good time to visit the Choosy Beggar. Though the prices are no lower, the earlier hour often finds Sheer-Meedish in a more accommodating mood.\n&lt;a href=\"Sickly%20Bernice%27s%20Taphouse\"&gt;Sickly Bernice's Taphouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;. Don't let the name fool you: Sickly Bernice's Taphouse is exactly what you'd expect from an inn located in downtown Crucible. The lodgings, while not as opulent as those found at the nearby Choosy Beggar, are satisfactory. Sickly Bernice is an affable hostess, when she is well enough to work. The food is palatable, as are the beverages. After a visit, make sure to see &lt;a href=\"Earil\"&gt;Earil&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Earil%27s%20Mysteries\"&gt;Earil's Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;. He sells a wide assortment of magicks, including some wonderful, low-cost Cure Disease spells.\nShopping.\n&lt;a href=\"Common%20Treasures\"&gt;Common Treasures&lt;/a&gt;, Bliss.\nIf you're looking for... well... anything, Common Treasures in Bliss is a good place to start. Trader &lt;a href=\"Tilse%20Areleth\"&gt;Tilse Arelith&lt;/a&gt; has a wide assortment of wares available to the discerning customer. She's also more than willing to negotiate a good price for those unwanted items you may find in your travels.\n&lt;a href=\"Cutter%27s%20Weapons\"&gt;Cutter's Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, .\nThere's not a finer weapon shop to be found in all of New Sheoth. Cutter runs a fine establishment, and usually keeps a good variety of weapons in stock and ready for use. She'll do repairs for you on the spot, and she seems to take extra-special care with your bladed weapons. This shop is not to be missed.\n&lt;a href=\"Books%20of%20Bliss\"&gt;Books of Bliss&lt;/a&gt;, Bliss.\nIf you're looking for reading material on your journey, this is the place to get it. Sontaire is a very, very friendly bookseller with a keen eye for more than just books. You won't be disappointed if you spend some of your hard-earned gold in this establishment.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Pauldron\"&gt;The Missing Pauldron&lt;/a&gt;, .\nIf it's armor you're in the mood to buy, look no further than The Missing Pauldron in Crucible. Recently re-opened under new manager Dumag gro-Bonk, the shop seems to be doing quite well. Dumag will be happy to sell you some new armor, repair you old favorites, or just sit a while and tell you the rather long and interesting story of his life.\n&lt;a href=\"Earil%27s%20Mysteries\"&gt;Earil's Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;, Crucible.\nMany adventurers don't like to travel without a full spell book, and Earil's is the place to go in New Sheoth to stock up on the latest in spellmaking. It sometimes seems time stands still as you browse through the excellent selection of spells. Highly recommended.\n&lt;a href=\"Things%20Found\"&gt;Things Found&lt;/a&gt;, Crucible.\nIt's an odd assortment of items, to be sure, but it's never a dull day when you visit Things Found in Crucible. Owner has scoured the realm in search of the most intriguing and varied assortment of magical items to be found almost anywhere. Take some time and browse around-you never know what you might find!"}

Don't let their beastly countenance fool you. The &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; are, by and large, a friendly and gracious people, eager to host visitors and entice travelers with all manner of goods and services. If you wish to vacation in a land of carefree ease, gentle breezes, and plentiful warmth, look no further!\nShould you travel there from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, you'll enter the venerable province of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of the two major regions that make up the province of Elsweyr\u2014and find the pastoral town of &lt;a href=\"Riverhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt; waiting to welcome you.\nThis bustling border town is a frequent stop for caravanners and travelers passing between Elsweyr and the greater Empire. The spacious town square acts as an open-air market where a wide array of goods are peddled right off the wagon by their enterprising owners, and the offerings vary by the hour as traders depart on their journeys or arrive from them. There's plenty to do other than haggle, of course. The &lt;a href=\"Banished%20Regrets%20Inn\"&gt;Banished Regrets inn&lt;/a&gt; frequently offers a selection of imported libations to ease a parched throat and the quiet atmosphere of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;'s Blessing is sure to give you a moment's peace. There is also a burgeoning &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Histories\"&gt;House of Histories&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to exhibit the long and storied history of the Khajiit upon its completion.\nOnce you're refreshed and ready to resume your travels, a short caravan ride east of Riverhold will lead you to the capital of Anequina: &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the road to Rimmen, you'll begin to see that the land of Elsweyr is as diverse as the Khajiit themselves. The closer you draw to the flourishing city, the more apparent it becomes that here the arid savannah has been tamed and the dry grassland has given way to lush greenery and flooded steppes of cane paddies. Within Rimmen's high walls, you will see that the misconception that Khajiit have an aversion to water is greatly exaggerated. Here trees and tropical plants thrive along artificial canals that weave throughout the city, supplied by a great aqueduct that spans the entire kingdom. Older than the city itself, it's a wonder constructed in an era long behind us. Lounging along the waterways is a favorite pass-time for residents and visitors alike. Rimmen's year-round warmth and largely clear skies make it a popular destination for vacationers from all around the Empire. Spend one day here and you'll find that Khajiit hospitality is second to none!\nIf you're feeling adventurous and up for a considerable hike, you can while away your time following the &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Aqueduct\"&gt;Anequina Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt; through the countryside. While you're touring the wonders of Anequina, you simply cannot miss the Scar, quite literally, an expansive canyon carved straight through the middle of the region. The sight of it from above or below is breathtaking in its magnitude and one you won't want to miss. Though you may find the sight of a vast water source that's just out of reach too much to bear in the arid scrub-lands that lie to the west.\nBefore you endeavor to traverse the winding chasm that is the Scar, it would behoove you to stop by the city of &lt;a href=\"Orcrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt;. While Riverhold is the gateway to Anequina, and Rimmen the capital, Orcrest is the center of commerce. This ancient, walled city rests along the cliffs of the Scar, outstretching its welcoming arms (its great bridges) to bring the disparate regions of Anequina together. Traders from all over the kingdom, and beyond come here to peddle their goods to their counterparts from neighboring Pellitine, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and Cyrodiil. Few things cannot be found for sale here. It's said that Khajiit here will part with their tail for the right price, but I'll admit that my fluency with &lt;a href=\"Languages%23Ta%27agra\"&gt;Ta'agra&lt;/a&gt; is not the best.\nYou may have tired hustle and bustle of city life, there are plenty of quieter places to take in the scenery. Placid moon-sugar farms dot the meadows of &lt;a href=\"Merryvale\"&gt;Merryvale&lt;/a&gt;, where the cane stalks sway along with the songs of cheery harvesters in the cool breeze. Khajiiti temples to the Divines are both numerous and strikingly beautiful. &lt;a href=\"Sunspire\"&gt;Sunspire&lt;/a&gt; in particular dwarfs any cathedral in &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Though if you want a truly unique Elsweyr experience, spend some time meditating with the monks of one of their adeptoriums and take in the feats of strength, agility, and skill that these dedicated ascetics are capable of.\nIf my words have brought you this far, I hope you'll take a few steps more and begin your travels to one of the most wondrous provinces in the Empire!"}

Sadrith Mora is an island settlement, and accessible only by sea and teleportation. The town is large, with many craftsmen, traders, and trainers, but it is open only to Telvanni retainers; outsiders should confine themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Inn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gateway Inn&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Hall\"&gt;Wolverine Hall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; quarters of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; garrison and guilds. The docks are in a sheltered bay on the western side of the island, and a trail leads up from the docks to the &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Inn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gateway Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond the Gateway Inn is the Great Market, with numerous craftsmen and traders, and a small slave market. North of the Great Market is the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Council%20Hall\"&gt;Telvanni Council Hall&lt;/a&gt;, a large orb supported by giant mushroom stalks. To the east of the Great Market is &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Naga%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Naga&lt;/a&gt;, the towering wizard-tower residence of Telvanni Councilor Mage-Lord &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Master Neloth&lt;/a&gt;.\nServices.\nOutlanders can find services for the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20cult\"&gt;Imperial cult&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Hall\"&gt;Wolverine Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; congregate at &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20Muriel%27s%20Cornerclub\"&gt;Dirty Muriel's Cornerclub&lt;/a&gt;. Telvanni Great House and &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; services are all housed within the Council Hall; additional Telvanni services are available in the Great Market district and in Tel Naga. The Gateway merchant inn is the only establishment with public beds. Members of the Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, and Imperial cults look for hospitality at Wolverine Hall. Telvanni kin and retainers stay at the Gateway, at Wolverine Hall, at a local cornerclub, or at Tel Naga. The Great Market has many services and tradesmen, and many others are scattered through town. There are two cornerclubs: &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20Muriel%27s%20Cornerclub\"&gt;Dirty Muriel's&lt;/a&gt;, for outlanders, and &lt;a href=\"Fara%27s%20Hole%20in%20the%20Wall\"&gt;Fara's Hole in the Wall&lt;/a&gt; for local &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Tel Naga is Master Neloth's wizard tower.\nNotable Figures.\nIf you're not Telvanni or Telvanni retainers, you'll want to know &lt;a href=\"Angaredhel\"&gt;Angaredhel&lt;/a&gt;, Prefect of Hospitality at the Gateway merchant inn, and &lt;a href=\"Ery\"&gt;Ery&lt;/a&gt;, Gateway's publican. At Wolverine Hall, &lt;a href=\"Hrundi\"&gt;Hrundi&lt;/a&gt; the Nord is the Fighters Guild steward, is Mages Guild steward, and &lt;a href=\"Aunius%20Autrus\"&gt;Aunius Autrus&lt;/a&gt; is the Imperial cult priest. &lt;a href=\"Big%20Helende\"&gt;Big Helende&lt;/a&gt;, the Thieves Guild Boss, makes frequent appearances at Dirty Muriel's Cornerclub. Telvanni wizards and retainers visit the Council Hall to confer with the Telvanni &lt;a href=\"Mouth\"&gt;Mouth&lt;/a&gt;s (Telvanni Mouths are spokesmen for their councilor mage-lords) &lt;a href=\"Felisa%20Ulessen\"&gt;Felisa Ulessen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galos%20Mathendis\"&gt;Galos Mathendis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arara%20Uvulas\"&gt;Arara Uvulas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mallam%20Ryon\"&gt;Mallam Ryon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Omayn\"&gt;Raven Omayn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dalyne%20Arvel\"&gt;Dalyne Arvel&lt;/a&gt;, Telvanni Council clerk. Councilor Mage-Lord Master Neloth lives in Tel Naga, the wizard tower in the center of town.\nTransportation.\nSadrith Mora is an island; there's no road or bridge to the mainland. To visit the mainland, you must either be able to fly, swim, or &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;water-walk&lt;/a&gt;, or you must rely on shipmasters at the docks or the guild guide at the Mages Guild. &lt;a href=\"Gals%20Arethi\"&gt;Gals Arethi&lt;/a&gt; at the docks offers ship passage to &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Mora&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Iniel\"&gt;Iniel&lt;/a&gt; at the Wolverine Hall Mages Guild can teleport you to &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; for a modest fee."}

My name is &lt;a href=\"Alessia%20Ottus\"&gt;Alessia Ottus&lt;/a&gt;, and I'd like to tell you all about &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkingrad County is famous for its &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tomato%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, and cheeses, and the town of Skingrad is one of the cleanest, safest, and most prosperous towns in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Located in the heart of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt; highlands, Skingrad is the gem of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Old Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, and a model of the Colovian virtues of independence, hardwork, and tough-mindedness.\nSkingrad has three districts: the Castle, Hightown, and Chapel. A low road runs east-west under the walls and bridges of the upper town. The guilds and &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20Inn\"&gt;West Weald Inn&lt;/a&gt; are in the west of HighTown, while many shops and upper class residence are arranged along a street in the north. The southern half of the town includes the chapel at its east end, with Skingrad's other lodgings, the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sisters%20Lodge\"&gt;Two Sisters Inn&lt;/a&gt;, on a street in the center, with other residences, modest and mean, scattered through the rest of the district. Gates and bridges cross the low road to connect Hightown and Chapel in several places. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Skingrad\"&gt;Castle Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; is completely separate from the town, standing on a high prominence to the southeast. A road from the town's east gate leads from town to the castle.\n&lt;a href=\"Janus%20Hassildor\"&gt;Janus Hassildor&lt;/a&gt;, Count Skingrad, has ruled Skingrad for many years, and is known by reputation to be a powerful wizard. He is a very private man, and declined all requests for an interview, and he shamefully neglects his chapel devotions to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nine\"&gt;the Nine&lt;/a&gt;. How are the people to learn public virtue if not from the model of their ruler? Nonetheless, he is widely honored and respected by his people, and Skingrad is a model of a well-run, orderly county. Crime, gambling, and public drunkenness are almost unknown, and its wines and cheeses command high prices all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two inns in Skingrad. One, the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sisters%20Lodge\"&gt;Two Sisters Inn&lt;/a&gt;, is owned by two &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. I'm pleased to tell you that this inn is clean and well-ordered, and is troubled neither by riot nor public drunkenness. The other inn is run by a pleasant &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; woman. Neither of these proprietors are to be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;Chapel of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, so I am at a loss to tell you which one you should choose when seeking food or lodgings.\nHowever, I am certain where you should go to purchase your sweet rolls\u2014to &lt;a href=\"Salmo\"&gt;Salmo&lt;/a&gt; the Baker in Chapel District! They are delicious. As for where to sample the other tasty treats of Skingrad\u2014its cheeses and tomatoes\u2014I must leave that to your discretion. I am sure you are not interested in Skingrad's wines, for drinking leads to disorderliness, and disorderliness leads to sin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; here is no better than it is in other places, but the &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; makes a specialty of goblin hunting, which is a great service to travelers in the West Weald. And I was shocked to discover that the town smith openly refers to himself as '&lt;a href=\"Agnete%20the%20Pickled\"&gt;Agnete the Pickled&lt;/a&gt;'. Can you imagine being proud of such shameful behavior?\nKeep the Nine in your heart!"}

Do you think they are big, dumb cousins of normal wolves? Then you are stupid. Dire wolves are cunning and deadly. To them, your laughter says, \"I am the next thing to fill your belly.\" Shelga laughed at dire wolves once. Now Shelga has one ear.\nShelga is no longer stupid. Now Shelga is beastmaster of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, the city with the dire wolf banner. This is why Shelga spends much time taming dire wolves.\nYou may think it impossible to tame dire wolves. This is true. Predators cannot be tamed. Not really. But if Shelga called it a \"Guide to Making Dire Wolves Eat Your Enemies and Not You,\" none would purchase. Or purchase for the wrong reasons.\nFirst thing. A dire wolf looks like a wolf. It moves like a wolf. It smells like a wolf. But it is not. It is a dire wolf.\nSounds easy, but easy to forget.\nA wolf needs a pack. A wolf with no pack is vicious. It is afraid to be alone. With effort you can tame a wolf. Give it food if it is hungry. Make it think it is part of your pack.\nA dire wolf needs no pack. This is because a dire wolf is one whole wolf pack. It is vicious only if it wants to be. It is not afraid to be alone because it is a dire wolf.\nYou cannot tame a dire wolf like a wolf. If it is ever hungry, you are food. It needs no pack but itself. You must show it you are a pack as well. Show how your pack and its pack should travel together for more food. A dire wolf understands this because it eats as much as one whole wolf pack.\nSecond thing. A dire wolf has a long memory. It is like a clan-mother with grudges from forty years ago. Don't give it reason to hate you. Shelga's sister Gralga once slapped a dire wolf for eating off her plate. This is how Gralga lost a thumb and learned manners at the same time. Gralga doesn't visit Kvatch anymore.\nIf a dire wolf comes to hate you, do not back down. Do not cower. Show it you know its hate. Show it you don't fear its hate. This shows respect. Then give it much food to smother the hate.\nShelga thinks this is why Kvatch puts the dire wolf on its flag. Kvatch does not forget. Kvatch respects those who show it respect. And Kvatch will smother its hate if you throw its people many banquets.\nSometimes the dire wolf still hates you. Then you must kill the dire wolf. Do not do so in sight of a dire wolf's mate or it will hate you too. Just like people.\nThird thing. Scratch the belly. Scratch behind the ear, but not in the ear. Scratch where the tail meets the back. Top part of tail only! Scratch below the chin.\nDo not scratch the paws. Dire wolf paws are sensitive, like &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Also they have sharp claws. When a dire wolf thinks you want to take its paws away, it will come to hate you.\nLast thing. A dire wolf is clever but it doesn't understand magic. So use magic. Scrolls are cheaper than a false hand. Don't try to tame a dire wolf like in the stories. Don't be stupid.\nShelga's sister Bolga says this is cheating.

Each of the great cantons is the size of a complete town. The &lt;a href=\"High%20Fane\"&gt;High Fane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"palace%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt; are visited by hundreds of tourists and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Path%20%28Book%29\"&gt;pilgrims&lt;/a&gt; daily. Citizens flock to the Arena for public entertainments like mock battles and comic plays. Outlanders mostly confine themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Foreign%20Quarter\"&gt;Foreign Canton&lt;/a&gt;, while natives live, work, and shop in the Great House compounds and residential cantons. But most of all, this is Lord Vivec's holy city. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, the Temple prison, hangs above the great temple of the High Fane, the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Halls of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Justice%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt;, and Lord Vivec's Palace.\nVivec is a city made up of eight cantons, each a little town in itself. On a map, it looks like a cross, with the Foreign Quarter at the top, the Temple Compound, with Vivec's Palace, the High Fane, the Ministry of Truth, and the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Hall of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Justice%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hall of Justice&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom, the Hlaalu Compound to the west, the Telvanni Compound on the east, and four cantons grouped together at the center of the cross -- Redoran Compound northwest, Arena northeast, St. Delyn's Canton southwest, and St. Olms Canton southeast.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Foreign%20Quarter\"&gt;Foreign Quarter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Foreign Quarter is the large three-tiered canton to the north. Originally, foreigners were not allowed to enter Vivec any further than the Foreign Quarter, but now outlanders can travel throughout Vivec at will. The Imperial Guilds each have guildhalls and complete services here, and an Imperial cult shrine serves the spiritual needs of the Imperial faithful. Various independent tradesmen, craftsmen, and trainers also rent space here. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Shalk%20Cornerclub\"&gt;Black Shalk Cornerclub&lt;/a&gt; rents beds to non-guild visitors.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Temple%20Canton\"&gt;Temple Compound&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe High Fane is the largest Tribunal temple on Vvardenfell. &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saryoni\"&gt;Saryoni&lt;/a&gt; presides over the temple, along with a large staff of priests, healers, and monks. Pilgrims travel from all over Morrowind to view the &lt;a href=\"High%20Fane\"&gt;High Fane&lt;/a&gt; and the Ministry of Truth, and to offer prayer and thanks before the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;Palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, a celestial body suspended by Vivec's mighty power over the Temple Compound, is the headquarters of the Temple &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;, and heretics are imprisoned and re-educated there. The Hall of Wisdom and Hall of Justice contain the executive, administrative, judicial, and martial operations of the Tribunal Temple. The Palace of Vivec is the abode of the god-hero Lord &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the Warrior-Poet of the three deities who comprise &lt;a href=\"Almsivi\"&gt;Almsivi&lt;/a&gt;, the divine patrons of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Only the most devout are admitted to the presence of Lord Vivec, and only at his initiation. Beneath the Palace of Vivec is the &lt;a href=\"Puzzle%20Canal\"&gt;Puzzle Canal&lt;/a&gt;, a place of worship and testing for questing heroes hoping to receive Vivec's favor. Many choice treasures are guarded by &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; servants in the &lt;a href=\"Puzzle%20Canal\"&gt;Puzzle Canal&lt;/a&gt;'s dark passages.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Hlaalu%20Canton\"&gt;Hlaalu Compound&lt;/a&gt;.\nHlaalu Compound is the westmost canton. The Hlaalu Councilor &lt;a href=\"Crassius%20Curio\"&gt;Crassius Curio&lt;/a&gt; has a splendid tier-top mansion here. The tiers below contain Hlaalu &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Treasury\"&gt;treasuries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Records\"&gt;records&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Prison%20Cells\"&gt;holding cells&lt;/a&gt;, and various Great House services. There are two public houses: the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Nations%20Cornerclub\"&gt;Elven Nations&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"No%20Name%20Club\"&gt;No Name Club&lt;/a&gt;. A variety of craftsmen and tradesmen also have shops at Hlaalu Compound. Some &lt;a href=\"Yngling%20Half-Troll\"&gt;House Hlaalu nobles&lt;/a&gt; and retainers prefer to maintain their residences in the less-formal St. Delyn and St. Olms cantons.\nTelvanni Compound.\nTelvanni Compound is the eastmost canton. The mage-lord &lt;a href=\"Mavon%20Drenim\"&gt;Mavon Drenim&lt;/a&gt; is the ranking Telvanni noble. The Telvanni rent the compound from the Temple, and have to make do with a &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i tower instead of their preferred mushroom towers. The administrative center includes a &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Treasury\"&gt;treasury&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Records\"&gt;hall of records&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;Slaves&lt;/a&gt; are housed in the lowest tiers, along with cells full of &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Monster%20Lab\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt;. There are many tradesmen, craftsmen, and trainers, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Lizard%27s%20Head\"&gt;the Lizard's Head&lt;/a&gt; cornerclub provides lodgings for Telvanni kin and mercenaries.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Redoran%20Canton\"&gt;Redoran Compound&lt;/a&gt;.\nRedoran Compound is the canton south of the Foreign Quarter, west of and next to the Arena. The Redoran administrative center there includes the &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Treasury\"&gt;Redoran Treasury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Records\"&gt;Hall of Records&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Prison%20Cells\"&gt;Holding Cells&lt;/a&gt;. On the lowest tier is a Redoran shrine and ancestral vaults. Two noble families, the Savens and the Dralors, have top-tier manors. There are many tradesmen, craftsmen, and trainers, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Flowers%20of%20Gold\"&gt;the Flowers of Gold&lt;/a&gt; cornerclub provides lodgings for Redoran kin and retainers.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Arena%20Canton\"&gt;Arena Compound&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arena Compound lies between the Redoran compound on the west and the Telvanni compound on the east. The Arena is the site of public entertainments and combat sports. The comfortable domed Arena has seating for hundreds of spectators; beneath the Arena are dressing and &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Storage\"&gt;storage rooms&lt;/a&gt; for entertainers and training rooms and animal pens for the combat competitors.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20St.%20Delyn%20Canton\"&gt;St. Delyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20St.%20Olms%20Canton\"&gt;St. Olms&lt;/a&gt; Residential Cantons.\nSt. Delyn Canton and St. Olms Canton are residence cantons for commoners and paupers. The Temple charges very reasonable rents for comfortable workshops, shops, and apartments, and most of Vvardenfell's crafts and light industry are housed in these cantons. &lt;a href=\"The%20Abbey%20of%20St.%20Delyn%20the%20Wise\"&gt;The Abbey of St. Delyn the Wise&lt;/a&gt; is on the top tier of St. Delyn, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; Councilor &lt;a href=\"Yngling%20Half-Troll\"&gt;Yngling Half-Troll&lt;/a&gt; has a top-tier manor on St. Olms.\nTransportation.\nFoot bridges connect with the mainland between the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; region and Hlaalu Compound, between the north bay region and the Foreign Quarter, and between the east bay region and Telvanni Compound. Good roads lead from the Hlaalu Compound bridge south to Ebonheart and north to &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; and points north. Good roads lead from the Foreign Quarter bridge west towards Seyda Neen, north towards &lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and east towards &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt;. Roads from the Telvanni Compound bridge are useful mostly for travelers to Molag Mar. &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Silt strider&lt;/a&gt; service is available at the north end of the Foreign Quarter bridge, traveling from Vivec to Suran, Seyda Neen, &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, and Molag Mar. Ships from the docks at the Foreign Quarter travel to Ebonheart, &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;, Molag Mar, and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt;. Ships from nearby Ebonheart sail to &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;, Sadrith Mora, Tel Branora, and the Foreign Quarter of Vivec. Low-fare gondolas shuttle passengers from canton to canton via Vivec's canals."}

The rest of the island is covered by hostile desert wastes, arid grasslands, and volcanic badlands, and thinly populated by the nomadic &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; tribes.\nVvardenfell has nine basic geographic regions, each with their own distinctive plants and terrain features. Scholars have based their classifications on the different types of land described by the native Ashlanders, so the designations are recognized by most local traders, travelers, and adventurers. These geographic regions are called: the Ascadian Isles, the Ashlands, Azura's Coast, the Bitter Coast, the Grazelands, Molag Amur, Red Mountain, the West Gash, and Sheogorad.\n&lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ascadian Isles is a region of lush, green, well-watered southern lowlands where most of Vvardenfell's agriculture is found. The area includes &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt; along with the inland lakes and waterways of the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt; proper. The urban areas of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; of the southern coast are densely populated; the inland Ascadian Isles are dotted with small farms and large plantations. The climate is temperate and comfortable, with moderate rainfall.\n&lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; is the seat of the Imperial government for Vvardenfell district, and a busy center of maritime trade. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Ebonheart\"&gt;Castle Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; is the home of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Duke Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt;, the district's ruler and Emperor's representative. Also located at Castle Ebonheart are the Vvardenfell District Council chambers and the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Moth%20Legion%20garrison\"&gt;Hawk Moth Legion garrison&lt;/a&gt;. The officers, docks, and warehouses of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; are also found in Ebonheart.\nVivec City is the largest settlement on Vvardenfell, and one of the largest cities in the East. Each of the great cantons is the size of a complete town. The &lt;a href=\"High%20Fane\"&gt;High Fane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"palace%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt; are visited by hundreds of tourists and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Path%20%28Book%29\"&gt;pilgrims&lt;/a&gt; daily. Citizens flock to the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Arena%20Canton\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; for entertainments and war games. Outlanders mostly confine themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Foreign%20Quarter\"&gt;Foreign Canton&lt;/a&gt;, while natives live, work, and shop in the Great House compounds and residential cantons.\n&lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt; is a splendid &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Ruins%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric ruin&lt;/a&gt; within sight of Vivec City. Though exotic and picturesque, it is a dangerous site, haunted by old magics, dark cultists, and their &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; summonings, and not recommended for sightseers.\n&lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt; is an agricultural village in the northeastern corner of the fertile Ascadian Isles region. Two popular pilgrimage sites are nearby -- the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Kummu%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Fields of Kummu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;Molag Bal's Shrine&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt; is a newly chartered &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; village between &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; on the western edge of the Ascadian Isles region. The village is right outside the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; garrison at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Pelagiad\"&gt;Fort Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;. The houses and shops are built in the Western Imperial style, and Pelagiad looks more like a village in the western Empire than a Morrowind settlement.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ashlands\"&gt;The Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ashlands are the dry, inhospitable wastelands surrounding the lower slopes of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The Ashlands extend to the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; in the north, and elsewhere form a wide margin between the blighted Red Mountain region and other geographic regions. The village of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; is the only sizable permanent Ashlands settlement; &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, the district seat of House Redoran, is on the margin of the region. Ashlanders hunt for game here, and their herds find sparse grazing. It rains rarely, and suffers frequent ash storms.\nMaar Gan is a small isolated village in a remote region north of Ald'ruhn. The &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan%20Shrine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Maar Gan shrine&lt;/a&gt; is an important &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; pilgrimage site.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku tribe&lt;/a&gt; has a permanent settlement at Urshilaku camp in the Ashlands region north of Maar Gan village.\n&lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rugged coast and islands of northern and eastern Vvardenfell are called Azura's Coast. The region is rocky, infertile, and largely uninhabited, except for the outpost at &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; settlements at Sadrith Mora, the wizard towers at &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, Tel Mora, and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt;, and Ahemmusa camp and the remote fishing villages of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Redaynia\"&gt;Ald Redaynia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt; on the north coast. There are no roads; most travel is by boat. Despite the rocky terrain, a variety of plants thrive on the regular rainfall.\n&lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; is the district seat of House Telvanni, and home of the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Council\"&gt;Telvanni Council&lt;/a&gt;, though only one Telvanni councilor actually lives in Sadrith Mora. Sadrith Mora is an island settlement, and accessible only by sea and teleportation. The town is large, with many services, but it is open only to Telvanni retainers; outsiders must confine themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Inn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gateway Inn&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt; is the tower and seat of the eccentric Telvanni wizard named &lt;a href=\"Therana%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Therana&lt;/a&gt;. The tower and its tiny village are located on a rocky promontory at the southeasternmost tip of Azura's Coast.\n&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt; is the Telvanni tower of Sorcerer-Lord &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. Beneath the tower is the &lt;a href=\"Corprusarium\"&gt;Corprusarium&lt;/a&gt;, a refuge-prison where the deranged, distorted victims of the deadly corprus disease are housed and tended.\n&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; is the Telvanni tower of &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gothren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gothren&lt;/a&gt;, Telvanni Sorcerer-Lord and head of the Telvanni Council. The associated settlement is a sizable village, and the site of the Festival Slave Market, the largest slave market on Vvardenfell.\n&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Mora&lt;/a&gt; is the Telvanni tower of &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Dratha%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mistress Dratha&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient wizard of the Telvanni Council. The small settlement includes a few craftsfolk and a tradehouse.\n&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt; is the tower of Telvanni wizard and council member Master &lt;a href=\"Aryon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Aryon&lt;/a&gt;. Tel Vos is a peculiar blend of Telvanni and Western architectural styles, and is close to &lt;a href=\"Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt; village.\n&lt;a href=\"Bal%20Fell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bal Fell&lt;/a&gt; is the \"City of Stone,\" an ancient &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; ruin in the southeastern islands and promontories of Azura's Coast. The site has a nasty reputation, and several Telvanni wizards currently have competing camps of hirelings and adventurers exploring and looting there. Legend says that Bal Fell was built on the site of an ancient Daedric worship center.\nThe Ashlander &lt;a href=\"Ahemmusa%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ahemmusa tribe&lt;/a&gt; has a permanent settlement at &lt;a href=\"Ahemmusa%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ahemmusa camp&lt;/a&gt; on a rocky promontory at the northeastern tip of the Vvardenfell mainland in the Azura's Coast region.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Bitter%20Coast\"&gt;The Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe western coast of Vvardenfell from &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; north to &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt; is called the Bitter Coast. The salt marshes and humid swamps of this region are uninhabited, with the only settlements found at the good harbors of Gnaar Mok, &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;, and Seyda Neen. Also called the Smuggler's Coast, the region's secluded coves and islands provide refuge for criminal trade, and the frequent rain and fog hides small boats from &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise\"&gt;Excise&lt;/a&gt; cutters.\nThe piercing light of the Grand Pharos at the mouth of the harbor of the port village of Seyda Neen is a beacon to mariners throughout the Inner Sea. Most visitors from the Empire make landfall at the port of Seyda Neen, where they are processed by the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise\"&gt;Census and Excise&lt;/a&gt; Commission agents of the Coastguard station. The Coastguard cutters docked here control smuggling and piracy on the Inner Sea.\nHla Oad is a tiny isolated fishing village on western Vvardenfell in the Bitter Coast region. A rough track along the &lt;a href=\"River%20Odai\"&gt;River Odai&lt;/a&gt; connects Hla Oad with the town of Balmora.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt; is a tiny island fishing village in the Bitter Coast region of western Vvardenfell.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Grazelands\"&gt;The Grazelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe regular rain and dark soils of the Grazelands produce the rich grazing for Ashlander herds that give the region its name. The region lies in the northeast of Vvardenfell, sandwiched between the Ashlands and &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Permanent settlements include Vos village and the towers of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. The Ashlanders of &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Zainab camp&lt;/a&gt; move their herds across the plains in search of fresh grazing. There are no roads or tracks, but travel is easy across the open plains.\nThe Ashlander &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Zainab tribe&lt;/a&gt; has a permanent settlement at Zainab camp, near the village of Vos in the Grazelands region.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocated inland in the southeast of Vvardenfell, Molag Amur is an uninhabited wasteland of rocky hills, steep-sided ravines, lava pools, and barren ash pavements. Pathfinding and travel is extremely difficult in this trackless wilderness, and is complicated by frequent ash storms. The Ashlanders of &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Erabenimsun camp&lt;/a&gt; hunt game here, but few others venture into this region. The worst part of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;, called the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Scathes\"&gt;Great Scathes&lt;/a&gt;, is considered impassible even by the Ashlanders.\nThe outpost at &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt; is a fortified stronghold on the southeastern edge of the desolate Molag Amur region. &lt;a href=\"The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Path%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Pilgrims&lt;/a&gt; bound for the nearby pilgrimage sites at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Assarnibibi\"&gt;Mount Assarnibibi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kand\"&gt;Mount Kand&lt;/a&gt; take refuge at the outpost's hostels, comforted by the garrison of Redoran and Buoyant Armiger crusaders stationed at the stronghold.\nThe Ashlander &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Erabenimsun tribe&lt;/a&gt; has a permanent settlement at &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Erabenimsun camp&lt;/a&gt;, an isolated hut settlement in the middle of the desolate Molag Amur region.\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dominant feature of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, is a vast volcano in the center of Vvardenfell. The outer slopes are steep and rugged, and the crater is deep and dotted with surface lava. The &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;, a magical barrier which blocks travel as well as seals in the harmful, disease-laden weather called 'blight,' rings the volcano's outer slopes, and is broken only at &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Ghostfence, rain never falls and the sun never shines; the only weather is the red and deadly ash-blight.\nGhostgate is the gate citadel of the Ghostfence &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armiger%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armiger&lt;/a&gt; garrisons. Ghostgate sits astride the only gap through which the monstrous hosts of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; might emerge from Red Mountain to threaten the rest of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The Ghostfence itself is a colossal magical artifact that completely encircles Red Mountain and prevents the Blight from spilling its corruption across the rest of Vvardenfell.\n&lt;a href=\"West%20Gash%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe western highlands of are called the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. The region extends from the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; on the northwest coast to the inland town of &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, where the region is sandwiched between the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;. The trading village of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; is north of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, and the fishing villages of and &lt;a href=\"Khuul\"&gt;Khuul&lt;/a&gt; lie on the north coast. The town of &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; lies near Balmora. The herds of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku camp&lt;/a&gt; graze on the sparse but hardy highland vegetation.\nBalmora is the district seat of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, and the largest settlement on Vvardenfell after &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Good roads lead north to &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; and south to &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial Legion garrison of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Moonmoth\"&gt;Fort Moonmoth&lt;/a&gt; lies south of Balmora.\nCaldera is a recently chartered Imperial town and mining corporation. The &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mining%20Company\"&gt;Caldera Mining Company&lt;/a&gt; has been granted an Imperial monopoly to remove &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;raw ebony&lt;/a&gt; from the rich deposits here. Caldera has the appearance and flavor of a Western Imperial town.\n&lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; is the district seat of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, and a large settlement. The &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Council%20Entrance\"&gt;Redoran Council Chamber&lt;/a&gt; are located inside the shell of an &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn-under-Skar\"&gt;ancient extinct giant crab&lt;/a&gt;. Tracks lead north to &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis villages&lt;/a&gt; and south to Balmora.\nGnisis is a small mining and trade village astride the &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;silt strider&lt;/a&gt; caravan route between the northwest West Gash and Ald'ruhn.\n&lt;a href=\"Ald%20Velothi%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Velothi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khuul\"&gt;Khuul&lt;/a&gt; are tiny fishing villages on the northern coast of the West Gash.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe large island of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt; lies north of Vvardenfell. This island and its associated lesser islands are a maritime wilderness extending north from Vvardenfell into the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. The region is largely hostile and uninhabited, with two small villages at &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Redaynia\"&gt;Ald Redaynia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt;. Only Dagon Fel is reached by ship services; all other island-to-island transport must be provided by the traveler."}

Indeed, the kings of the Covenant take the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Remans&lt;/a&gt; as their model, claiming to be the spiritual heirs of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nThe Daggerfall Covenant was born in &lt;a href=\"2E%20542\"&gt;2E 542&lt;/a&gt;, when the kings of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; allied to repulse an invasion by a horde of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Durcorach\"&gt;Durcorach&lt;/a&gt;, \"the Black Drake.\" Howling out of the eastern mountains, the Reach barbarians razed &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, besieged &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, sacked &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, and marched as far as the gates of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; before the Bretons finally stopped them. In the wake of Durcorach's defeat, the kings of Daggerfall, Wayrest, Camlorn, Evermore, and &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; swore the so-called \"first\" Daggerfall Covenant, a solemn oath to defend each other's kingdoms and stand as one against all foreign foes.\nHigh Rock prospered as the Bretons rebuilt, especially after &lt;a href=\"2E%20561\"&gt;2E 561&lt;/a&gt;, when miners near Wayrest made the biggest &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum%20Ore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;orichalcum&lt;/a&gt; strike in recorded history. &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, Earl of the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cumberland\"&gt;Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the mines, proposed to use the resulting wealth to enhance Wayrest's fleet and improve trade throughout High Rock. King &lt;a href=\"Gardner%20Dynasty\"&gt;Gardner&lt;/a&gt; of Wayrest granted his approval, but before the fleet was completed, the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; swept through Wayrest and killed the entire Gardner royal household. Earl Emeric was elevated to the throne and House Cumberland became the second royal dynasty of Wayrest.\nThe new King Emeric of Wayrest had been courting the daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; of Shornhelm, but in &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt; he married Princess &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. This nearly brought down the first Covenant when Ranser, who felt betrayed, launched a surprise attack on Wayrest. The kings of Camlorn, Evermore, and Daggerfall all sided with Wayrest, and Emeric's superior diplomacy brought the armies of Sentinel into the fray to protect Emeric's queen. Furthermore, Emeric reached out to a great clan of Orcs in &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; and offered them &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; in return for aid. Shornhelm was defeated and the Covenant was reborn: not as a mere Breton defensive pact, but as a new, multinational alliance.\nThe conclave that negotiated the alliance lasted for months, with argument and debate at every turn. The final result was the child of King Emeric's vision, made manifest in dozens of compromises and carefully negotiated provisions. Freedom of trade was guaranteed throughout the region, and over the objections of the nobles of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crown&lt;/a&gt; Redguards of &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;, the Orcs were accepted as full members of the alliance. Eventually, all the city-states of northwest Tamriel swore fealty to the Covenant's &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Council\"&gt;Royal Council&lt;/a&gt;, presided over by High King Emeric. As the architect of the alliance, he claimed supreme leadership.\nSo this is the modern Daggerfall Covenant, an alliance of the Redguards of northern &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, under King &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;; the Orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;mountainous northeast&lt;/a&gt;, under King &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;Kurog&lt;/a&gt; of Orsinium; with the Breton King Emeric of High Rock presiding from his palace in Wayrest. At its best, it is a noble alliance of honorable and chivalrous peoples, representing all the best aspects of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;s. And from this solid foundation, perhaps a third, even mightier Empire shall arise, providing all the peoples of Tamriel the benefits of mutual respect, vigorous trade, and reverence for &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "559400", "revid": "29733383", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=559400", "title": "Guide to the Ebonheart Pact", "text": "Guide to the Ebonheart Pact is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; has forged an unlikely alliance between the far-flung nations of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, bringing together the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, and free &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; for their mutual defense. Thanks to the size of its allied nations and the distances involved, the Pact remains relatively free of inner strife and discord. The Nords and Dark Elves have so much of their own territory to deal with that they have little time to spare for meddling in each other's affairs.\nThe Ebonheart Pact came about in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt; in response to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; of northern &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Nords, Dark Elves, and free Argonians joined forces to save the rest of Tamriel from slaughter and subjugation. Forged in war, the alliance brought a sudden new power to the continent. At first, few believed the Dark Elves would be able to maintain an alliance with their ancient blood enemies and former &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt;, but after a troubled decade, the Pact remains strong and intact.\nA &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt; governs the Pact. This council of equals from each of the member &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Online%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; is not only known for hot tempers and loud voices, but also for mutual respect and an amazing will to hold the Pact together against all odds. Only as equals can the allies hope to mollify the pride of the Nords and the Dark Elves while addressing the injuries suffered by the once-enslaved Argonians.\nServing as an integral, perhaps even critical, part of the alliance, the Dark Elves of Morrowind are aloof, proud, and profoundly strange. They work hard to conceal their disdain for their \"inferior\" allies, but the current crisis requires the strong arms of Nords and wily resourcefulness of Argonians to keep rival alliances at bay. Wizardly craft and a deep well of experience serve the Dark Elves well, providing the Pact with the vital ability to react and adapt \u2014 something neither the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; nor the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; can claim to do as well. The Pact fields superior warriors and sorcerers. And they possess an asset that no other race can match: &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;three living gods&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 abide among them.\nThe Nords of Eastern Skyrim are fearless and aggressive, industrious and enterprising. They excel at war and prosper in trade, and they are without equal as explorers and trailblazers. Strong, stubborn, and hardy, they customarily solve problems through combat. Nords cheerfully rush into battle with a ferocity that frightens and appalls their enemies. They accept and even revel in their role as shock troops for the Ebonheart Pact. Nords are direct, not subtle: they champion simple solutions in the meetings of the Great Moot, though they are often outvoted by shrewd Argonians and sagacious Dark Elves. On the field of battle, however, they have no equals. Pact generals tend to be Nords, as are most of the soldiers in the field. The Nords don't mind. This means they also get first choice of the spoils of war.\nBy their decisive intervention against the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, the Argonians of Black Marsh won their freedom from Dark Elf enslavement, and the lessons they learned have made them a valuable member of the Pact. Reserved and alien, their expressionless faces and flat intonations make it difficult for other races to interpret their true motives. Nevertheless, the Argonians possess a cool intelligence. Slow to trust and hard to know, their natural agility makes them as comfortable employing magic as they are using stealth and steel. Years of defending their borders have made them experts in waging war against stronger, more traditionally organized armies. Equally at home on land or in water, they serve as scouts and skirmishers among the Pact forces. Other aspects of Argonian culture are nearly incomprehensible to outsiders, including their social hierarchy and collective decision making. Their representatives present strange proposals without explanation, but their allies have learned that there\u2019s always a reason for everything they do.\nToday, the young &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; serves as the acting &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of the Moot, but not all in the alliance support him. As the members of the Pact struggle to maintain and solidify their alliance, they must also deal with internal threats to each of their nations. Unsolved, these threats could destroy them before they ever face the Dominion or Covenant in open battle."}

All know the emperor to be a good and holy man, for he may often be seen in the Temple of the One, making his devotions to the Nine Divines and the Communion of Saints.\nAnd where does he live? In the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;, in the center of the Imperial City, in the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; which was built many ages ago by the godless, &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-loving &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. How fine it is that the stones raised high by this ancient evil empire are now reconsecrated as a monument to Imperial justice and piety.\nPeople who visit the Imperial Palace like to walk among the graves of saints and counts, &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s and emperors, and gaze with wonder upon White Gold Tower, which can be seen from any place within the City.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council%20Chambers\"&gt;Elder Council Chamber&lt;/a&gt; here cannot be entered, and though you may marvel at their curious ancient armors, you will soon want be away from the rude and discourteous &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;Imperial Guards&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Imperial City is divided into ten districts. At the center is the Imperial Palace. The other districts are grouped around the Palace. To the northwest is Elven Gardens, a pleasant residential district.\nContinuing widdershins, the &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive residential area, lies to the west. To the southwest is the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;, and beyond it, outside the walls, the filthy and bad-smelling &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Waterfront District&lt;/a&gt;. To the southeast lies the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;, and beyond that, outside the walls, the infamous &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. To the east is the notorious Arena District. And last, to the northeast of the Palace lies the Market District, where anything may be bought, and beyond the Market District, outside the city walls, the Imperial Prison.\nI live in the Temple District of the Imperial City, and it is a very pretty place. You are welcome to visit me, my husband, and daughter when you come to worship at the Temple of the One. This district is very pretty, and only pleasant and well-bred persons live here, though, as in all parts of the city, &lt;a href=\"Beggars%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;beggars&lt;/a&gt; are a constant problem.\nIn this beautiful garden you will find the famous Statues of the Nine Divines. In the center you will find the statue of Lord Talos, Emperor Tiber Septim. But is it right, that Talos should have this place of honor rather than Akatosh, king of gods? It is the scheming pride of the Elder Council, who sought favor with the sons of Talos, that is responsible for this shameful error.\nYou will find crowds of people waiting outside the doors of the Office of Imperial Commerce to make their complaints about being cheated by some merchant. It is a very dirty place. Piles of crates lie around in untidy heaps, unwholesome toadstools and &lt;a href=\"Fungi%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; grow in clumps, and the cobbles are slimy and encrusted with filth. If you may send your servant rather than visit yourself, it would be far better.\nThis place is unspeakably dirty and unkempt, no better than a slum. You will never find the students or wizards outside in the air, for they are squatting in their dark dungeons poring over profane texts and making crabbed scribbles on scrolls.\nWithin the Arch-Mage's Tower is hidden the Imperial &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt;, which the mages use to study the sky. Such fools! Why do they not look on the glory of Creation itself, and give praise to the Nine as they ought, rather than squat and peer at such a ridiculous and expensive machine?\nThe Mages are said to have &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Archives\"&gt;a great library of precious books&lt;/a&gt;, but they jealously hoard them for themselves. This is no loss for the righteous, for these books are surely full of wicked nonsense.\nThis is a terrible place. It is not uncommon to stumble over the bodies of women and children who have been murdered here. There are no more wicked and godless men in Tamriel than merchants and sailors, and they gather here to plot and cheat citizens of their hard-earned gold. Gambling and slaving and &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt;-sucking and even more depraved activities take place in warehouses and ships here. And where are the City Watch? Nowhere to be seen.\nThe prisons are very cruel and horrible, damp and dirty, with chains and pincers and manacles and instruments of torture on every hand. But did I find any prisoners in these cells? No! For the Watch is so lazy and careless that the cells are all empty!\nThere are guards everywhere in the Imperial City. They travel in groups, for even they are afraid of the cruel bandits and thieves that lurk everywhere in the City. I do not know why they do not throw the impertinent beggars into prison. Criminals are so bold as to introduce themselves to you on the street. One outlaw was so brazen as to boast that he had stolen his weapons and armor from the Imperial Prison. How careless and idle these Watchmen must be to allow this! They know no shame, for the wicked officers of the Watch are corrupt, and accept gold from the hands of the very people they are supposed to place behind bars.\nI will not tell you about this place, for you have no need to visit it. Only idle or foolish persons come here to throw their money away on games of chance, or to spill their own blood when they would better devote themselves to exterminating the armies of robbers and beggars that swarm in the streets.\nMay the Nine bless you and keep you!"}

The Agent is therefore tasked with defending the item between midnight and 3:00 am, a time thieves like to strike.\nThe Guild Guardian.\nThe Guildhall will remain open beyond its usual 23:00 closing time, and the Agent must be inside before midnight. Once inside, the Agent can loiter around, as their wait will be interrupted by the appearance of thieves, likely in two groups. The thieves themselves will respond to being hit, with the first thief stating:\nThe Agent must kill at least two of the thieves to complete the quest, although they will have to wait until the 03:00 deadline passes. After 3:00 the Agent may speak to the Guildmagister to complete the quest and receive their reward.\nA Temptation Too Far.\nIt is possible for the Agent to steal the item themselves, for it can be seen lying on the floor somewhere within the Guildhall. Picking up the item, and either leaving the Guildhall or keeping it in their inventory beyond the 3:00am deadline constitutes a theft, and will effectively fail the quest. Furthermore, the Guild will send a group of &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Enemy%29\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; to take the item from the player, who will shout when hit:\nAfter three days the Agent will be deemed to be the owner of the item, meaning they can use it as they please. However, they will have taken a severe penalty to their &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the Mages Guild.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random &lt;a href=\"gem%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt; from the Guildmagister for preventing the item from being stolen, alongside the boost to their &lt;a href=\"reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; within the Guild. The penalties for failing the quest are relatively high by comparison, but will also see gains among some anti-Mage Guild factions:\nFurthermore, taking the magical item, either intentionally or accidentally, will result in an additional penalty:"}

First of all, it is technically a subset of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, and on that basis alone it should be abhorred. (Except, as mentioned, for certain special cases, and then only under controlled conditions.) Second, it is a magical technology that practically invites abuse, especially when employed to trap the souls of sentient &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s. It is the sort of arcane practice that the public fears most, and is likely to result in local bans on the organized teaching of magic, and if that happens all our work in establishing the Guild will have been in vain.\nThe fact that soul trapping is now common knowledge among &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s magery, to the point where so-called \"Mystics\" sell soul gems of various sizes in every market and bazaar, is a problem that can be laid squarely at the feet of the iniquitous &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;. It is all part of his program to make necromancy seem commonplace and almost harmless. In some parts of Tamriel, notably &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the vile practice of necromancy has even become accepted as a valid, and legally tolerated, magical discipline. What our old mentor Iachesis would have to say about this pernicious development I hate to think.\nSo what are we to do about it? I have been giving the matter some hard thought, in between rooting out cells of the ever-burgeoning Worm Cult, and I think at this point the only way to gain control over soul-trapping is to co-opt the practice. Therefore I propose the Mages Guild codify and systematize the various soul-trapping magics into a common grimoire of a few reliable spells, and then teach our members that these, and only these, are the legal and authorized methods for trapping souls.\nFurthermore, I propose that for the purposes of soul trapping we categorize all souls into two classes: the legal, or \"White\" souls, those smaller essences that are captured from beasts and animals, and illegal, or \"Black\" souls, which are derived from sentient mortals. And we will teach only those spells that can capture White souls, forbidding our students to use the larger soul gems on sentients.\nIt will take several generations, and the suppression of the Worm Cult, for this dichotomy to become the pan-Tamrielic standard for soul trapping. But if the Mages Guild can't take the long view for the good of Tamriel, who can?"}

When a guild has at least 50 members, those members can list items in a guild store as well as buy items that have been listed from any &lt;a href=\"Banks%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that a portion of the profits made from all sales is deposited into the guild's &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Bank\"&gt;banked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, accessible by the guild's leader and other members with permission to make withdrawals. This system allows for secure trade between guild members and provides a consistent source of items and gold for active guilds.\nGuild traders.\nGuild traders are characters located throughout Tamriel who can be bid on by guilds to act as public salespersons for their Guild Store. This means the guild's store can be accessed by anyone, not just its members, allowing for wider commerce. Each week, guilds bid on these guild traders, and the highest bidder wins the right to that guild trader's services for the week. In addition to this, items can be traded with members of the same &lt;a href=\"alliance\"&gt;alliance&lt;/a&gt; who are in the same &lt;a href=\"fortification\"&gt;fortification&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster\"&gt;Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; if that particular alliance has captured it.\nPrices in guild stores and traders are set by the seller and can vary significantly based on supply, demand, and the individual guild's guidelines or strategies; therefore, savvy trading and a good understanding of the economy can help sellers maximize their profits and get the best deals.\nBidding.\nGuilds acquire a trader by making a blind bid on a specific trader against other bidders. Members with the appropriate permissions can go to any desired guild trader and place a bid with the 'Hire a Trader' dialogue option. Because the bidding is blind, it is impossible to know the offers other guilds have made. A guild can bid for up to 10 different traders but can only select one if multiple bids are successful. The gold used to place a bid must be available in the guild's bank and is paid immediately. If the bid is unsuccessful, the gold is refunded. Bidding for traders is available at all times, and the highest bid on Tuesday at 2:00 PM UTC every week retains the trader for the week. If two guild both make the same highest bid, the guild that made the bid first is awarded the trader.\nHiring a guild trader constitutes an investment. Although it may increase a guild's sales potential, the guild must ensure that the sales volume is sufficient to cover the bid's cost. This necessitates a calculated risk, with guilds needing to take into account their members' activity level, the quality and quantity of goods, and the trader's location prior to placing a bid."}

{"id": "225114", "revid": "5064773", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=225114", "title": "Guilds (Online)", "text": "Guilds are organizations of players working collectively in who usually have similar interests and goals.\u00a0When a guild takes control of a keep or one of its resources, the guild's store and bank are able to be used there via the keep's quartermaster. Only the store is available to the public, however.\nPlayers can join a maximum of 5 guilds per account. Guilds make an alliance between players. You have to be at least level 10 in experience to join and start one.\nIf an account makes a character from a different faction they can still chat in the guild and group up with players from the same faction as their character, but players will not receive the bonuses for any keeps or resources held if they are from a different faction than the guild's starting faction.\nGuild Stores.\nGuild Stores work in two distinct ways. First, it will allow players in the Guild to sell items to one another internally. Secondly, if the Guild has captured a Keep/Resource in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, there will be an opportunity to sell to guildmates in that keep without having to teleport out of Cyrodiil.\nIn Guild Stores, players can set their own prices and sell any item they want, provided it isn't bound to their character or an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Edition\"&gt;Imperial Edition&lt;/a&gt; item.\nSince there is no global auction house system in The Elder Scrolls Online, guilds can be created with massive amounts of players for the sole purpose of trading/buying/selling.\nGuild Tabards are able to be purchased from the Guild Store, regardless of whether or not the guild has more than 50 members, but they will only appear blank until a Guild Heraldry is created (Available to guilds with over 10 members)\nGuild Banks.\nGuild Banks are storage areas for the Guild's members, and are unlocked once a guild reaches 10 members. Players can deposit or withdraw items and &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; from this bank and the Guildmaster or an Officer is able to control what ranks are able to deposit and/or withdraw from the bank. Anything can be deposited in the guild bank, regardless if it is bound to your character or not and any item can be taken by any rank-appropriate player. Thus, it is not recommended to deposit your valuable items in the bank.\nGuild Banks have a storage capacity of 500 items. There is no limit on how much gold can be deposited.\nGuild Heraldry.\nGuild Heraldry is unlocked once a guild has reached 10 members, and allows a guild to distinguish itself from other guilds. Only the Guildmaster is able to create and modify the Guild's Heraldry.\nThe Guildmaster first must purchase a tabard from the Guild Store, which costs 2000 gold. Then in the new Heraldry tab in the Guild menu, the Guildmaster is able to create the guild's very own tabard. They can select from a very large array of over 250 colors, 63 background styles and 136 crests, as well as a variety of tabard shapes and borders.\nGuild Traders.\nGuild Traders, also known as Guild Kiosks, are essentially public Guild Stores. Once a Guild wins the bid on, or buys out, a guild trader, the Guild's Store is able to be used by the public through that specific trader for one week (or in the case of buyout, the remaining time left on the bidding cycle). Gold from sales is split between the selling player and the Guild bank. To use a Guild Trader, obviously, a Guild must have unlocked the Guild Store at 50 members.\nOnce the remaining time is up, the Guild loses the ability to sell through the Guild Trader and must bid on/buy it again.\nGuild Traders can be found in every town in every zone with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, where Guild Stores can be used by the public through a specific keep if it is controlled by a guild, which does not cost any gold, as well as wandering the road.\nRanks.\nGuilds start out with four ranks by default. A Guild can have up to 10 ranks which can be reordered, renamed and have their own logos. Any Guild can have any number of ranks regardless of member count.\nThere cannot be two Guildmasters, but a rank can be set so it has all permissions enabled (except for editing permissions, which is exclusive to the Guildmaster)."}

However, it can be surmised that the Guilds Act was the inspiration for the structuring of the modern day Thieves Guild, at least as it was during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Guilds Act became official legislation in &lt;a href=\"2E%20321\"&gt;2E 321&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that the Fighter's Guild was actually formed before then, as was the Mages Guild.\nThe Guilds Act had a partial effect in Skyrim,\u00a0unlike the rest of Empire-controlled areas. The Bards College was instituted in Solitude, however, a Fighters Guild and a Mages Guild was not put into place. This may have been because there was an already well-established group in place for both of these roles; &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, respectively."}

Gulan didn't trust Radhasa, so he warned Attrebus to be cautious. Attrebus convinced Gulan that Radhasa was harmless, but he was glad that Gulan trusted him enough to tell him his worries. Attrebus then revealed to Gulan his plans to intercide in &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;, but Gulan confessed that there were rumors in the court that the &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; wanted Attrebus to marry soon.\nAfter meeting the Emperor, Attrebus informed Gulan that he was going to disobey his father's orders and head down to stop &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;.

Gulan and him got out of the city from the sewers.\nAttrebus, Gulan and Radhasa arrived at Ione together. After a motivational speech, all his men shouted, but Attrebus noticed they were not as exited as other times. During their journey,\nthey were ambushed and all of Attrebus' guards died except for Radhasa, who turned out to be a traitor.

After following Gulum-Ei deep into the warehouse, the Dragonborn confronts him, and Gulum-Ei confesses the woman's name: &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt;, the previous guildmaster's murderer and the person after Mercer. Alternatively, he can be killed before the confrontation, resulting in the Dragonborn getting the information necessary in a nearby chest that has &lt;a href=\"Gulum-Ei%27s%20Confession\"&gt;Gulum-Ei's Confession&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Goldenglow%20Bill%20of%20Sale\"&gt;Goldenglow Bill of Sale&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n\"So, what do we have here?

According to legends, the mask could transform an Orc's visage into something more appealing to an observer. But sometimes even greater powers were attributed to the mask. Ambassadors and spies used Guthrag's Mask over the centuries to promote Orsimer cause in foreign lands.\nThe last recorded owner of the mask was the mysterious Chief's Eye of &lt;a href=\"Fharun%20Stronghold\"&gt;Fharun Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. The power of the mask was broken when an arrow pierced the mask and plunged into the master's spy forehead. Even bereft of power, the mask remains an item of historical significance."}

Warriors of merit, yes, but few in number. Our power was limited, our scope miniscule; forced to crawl along the shadows like insects. We had degraded to become nothing more than bandits. A hindrance, nothing more.\nIt was I that saw the wisdom in change. To grow our numbers, to grow our influence, we needed allies. I allowed dryskins into our ranks, inviting them to add their strength to ours. And so the &lt;a href=\"Blackguards\"&gt;Blackguards&lt;/a&gt; grew, like a mighty storm, like a crashing wave.\nBut many clouded eyes looked out among our ranks. They questioned my leadership, blinded as they were by the old ways. They cried out in angry voices, rising louder and louder. I looked upon them calmly, for Sithis has taught me that change always leads to chaos, just as chaos leads to blood.\nAnd so my gauntlet was born. Any who questioned my decision would have their chance to test the combat prowess of our dryskin allies. And the very few who were able to succeed in such a challenge? They would face me. After all, it was my orders that they were questioning, my strength as a leader.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; before me, I became both destroyer and creator, slaughtering those who questioned and strengthening all who followed. And thus was the rebirth of the Blackguards."}

But when my scouts told me that his companion was seen lurking about my fortress, I knew what must be done.\nThough watching Pimaxi-Taeed die a slow, agonizing death would be satisfying, I feel that he and this Wood Elf must share a bond. So first, I will kill his heart. I will watch as the misery wells up within his eyes, knowing that he caused the death of one who obviously cares so deeply for him.\nDeath can come later.

He spoke a sharper tongue than I, but his heart was filled with the same venom. Taken from his home, the Imperials tried to bend him to their will. To break the unbreakable spirit of a Naga warrior.\nThey failed. Every insult hardened his resolve. Every lash of their whips sharpened his claws. Every chain they shackled upon him only added to his strength. He gathered his egg-siblings, and he sang a warrior's song into their hearts. Together, they took Blackrose Prison from the very Imperial scum who had wrapped them in chains.\nBut when the other tribes heard such a warrior song, they shrank back in fear. They looked upon the venom in my grand-sire's heart, and they thought him poisoned. They bid him to forget his anger, to forget the Imperial's transgressions. To dance once more beneath the leaves of the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, content to only gaze longingly at the horizon.\nMy grand-sire saw this for the foolishness it was. He had become raj-kaal, the war chief of a new tribe. He reclaimed the tools of those who oppressed them. Reclaimed the dryskins' prison to be his fortress, their weapons to be his strength, their armor to be his protection. And so the &lt;a href=\"Blackguards\"&gt;Blackguards&lt;/a&gt; were born, wielding the very chains that once confined them."}

How dare we stand by and allow the &lt;a href=\"Silken%20Ring\"&gt;Silken Ring&lt;/a&gt; to encroach on our territory. How dare we show weakness as they steal our contracts and kill our agents. My words stoke the fire as my knives provide the fuel and they are none the wiser. Indolent, arrogant, fools.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Velidreth\"&gt;Lady of Lace&lt;/a&gt; was pleased with my deception. The &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; is chasing shadows, while the real threat mounts far from their notice. For my efforts, I have been invited to join the Silken Ring. Through them I will no longer merely pay lip service to &lt;a href=\"Mephala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, but do her bidding by my own hands. How can the promise of gold compare to reaping the blessings of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;?\nThe Lady has asked one last thing of me before I may receive the blessings of the Spinner. An offering of devotion. A sacrifice befitting Mephala. Some other fool might be tempted to rush out and work their knife in her name. Not I. This requires care. My introduction must be perfect.\nI have never desired ties. Why chain my heart to the weapons my enemies would wield against me? There have been moments though, where I have been handed those shackles and invited to clasp the lock closed. Nyri, was one such temptation. Perhaps it is now my turn to offer the bonds.\nNyri was unprepared for my advances, for good reason. I'd made my intentions clear before. I did not give her time to question my change of heart, as hers still harbored affection for me. reason melted at my touch, and she has fallen into Mephala's web willingly.\nI have whispered lies into ear for many nights now. Seeded doubt in her mind about the Morag Tong. Convinced her that we should act without their sanction. I will lead her to the Silken Ring tonight. It will be perfect.\nThe look on Nyri's face as the dagger pierced her heart was exquisite. It was as if all the emotions she'd secreted away inside burst forth in one last agonizing torrent, before she died. The Lady of Lace was so moved by my sacrifice that I've caught her eye. As it should be.\nI go now, into the Cradle of Shadows, to taste Mephala's true power. The reward for my devotion will be sublime.\nThis was that right move. I'm more sure of it than ever. Any doubts I had disappeared when I met the Lady of Lace. The power she offers is more than anything the fools back in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; can imagine. One of many benefits gained from casting off the shackles of &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; whims to embrace a higher purpose. This is what the Morag Tong must have been before it became strangled by bureaucracy and beholden to &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;false gods&lt;/a&gt;."}

He will be surprised to see you, as he presumed you'd be killed. He will tell you that you're no longer useful, and because you know too much, you need to die. He will then proceed to attack you.

This feature is likely related to their relation to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; and its priests, to whom the Draugr act as immortal servants. The &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; seem to believe that the Draugr were cursed with undeath by the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt;, due to having feasted on their comrades after becoming trapped on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. Others believe that they were cursed to never die by the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, after Men betrayed them in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn her book, \"&lt;a href=\"Amongst%20the%20Draugr\"&gt;Amongst the Draugr&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Bernadette%20Bantien\"&gt;Bernadette Bantien&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; tells the story of her stay in a Dragon Priest's resting place. She says that, after about seven months within the location, the Draugr gradually ceased their attempts to eliminate her and returned to their daily routine, at which point she was able to make great progress in her research. As for the reasons for the behavior, she suggests that they might have simply decided that she posed no threat to them; or perhaps a communicated agreement, as she reports them uttering words in their \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;heathen tongue&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBehavior and origins.\nBantien mentions that, different from other creatures, in which hostility is easy to read, \"these most peculiar of the living dead\" were different, due to the large disparity in their gait and speed. She used their general movements towards her and the tone of voice used, as well as the glowing eyes of the Draugr, in order to better predict their intent. The eyes, she says, \"seem to be key to their intent.\" She describes the routine of the Draugr. Every day, a different set of them would awaken and make their way to their priest. Once at the sarcophagus, they would prostrate themselves before it for several hours, meticulously cleaning the area afterwards (which she associated to a continuous worship, even after hundreds or thousands of years). By setting scrying &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; around the tomb, Bantien was able to safely look deeper into this ritual. When a group of Draugr entered, she noticed a transferral of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al energies, which she describes as \"a distinct flow of life force between the adherents and the master.\"\nIt was then that she understood the Dragon Cult's notion of resurrection, in which eternal life was only promised to those who ascended to priesthood, and the lesser functionaries contributed their life force in order to sustaining them indefinitely. Bantien does not seem to know where such endless, rechargeable life force (which she refers to as an \"eternal wellspring\") comes from, but understands that each Draugr carried \"only the barest whisper of life in it,\" and speculates that they were in fact buried fully as men and women (as opposed to dead, although there are cases of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;reanimated&lt;/a&gt; Draugr). She completes the speculation by saying that, in that case, it was the thousands of years underground, performing the ritual, that gave the Draugr an undead appearance; and that if one were to visit a barrow directly after its construction, they might not have even known any of its inhabitants were dead.\nMythological connections.\nDraugr take their mythological inspiration and several traits from the , undead creatures from Norse mythology. It should be noted that one differentiates between sea-draugar and land-draugar (draugar being plural of draugr): while land-draugar were simply undead with numerous magical abilities, sea-draugar were fishermen who had drowned at sea, thus being denied the privilege of being buried. In Norse mythology Odin was the ruler of draugr and could raise them using a secret, magic song."}

Bernadette stated that she had \"...always wondered why the ancient priests of the dragon cult insisted that their followers be buried with them,\" until noticing everyday a different set of draugr would awaken and prostrate themselves before the priest's sarcophagus, after which they would meticulously clean the area. Their dedication after death also seemed to explain why they so ferociously defend their chambers.\nAfter further observation, she reports that when the group of draugr came to pay homage to their fallen leaders, a distinct flow of life-force could be noted between the priest and the followers. The second eternal life of the dragon cult was only promised to those who ascended to priesthood, while the lesser functionaries contributed their life force to sustaining them for eternity.\nDirectly quoting the book:\n\"I don't know what sort of eternal wellspring they draw from, but it's clear that the draugr carry only the barest whisper of life in them, and it rekindles nightly while resting in its niche. I now believe that the grotesque forms that we see in the barrow were, in fact, buried fully as men and women, and only over the thousands of years that have passed withered into the wretched things we know. If we had visited a barrow directly after its construction, we might not have even known any of its inhabitants were dead!\"\"\nVariants.\nDraugr come in a number of variants. The specific type that is encountered is typically level-dependent; however, lower-leveled draugr can still be encountered at higher levels. In addition to regular variants, there are also special types of draugr only encountered as boss enemies, such as overlords or scourge lords. Higher-level draugr may wield honed ancient nordic weapons, supple bows, or ebony weapons. Some draugr use &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron shields&lt;/a&gt; (Hulking draugr may use a &lt;a href=\"dented%20iron%20shield\"&gt;dented iron shield&lt;/a&gt;s). Archers use bows and one-handed weapons while warriors can use one-handed weapons and shields or two-handed weapons. Warlocks use one-handed weapons and frost magic. All boss draugr, as well as draugr scourges and greater, are capable of using at least &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;, and the highest level may be able to ragdoll opponents with this shout, as well as use &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt;.\nNiche Draugr.\nThere are three types of draugr lying or standing in burial niches. The first kind look like skeletons and never have loot, nor do they ever awaken. The second kind, which look fleshier than the first kind, but wear no armor, are loot containers, and cannot be moved or reanimated with raise dead spells. The third kind are sleeping Draugr who look like the second kind, but their body model includes armor and these will awaken and attack the Dragonborn if they sense their presence. If the Dragonborn is sufficiently stealthy, a way to distinguish between the second two types is to mouse over the draugr. If the search text comes up, they are loot containers and if not, they are currently susceptible to a sneak attack.\nCombat.\nIn battle, draugr lords as well as scourges make extensive use of the &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; shout. Typically this is not much of a threat as it does very little damage and at worst can throw off the Dragonborn's aim, however, the highest level draugr are capable of knocking those caught by the shout off of their feet with their shout, ragdolling them. They provide some early warning to this as when they are about to use the shout, they will tense up, stand up straight with their head reared back, then lean forward as they open their mouths to unleash the shout. They also use other shouts such as &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt;, but this can't ever ragdoll. The other shout draugr can use is &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt;, though they stop using it against the Dragonborn once they reach level 31 (though can still use it against other targets as long as they are below that level). These shouts can be countered by any &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt; spell, &lt;a href=\"Spellbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt; or absorbed using &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Absorption%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell absorption&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraugr can be detected by using the &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Dead\"&gt;Detect Dead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Whisper\"&gt;Aura Whisper&lt;/a&gt;. Most draugr are initially asleep, though some may already be awake, and they can be detected as well. Using a power attack on, or casting an area affect spell at a closed coffin containing a Draugr can cause it to emerge. If the Dragonborn is stealthy enough, it is possible to crouch walk towards a sleeping Draugr and successfully land a stealth attack (which can often kill them in one hit without giving them a chance to fight the Dragonborn), or simply sneak past them.\nWhile draugr appear humanoid and possess certain humanoid abilities, they are not treated as true humanoids by the game. They generally have a different moveset in combat to humans (including several taunting animations) and are not susceptible to certain effects, such as decapitation, that normally affect humanoids, and cannot be pickpocketed (note this is not simply due to draugr being undead as vampires are true humans and are also undead).\nAll draugr are immune to poison and bleeding damage, with the additional attribute of possessing 50% resistance to frost. However, the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Targe%20of%20the%20Blooded\"&gt;Targe of the Blooded&lt;/a&gt; can be used to poison them or cause bleeding damage, respectively. As they are undead, all draugr are weak to &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;silver weapons&lt;/a&gt;, susceptible to the effects of &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and anti-undead magic such as &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Necromage&lt;/a&gt; perk, and will be completely immune to all illusion spells until the &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20the%20Mind\"&gt;Master of the Mind&lt;/a&gt; perk is obtained. Contrary to popular belief, draugr possess no specific weakness to fire damage."}

A legendary hero named Narsis Dren agreed to help them, but he has yet to return from the ancient barrow.\"\nWalkthrough.\nNear the map marker for &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Barrow\"&gt;Exile's Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a woman named &lt;a href=\"Mazgroth\"&gt;Mazgroth&lt;/a&gt;.

Dren has not been heard from since, so Mazgroth will ask you to head into the barrow to look for him.\nHead south along the path to find the barrow. In the first room of the barrow, you will find a sarcophagus; open it to reveal Narsis Dren. speak with him and the braggart will tell you that the solution to the draugr problem is probably in the main burial chamber. Proceed south into the square chamber in the center of the barrow. Here, Dren will identify a switch, but it will not do anything when he presses it. Speak with him and he will tell you that the door here will lead to the tomb, but that three of the panels are broken and you will have to look around the dungeon for reliefs and pieces of the broken panels. \nYou will find two of the panels in the eastern part of the ruin. One will be in the little square room, the other will be in the hallway to its south. The one in the square room will depict people worshiping a dragon priest. The one in the hallway will depict the nords travelling to this land. You will find one of the missing panel pieces to the left of the relief. Additionally, in the hallway leading back to the first room, you can find \"&lt;a href=\"Narsis%20Dren%20and%20the%20Lost%20Notebook\"&gt;a journal&lt;/a&gt;\" indicating that Narsis Dren was responsible for awakening the Draugr here.\nFor the remaining two reliefs, head to the south of the dungeon. The one in the western room will depict the construction of this tomb; there will be a panel piece by the coffins in this room. Draugr will emerge from the coffins upon approaching them, so take care. Finally, head east for the last relief panel. Dren will have no idea what this one means. The final panel piece can be found in the hallway leading back to the antechamber. \nOnce you have all the pieces, head back to the antechamber and place them on the switches. Once you have done so, press the panels in the proper sequence to open the door. The correct order is Triumph-Exodus-Restoration-Ascension. Once the door is open, head through to the main burial chamber and talk to Narsis Dren there. He will tell you to head into the burial chambers first. In there, you will have to face several waves of draugr before you are tasked with defeating the dragon priest &lt;a href=\"Arthosiis\"&gt;Arthosiis&lt;/a&gt; himself. After you have disposed of the priest, Dren will find the keys to the treasure vaults to the north, and will rush in there. \nHead in after Dren. You will find the passageways here laden with fire traps; make sure to avoid those. Once you have reached the treasure vaults, speak with Dren. He will reveal that the entire purpose of this expedition was to get his hands on the dragon priest mask here. you can now tell him to tell the villagers about the real reason behind the Draugr reawakening, or you can trick him into thinking there is another dragon priest here. If you choose the latter, . If you choose the former, he will head back to the village to tell them all about his exploits. \nWhen you arrive back in town, you will find the braggart telling tales of his heroic deeds in the barrow. Speak with him; you can persuade him to tell the orcs the truth and compensate them for what happened. If you do not persuade him, . After this, speak with Mazgroth to finish the quest."}

He remained there for many years until the Indoril family began to lose its power and a war between the houses erupted. Not wanting any part of it and feeling that Tharn was no longer a threat, Drayven left his homeland behind and settled in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt; under the guise of a simple miner.\nLater life and death.\nDrayven, now at an advanced age, was later found by his daughter &lt;a href=\"Dralsi%20Indoril\"&gt;Dralsi Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, born out of Dravyen's seduction of Barenziah, in a small mining community called &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;. No longer the spry rogue that had seduced &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, he was still nevertheless Dralsi's father and he treated her as such. In the remaining years of Drayven's life, he imparted the ways of the Nightingale to Dralsi until he finally succumbed to his old age."}

He will ask you to go speak with &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ravenwatch%20Castle\"&gt;Ravenwatch Castle&lt;/a&gt; to see if he has discovered anything of note. \nHead to Ravenwatch Castle. You will walk in on Verandis and his retainer &lt;a href=\"Gwendis\"&gt;Gwendis&lt;/a&gt; feeding on one of the Count's retainers; these people are vampires. Speak with the count and he will confirm that they are indeed vampires, but that they are good vampires who only feed on willing subjects. When asked, he will tell you that there is more to Montclair than just the ambition to rule &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, and he will ask you to come with him. Follow him, and he will lead you to a potion that will allow you to see his memories; he thinks there might be a clue there as to Montclair's plans. You can speak with Verandis about the potion and its effects, but this will have no effect on further quest progression.\nDrink the potion. You will arrive at a scene where &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Leila%20Montclair\"&gt;Baroness Leila Montclair&lt;/a&gt;, Duke Montclair's wife, lies on her deathbed; her husband and daughter are begging her to accept Reezal-Jul's help, but she will not. Baron Montclair will call Verandis (you) aside to talk; speak with him and he will ask you to turn Leila into a vampire. You can either refuse the request or offer to ask Leila whether she wants this. If you refuse this, . If you accept, go talk to Leila. She will refuse the request, after which the real Count Verandis will tell you he has vague memories of talking to someone else, but he cannot remember who. Head out of the room and you will run into Reezal-Jul; talk to him and he will tell you about an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; artifact he can use to cure the baroness. Since the countess doesn't want his help, he will ask you to use the artifact to save her.\nAfter this, the scene changes to after Leila is cured. After some celebration, she will ask you to come talk to her in private. The real Verandis does not remember this conversation; speak with him and he will tell you to explore this moment and see what you can learn about Montclair's turn to evil. There are three people to talk to now; Baron Montclair will be at the table in front of you; he will tell you that he is grateful for the stone and its effects, but will mention that the Argonian never mentioned it to him. Down the stairs, you will find Reezal-Jul, who will tell you that he feels the relic calling out to him, and that he found it among &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;'s belongings. He thinks it is part of a greater whole, and is researching it in ancient texts. Three phrases stood out to him: \"Life, Death, Crag.\" Finally, there is Baroness Leila Montclair. She is sick again, and thinks she needs another helping of the stone. She thinks the stone is probably part of a larger whole, and that she will need the whole relic to be cured. \nOnce you have spoken with all three people, head for the study in the west of the ground floor. There, the Argonian has laid out &lt;a href=\"Translated%20Ayleid%20Texts\"&gt;Translated Ayleid Texts&lt;/a&gt;; these texts will mention something the Ayleids used to attain immortality, and that only a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; can contain its power. They set up camp somewhere in the mountains and hidden an important tome there. After reading this, speak with the real Verandis and he will tell you that the text is about &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomcrag\"&gt;The Doomcrag&lt;/a&gt;; you will then be taken to a memory there. \nHead straight ahead and you will find the people of &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;House Montclair&lt;/a&gt; discussing leaving their guards behind and continuing by themselves. Head with them into the Doomcrag and you will be set upon by a horde of skeletons. Defeat them, then head on. Once you reach the middle tier, speak with Baron Montclair. He will tell you that he will do anything to save his wife, and he will shame you for not turning her into a vampire. Head further up and you will be set upon by a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bone Colossus&lt;/a&gt;; kill it and head onward. At the peak, you will find the door to the relic chamber. Before you enter, you can talk to Baron Montclair and tell him that something does not feel right; the relic does not seem to be all that benign. He will ignore your comments though. Either way, head into the relic chamber and talk to the baron again there. You will once again warn him against using the artifact, but he will not listen. They will then start the ritual to heal Leila, but she will remark that something feels very wrong. Baron Montclair will ask you to touch the &lt;a href=\"Lightless%20Remnant\"&gt;relic&lt;/a&gt; to help them; do so, and you will see the ritual do something to the Count, his daughter and Reezal-Jul. Leila will be kept alive, but will be in incredible pain and will ask you to end her life. After you do so, Montclair will attack you, but Gwendis will appear just in time to save you. You will then wake up from the memory.\nAfter waking up, talk to Verandis and he will inform you that the ritual has made Baron Montclair and the others into vampires, imbued with the power of the relic. This will finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Blood-Splattered%20Shield\"&gt;The Blood-Splattered Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

I can almost feel them laughing at my back as we set out on the long journey to &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. I'll have to remember to tell Low-Neck to stop all transactions with those untrustworthy wizards.\nLast night the song was red. Browned and dried at the edges. Flaking off. They chased me through the halls, always gaining. Great heroes battled them and fell in pools of blood that rang out with sickly chords. Ever-Open Eye. The Terror of Kora-Dur. Son of the Fire Stone.

I'd almost turned from the path to Wrothgar and the only lead I have that might be able to stop them, so I suppose it's a blessing of a twisted sort.\nAll was green, the green of the wavering bands of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s night sky. Only there were no stars, there was no sky and no ground. A &lt;a href=\"star\"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; descended towards my head, a grain of sand in a gigantic hourglass. 12 stones ringed my body, floating and colliding with enemies that assaulted me from all sides, lunging from the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial\"&gt;Aetherial&lt;/a&gt; mist. The sound of cracking bones formed the rhythm, the hum of the star growing louder every second. What would happen if it reached my skull? I am relieved I never found out. One of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; traders in the caravan heard me sobbing and roused me.\n1st &lt;a href=\"Suns%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;\nI wonder how my former employer fares. I hope Low-Neck has kept up the deliveries. I've been too sick to travel, too weary. Last night's was worse than usual. I have to get back on the road.\nThe darkness was breathing. Hissing against sharpened teeth.\n8th Sun's Height\nPurple. An ocean of words telling unimaginable tortures. The innocent crying out for salvation in the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, the curses from &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; tongues lingering on their flesh, uncured. The heroes again, the last shred of their hope bleeding out as their leader fell. Machines rust beneath the ground\u2014even they cannot escape the decay. There is no protection, no beetle-shell to fend off the growing nothingness. The dead are four and four and four then three, students of the crawling weft and warp left to live. The void looms.\nSource.\nThis journal was written by the team of as part of the Loremaster's Archive."}

She will explain that she has been dreaming of a stranger finding the White Guar for some time now. Believing that the White Guar will help her tribe, she asks the Hero to find the guar.\nShe indicates to look for a forking trail, where \"the rocks grow from the earth like fingers on a hand.\" Following the main path that leads from the south of the camp. Going towards the south-west, soon, the Nerevarine finds a crossroad with five tall boulders, at midway between &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kushtashpi%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Kushtashpi&lt;/a&gt;.

The Dragonborn enters through a door, finding a washed out room with a shrine, mannequins and other furniture. When first arriving, jugs and plates are hovering and moving around.\nWalkthrough.\nNaara can be found in the middle of the room next to the table covered with red cloth. Her journal is next to her on the right, along with Naara's Pleas reading \"LET ME OUT\" indicating that Naara did not work the puzzles out in time. The first clue is found on the table with a map of Skyrim and flags in a circular shape. The clue indicates in what order the torches should be removed:\nPick up Staff of Worms on the floor near the coffins. As indicated by the item description, the staff can be used to animate the dead. This can be used on the adjacent mage skeleton that has a key to the safe with the next clue.\nThe second clue indicates that a Prince should be prayed to for the gems and the door. A way into the dream world is accessed by praying to the statue at the edge of the room, then using the bedroll to sleep. The Dragonborn will wake with sepia toned vision blurred at the edges. Gems inside the necromancer's coffers are called \"Dreamer's Greater Soul Gems\" and can be found at the following locations:\nOnce all three have been found, the Dragonborn immediately snaps out of the dream state.\nThe final instructions will instruct the Dragonborn to place the dreamer soul gems onto the altar. Once done, interacting with the altar will turn all the gems black and open the door. Inside is a room with the Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw and other items, downstairs is a bone forge which will allow the Dragonborn to create skeleton from items. A book explaining how to do so is nearby. There is also a spell tome on necromantic healing on the bookshelf."}

He will then ask you to deal with the portals that have been opening up in the area while he looks for Master Muzgu. \nThe portals can be dealt with by throwing scamp heads into them. There should be plenty scamps in the area; kill at least three and take their heads. Once you have the heads, head for the portals.

Beings that can, with a simple spell, step into the dreams of another. Your darkest desires, your most bizarre fantasies, your true self, all revealed to these Dreamwalkers like an open book. Your most prized memories ransacked and picked through like the leavings of last night's feast.\nThose who Dreamwalk are said to have sworn themselves to the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;. To have sold their souls for the ability to enter her plane, the &lt;a href=\"Dreamstride\"&gt;Dreamstride&lt;/a&gt;. The veracity of this claim, I cannot say, but the similarities between what Dreamwalkers do and what the Priests of Vaermina accomplish is quite uncanny.\nThe only difference I could ascertain was how each entered the dream state. Vaermina's priests require nothing more than the drop of an alchemical concoction, a draft prepared by the most brilliant alchemists. The Dreamwalkers, however, require no such potion. They conjure a magic that appears to be innate, not taught or passed down by some hereditary process. Were they blessed by the Daedric Prince? Did their parents perform some sacred ritual to acquire this power upon birth? None I have spoken to truly know. Or will say, one way or another.\nBut what of the Dreamwalkers themselves? What do they use this power to achieve? Think of the havoc one could cause by entering the dreams of another. That's a frightening thought, indeed.\nYet, the Dreamwalkers I met were kind and gentle. They use their powers to help others. They eliminate painful memories. Cure mental illnesses that not even the best healers can mend. They accomplish incredible things by simply touching a person's dreams. I know, for I saw a Dreamwalker in action.\nMy wife and children contracted the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. It was a terrible way to die, slow and painful. When they died, my reason to live died with them. But the Dreamwalker I met, he took pity on me. He gave me an opportunity to remember my family while forgetting the pain of losing them. To become numb to the loss and remember them as they were before the illness. To remember the happiness and the love.\nThe Dreamwalker entered my dreams. When I woke, a calmness had filled me. Everything was all right. I could go on with my life. I wanted to thank him, but he was gone. I never saw him again.\nWhoever the Dreamwalkers are, whatever master they ultimately serve, I will forever be in their debt. But this fact doesn't eliminate the fear that lingers at the back of my mind. Was it right to take away the pain? Aren't memories the thing that makes us unique? Have I become someone else because my memories have been changed? It seems I have replaced pain with fear, and I'm not sure which I prefer."}

They serve a range of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, most notably &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, although some are counted in the ranks of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;. they are noted to be one of the few forms of Daedra who prize honor. They have a very militaristic culture, with many ranks and subdivisions within the culture of each clan.\nPhysiology.\nDremora are humanoid beings of above average size, typically appearing as male with black-and-red faces, and sometimes small stubs of horns. Although, skin color and/or facial features are different depending of native plane of dremora due to the influence of &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Creatia\"&gt;Chaotic Creatia&lt;/a&gt;. They are fully sentient and most are powerful warriors or spellcasters. They are the most powerful and intelligent of the lesser Daedra, to the point of governing over other Daedra on behalf of their Lord. Higher-ranking Dremora are often larger in physique than a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; male. Dremora are always heavily armored and even the spellcaster's robes provide heavy armor protection.\nDremora are one of the rare species of Daedra which are not only sentient, but capable of human speech. Unlike other sentient species, such as &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt;, the Dremora primarily speak in their own language and use &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; only for taunting human opponents. Dremora always have demonic, distorted voices.\nLittle is known about the Dremora language, except for a few key terms. The Dremora word for \"people\" is Kyn, the name they use to refer to themselves (compare to mer and men.) An individual Dremora is called a kynaz, roughly one of the people. Their use of this term expresses their belief that all other daedric species are essentially beasts, or at best uncivilized. However, this term is essentially a \"nickname\" for the Dremora while dealing with mortals; they do not speak their actual name, so that it cannot be used against them.\nCulture.\nThough Dremora are mainly followers of Mehrunes Dagon, they also serve other princes, such as &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; and many others.\nDremora have developed a complex social structure, with each individual belonging to a particular caste. Individual Dremora are noted to be able to advance or fall in rank. Each Dremora is named to suit their purposes, although the true names of clans and individuals are not spoken, for fear they might be used against the Dremora. Their culture is almost exclusively devoted to combat, primarily in defense of Mehrunes Dagon's plane of Oblivion as well as troops for his offensive plans.\nDremora societies and formations exists within clan systems. Clans are found in service of daedric princes. While it is generally assumed that dremora serve Mehrunes Dagon (with name of the clan or clans currently unknown), Molag Bal has two entire clans of them at his disposal: &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Clan\"&gt;Deathbringer Clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Foolkillers%20Clan\"&gt;Foolkillers Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Boethiah also has a clan in service of them, known as &lt;a href=\"Bloodwraith\"&gt;Bloodwraith&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kyn castes are divided into three basic groups: soldiers, commanders, and nobility. In addition, there are a few specialized Dremora, which may be previously unknown subtypes, or may simply be specialized members of an existing subtype.\nRanks.\nSoldiers.\n The soldier subtypes are the rank and file of Mehrunes Dagon's army, and are fairly numerous on his plane of Oblivion. They are roughly Apprentice level in their chosen skill set, with conjurers being able to summon scamps.\nChurl.\nChurls are the lowest ranking foot soldiers among the Kyn. Higher ranking Dremora will often use the term \"churl\" when hurling insults at the player, clearly indicating their status within Kyn society. All Churl carry a Dremora Mace. Fighters and mages may have enchantments on their maces, while bowmen will have a light bow and field arrows.\nCaitiff.\nThe Caitiff are the irregulars of the Kyn army. In addition to their normal heavy armor, melee-type Caitiff will be carrying a Dremora Caitiff Shield. Like the Churl, these will be carrying a mace, though more likely to be enchanted, and the bowman will have a light bow and field arrows.\nThe Apprentice-level &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; spell \"Summon Dremora\" will summon a Caitiff armed with mace and shield. However the Caitiff frequently uses lightning attacks as well.\nKynval.\nVal is a Kyn word implying a type of leadership or nobility, making Kynval roughly equivalent to a knight. In addition to their normal armor, melee warriors may be wearing a helmet. Fighter and mage Kynval are equipped with a longsword, which may be enchanted, while bowmen are equipped with a mace, normal bow, and broad headed arrows.\nOfficers.\n There are four Dremora \"officer\" ranks, which act as both military commanders and members of what passes for regional government among the Kyn. At these ranks, Dremora begin to reach Journeyman level in their chosen skills, particularly &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells; conjurers may summon flame &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s in addition to scamps.\nKynreeve.\nA reeve is a term for a regional official roughly equivalent to a Colonel. Kynreeve are the police of the Kyn, as well as field commanders for lower-level Dremora. They begin appearing around level 14, typically replacing the Caitiff. Kynreeve melee units carry Dremora Kynreeve Shields, and possibly a Dremora Kynreeve Helmet. Bowman will carry a Dremora mace, normal bow, and broad headed arrows; fighters and mages will carry a Dremora longsword.\nKynmarcher.\nThe Kynmarcher is the ranking official in a typical outpost, tower, or local area. They are roughly equivalent to a minor lord, high ranking General or duke in Imperial nobility. These appear starting around level 17; apart from their tendency to conjure flame atronachs instead of scamps, they are fairly similar to Kynreeve. Fighters and mages are now carrying claymores, possibly with intermediate-level enchantments on them, though they are still Dremora weapons. Melee attackers also frequently wear a Dremora Kynmarcher Helmet. Bowmen will be carrying a heavy bow and barbed arrows.\nNobles.\nAt the top of the Dremora chain of command are two noble subtypes. These Dremora are a good deal stronger than the lower ranks, for several reasons. One major difference is that, unlike most other Dremora, these types level along with the player. They also have access to more powerful spells, including &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;reflection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Absorption%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell absorption&lt;/a&gt;. At the highest levels, the mages will begin summoning powerful Daedra, including &lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daedroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xivilai\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarkynaz.\nThe term markynaz translates approximately into dremora lord, and hold a position somewhat near a grand duke or count. They are members of the Markyn, the Council of Lords which presides over the Dremora society. Markynaz mages receive a &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; boost similar to the Mage &lt;a href=\"birthsign\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt;. Markynaz begin appearing around level 21.\nMarkynaz mages and fighters carry claymores, and the fighters will almost always be wearing a Dremora Kynmarcher Helmet (though a stronger version than that worn by a Kynmarcher). The bowman are still equipped with heavy bows and barbed arrows, but now carry longswords instead of maces. As an interesting side note, the only female Dremora in the game is a Dremora Markynaz bow woman.\nThe Master-level conjuration spell \"Summon Dremora Lord\" will summon a melee-type Markynaz.\nValkynaz.\nThe upper echelon of Mehrunes Dagon's Dremora army are the Valkynaz, or Dremora Princes. They are all members of the Valkyn, Mehrunes Dagon's personal \"royal guard.\" They are not frequently seen on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and prefer to stay inside the towers in the Deadlands of Oblivion.\nThese Dremora are much better equipped than their lower ranking cousins. Melee and magic attackers wield a Daedric War Hammer, and missile attackers carry a Daedric Bow (usually with 3\u201310 barbed arrows). The melee and missile attackers have also replaced their Dremora armor with the superior Daedric armor, but show no signs of wearing a Daedric helmet, ironic for the lower-ranking Markynaz, who do. In addition to their new appearance, they now have long hair, colored dark red."}

As such, they are frequently encountered during attempts to close &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt;, which lead to the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, Dagon's plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. They are formidable opponents; even the lowliest Dremora is able to proficiently engage their opponents with both weapon and spell.\nPhysiology.\nDremora are humanoid beings of above average size, typically appearing as male with sneering black-and-red faces, and sometimes small stubs of horns. They are fully sentient and most are powerful warriors or spellcasters. They are the most powerful and intelligent of the lesser daedra, to the point of governing over other daedra on behalf of their Lord.

Dremora always have robotic, distorted voices.\nLittle is known about the Dremora language, except for a few key terms. The Dremora word for \"people\" is Kyn, the name they use to refer to themselves (compare to &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;). An individual Dremora is called a kynaz, roughly one of the people. Their use of this term also encompasses their belief that all other daedric species are essentially beasts, or at best uncivilized.\nThe most complete source of information on Dremora comes from the reference tome, \"&lt;a href=\"Varieties%20of%20Daedra\"&gt;Varieties of Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\", which can be found in most bookstores and libraries across Cyrodiil. These beasts are followers mainly of Mehrunes Dagon.\nCulture.\nDremora have developed a complex social structure, with each individual belonging to a particular caste, or subtype. (These subtypes are actually ranks of an NPC-only Dremora faction.) The castes are assigned titles in the Dremora language; these are the names by which most people refer to an individual Dremora. Their culture is almost exclusively devoted to combat, primarily in defense of Mehrunes Dagon's plane of Oblivion as well as troops for his offensive plans.\nWithin Dremora culture, most members do not have a distinct identity. All members of a given caste are treated as essentially identical. Their choices of weapons, armor and skill specialties are common within the entire subtype. Only a few Dremora achieve a social status high enough to be granted a unique name. These Dremora are often the highest ranking generals on Dagon's army and are granted a great deal of independence. The highest-ranking Dremora are also more likely to engage in conversation with non-Dremora, although the tone is still one of extreme condescension.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; progresses in level, the types of Dremora encountered progresses up the chain of command. Most Dremora are of a fixed level, usually slightly lower than the level where the player first encounters them. However, a typical Dremora individual is roughly as strong as a human or elf two to four levels higher, so one-on-one the odds are fairly even. When faced with multiple Dremora, the Hero can quickly find themselves overwhelmed.\n\"Varieties of Daedra\" divides the Kyn castes into three basic groups: soldiers, commanders, and nobility. In addition, there are a few specialized Dremora, which may be previously unknown subtypes, or may simply be specialized members of an existing subtype.\nAll Dremora subtypes have certain characteristics in common. They are highly aggressive; and rogue, summoned Dremora will be attacked on sight by town guards. They are considered a race of humanoid NPCs, not a variety of creature. This means that spells which target creatures will not affect them, while spells which target humanoids will. In addition, even the weakest Dremora cannot be &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;soul trapped&lt;/a&gt; except by use of a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dremora at each rank can be further grouped by their primary attack type, into melee, ranged, and magical attackers. All Dremora have access to the full range of &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic, and have an innate magical resistance. Dremora mages can conjure other daedra for assistance, and can shield themselves from both physical and magical attacks. Melee or ranged attackers, in addition to the Destruction spells, can also &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dispel&lt;/a&gt; effects from themselves and the Hero.\nAny given Dremora corpse is likely to generate the following drops:\nIn addition, Dremora will have weapons and armor appropriate for their caste. With the exception of the Dremora Princes, or Valkynaz, all Dremora carry at least one &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20weapon\"&gt;Dremora weapon&lt;/a&gt;, and wear some form of &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20armor\"&gt;Dremora armor&lt;/a&gt;. Dremora mages will be wearing a Dremora robe, and with the exception of the lowest ranks, have about a 50% chance of carrying a staff.\nMelee and missile attackers wear a matching set of heavy cuirass/greaves/boots. Missile attackers will also be equipped with a bow and about a half-dozen arrows, while certain types of melee attackers will have additional equipment, as described below.\nRanks.\nSoldiers.\nThe soldier subtypes are the rank and file of Mehrunes Dagon's army, and are fairly numerous on his plane of Oblivion. They are roughly Apprentice level in their chosen skill set, with conjurers being able to summon scamps.\nChurl.\nChurls are the lowest ranking foot soldiers among the Kyn, appearing from the start of the game, and will level up along with the player. Higher ranking Dremora will often use the term \"churl\" when hurling insults at the player, clearly indicating their status within Kyn society.\nAll Churl carry a Dremora Mace. Fighters and mages may have enchantments on their maces, while bowmen will have a light bow and field arrows.\nCaitiff.\nThe Caitiff are the irregulars of the Kyn army, and begin appearing around level 6.\nIn addition to their normal heavy armor, melee-type Caitiff will be carrying a Dremora Caitiff Shield. Like the Churl, these will be carrying a mace, though more likely to be enchanted, and the bowman will have a light bow and field arrows.\nThe Journeyman-level &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; spell \"Summon Dremora\" will summon a Caitiff armed with mace and shield. However the Caitiff frequently uses lightning attacks as well.\nKynval.\nVal is a Kyn word implying a type of leadership or nobility, making Kynval roughly equivalent to a knight. These Dremora typically begin appearing around level 11, but can appear at levels as low as 9, although rare.\nIn addition to their normal armor, melee warriors may be wearing a helmet. Fighter and mage Kynval are equipped with a longsword, which may be enchanted, while bowmen are equipped with a mace, heavy/light bow, and broad headed arrows.\nOfficers.\nThere are two Dremora \"officer\" ranks, which act as both military commanders and members of what passes for regional government among the Kyn.

These appear starting around level 17; apart from their tendency to conjure flame atronachs instead of scamps, they are fairly similar to Kynreeve.\nFighters and mages are now carrying claymores, possibly with intermediate-level enchantments on them, though they are still Dremora weapons. Melee attackers also frequently wear a Dremora Kynmarcher Helmet. Bowmen will be carrying a heavy bow and barbed arrows.\nNobles.\nAt the top of the Dremora chain of command are two noble subtypes. These Dremora are a good deal stronger than the lower ranks, for several reasons. One major difference is that, unlike most other Dremora, these types level along with the player. They also have access to more powerful spells, including &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;reflection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Absorption%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell absorption&lt;/a&gt;. At the highest levels, the mages will begin summoning powerful daedra, including &lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daedroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarkynaz.\nThe term markynaz translates approximately into dremora lord, and hold a position somewhat near a grand duke or count. They are members of the Markyn, the Council of Lords which presides over the Dremora society. Markynaz mages receive a &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; boost similar to the Mage &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt;. Markynaz begin appearing around level 21.\nMarkynaz mages and fighters carry claymores, and the fighters will almost always be wearing a Dremora Kynmarcher Helmet (though a stronger version than that worn by a Kynmarcher). The bowmen are still equipped with heavy bows and barbed arrows, but now carry longswords instead of maces. As an interesting side note, the only female Dremora in the game is a Dremora Markynaz bow woman.\nThe Master-level conjuration spell \"Summon Dremora Lord\" will summon a melee-type Markynaz.\nValkynaz.\nThe upper echelon of Mehrunes Dagon's Dremora army are the Valkynaz, or Dremora Princes. They are all members of the Valkyn, Mehrunes Dagon's personal \"royal guard.\" They begin appearing around level 19, and will eventually make up the majority of the Dremora encountered in Oblivion. They are not frequently seen on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and prefer to stay inside the towers in the Deadlands of Oblivion.\nThese Dremora are much better equipped than their lower ranking cousins. Melee and magic attackers wield a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Warhammer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric Warhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and missile attackers carry a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Bow%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric Bow&lt;/a&gt; (usually with 3\u201310 barbed arrows). The melee and missile attackers have also replaced their Dremora armor with the superior Daedric armor, but show no signs of wearing a Daedric helmet, ironic for the lower-ranking Markynaz, who do. In addition to their new appearance, they now have long hair, colored dark red.\nUnique Dremora.\nA number of other, unique types of Dremora are encountered during the invasion from Oblivion. In general, these are specialized versions of one of seven Dremora ranks described above. Some of the more notable are included below:\nThe following Dremora have been assigned to aid &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; within his constructed &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;. These Dremora will actually converse with others (but clearly don't like doing so):"}
