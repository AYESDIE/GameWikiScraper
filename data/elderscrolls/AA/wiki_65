We know you've been anxiously waiting to join this iconic guild, and have some great content in store for you.\nThieves Guild, similar to our previous updates, will come in two parts\u2014the DLC game pack, and the base game patch.

Abah's Landing, the opulent jewel of Hew's Bane, is not only one of the most elaborate cities in ESO, it's also home to the Thieves Guild. Be ever aware of your surroundings while in Abah's Landing\u2014the network of back alleys, narrow catwalks, and secluded alcoves hide more than a few secrets.\nLarceny System\nThe new Larceny System introduces a number of repeatable activities for those sneaky enough to complete the missions. These quests are acquired by visiting three mission boards found in or around the Thieves Den.\nLarceny Quests: Kari, a precise Nord woman who keeps accounts of the guild's finances, as well as accounts of information and rumors runs the Tip Board.\nTravel all around Tamriel doing larceny quests for the Thieves Guild. These include pickpocketing, unlocking safeboxes, gathering specific categories of items for consignment requests, and more.\nHeist Quests: Find Fa'ren-dar, a tough male Khajiit who works on the far side of the Den, near the sewer drain exit. He runs the Heist Board.\nThieves Guild heists require sneaking, avoiding traps, and getting in and out of special instanced heist areas with your prize\u2014earn special bonuses for completing the heists undetected and within the time limit!\nReacquisitions Quests: Seek out Spencer Rye, a fancy Breton man who runs the Reacquisitions Board, which is set up just outside the Thieves Den.\nKill group bosses and complete delves in Hew's Bane.\nNew Criminal Activities\nWe're expanding on the existing Justice System, and adding a number of exciting, new activities to scratch your thieving itch:\nTrespassing\nCertain locations in Abah's Landing are off-limits to adventurers where just being seen is considered a criminal act. These locations are accessible via clearly-labeled entrances that make it clear you will be trespassing. While doing so, the on-screen justice indicator will notify you of your illicit status.\nGuild Jobs\nThe Thieves Guild may request certain types of items to be retrieved from their current owners. Stolen goods now indicate what categories they belong to, to help make sure you pilfer the desired valuables.\nBounty Edicts\nGiven the Thieves Guild has certain \u201cconnections,\" they may at times reward their members with documentation which conveniently erases past misdeeds (to a point).\nHidden Panels\nThe criminal element of Abah's Landing has a tendency to hide their possessions in plain sight. Sharp-eyed adventurers may discover secret stashes that blend in with their surroundings.\nNew Passive Skill Line: Thieves Guild\nAccess to the Thieves Guild DLC game pack will allow you to pursue a new associated skill line which includes six new passive abilities. These non-combat passive abilities will assist you in your criminal endeavors, and are unlocked as you gains ranks in the Thieves Guild.\nFinders Keepers: Access new troves of stolen goods throughout Tamriel\nClemency: Talk your way out of trouble\nVeil of Shadows: Reduce the range of your criminal acts being witnessed\nTimely Escape: Make a dramatic escape from the guards\nSwiftly Forgotten: You just have one of those faces that the guards tend to forget about faster than others\nHaggling: Get every coin you deserve for those stolen goods\nMaw of Lorkhaj\nAn ancient Khajiiti shrine known as the Temple of Seven Riddles has been claimed by the dro-m'Athra\u2014ancient, moon-hating spirits from the heart of the Great Darkness. The monks residing within the temple, led by Moon Bishop Kulan-dro, have all been corrupted and possessed. Now they lurk within the shadows of the Temple, preparing to spread their dark influence to the Khajiit of Elsweyr and beyond. Fearing the worst, the Moon Bishops have dispatched a group of Twilight Cantors to the scene. But even these powerful monks are no match for the evil within the temple. The order's leader, Chief Crier &lt;a href=\"Adara%27hai\"&gt;Adara'hai&lt;/a&gt;, asks for the player's help in banishing the &lt;a href=\"dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt; and resealing the boundary between Mundus and the dark realm of Namiira.\n&lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Maw of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; is a 12-player Trial located in the southwest section of Reaper's March.\nMaw of Lorkhaj features a Normal version in addition to a challenging Veteran version!\nTo enter Maw of Lorkhaj, you have two options:\nTravel to Reaper's March and navigate toward the POI, south of Do'Krin Monastery.\nSpeak to &lt;a href=\"Bakhum\"&gt;Bakhum&lt;/a&gt;, a Khajiit on the docks in Abah's Landing, to receive the quest The Dark Moon's Jaws. This will take you directly to Maw of Lorkhaj.\nThere are unique sets available only within Maw of Lorkhaj which grant unique, group based, PvE bonuses.\nThese are available in both Normal and Veteran versions.\nMaw of Lorkhaj will scale to the level of the Trial Leader, much like Dungeons do currently.\nWhen you start the Veteran version of the Trial at Veteran Rank 16, you will qualify for the Leaderboards.\nPoints for Leaderboards are awarded in the same way as other trials (monster kills, vitality bonus and time).\nYou can still run the Normal version of the Trial at Veteran Rank 16, but this will not qualify you for the Leaderboards.\nNew Collection Category: Assistants\nAssistants are non-combat followers that you can summon via the Collection system, similar to pets, which provide various services. These benefits include (but are not limited to) selling and fencing items, as well as accessing the bank.\nYou may have an assistant or a pet summoned at any given time, but not both simultaneously.\nRumor has it that adventurers may gain an assistant from supporting the Thieves Guild in its endeavors in Abah's Landing.\nNew and Updated Item Sets\nWe're introducing new item sets which will be available from a variety of sources:\n3 new crafted item sets, available exclusively at the crafting stations in Abah's Landing.\n2 new non-crafted item sets, available from Thieves Guild daily quests, the Grouping Tool reward boxes, or rarely from Thieves Guild world bosses.\n3 older non-crafted sets, revamped and available from the new Treasure Troves.\n4 new non-crafted sets, available from Maw of Lorkhaj as a drop, or from the weekly Trial leaderboards.\n3 older non-crafted sets, revamped and available from Maw of Lorkhaj as a drop.\n6 new Alliance War item sets, available from Rewards of the Worthy mails and Alliance War leaderboards, as well as the new Alliance War vendor.\nSaving Progress in Veteran Maelstrom Arena\nYour progress will now be saved between Veteran Maelstrom Arena sessions!\nThere is a new quest in Veteran Maelstrom Arena cleverly titled \u201cVeteran Maelstrom Arena.\"\nThis quest functions much the same way as the old quest, except both quests are now mutually exclusive. You earn progress toward the \u201cVeteran Maelstrom Arena\" quest in Veteran Maelstrom Arena, and progress toward \u201cMaelstrom Arena\" quest in normal Maelstrom Arena.\nYou can have both quests at the same time, and be on different stages of progress in each one.\nIf you progress to the Vault of Umbrage in Veteran Maelstrom Arena and log out, you will be placed in the Vault of Umbrage at the beginning of that Arena when you use the portal upon your return as long as you are still on that stage of the quest.\nIf you want to start over from the beginning, simply abandon the quest and pick it up again.\nIf you opt to continue your progress in Veteran Maelstrom Arena via the quest, you will no longer have a Leaderboard time when the Arena completes.\nWe designed the Leaderboards to gauge and measure player characters that wish to do the most difficult content in the game, and time is a major factor in that measurement. As such, if you want to be on the Leaderboard, you need to complete the Arena all in one go.\nDLC Quests from Collectibles\nYou will now be able to access an introductory quest for each DLC game pack via the Collection system! A new tab has been added to the Collection system for all DLC entries.\nLoyalty Rewards\nAnyone who owns the Orsinium or Thieves Guild DLC game packs, or is an ESO Plus member, will be granted a vanity pet as a loyalty reward!\nThe Orsinium reward is an Echalette vanity pet, and the Thieves Guild reward is a Jackal vanity pet.\nYou'll need to complete a new achievement to receive your pet by simply walking into the main city for each DLC.\nOrsinium loyalty reward achievement: \u201cA Gift from Orsinium\"\nThieves Guild loyalty reward achievement: \u201cSpoils of Abah's Landing\"\nThe pet will be added to your Collections UI, and will be usable account-wide.\nGoing forward, each DLC game pack will include some sort of reward for those that purchase or have access to it.\nBase Game Patch\nGrouping Tool Improvements\nThe Grouping Tool has undergone additional improvements for this update:\nWe completely updated and restructured the UI.\nYou'll find that this tool has been broken up into three sections: Regular grouping, the Dungeon Finder, and the Alliance War.\nYou can now form cross-alliance parties to complete dungeons or Trials by simply inviting your friends to your group without using the Grouping Tool first.\nNote: You won't be able to do this while in Cyrodiil or Imperial City, and won't see your cross-alliance group members outside of 4-player dungeons or Trials.\nYou can now queue for more than one individual dungeon at a time.\nQueuing and completing a random dungeon now awards bonus experience and items.\nYour first completion of the day will grant a fairly sizeable chunk of experience. You also receive a blue item from the two new sets mentioned in the item set section above.\nSubsequent runs give slightly less experience, and a green item from the same sets as previously.\nYou also have a chance to get a style item (or style item fragment) from one of the rare styles.\nThis is part of an ongoing process to continue improving the Grouping Tool \u2013 look for additional improvements in future updates!\nScrolling Combat Text (SCT)\nOptions for displaying combat text have been added to the Interface section of the Settings menu.\nThis will display damage values, healing values, and crowd control effects on your targets.\nThis option is turned off by default.\nSoul Reservoir and Vitality Bonus\nWe have removed the old Soul Reservoir system, and replaced with the Vitality Bonus.\nVitality Bonus is a new feature added to Trials (Hel Ra Citadel, Aetherian Archive, Sanctum Ophidia and the new Maw of Lorkhaj) which tracks player character deaths, and awards points based on remaining lives.\nEach Trial will have a maximum number of lives specific to the Trial, and each life will be worth 1,000 points.\nAt the end of the Trial, the remaining lives are multiplied by those points and then added to the score. The score is then multiplied by the Time Modifier, and your final score will be displayed with some additional supporting information.\nWhat this means is that once again, deaths within the Trial matter more than just time. Each life lost will diminish your final score.\nYou will be able to view your score and remaining lives towards the Vitality Bonus on the HUD while in a Trial or Arena.\nCyrodiil Updates\nWe have a number of exciting additions and changes in Cyrodiil!\nAzura's Star and all non-Veteran campaigns will now limit the Champion System.\nWhile in these campaigns, you will not be able to spend Champion Points when they are earned until you leave Cyrodiil, and all Champion abilities will be inactive.\nNote that Champion Experience can still earned while in these campaigns.\nThe Thornblade campaign will be closing on the Xbox One European megaserver.\nIf this is your currently-assigned campaign, you will receive a free campaign reassignment, and will also receive rewards based on the state of the campaign score and leaderboards at the time of shutdown.\nA new rare items merchant, Adhazabi Aba-daro the Golden, is now available!\nAdhazabi will now only appear on the weekends. She will arrive at 00:00 UTC/GMT on Friday nights, and will pack up shop at 12:00 UTC/GMT on Mondays.\nThis vendor will sell powerful item sets not normally obtainable in Cyrodiil for a high amount of AP or gold.\nYou'll be able to find Adhazabi in the following locations:\nWestern Elsweyr Gate\nNorthern Highrock Gate\nSouthern Morrowind Gate\nForward Camps, an item that allows you to respawn anywhere without relying on Keep ownership or respawning at your home base, are now available to use:\nYou may only respawn within a Forward Camp radius if you die within it.\nThere is a global respawn time of 2 minutes when you respawn at a Forward Camp, which will limit you from respawning at another Forward Camp while within the cooldown period.\nForward Camps are purchasable from Siege merchants for 20,000 AP.\nYou must be Alliance Rank 6 or higher to purchase or deploy a Forward Camp.\nAny ally from your alliance will be able to use a Forward Camp once deployed.\nWe've made some updates to the items you receive from the Rewards of the Worthy. Below are the only sets that will be available from Rewards for the Worthy:\nVicious Death\nTransmutation\nMarksman's Crest\nLeki's Focus\nFasalla's Guile\nWarrior's Fury\nWe have increased the drop rate so you are guaranteed to receive a piece from one of these item sets each time, rather than only having a small chance to receive a piece from a large pool of possibilities.\nYou will still be able to obtain the previously-available item sets from the Alliance vendors, and we are currently evaluating plans to alter their wares in the future (both to change the exact sets they offer, and to bring their wares up to VR16).\nMoving forward, we will regularly cycle out older item sets from Rewards of the Worthy so you are given a greater opportunity to acquire the newest item sets, and older item sets will be purchasable from the Alliance vendors.\nChampion System Improvements\nThe Champion System abilities have undergone significant revision to improve the viability and balance of each star, which you can read about in more detail under the Fixes &amp; Improvements section.\nThe Warrior (red) and The Mage (blue) tree abilities are now closely matched to counterbalance the defensive and offensive bonuses.\nInfrequently selected abilities have been improved and consolidated for better Champion System build diversity.\nMany abilities have had their tooltips and effects clearly outlined so that bonuses are easier to understand.\nCadwell's Silver and Gold Updates\nSilver and Gold alliances are no longer restricted by accepting and completing Cadwell's quests, and will instead immediately unlock when you reach Veteran Rank 1.\nUpon the initial unlock, the first zone's wayshrines will be displayed on the map for you to fast travel to. You can also jump directly to other player characters in those alliances.\nSilver and Gold content is also immediately unlocked for anyone who accepts Cadwell's quest before reaching VR1.\nWhen accepting Cadwell's Silver and Gold, your quest progress will be immediately updated for anyone who has already completed some or all of the objectives required for those quests (i.e. if you complete content in the Silver and Gold zones before taking Cadwell's quests, you don't have to play that content again).\nCompleting Cadwell's Silver will grant you the Soul-Shriven Style Motif book; completing Cadwell's Gold will grant you a unique Collectible from Sir Cadwell himself.\nFor those who've already completed these quests, you will automatically receive the rewards.\nEvery player character who has completed Cadwell's Silver will receive a Soul-Shriven Motif in the mail, and anyone who has completed Cadwell's Gold will receive the Collectible directly to their Collections UI.\nNew Crafting Motifs\nThis update introduces a host of new crafting motifs to learn:\nOutlaw: Found in the delves and world bosses of Hew's Bane from the Thieves Guild DLC game pack\nTrinimac: Received from Orsinium Daily Delve quests\nMalacath: Received from Orsinium Daily World Boss quests\nAlliance Motifs: Found in chests within Cyrodiil and Imperial City\nSoul-Shriven: Received from completing the Cadwell's Silver quest (anyone who has already completed this quest will receive this style)\nThose who complete Cadwell's Gold will receive a special item that you can perhaps wear on your head\u2026\nCrown Mimic Stone\nThe Crown store now offers a new type of style item that can be used to make equipment in any crafting motif the crafter has learned.\nTo utilize these magical items after purchase, simply set the interface to use the Crown Mimic Stone at any clothier, blacksmith or woodworking station and create a piece of equipment.\nThe Crown Mimic Stone permanently transmutes itself upon being integrated into an item, which means deconstruction can yield the specific style item associated with the equipment but will never return the Crown Mimic Stone itself.\nThe introduction of this item allows us to update the Malachite, Laurel and Goldscale style items to be fully tradeable, akin to all other style items.\nThe Crown Store will offer Crown Mimic Stones in various quantities, and the purchase of any high-end motif will include complementary Crown Mimic Stones as well.\nNew Collection Category: &lt;a href=\"Mementos%20%28Collection%29\"&gt;Mementos&lt;/a&gt;\nAll activated public dungeon reward items which previously took up inventory space are being relocated into the Collections System!\nIf you've deleted any of these items to make room, they will automatically be unlocked in your Collections UI based on your completion of the associated quests.\nYou will need to log in on at least one character that has completed the associated quest in order to have the associated memento unlocked in the Collection System.\nThe affected items include the following:\nProvisioning Update\nVendors now sell recipes used in Provisioning Writs, which will ensure provisioners are able to reasonably complete any Provisioning Writ received.\nFood recipes will appear on Chefs, while drink recipes show up on Brewers.\nThe recipes offered are based on your current level of Recipe Improvement, though they also will offer recipes from the previous rank as well.\nProvisioning Writs will no longer reward these recipes.\nCompleting the certification quest for Provisioning will directly provide the recipes needed for the first tier of writs to ensure novice provisioners can immediately undertake the quests.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, IMPERIAL CITY DLC GAME PACK\nAudio\nGeneral\nImproved the audio performance in Imperial City so audio will use less CPU time.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nMonsters\nTaebod the Gatekeeper, located in the Imperial City Sewers, no longer has the ability to critical hit player characters.\nMonster Abilities\nFlesh Colossus\nAdjusted the timing for the Stumble Forward ability to make it more accurate.\nTaebod the Gatekeeper\nIt is no longer possible to interrupt the Summon Winged Twilight ability.\nXivkyn Elite\nWinter's Reach no longer displays an interrupt tutorial, as the attack cannot be interrupted.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nDungeons\nImperial City Prison\nIbomez the Flesh Sculptor\nBlight Bomb can now be dodged or reflected. Note that reflecting the projectile back to the boss will do reduced damage.\nThe initial damage from the impact of Blight Bomb can now be mitigated by blocking.\nInmates will now only appear when The Flesh Sculptor runs to the center and channels his summoning spell.\nThe Flesh Sculptor is now completely immune to damage while channeling the summon spell.\nRemoved the 45 second cooldown on The Flesh Sculptor's summoning spell.\nThe summoning spell is now performed exactly 3 times during the encounter, and is triggered by specific health values remaining on The Flesh Sculptor.\nThe total amount of inmates eager to be used in The Flesh Sculptor's stew has not changed, so expect to see a few more inmates being summoned when the time comes.\nWhite-Gold Tower\nYou can no longer remove Molag Kena's Shock Spear by using the Spear Shards Synergy near it.\nFixed a typo with the dialogue of Sister Arminus.\nOtho, Micella and Cordius no longer have the ability to critically hit player characters.\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nAchievements\nRelocated the Xivkyn Style Master achievement from the Crafting category to the Imperial City DLC category, to be consistent with the location of other achievements introduced in DLC content.\nItemization\nNon-VR16 player characters can no longer purchase items from the Greater Tel Var Lockbox vendor as they couldn't be opened until reaching VR16. You may still securely store your Tel Var stones in the bank, if you'd prefer to stockpile them for the day you reach Veteran Rank 16!\nClarified the tooltip for the Necrotic Hoarvor in the Collections menu, to point you to the correct section of the Achievements menu for the Achievement that grants it.\nQuests &amp; Zones\nGeneral\nEnemies that get knocked back through walls during the Central Sewer event will no longer break their portals if they were the last enemy of that wave.\nQuests\nWatch Your Step: The quest step to kill Legion Zero Soldiers will now properly advance when killing any Legion Zero soldier in Imperial City.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, ORSINIUM DLC GAME PACK\nArt &amp; Animation\nGeneral\nFixed an issue that was causing King Kurog's weapons to disappear in some instances.\nThe visual effects of Batasha's Brew will now only display when you first get it instead of every time you zone.\nTerrain\nDistant mountains will now have a more consistent appearance and not suddenly disappear as you approach them.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nGeneral\nYou can no longer target corpses throughout Wrothgar.\nFixed an issue that was preventing Durhaz from entering combat.\nMonsters\nPocket Mammoths no longer shake the ground when they die.

We have some great new content, features, and systems in store for you, and we're excited to hear what you think!\nDark Brotherhood, like our previous updates, will come in two parts\u2014the DLC game pack, and the base game patch. The base game patch will be available to everyone who owns The Elder Scrolls Online and the DLC game pack will automatically download with it, allowing you instant access to the new content when you purchase it, or activate an ESO Plus membership.\nAnyone who owns ESO and has an active ESO Plus membership will also automatically have access to the Dark Brotherhood DLC game pack. If your ESO Plus membership ends or lapses, you will no longer have access to the Dark Brotherhood DLC game pack content and areas, but you will still have any items you earned while you had access. You will also keep any acquired skills from the Dark Brotherhood skill line up to the rank that you earned while you were in the Guild, even if you respec. If you do not have an active ESO Plus membership you can purchase the DLC game pack for 2,000 crowns via the in-game Crown Store.\nJoin the Dark Brotherhood and become their newest assassin. Aside from hours of new story content, two new delves and group bosses, this update introduces a deadly new passive skill line exclusive to members of the Dark Brotherhood. We also have a number of new item sets available, plus a variety of repeatable content. In addition, we have some changes to previous DLC game packs including a District capture system for Imperial City and improvements to the Tel Var Stone merchant.\nThe base game patch also features an abundance of new features including Poison-Making as an extension of the Alchemy system, improvements to item set Traits, more enhancements to the Activity Finder, nameplates, item locking, an extended crafting inventory (Craft Bags) for ESO Plus members, and more. And, of course, the highly anticipated removal of Veteran Ranks. We have published a deep-dive of Veteran Rank removal on our website. Please read it for details.\nIn addition to all the new features and major updates, we have made many fixes and improvements to the overall combat and gameplay (including many stamina-related changes), content throughout the game, itemization, UI, and more.\nWe hope you enjoy our latest update!\nContent\nNEW FEATURES / UPDATES / BIG CHANGES\nDLC Game Packs\nBase Game Patch\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, IMPERIAL CITY DLC GAME PACK\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nQuests &amp; Zones\nUI\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, ORSINIUM DLC GAME PACK\nArt &amp; Animation\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nQuests &amp; Zones\nUI\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, THIEVES GUILD DLC GAME PACK\nArt &amp; Animation\nAudio\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nQuests &amp; Zones\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, BASE GAME PATCH\nAlliance War\nArt &amp; Animation\nAudio\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nCrown Store\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nJustice System\nMiscellaneous\nQuests &amp; Zones\nUI\nNEW FEATURES / UPDATES / BIG CHANGES\nDLC Game Packs\nDark Brotherhood\nFor the first time since The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, return to the Gold Coast of Cyrodiil in the Dark Brotherhood DLC game pack! Visit the cities of Anvil and Kvatch on the disenfranchised borders of Cyrodill and whet your appetite for slaughter as you join the deadly and mysterious Dark Brotherhood, Tamriel's premier guild of assassins. Blood will flow as you carve a gruesome path into the good graces of the Night Mother and remind all of Tamriel why they should always fear the shadows.\nThe Gold Coast is a new zone on the West Coast of Cyrodiil containing the iconic cities of Anvil and Kvatch, including the Kvatch Arena which you can read more about below.\nNote that this section of Cyrodiil is free from the war that current rages in the rest of the province; it is not a PvP area.\nThis update includes an all-new assassination-based storyline and quests centering on the Dark Brotherhood.\nMarked for Death\nAnyone in the know realizes that if they want someone put in the ground, they call upon the Dark Brotherhood. There are two types of repeatable quests that you can perform for the organization to increase your standing and acquire suitable rewards.\nContract Quests\n&lt;a href=\"Elam%20Drals\"&gt;Elam Drals&lt;/a&gt;, a dry-humored Dark Elf, oversees the Dark Brotherhood's contract killings for those who exchange simple gold for the promise of disposing of troublesome individuals throughout Tamriel. Visit locations throughout the world of Tamriel to execute individuals named in the contracts while avoiding guards and the accrual of bounty for your heinous murder.\nThese quests are unlocked once you join the Dark Brotherhood and complete their trials, and can be acquired from the ledger next to Elam Drals in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary.\nYou can do as many Contract quests as you like, but can only have one at a time in your journal.\nSacrament Quests\nSpeaker Terenus, the grim Imperial who indoctrinates you into the Dark Brotherhood, remains behind in the Sanctuary to bestow the most important missions that members of the Dark Brotherhood undertake in the name of their vaunted Night Mother.\nTravel to specialized locations to stalk and kill your prey, completing bonus objectives to achieve greater rewards.\nSacraments are unlocked once you complete the Dark Brotherhood quest \u201cA Lesson in Silence,\" not too long after you join.\nYou can only accept and complete one Sacrament quest per day.\nNew World Bosses and Delves\nThe Gold Coast is a settled region, but there is no shortage of danger in this fractured Cyrodillic territory.\nWorld Bosses\nTribune's Folly: The Gold Coast is home to savage minotaurs, who generally keep to themselves and are drawn to ancient Imperial sites. The minotaur drawn to Tribune's Folly has undergone a dark change, slave to a terrible evil lurking beneath this cursed ruin.\nKvatch Arena: The otherwise pious and reserved Colovians of Kvatch cut loose in the arena, where a regular Pardoner's Brawl is held to allow prisoners condemned to death to fight for their freedom. What happens when blundering adventurers such as yourself intervene?\nDelves\nHrota Cave: A drowned sprawl near the borders of the city of Anvil, this cave is haunted by terrible wispmothers and the shambling corpses of those travelers drawn to the place. Will you survive to loot the fallen, or join the dead in eternal unrest?\nGarlas Agea: Even the ancient Ayleids can't escape the spread of greed throughout Tamriel, and the Gold Coast Trading Company has claimed these ruins as storage for illicit cargo to be shipped across the world. Cut into their profits \u2013 and their necks \u2013 to claim a piece of the pie.\nRepeatable Bounties: Bounty boards in both Anvil and Kvatch have daily quests that ask you to battle one of these dangers and return victorious.\nNew Passive Skill Line: Dark Brotherhood\nJoining the Dark Brotherhood allows you to learn the tricks of their bloody trade and learn a new skill line of passive abilities.\nBlade of Woe: This first passive unlocks when you join the Dark Brotherhood, allowing you to perform merciless executions as outlined previously.\nYou may call this armament to your hand whenever you sneak up behind unsuspecting humanoid victims in the world, and dispatch them cruelly and instantly.\nNote that this attack does not work on player characters in Cyrodiil, vendors and quest NPCs, or on any bosses in the game, and can only be performed on creatures belonging to the standard races of Tamriel. You also receive 25% of the normal experience from killing targets with the Blade of Woe.\nScales of Pitiless Justice: No one wants to risk snitching on the Dark Brotherhood, and bounty gained from witnesses of your assaults and murders is reduced.\nPadomaic Sprint: Slaying innocent victims grants you a quick boost to your speed so you can evade the guards.\nShadowy Supplier: Visit a silent watcher in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary and any Outlaws Refuge to gain special boons.\nShadow Rider: Your mount instinctively knows how to keep to the shadows, significantly reducing your mounted aggression radius.\nSpectral Assassin: Even in broad daylight in the midst of a crowd, Sithis may cloak you in his void embrace, preventing you from being witnessed when using the Blade of Woe.\nChanges to Imperial City\nWe've introduced a number of changes and improvements to Imperial City in this update:\nDistricts can now be captured via mechanics similar to Resources in Cyrodiil.\nA single flag is located in each District, and is guarded by a few Alliance Guards.\nOwnership of a District confers a 33% Tel Var Stone bonus to all Tel Var Stone gains in the Districts.\nOwnership of a District also controls whether you can respawn in that District via a PvE or PvP death.\nIf your Alliance doesn't control any Districts and you die in the Districts, you will respawn in the Sewers.\nYou will now lose 50% of your Tel Var Stones for both a PvE or PvP death. Previously, you would lose 10% of your Stones for a PvE death, and 80% for a PvP death.\nRebalanced the monsters in Imperial City to make moving around the city easier for the solo player.\nBosses remain targeted at two player characters.\nPatrolling Horrors and Xivkyn elite are best handled by four or more, but their attacks are now less likely to kill you in one hit.\nWhite Gold Tower &amp; Imperial City Prison\nWe adjusted the difficulty in both Normal and Veteran versions, which will result in an overall reduction in difficulty for both versions.\nRuneboxes\nYou can now purchase Runeboxes from the Tel Var General Merchants in Imperial City in exchange for a substantial number of Tel Var Stones.\nRuneboxes are special items. Each one has a specific Collectible inside; the three introduced in this update have the Xivkyn Polymorphs that were previously only obtainable through rare drops in other Tel Var-purchased containers.\nUnlike the Collectibles themselves, Runeboxes can be traded, mailed, or sold on Guild Stores.\nUsing a Runebox will immediately grant you the associated Collectible; however, you can only use a Runebox if you do not already own the associated Collectible.\nNew Motifs\nThe Thieves Guild, Abah's Watch, and Assassins League crafting styles are now available to craft.\nYou'll be able to find the Chapters (or rarely, the full Book) for the Thieves Guild crafting style in the Unidentified Equipment boxes obtained as a reward for performing Heists to the Thieves Guild's highest standards.\nThe Style Item, \"Fine Chalk,\" or its component \"Rough Chalk,\" can be found in some Thieves Troves.\nThe inimitable style of Abah's Watch is also now available for crafters to learn, and you can find the Chapters (or rarely, the full Book) in the Large Laundered Shipments obtained from the repeatable quests found in the Thieves Guild hideout.\nThe Style Item, a \"Polished Shilling,\" can sometimes be found by pickpocketing any guard throughout the world (not just in Abah's Landing!).\nThe Assassins League style is available for aspiring assassins, and chapters can be found by defeating bosses in the Gold Coast area.\nThe Style Item, \"Tainted Blood\" can be refined from Dried Blood, obtained solely from use of the Blade of Woe.\nOne's ability to harvest blood from kills with the Blade of Woe is dependent both on their knowledge of the Assassins League style, and their rank in the Dark Brotherhood.\nDark Brotherhood Loyalty Reward: Personality\nThe first collectible personality, the Assassin, is available by purchasing the Dark Brotherhood DLC game pack and visiting the Gold Coast! Using this will allow you to take on a new attitude by changing the way you stand, move, and even emote.\nItem Sets\nIn this update, you'll be able to obtain some new item sets from a variety of sources:\nThere are 3 item sets that are obtained from participating in content from the Gold Coast:\nSithis' Touch\nFlanking Strategist\nHide of Morihaus\nThere are also 3 new crafted item sets available from crafting stations located in the Gold Coast:\nPelinal's Aptitude\nVaren's Wall\nKvatch Gladiator\nFour new PvP-based item sets available from the Tel Var Stone vendors in Imperial City, including:\nGalerion's Revenge\nVicecanon of Venom\nThews of the Harbinger\nImperial Physique\nNew Mementos\nSwear a blood oath or perform the ritual of the Black Sacrament itself with new mementos that can be unlocked from achievements obtained by playing through the Dark Brotherhood content.\nNew Titles\nIn this update, you'll be able to obtain 3 new titles:\nSilencer: Complete the Dark Brotherhood quest line to take your place as a Silencer.\nBane of the Gold Coast: Defeat Limenauruus the possessed minotaur, enter the Kvatch Arena and stand victorious, explore Hrota Cave and Garlas Agea, and complete the majority of the quests in the Gold Coast to earn this title.\nOphidian Overlord: Completing Veteran Sanctum Ophidia while the Trial is scaled to Champion 160 to earn this exclusive new title.\nBase Game Patch\nVeteran Rank Removal\nVeteran Ranks have been completely removed from the game in this update! Your strength after level 50 is now based on your number of Champion Points. As Champion Points are gained much faster than Veteran Ranks, this will allow you to advance more rapidly and start getting the best gear in the game faster.\nYou'll keep all your hard-earned attribute and skill points you received from gaining Veteran Ranks, and new players will instead earn them while leveling up to level 50.\nYou will receive 2 points every level that ends in a 5\nYou will receive 3 points every level that ends in a 10\nYou will continue to get 1 point for levels 2-49\nYou will receive 10 Champion Points as soon as you hit level 50 if your account doesn't have any Champion Points already.\nWe will be awarding a one-time bonus of 2.5 Champion Points per Veteran Rank gained on your highest level character when you first log in when Dark Brotherhood is released!\nEach Veteran Rank will grant 2.5 Champion Points, up to a maximum of 40 points at VR16.\nReaching level 50 with a second character means you can immediately equip gear up to your account's Champion Point value since Champion Points are shared across all characters on an account.\nOld Veteran Rank Items and monsters will now display Champion Points.\nFor items, this describes the number of Champion Points required to equip them.\nFor monsters, the number of Champion Points describes the monster's strength.\nEvery Veteran Rank is equivalent to 10 Champion Points.\nFor example: A monster that used to be VR12 will now be Champion Point 120.\nMonsters will now scale up faster in difficulty through veteran zones.\nExperience gain rules will continue to function as they did for Veteran Ranks:\nMobs 40 Champion Points below your level will grant 75% of their normal XP.\nMobs 50 or more Champion Points below your level will grant 30% of their normal XP.\nAbilities no longer increase their cost by 1% per Veteran Rank, but will now increase at their normal rate for every 10 Champion points, up to a cap of 160.\nMost abilities will cost about the same, but cost reduction abilities should return more predictable results.\nCore mechanics (sprint, dodge, CC break) will now be slightly more expensive.\nSilver and Gold zones have been releveled to account for the increased speed at which you gain Champion Points.\nThe Champion Point cap will remain at 501 for this update.\nThe Character Select screen now indicates how many Champion Points your account has.\nItem tooltips have been updated to support the removal of Veteran Ranks.\nLevel requirements for items previously referencing Veteran Ranks will now reference Champion.\nGold Value has been moved to the bottom of the tooltip.\nGuild, Friends, and Group lists now display Champion Points for anyone above level 50, rather than their Veteran Rank.\nThe XP bar has been modified to show Champion progression after hitting level 50.\nLoot history will now include the enlightenment bonus when showing XP gains.\nPoison-Making\nYou can now use the Alchemy system to create a wide array of dangerous poisons! Using new and existing reagents mixed together in a new type of solvent (oils), these poisons can be equipped alongside wielded weapon sets and have a chance to be applied to your enemy when using heavy attacks, light attacks, or weapon abilities.\nPoisons, unlike other equipped items, are consumed as they are applied.\nPoisons are also subject to dilution, with each effect becoming less potent as more effects are added.\nOils are sourced from various deadly monsters throughout Tamriel.\nThe new reagents have been added to many critters and monsters throughout Tamriel, and create multiple new effects for both potions and poisons.\nWhile a weapon set has a poison equipped, any weapon enchantments on that weapon set are temporarily suppressed.\nMaster's Weapons and Maelstrom Weapons have their unique-ability modifying effect suppressed, while their stat bonus is not suppressed.\nWeapon tooltips have been updated to support poisons.\nWhen a poison is equipped, the weapon enchant and charge will be suppressed and replaced by the poison description and count.\nAdded indicators for Armor Durability, and Weapon Charge/Poison.\nWhen any piece of equipped armor is broken, an indicator will appear near the ability bar.\nWhen a weapon for your current weapon set has no poisons equipped and runs out of weapon charge, an indicator will appear near the ability bar.\nActivity Finder Improvements\nThe Activity Finder has undergone additional improvements for this update. We've taken steps to address disruptive behavior with this tool, such as leaving a group as soon as the dungeon starts or abusing the power of group leader by removing friendly players.\nYou can now initiate a Ready Check to ask your group if everyone is ready (no need to jump up and down anymore!)\nA Ready Check will pass if everyone responds yes, fail if someone says no, and fail if it times out. The option to initiate a Ready Check is present in the Group Menu.\nGroups can vote to kick party members\nThe option to initiate a vote can be found by right clicking a player character's name in the group UI.\nA vote to kick ultimately requires a majority vote and can be initiated by anyone in the group. A 4-player group thus requires 3 votes to remove someone.\nLeaders of groups formed through the Activity Finder can no longer disband the group or remove other group members.\nAdded a 15-minute cooldown to re-queueing once you have successfully formed a group.\nCompleting the activity you queued for will reset the timer. If you join a group in progress and kill the final boss 4 minutes later, your timer clears. You don't then have to wait another 11 minutes.\nThe cooldown will be displayed in the group UI at the bottom when trying to queue for a dungeon.\nThis is all part of an ongoing process to continue to improve the Activity Finder \u2013 look for additional improvements in future updates!\nItem Trait Improvements\nItem Traits have undergone revision to improve the viability and balance of each Trait. Some Traits have received complete redesigns, other Traits have gained new effects and bonuses, while some other Traits have simply received better number tuning.\nWeapons\nCharged: This trait now increases your chance to apply status effects instead of increasing the amount of enchantment charges on your weapon.\nDefending: This trait now increases your Physical Resistance and Spell Resistance by flat values instead of percentages.\nInfused: This trait now also reduces the cooldown on your weapon enchantment in addition to increasing its damage.\nIntricate: This trait now also increases the amount of refined materials you obtain whenever you deconstruct the weapon, in addition to increasing the amount of inspiration gained.\nNirnhoned: This trait now increases the damage of the weapon.\nPowered: This trait now increases your healing done instead of reducing the cooldown on your weapon enchantment.\nSharpened: This trait now increases your Physical Penetration and Spell Penetration by flat values instead of percentages.\nTraining: This trait now increases all experience gained from all kills by a percentage instead of increasing your weapon skill line experience only.\nWeighted: This trait now grants you a chance to gain additional Ultimate whenever you generate Ultimate normally, and has been renamed to Decisive.\nArmor\nExploration: This trait now increases all gold gained from monster kills instead of increasing exploration experience gained, and has been renamed to Prosperous.\nImpenetrable: This trait now also reduces the durability damage taken of the item, in addition to reducing the damage taken from Critical Hits.\nIntricate: This trait now also increases the amount of refined materials you obtain whenever you deconstruct the armor, in addition to increasing the amount of inspiration gained.\nNirnhoned: This trait now increases Physical Resistance and Spell Resistance by a flat value.\nSturdy: This trait now reduces the cost of Block.\nTraining: This trait now increases all experience gained from all kills by a percentage, instead of increasing your armor skill line experience only.\nWell-fitted: This trait now also reduces the cost of Roll Dodge, in addition to reducing the cost of Sprint.\nImproved Cyrodiil Vendors\nIn this update, we've made a number of improvements to the vendors you find in Cyrodiil:\nAll armor sold by the Rare Items Merchant (Adhazabi Aba-daro the Golden) in exchange for Alliance Points now has the Impenetrable trait.\nArmor she sells for gold is unchanged, and has either the Infused or Divines trait. (The Divines trait is a new addition.)\nArmorers, Leatherworkers, Clothiers, Weaponsmiths, and Magus vendors in Cyrodiil now sell boxes of green-quality non-set items.\nThese boxes have a 10% chance to instead award a blue-quality set item.\nElite Gear Vendors in Cyrodiil now sell boxes containing blue-quality set items.\nThese boxes have a 5% chance to instead award a purple-quality set item.\nFor additional details, please see our in-depth post here.\nItems received from these new boxes scale to your level and Champion Point total at the moment you open the box, up to and including Champion 160.\nUpdates to Sanctum Ophidia\nVenture once again into the depths of Sanctum Ophidia!\nSanctum Ophidia now features a Normal version in addition to the Veteran version.\nNew surprises await as the denizens of the Trial have attracted the aid of a new Bannerman, the Serpent Fang.\nStonebreaker and Ozara have had their difficulty increased. As a result of this change, their accompanying rewards have been improved.\nItems and Weapon sets obtained in this Trial have been updated to max level, which is now Champion 160.\nSome of the items that now scale to Champion 160 have been rebalanced.\nSanctum Ophidia will now scale to the level of the Trial leader, much like Dungeons do currently.\nWhen you start the Trial at max level (Champion 160), you will qualify for the Leaderboards.\nPoints for Leaderboards are awarded in the same way as other Trials (monster kills, vitality bonus and time).\nExtended Inventory for Crafters (Craft Bag)\nESO Plus members will now receive access to an extended inventory for crafters (Craft Bags.)\nThe Craft Bag is an additional inventory section which does not count against your inventory limit, is shared across all characters on your account, and can hold an effectively unlimited number of all basic crafting supplies.\nIf your membership expires, you will still have access to the resources stored in your Craft Bags, but you will be unable to add any new materials to it.\nLoot that goes to your Craft Bag has a special call out in the Loot History.\nCrafting Materials from your inventory and account bank will automatically go to your Craft Bag upon the first login of each of your characters.\nItems can be manually retrieved from the Craft Bag in maximum stacks of 200. Retrieved items can also be manually stowed back into the Craft Bags.\nWhen accessing your Craft Bag, everyone around you will see you rummaging through an ornate bag that is different than the default backpack.\nPlease Note: When you have a very large number of items in the Craft Bag, the UI will abbreviate the item count (ex. 1.1k Simple Bait). Selecting a specific item will show you the exact number in the tooltip.\nItem Locking\nEquipment can now be locked to prevent accidental deletions, which will prevent you from destroying it, converting it to Imperial, and marking it as junk.\nPress Y on an item to bring up Actions for that item, then select Lock.\nLocking an item will remove it from the following:\nVendor \u2013 Sell\nGuild Store \u2013 List\nTrade\nMail \u2013 Send Mail\nGuild Bank - Deposit\nCraft Stations \u2013 Deconstruct, Improvement, Research\nThe list of available item actions has also been reordered to put more commonly used actions towards the top.\nNew Collectible Functionality &amp; Changes\nBrand New Categories\nHats: These fashionable new additions are cosmetic and work just like other costumes.\nPersonalities: Take on a new attitude by changing the way you stand, move, and even some emotes\nModular Usage\nYou can now apply multiple collectibles simultaneously!\nPolymorphs and skins have been separated out from the costume category, and two new categories (hats and personalities) have been added.\nThis means you can have a hat, costume, skin, and personality all applied at the same time! And of course, you can combine these with your existing equipment to create your perfect look.\nThe Costumes category has been renamed to Appearance.\nEquipment and Collectibles that are hidden now have information in the tooltip communicating their hidden status.\nPolymorphs override all other appearance change options with the exception of personalities.\nCollectibles in Character Select\nActive Appearance Collectibles (Hats, Personalities, Polymorphs, Costumes, Skins) can now be seen from the Character Select screen, in addition to your active mount and/or pet!\nNew Dye\nViridian Venom is a new dye acquired by learning all of the Alchemy traits on the new reagents introduced with Poison-Making.\nAdditional Character Slots\nYou will now be able to purchase additional character slots through the in-game Crown Store!\nYou'll be able to purchase up to four additional slots. Once you buy the maximum amount, the option will be greyed out.\nInformation about purchasable character slots will appear on the Character Select screen when you max out your character slots, and there are additional slots available for purchase.\nNote: You can purchase additional slots any time, not just when you're maxed out.\nNameplates\nA new option for Nameplates has been added to the Settings menu. This controls the display of character names or UserIDs, Alliance icons, and health bars above characters in the world.\nThese settings can be toggled for Self, Group Members, Friendly NPCs, Friendly Players, Enemy NPCs, and Enemy Players.\nNames are off by default.\nDefaults for existing health bar settings remain unchanged in that they show up for injured player characters and enemies.\nThere are new health bar settings for group members and damage that are on by default.\nDefaults for Indicators remain unchanged.\nYou can control when nameplates display on any of the above units, and when they highlight on any of those units.\nNameplates can be set to show player's titles if they have one selected.\nNameplates can be set to show guild names as well.\nGuild names are shown based on the guild tabard you are wearing.\nCharacter and UserID Display\nYou will now see both the character name and gamertag/PSN ID when targeting another player character, and when receiving most notifications from other players.\nAn option for Display Name has been added to the Interface section.\nThis setting controls which name is listed first when both names are listed (e.g. Target Frame), and which name is shown when only one name is shown (e.g. Group Frame).\nCharacter Sheet\nThe character sheet has been broken up into two new sections:\nAttributes: Contains combat related stats\nDescription: Contains non-combat related stats\nWe also added XP progress to the next level, as well as Enlightened information to the Description section.\nEnchanting Improvements\nWe've implemented a number of changes and improvements to Enchanting:\nEnchantment glyphs no longer have an upper limit on the equipment they can be applied to. This means a lower level enchantment can now be applied to a higher level piece of gear.\nEach harvestable runestone is guaranteed to contain an Essence and an Aspect rune, and one third of the runestones you find will also contain a Potency rune.\nHalf the time, when you find a Potency rune it will be scaled to your combat level, and the other half of the time it will be scaled to your rank in the Potency Improvement passive.\nEvery tier of both polarities of potency is now available for purchase from any enchanting vendor, including Alliance Point enchanting vendors.\nThe overall power of weapon enchantments has been significantly increased.\nAll Enchanting Runes can now be sold to vendors for at least 1 gold.\nHarvest Nodes\nResource nodes that spawn in battle leveled zones (such as Orsinium or the Gold Coast) now come in two varieties and provide crafting resources based on either your combat level or your rank in the associated material-use passive.\nWhen the resource node spawns, it has an even chance to be based on either level or passive rank.\nFor example, if you are Level 3 and have purchased Metalworking up to Rank 5, half the ore nodes found in scaled zones will be Iron, and half will be Ebony.\nArmor Improvements\nWe have begun an effort to improve clipping and floating issues seen with a large amount of our armors and costumes. A test batch of updated armors will be available with this patch. In each of the cases listed, there should be a significant improvement with shoulder pad and tasset floating/clipping. We will target additional armors for future updates based on your feedback.\nAffected Styles are:\nUndaunted Armor and Motif\nDark Brotherhood Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor\nAldmeri/Daggerfall/Ebonheart Alliance Armor and Motifs\nCombat Animation Prioritization\nWe adjusted the combat animation priority so that you will see impacts and effects for each ability and attack fired when played in rapid succession, without it affecting DPS. Blocking mechanics have been excluded from this change based on feedback from the last PTS testing cycle.\nPickpocketing Improvements\nWhen stealing from an NPC, their profession is now displayed on the pickpocket prompt. An NPC's profession influences the type of goods they are likely to be carrying, so picking the pocket of a Priest (or Cultist!) gives you a better chance at religious goods than stealing from a Scholar or a Smith.\nQuick Cast Ground Abilities\nAdded a new interface option to change the way ground targeted spells are cast.\nThis option can be found under Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Quick Cast Ground Abilities\nChanging this to \u201cOn\" means that all ground targeted abilities will cast immediately in the location at which you are aiming.\nChanging this to \u201cOff\" means that all ground targeted abilities will require you to select where the ability is cast.\nThis feature defaults to \u201cAutomatic\" which preserves the current in-game functionality for ground targeted abilities (Ultimates cast instantly at your target location, and normal abilities require a button press).\nStarter Islands\nUpon completing or skipping the tutorial (Wailing Prison), new characters will now appear on the starter island for their alliance: Bleakrock Isle for Ebonheart Pact characters, Khenarthi's Roost for Aldmeri Dominion characters, and Stros M'Kai for Daggerfall Covenant characters. You can take a boat from your starter island to your alliance's first major city, at any time.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, IMPERIAL CITY DLC GAME PACK\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nGeneral\nRemoved the gate on the Arena coliseum.\nThe spawn rates for monsters in the Temple District and General Kryozote's wing of the Imperial Sewers will now adjust correctly according to monsters slain (previously, they would always wait the maximum time).\nDistrict Flags in Imperial City can now only be influenced by a maximum of 1 player character instead of 5 player characters.\nMonsters\nSpider Daedra that appear in certain events in the Nobles District now drop appropriate Spider Daedra loot, and are correctly vulnerable to attacks that affect Daedra.\nMonster Abilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Colossus\"&gt;Flesh Colossus&lt;/a&gt;\nStumble Forward no longer displays telegraph cones, but will still strike multiple targets.\n&lt;a href=\"Gati%20the%20Storm%20Sister\"&gt;Gati the Storm Sister&lt;/a&gt;\nStorm Shadows can no longer be interrupted.\nNullifier\nNullify Silence and Pet Stun now last 2 seconds, increased from 0.65 seconds.\n&lt;a href=\"Otholug%20gro-Goldfolly\"&gt;Otholug gro-Goldfolly&lt;/a&gt;\nAspect of Terror can no longer be interrupted.\nAspect of Terror's fear effect can now be dodged along with the rest of the ability.\nAspect of Terror now has a shorter cast time, and can only hit one target.\nAspect of Terror no longer affects the targeted player character before it actually hits.\nBlocking Fright Force is now more intuitive.\nPatrolling Horrors\nDaedric Arch scamps summoned by Baron Thirsk now have less health.\nAmoncrul: Antimagic Reduced the field that targets player characters and the monster itself to two player characters from three.\nBaron Thirsk\nReduced the amount of health that Blend into Shadows heals Baron Thirsk for to 2% of his health over 5 seconds from 7% over 3 seconds.\nImmolator Charr: Regeneration no longer heals Immolator Charr to full health.\nMazaluhad: Zombies now explode for three times as much damage.\nScreeching Matron\nDevour now deals more damage, and no longer heals for the initial hit.\nVolghass:\nBurning Ground no longer creates three telegraphs for each flame circle, and now hits half as often.\nCrazed Claw deals slightly less damage.\nYsenda Resplendant: Your health will no longer desync while fighting Ysenda Resplendant.\nZoal the Ever-Wakeful: Shocking Gaze now hits every second instead of twice per second.\nSweepers\nMind Spike now works like Clairvoyance and matches the indicated telegraph, and suppresses all forms of stealth. Unlike Clairvoyance, Mind Spike remains in combat.\nXivkyn Elite\nDrain Essence now heals for 5% of the maximum health if your character dies while being drained.\nEnraged Strike now deals significantly less damage.\nFire Runes now hit less often.\nForce Pulse now deals far more damage.\nReduced the shield from Healing Shield. It now absorbs 4% of the monster's health in damage against 4 players, down from 12%. Healing Shield also now heals less damage over time.\nLava Whip's cast time is now much longer and can be blocked.\nRotating Reflective Shield no longer damages and knocks back melee and ranged physical attacks.\nWhile green, Rotating Reflective Shield now reduces damage from melee attacks and reflects ranged physical attacks.\nWhile blue, Rotating Reflective shield reflects spell projectiles.\nStanding in a Lich Crystal now deals more damage. The detonation damage from the Lich Crystal remains unchanged.\nSteel Cyclone now deals far more damage per hit.\nTeleport Strike is no longer immediately followed by another attack when it hits.\nVampiric Ground no longer heals for the first two hits after placement; it now deals less damage for the first two hits, and more damage starting with the third.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nDungeons\nImperial Prison\nLord Warden Dusk will no longer banish you when you use a movement-based ability.\nThe Flesh Sculptor's health bar will no longer disappear near the central pool.\nTwo player characters will no longer be able to use the same lever at the same time to open a gate leading to Lord Warden's Council. Two separate switches must now be used in conjunction.\nEnemies will now be able to pass through gates that have been opened near the Lord Warden's Council.\nThe visual effects from Lord Warden Dusk's ability Shadow Nova will no longer get stuck on screen and/or in the ground.\nWhite-Gold Tower\nThe Planar Inhibitor will no longer interrupt her Magma Diver ability when you use the pinion.\nUndaunted Pledges\nA quest pin will now be displayed indicating where Daggerfall Covenant player characters can turn in their pledge for Imperial City Prison and White-Gold Tower.\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nGeneral\nUpdated the goods sold by Tel Var Stone merchants to include many more set items and rare goods.\nDue to recent landscaping changes, many of the fishing holes in the Imperial City have been relocated to other nearby locations.\nUpdated the locations and achievement hints for two Imperial City skyshards, to account for changes to the battlefield around them.\nSet pieces obtained from the Trophy Vaults in Imperial City Prison and White-Gold Tower can now drop with Sturdy, Training, or Prosperous traits, in addition to the previous Infused, Divines, Well-Fitted, and Reinforced traits.\nQuests &amp; Zones\nQuests\nKnowledge is Power: The quest objective marker for this quest will now appear in the correct place.\nThe Lock and The Legion: Summoned pets will no longer mimic Captain Regilus' lines.\nUI\nGeneral\nFixed an issue where the Imperial City tutorial will appear on relog and the dismiss prompt will no longer function if you no longer have access to ESO Plus.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, ORSINIUM DLC GAME PACK\nArt &amp; Animation\nFigure\nMalacath Armor: Equipping the Malacath medium helmet will no remove your facial hair.\nTrinimac Armor: Fixed a texture-related issue for the shoulders of the Trinimac light armors when certain hoods were equipped.

This update opens up the world of Tamriel for you to explore any time, and play with your friends no matter what level you are. Due to the significant changes One Tamriel brings to ESO, we've adjusted much of the current content and systems.\nIn this update, you'll find that we've made Craglorn more solo-friendly, added Normal and Veteran modes for all 4-player dungeons, re-designed the Undaunted Pledge system, and made some fairly sizeable itemization changes and updates \u2013 you'll definitely want to check out all the details below.\nIn addition to One Tamriel, we've also added dueling, Weapon Ultimates, and added new daily quests. We've also added 16 new Monster Masks and 30 new item sets, and raised the Champion Point cap by 30 points. As with previous updates, we've also implemented many fixes and improvements to previous DLC game packs and the base game patch, including a fix for frequent crashing in Trials.

Your character will automatically scale and balance to the content.\nThe alliance restrictions have been lifted in all open-world zones, with the exception of PvP areas.\nHigh-level players will be able to group with friends who are new to ESO; anyone below Champion 160 will scale so everyone can adventure together.\nEvery zone has been modified to ensure a mixture of content for solo and group play is available.\nCraglorn\nCraglorn has been re-designed so not all content will require a group to play.\nThe main story quests are now balanced for one player, and the remaining group content can be completed with as little as two players.\nThe group-number restrictions on all quests or doors have been removed.\nBecause of the significant changes, you will be able to complete all the quests in Craglorn even if you've done them once before.\nBe sure to try your hand at the group delves to find new rewards, or take on one of the world events with a full group for new achievements!\nJust like the rest of Tamriel, you can expect to find updated loot throughout the quests, delves, and bosses in Craglorn. See the itemization section below for more details.\nDungeons\nThere are lots of changes for Dungeons with this update! Read on to see what adventure awaits for those wanting to delve into the darkest reaches of Nirn and beyond.\nAll Dungeons now have both a Normal and Veteran modes.\nPrevious Dungeons which had a unique Veteran mode have been converted to Version I and II; each version now has a Normal and Veteran mode.\nExample: Fungal Grotto will now be known as Fungal Grotto I and Fungal Grotto II.\nEach Veteran dungeon now contains a Monster Mask and Shoulder set.\nMonster Masks will drop 100% of the time from the final boss in Veteran mode.\nShoulder sets are acquired via Pledge keys (details are outlined in the next section below).\nUndaunted Pledges\nWe have redesigned the Pledge system to offer more rewards more often, and at a predictable rate.\nThere is no longer a Bronze, Silver and Gold key. All keys have been converted Undaunted Keys and reward a Shoulder set piece with each use.\nThere are now three pledge givers for Undaunted Dungeon quests, with each offering a unique Pledge each day. They also have a corresponding chest which, when an Undaunted Key is used, will offer a Shoulder set piece from one of the Dungeon Pledges they offer.\nMaj al-Ragath offers a random Pledge for the following Dungeons:\nBanished Cells I &amp; II\nDarkshade Caverns I &amp; II\nElden Hollow I &amp; II\nFungal Grotto I &amp; II\nSpindleclutch I &amp; II\nWayrest Sewers I &amp; II\nGilirion the Redbeard offers a random Pledge for the following Dungeons:\nArx Corinium\nBlackheart Haven\nBlessed Crucible\nCity of Ash I &amp; II\nCrypt of Hearts I &amp; II\nDirefrost\nSelene's Web\nTempest Island\nVaults of Madness\nVolenfell\nUrgalarg Chief-bane offers a random Pledge for the following Dungeons:\nCradle of Shadows\nImperial City Prison\nRuins of Mazzatun\nWhite-Gold Tower\nEach pledge can be completed in one of three ways for a total of up to six keys per day.\nNormal Dungeon: Completing a Pledge in a Normal version of the dungeon awards a single Undaunted Key.\nVeteran Dungeon: Completing a Pledge in a Veteran version of the dungeon awards a single Undaunted Key, but completing Veteran versions of the Dungeon are also the only way to get the Undaunted Monster Masks.\nVeteran Hard Mode: Completing a Pledge in a Veteran version of the dungeon after the final boss has been made more difficult will award two Undaunted Keys, in addition to awarding the Monster Mask from completing a Veteran Dungeon.\nAll previous dungeons that did not have a Hard Mode have been given a way to activate a mode that makes the final boss more difficult in the Veteran version, activated by the Scroll of Glorious Battle found in the final boss' room.\nItemization Changes\nIn order to support One Tamriel which allows you to go anywhere, we needed to make several significant changes to itemization and item sets. In general, each zone and dungeon in the game will now drop 3 sets \u2013 one for light, medium, and heavy armor \u2013 and all set drops in the game will scale up to CP160.\nItem Sets will now drop for every item slot.\nThis excludes the Agility, Endurance, and Willpower jewelry sets.\nSets that grant a bonus to melee damage will now drop more intelligently (i.e. a set with melee damage will no longer drop with a bow or stave).\nHelms and shoulders can now drop at all levels.\nAll set drops have a chance to be green, blue, or purple quality.\nThe chance of receiving blue and purple quality items increases as you gain more levels.\nAll set drops from the overland are now bind-on-equip.\nDungeon bosses and mini bosses will now drop a set piece 100% of the time.\nMini bosses will drop either a hand, waist, or feet set piece.\nBosses will drop either a chest, shoulder, head or leg set piece.\nThe final Boss of a dungeon will drop weapons or jewelry.\nNormal mode dungeon bosses will drop blue-quality items.\nVeteran mode dungeon bosses will drop purple-quality items.\nAgility, Willpower, and Endurance sets no longer drop from dungeon bosses. They are now rewarded upon completing a random dungeon using the Grouping Tool.\nNote: These sets can still be found in the Cache chests in Imperial City.\nAll dungeon set drops are bind-on-pickup.\nNon-Dungeon Bosses\nDelve bosses will now drop a waist or feet set piece from the zone they are located in.\nOverland group bosses drop head, chest, legs, or weapon set piece from the zone they are located in.\nPublic dungeon bosses drop a shoulder, hand, or weapon set piece from the zone they are located in.\nMany of these Bosses have a small chance to drop a uniquely-named item, instead of the expected set piece. This uniquely-named item is also a part of one of the sets of the zone they are located in, but may not adhere to the dropped slot guidelines above.\nTrials\nMobs and bosses in Normal mode will drop blue-quality gear.\nMobs and bosses in Veteran mode will drop purple-quality gear.\nThe last boss on Veteran Hard Mode will drop gold-quality jewelry.\nHard Modes all contain an item worth 10,000 gold which can only be acquired once every 5 days.\nUndaunted Plunder\nIn order to ensure that Veteran Trials offer proper rewards as befitting their difficulty, we've added Undaunted Plunder to all bosses within those Trials.\nBy defeating bosses in the Veteran-mode Trials, you'll earn Undaunted Plunder \u2013 valuable items that can be sold to merchants for 1000 gold each.\nEach boss you defeat will drop an increased amount of Undaunted Plunder that you can sell.\nTreasure Chests\nTreasure Chests gained from defeating a Dark Anchor have a 100% chance to drop a ring or amulet set piece form the zone they are located in.\nThe above is also true of Unstable Anomalies found in Craglorn.\nTreasure chests found in the world have a chance to grant any set piece that can drop in that zone.\nSimple chests have a slight chance of dropping an item set piece.\nIntermediate chests have a good chance of dropping an item set piece\nAdvanced and Master chests have a guaranteed chance of dropping an item set piece.\nIf you have the Treasure Hunter Champion Passive, both the above chances and quality of an item will be improved.\nTreasure chests found from a Treasure Map have a guaranteed chance to drop one random set piece that can drop in that zone.\nHigher difficulty chests have a better chance of spawning in the world, but easier chests will continue to be more common.\nThe loot from the CE Treasure Chest maps now scale to your level up to CP160.\nQuests\nThe quest reward items from major quests have been updated to now be part of an item set. In many cases, these items' names have been modified to reflect this. Less important quests' rewards are not part of an item set.\nMany quest rewards' item qualities have been rebalanced, meaning that the most important quests in the zone will now reward blue-quality items. (Combined with the above, these will be blue-quality set pieces.)\nRegular monsters throughout Tamriel have a small chance of dropping any item set piece that can drop in that zone.\nAdhazabi Aba-daro the Golden, the rare goods vendor in Cyrodiil, has been updated to include the new Monster Masks and gold-quality jewelry.\nYou now have a better chance of getting more valuable or useful items from Thieves Troves as your rank in the Thieves Guild increases.\nTreasure maps found in any zone may now direct you to any overland zone.\nNew Item Sets\nWe've added 30 Item Sets to drop in Overland zones and Dungeons, with the full list of names for the new sets below.\nArmor of the Trainee\nBeekeeper's Gear\nBone Pirate's Tatters\nDraugr Hulk\nGreen Pact\nJailbreaker\nKnight-errant's Mail\nLamia's Song\nLeviathan\nLight Speaker\nMedusa\nMother's Sorrow\nNetch's Touch\nOrder of Diagna\nPlague Doctor\nRattlecage\nShalk Exoskeleton\nSkooma Smuggler\nSpelunker\nSpider Cultist Cowl\nSpinner's Garments\nSpriggan's Thorns\nStrength of the Automaton\nSword Dancer\nSword-Singer\nToothrow\nTreasure Hunter\nVampire Cloak\nVampire Lord\nYsgramor's Legacy\nItem Set Drop Locations\nMany drop locations for Item Sets have been changed.

This new category includes sub-categories for general achievements, Death Challenges, Slayer Challenges, Survivor Challenges, and Speed Challenges.\nWe've also reordered the Dungeon and Veteran Dungeon achievements, so that achievements within a sub-category are grouped by dungeon and listed in the order they are most likely to be discovered in, instead of alphabetically.\nAdded 3 achievements for completing all of the Magical Anomalies, Anka-Ra Sites, and Iron Orc Nirncrux Mines in Craglorn.\nAdded 3 new achievement lines for completing 1 / 10 / 30 of the new daily quests for Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, and Undaunted Delve dailies.\nCompleting these achievements awards a small amount of reputation for the associated skill line.\nWe've updated the Undaunted pledge achievements to account for changes to the pledges themselves:\nThe achievements for completing Pledges from Maj al-Ragath and Glirion the Redbeard are no longer difficulty specific.\nAdded a line of achievements for completing Pledges from the new pledge giver, Urgarlag Chief-Bane.\nMotifs and Recipes\nUpdated the way Provisioning recipes drop as follows:\nRecipes in Cyrodiil, the Imperial City, and Dungeons now drop based on your rank in the Recipe Improvement passive.\nIn other zones, recipes drop based on your passive rank 75% of the time, and the rest of the time drop the same way they dropped prior to One Tamriel, by zone.\nCrafting Motifs which were previously only available in the Silver and Gold versions of alliance content are now available throughout the world.\nDaedra Hearts are now an uncommon drop from humanoid Daedra.\nArgentum, Copper, and Palladium style items can now be found in treasure chests.\nJustice System\nLegerdemain now influences the quality of loot obtained from Justice activities.\nHigher skill ranks in Legerdemain provide a better chance to \"find\" higher quality items.\nThis replaces the previous approach of higher level zones having a higher chance to obtain higher quality items.\nSimilarly, the overall value of items from Thieves Troves is now based on your rank in the Thieves Guild skill line, with a higher rank providing an increased chance for more and higher quality items.\nCrafting &amp; Harvesting\nSurvey Reports received from Crafting Writs may now send you to any zone throughout the world.\nYou may now pick up Crafting Writs from Writ Boards outside your home alliance.\nNote: Deliveries sites are still determined by your original alliance.\nWhen opening a Clothing, Woodworking, or Blacksmithing Writ reward box, you now have a chance to obtain a shipment of 25 refined materials from a previous tier of materials.\nThese shipments appear whenever you do not obtain a Survey Report.\nYou no longer need to be Champion 10 or above to obtain Crafting Writs for Craglorn and Orsinium.\nNote: You still must have access to Orsinium in order to receive an Orsinium crafting writ.\nAll harvest nodes now scale to your combat level or applicable crafting passive rank.\nMiscellaneous Systems Changes &amp; Updates\nIn addition to the above updates for One Tamriel, we've also made several miscellaneous changes to various systems across the game.\nAll vendors now offer goods close to your level, instead of goods based on the zone the vendor is located in.\nGold drops from monsters, treasure chests, safe boxes, Thieves Troves and other containers now scale to your level, instead of the level of the source.\nThe gold cost for Bribery is now based on your level.\nSoul gem usage has been simplified.\nPlayers of all levels will receive and fill Grand Soul Gems, which can be used to revive players of any level, as well as to refill enchantments.\nNon-grand Soul Gems no longer fill these roles, and may be sold to vendors.\nAll survey reports now spawn six rich nodes. To balance out the reduction in number of nodes at high-tier survey sites, the amount of materials high-tier rich nodes award has been increased.\nPlayers can now undergo the Ritual of Mara with players from other alliances.\nNEW FEATURES / UPDATES / BIG CHANGES\nDueling\nYou can now initiate duels with other players!\nThis new feature can be found in the social interaction wheel when interacting with another player, or simply typing /duel if you have a keyboard connected.\nDuels may be initiated in any non-PVP overland zone against a player of any alliance.\nDuels can only be done between 2 player characters, and only a certain amount of duels can occur within a given area.\nIf you don't want to fight other player characters or receive dueling invitations, the Social panel in your options menu allows the auto-declining of duels.\nDuels have the following rules:\nAfter the challenged player accepts the duel invitation, a countdown to begin will appear in the center of both player's screens.\nAll outside influences such as healing, buffs, etc. from other player characters will be blocked when a duel begins, and will last for the duration of the duel.\nCombat with a monster will not break or end a duel.\nBattle-spirit will still be applied to any player characters within a duel.\nDuels will have a radius you must stay inside, and will be centered around a Dueling Flag.\nYou will be notified if you are nearing the \"out of bounds\" area of the duel.\nLeaving the duel area results in a forfeit.\nA duel is completed when one player character is knocked down to 0 hitpoints.\nYou will be offered a free resurrection if defeated, or can be resurrected by other player characters.\nNew achievements have been added to your journal for winning 1, 25, and 100 duels.\nWeapon Ultimates\nNew Weapon Ultimates have been added to the game. Each Weapon skill line now has one Ultimate, and each Ultimate can be obtained by reaching Rank 50 in its respective Weapon skill line. Weapon Ultimates can be morphed as well!\nChampion Points\nThe Champion Point cap has been raised by a total of 30 points (10 in each red/blue/green constellation). The Champion Point experience curve has been automatically adjusted with this new cap, so that earlier Champion Points require less experience and can be earned faster.\nNew Daily Quests\nWe've added daily quests for the three factions \u2013 Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, and the Undaunted. Included are new rewards, and a new way to gain reputation in their ranks.

We've also made several fixes to itemization (including a fix for Vicious Death), dungeons, quests, and overall gameplay.\nContent\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, IMPERIAL CITY DLC GAME PACK\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, ORSINIUM DLC GAME PACK\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, THIEVES GUILD DLC GAME PACK\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nQuests &amp; Zones\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, BASE GAME PATCH\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nMiscellaneous\nQuests &amp; Zones\nUI\nNEW FEATURES / UPDATES / BIG CHANGES\nHDR Support\nWe now support HDR on the Xbox One S!\nIf you have HDR enabled in your Xbox One S system settings, the game will run in HDR mode.\nThere is a slider present in the UI settings to adjust the HDR brightness to match your TV settings. Please see Microsoft's recommendations for which TVs to use to get the best HDR experience.\nMythical Aetherial Ambrosia\nWe've introduced Mythic Aetherial Ambrosia to Tamriel! Mythic Aetherial Ambrosia is an incredibly rare, incredibly potent version of Psijic Ambrosia. Drinking it grants you a +150% bonus to the Experience you gain while it is in effect, and just like Psijic Ambrosia, its consumption and crafting is affected by your Connoisseur and Brewer passives. While Mythic Aetherial Ambrosia will stack with other foods or drinks, it will not stack with Psijic Ambrosia.\nTo craft Mythic Aetherial Ambrosia, you must first find an Aetheric Cipher.\nThis extremely rare item can potentially be found on any monster within certain areas, listed below.\nYou also need a Recipe Scroll for Psijic Ambrosia.\nUse the Aetheric Cipher while the Psijic Ambrosia Recipe scroll is in your inventory, and the recipe scroll will transform into a Mythic Aetherial Ambrosia Recipe scroll.\nThis recipe can only be understood by those with the highest rank of the Recipe Quality Provisioner passive.\nThe recipe for Mythic Aetherial Ambrosia calls for one unit of Aetherial Dust and one Psijic Ambrosia drink.\nAetherial Dust is very rarely found on the resource nodes in certain zones - it can appear on ore, raw cloth, fallen wood, alchemical herbs and mushrooms, and water sources. It is not found on monsters.\nApothecary's Parcels (Imperial City DLC Game Pack)\nWe've introduced Apothecary's Parcels to certain merchants in the Imperial City, enabling you to purchase herbs and other reagents in exchange for Tel Var Stones.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, IMPERIAL CITY DLC GAME PACK\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nItemization\nFixed an issue where Lord Warden Dusk, located in Imperial City Prison, was dropping the incorrect set items.

This free update introduces our player housing system with 39 uniquely-themed homes you can acquire throughout Tamriel. With over 2,000 individual decorative and furniture options, plus Furnishing Crafting, you'll have a lot of options available to make your home truly yours.\nIn addition to this massive new system, we've also added Master Crafting Writs, four new Motifs, and updated several sources of itemization in Cyrodiil and the Imperial City, all of which are detailed below. You'll also find that we've put a focus on improving the balance across all classes and skills.\nAs always, we've made several fixes and improvements to all previously DLC game packs and the base game patch. We can't wait to have you play our latest update. Thanks, and enjoy!\nHOMESTEAD.\nUpdate 13 features Homestead \u2013 player housing is coming to The Elder Scrolls Online! As such, you may now acquire and decorate homes across Tamriel. Homestead features 39 homes spread throughout many zones in the base game. Homes can be found in a variety of interesting locations across Tamriel, and each is available for purchase.\nHomestead Basics.\nExcept for your first entry-level inn room, which is free after completing a short quest, all of the initially-available homes or inns from other alliances can be purchased with in-game gold or crowns.\nYou may own one of every home, all the way up to all 39 available at launch!\nHomes are shared across all characters on your account.\nHomes are split into several tiers, by size:\nInn Rooms: 3 total, 1 for each alliance\nApartments: 3 total, 1 for each alliance\nSmall Homes: 10 total, 1 for each of the 10 playable races\nMedium Homes: 10 total, 1 for each of the 10 playable races\nLarge Homes: 10 total, 1 for each of the 10 playable races\nManors: 3 total, 1 for each alliance\nHome ownership is tracked in the new Housing tab of the Collections window.\nThis tab describes each home in detail, and allows you to travel to that particular home.\nThis also displays any homes that you haven't yet acquired and allows you to preview them, which you can read more about below.\nAll 36 of the apartments, homes and manors can all be purchased with either gold (as long as the achievement prerequisites are met) or crowns.\nOnce obtained, a home is yours forever! There is no rent to pay, or any other form of ongoing maintenance costs.\nHomes have limits on the number of items, collectibles, and visitors that may be present, with larger homes having higher caps.\nThe number of objects you can place in your home is doubled for those with an active ESO Plus membership.\nIn the event your ESO Plus membership lapses, you won't be able to add any additional items to your home until you drop below the regular item cap. You will be able to remove items in order to do so.\nDueling is allowed in homes, but is disabled inside inn rooms and apartments.\nPets, Assistants, and Mounts cannot be summoned inside of homes, but can be placed inside homes as decorations.\nOnce placed, Assistants can be used as normal.\nAcquiring a Home\nThere are three ways to acquire a home in Homestead:\nPurchase the home in the Crown Store for crowns.\nOpen the Crown Store and explore the new \u201cHousing\" tab.\nFrom there, you can preview and then purchase any of the new homes via crowns.\nFind Canthion the Housing Broker to acquire a quest that grants you a free inn-room.\nCanthion the Housing Broker can be found within the banks of Daggerfall City, Davon's Watch, or Vulkhel Guard, depending on your alliance. If you want a free inn-room \u2013 highly recommended! \u2013 talk to him, and he will bestow the quest.\nCompletion of this quest awards the small inn-room located in the zone associated with your alliance.\nAfterwards, you may purchase the other inn rooms for a nominal fee or can repeat the quest on another character in a different alliance to acquire the other rooms.\nFind homes scattered across Tamriel, making sure you have completed any prerequisites, and purchase them for in-game gold.\nFirst, you must find the home in-game, open the door, and follow the purchasing instructions.\nMost homes require you to complete certain prerequisites before you can purchase them for gold. For example, to purchase the Daggerfall Covenant Manor, you must have previously completed the Hero of the Daggerfall Covenant achievement.\nYou must own the Imperial Edition version of ESO in order to purchase any Imperial homes.\nHomes can be purchased for crowns at any time, bypassing the above requirements.\nHome Previewing\nThe easiest way to preview homes you have not yet purchased is to go to the new \u201cHouses\" section in the Crown Store, highlight the home you want to check out, and select \u201cPreview.\" This will teleport you to the home so you can do a walkthrough while making your purchase decision. You can also preview homes from the Collections window, and also by simply finding the home in the world and opening its door. Previewing brings you into a personal experience where you can explore the prospective home, including both furnished and unfurnished versions.\nUnfurnished homes may be purchased with gold or crowns, and generally come with a small number of items such as plants and rocks (if the home has a yard) and candles (to light the interior of the home).\nFurnished homes may only be purchased with crowns. Each furnished home is pre-decorated with a tasteful selection of items, which are yours to keep or adjust at your leisure.\nYou may switch between unfurnished and furnished previews at any time, and the preview will adjust on the fly accordingly.\nIt is not possible to preview a home after you've already purchased it, or to purchase the furnished version of a home if you've already purchased the unfurnished version (or vice versa).\nOnce you make your purchase, you will automatically load into your new home and can start editing it immediately.\nThe Housing Editor\nThe housing editor contains multiple tabs and categories for ease of asset selection.\nThe Place tab allows you to place furnishings and collectibles from a categorized list of available options.\nThe Purchase tab contains a large list of furnishings available for a la carte crown purchase.\nNearly every item in the Purchase tab is also available via crafting or from other in-game sources with a few exceptions for items found exclusively in Crown Store bundles.\nIn addition to directly selecting any placed items in editor mode, you may also retrieve placed furnishings from a list of placed items in the Retrieve tab of the editor, without needing to locate them in the home.\nAdditionally, the Retrieve tab indicates the distance to each item in your home, and allows you to mark the location of items on your compass.\nYou can also search each tab by item name to further filter your results.\nHome Decoration\nFurnishings are a new kind of inventory item that may be placed in a home, and can be identified by the word \u201cFurnishing\" on their tooltip. These function like any other inventory item until it is time to place them in a home.\nAfter you enter a home you own, you can enter the housing editor and start placing furnishings.\nOnce placed, a furnishing is removed from your inventory or bank and is stored in the house, counting towards the maximum number of items that can be placed in the home.\nYou can see how close you're getting to the item limit in the House Information panel of the Housing Editor. From there, you can see the current and maximum value for Furnishings and Collectibles.\nYou can place each object at any location and at any angle. The only limitation beyond the Furnishing caps is there is a small safe area near the main entrance which cannot be filled with items.\nNote that certain furnishings such as chairs and crafting stations may not be usable if placed at an unusual location or orientation (you'll know if an item usable if it highlights green).\nIn addition to furnishing items, you can also place assistants, mounts, non-combat pets, and a new category of furnishing collectibles called Trophies that includes Undaunted Busts.\nThere are separate limits for furnishings, furnishing collectibles, and other collectibles such as pets or mounts.\nSpecialty Furnishings\nMany types of housing objects have additional functionality when placed, including the following:\nAssistants\nAny of the currently-available Assistants (Nuzhimeh the Merchant, Pirharri the Smuggler, and Tythis Andromo the Banker) can be placed in your home, and will offer their services to you and visitors as normal.\nLight Sources\nObjects such as torches, braziers, and lamps can be lit or extinguished at will after being placed.\nSeating\nMany chairs, thrones, benches, pews, stools, and other seating objects throughout Tamriel are now interactive. You just need to approach the furniture and interact with it to sit down, provided there is room and the furniture is placed in an accessible location.\nThis applies to seating placed in homes as well as those found in the world.\nSeating objects that aren't placed in a level, open area may not be valid for interaction.\nTarget Skeletons\nA Target Skeleton can be used to practice with new weapons and abilities, or to practice combat in general. It does not fight back, but is a resilient opponent, roughly as difficult to put down as the second boss from Veteran Spindleclutch II (Bloodspawn).\nFor those who want a more resilient opponent, there is a Robust variant available that has roughly twice as much health.\nTo learn to craft a Target Skeleton, you can purchase the plan from Rolis Hlaalu, the Mastercraft Mediator in each alliance capital, in exchange for Writ Vouchers.\nWrit Vouchers are obtained through Master Writs, and Rolis Hlaalu will appear after you start or complete a Master Writ. You can find the description for these below.\nCrafting a Target Skeleton requires one or more Animus Stones in addition to a variety of other ingredients.\nThe Animus Stone is a new crafting material that is also available in exchange for Writ Vouchers.\nShortly after being defeated, the Target Skeleton will reform itself automatically.\nAfter fighting a Target Skeleton, you will get a report in your chat log that indicates your damage per second as well as the length of the fight.\nGuild Reprints of Shalidor's Library\nAfter you complete a collection from Shalidor's Library, a Mages Guild reprint of that collection will be available on any Mystic for a moderate fee.\nEach reprint contains individual volumes of every book in that collection. These reprint volumes can be placed in your home, and you or your guests can read them at any time.\nReading a reprint volume does not grant Mages Guild reputation or progress towards Shalidor's Library--only the original version of a book counts for that!\nStandard Crafting Stations\nCrafting stations can be purchased from Rolis Hlaalu, the Mastercraft Mediator, for a moderate number of Writ Vouchers.\nOnce placed in the home, these can be used like any other crafting station.\nNote: Crafting stations will not work if placed at an angle or inside other objects.\nMutable Crafting Stations\nMutable Crafting Stations can be purchased from Rolis Hlaalu, the Mastercraft Mediator, in exchange for Writ Vouchers.\nThese items can be activated at any item set crafting site in the world, permanently attuning the station to the unique energies of that item set and binding the station to you.\nOnce attuned, the station can be placed as a furnishing in your home and used by you and your guests to craft items from the set it is attuned to.\nUnique Objects\nThere is also a variety of unique objects, from Dark Anchor Pinions that open and close, to decoy Elder Scrolls that swap between offensive and defensive visual effects, all with their own unique interactions and effects.\nAs time goes on, expect us to expand this category!\nFurnishing Sourcing\nHome furnishings can be found from a number of sources, including:\nFurnishing Crafting\nSee the Furnishing Crafting section below this one for the juicy details!\nLuxury Furnisher\nA new NPC, Zanil Theran, can be found in the Hollow City within Coldharbour over the weekend and has a cycling inventory, similar to Adhazabi Aba-daro the Golden in Cyrodiil.\nLook for Zanil Theran inside \u201cCicero's Food &amp; General Goods\" when he sets up shop!\nAchievement Furnishers\nSome items are gated by a specific achievement or accomplishment, and are themed to those requirements.\nCompleting the requirements listed on the item will allow you to purchase copies of the item for gold or AP.\nThese can be found throughout Tamriel, including in Cyrodiil, and offer rewards for various heroic deeds.\nIn addition, several pre-existing merchants will offer achievement furnishings related to their specialties.\nEach item is bind on pickup.\nHome Goods Furnishers\nThese merchants can be found throughout Tamriel in each alliance's main city and all capitals, and offer a number of basic home commodities as well as local plants and natural stone from the region they are located in.\nPurchase Tab in Housing Editor\nFurnishings purchased from the Housing Editor are bound to your account, but may be moved to other homes that you own.\nThese items are purchased for crowns, and cannot be sold for gold.\nUndaunted Busts\nBeginning with Homestead, the final boss of each Veteran Dungeon, Trial, or Arena will drop a collectible bronze bust of one of the iconic monsters from that piece of content.\nBusts are account-wide collectibles, and can be placed once in each owned home.\nBusts from Trials and Arenas include a marble stand.\nThere are a total of 34 Undaunted Busts available in Homestead.\nFishing\nThough rare, you may catch aquatic-themed decorations while fishing at a fishing hole.\nThese decorations will differ based on the type of fishing hole \u2013 some things come from the ocean, while others come from fresh waters. For example, Starfish can only be found in oceans and not from lakes.\nShadowy Supplier\nThe Shadowy Supplier will rarely award one of a selection of Dark Brotherhood-themed decorations.\nFurnishing Crafting\nYou can now craft furnishings for yourself, your friends, or to sell to others!\nTo craft a furnishing, you will need to obtain a specific furnishing plan, similar to the way existing Provisioning recipes work.\nAll tradeskill disciplines now have a new tab at their respective stations for furnishing plans.\nEach tradeskill has a unique type of plan and primarily uses a new type of material:\nWoodworking Blueprints primarily use Heartwood, from lumber nodes.\nBlacksmithing Diagrams primarily use Regulus, from ore nodes.\nClothing Patterns primarily use Bast, from fibrous plants, or Clean Pelts, from beasts and other sources of leather.\nAlchemy Formulas primarily use Alchemical Resin, from mushrooms and alchemy plants.\nEnchanting Praxises primarily use Mundane Runes, from runestones.\nProvisioning Designs primarily use Decorative Wax, from crates, barrels, and other sources of provisioning ingredients.\nPlans can be found in containers across the world, purchased from certain merchants, dropped from monsters, or even obtained from pickpocketing (or murdering) Tamrielic citizens.\nHigher quality plans will require knowledge from multiple tradeskills.\nExample: An elaborate canopy bed may require rank 9 in the passive skill Woodworking, rank 7 in Tailoring, and rank 3 in Metalworking.\nFurnishing crafting also utilizes several additional types of materials:\nFurnishings in a particular racial style require multiple style items associated with that race.\nYou do not need to know the Motif of a race to learn or craft their furnishing plans.\nRosins, Tempers, and Tannins are often needed for Green-quality furnishings and higher.\nEach plan is unique, and certain special plans may require custom ingredients be located and included.\nAll plans, ingredients, and output items are tradeable.\nHousing Permissions\nYou can choose to allow or restrict access to each of your homes as desired, and may set different permissions for each of your guilds and on a per-individual basis. You can even ban specific individuals, while allowing the rest of a guild access (just in case you want to hang out with most of your guildies, but Tony keeps spilling mead on your favorite rug).\nPlayers with Visitor access may interact with your placed furnishings but may not move anything, whereas those with Decorator access may relocate items freely.\nNote: Other players may not add or remove housing items from your home regardless of their access settings.\nAs a homeowner, you can set a primary residence. This primary residence is used to determine which home is visited when friends or guildmates try to visit your home while you are offline. When you are online, other players may social jump directly to you in any home, provided they have access to that home.\nHomeowners may rescind access to visiting players at any time, resulting in the immediate eviction of that player from their home.\nHousing Achievements\nIn Homestead, you can expect to see a variety of new achievements for everything from decorating your home in a certain way, to learning an impressive number of furniture plans, to beating up Target Skeletons. Of particular note, we've added four new titles:\nClan Father or Clan Mother, awarded for acquiring the Aldmeri Dominion Manor, Serenity Falls Estate.\nLord or Lady, awarded for acquiring the Daggerfall Covenant Manor, Daggerfall Overlook.\nCouncilor, awarded for acquiring the Ebonheart Pact Manor, Ebonheart Chateau.\nCount or Countess, awarded only after you've acquired all three of the titles above.\nList of Homes\nStaple Homes\nInns\nMara's Kiss Public House: As the least restricted seaport in the Summerset Isles, Vulkhel Guard has visitors from across Tamriel\u2014and you're likely to meet most of them hoisting a mug at the Mara's Kiss Pub.\nThe Ebony Flask Inn Room: The Dark Elves may not worship Dibella, but down at the cornerclubs they show that they still know how to have a good time\u2014in their own special way.\nThe Rosy Lion: This inn has always had the reputation of being the safest place in Daggerfall for common citizens in search of illicit services to meet their shadier counterparts.\nApartments\nBarbed Hook Private Room, 11,000 gold: Like every busy port, Skywatch has a seamy underside.

Not to mention an unusual fragrance.\nSisters of the Sands Apartment, 12,000 gold: In Sentinel, the best way to hide out in plain sight is with a private room in the Sisters of the Sands, the town's largest inn.

This compact house at the Baandari Trading Post in Malabal Tor is a bit of Cyrodiil in Valenwood, and just steps away from the fine food and drink at the Silver Moons Inn.\nHammerdeath Bungalow, 65,000 gold: \"It may be small, but at least it's gloomy. And if you enjoy beating up on your friends, like I do, it's right next door to the arena!\" \u2014Goorguk gro-Murtag, Orcish Realtor\nHumblemud, 40,000 gold: A mud house is a constant reminder of the impermanence of life, and that we are but standing waves in the river of existence. But one still wishes it to look nice and comfortable, and decorates accordingly. Of course.\nKragenhome, 69,000 gold: This residence might not be in Kragenmoor's best neighborhood, but if you're looking for classic Dunmeri architecture at an affordable price, this town house certainly fits the bill.\nMoonmirth House, 50,000 gold: A small elevated house on an idyllic plantation in the mild and hospitable clime of Khenarthi's Roost?

He's probably fine\u2014he must be!\u2014but in the meantime, his walled town house in Elinhir is available on an indefinite basis.\nGrymharth's Woe, 280,000 gold: Fine urban living in Windhelm is now available at this commodious town home, which features a lofty main floor, two fireplaces, and a second-floor balcony. Alas, that balcony lacks a railing, which is how Grymharth, after too much mead, came to woe.\nHouse of the Silent Magnifico, 320,000 gold: After the death of his beloved daughter Haruzeh at the Running of the Dunerippers, the Magnifico Z'za retired to his house in Sentinel and never spoke again, spending his last days playing endless games of hammergammon with his trained monkey, Lizard.\nMournoth Keep, 325,000 gold: This fortified household is strong, intimidating, and remote\u2014in short, everything an Orc holds dear.

The local story that the ravens that loiter around the front steps are the revenant spirits of former owners is absurd.\nSleek Creek House, 335,000 gold: All your friends are already nearby in Rawl'kha, yes? Invite them over to have a party at your so-sleek riverside house, with its private garden and over-creek deck. Much sweetness!\nThe Ample Domicile, 195,000 gold: \u201cThis house is a good house, plenty of room for guar! Palisade is strong to keep guar from straying, and many guar can feed in the garden!

The keep comes complete with a lower dungeon level.\nEbonheart Chateau, 3,785,000 gold: A magnificent castle keep, complete with walls, watchtowers, well, fountain, and stable, all dramatically sited on the slopes of an active volcano!

(Purple and Gold)\nWrit Vouchers are a new form of currency awarded exclusively through the completion of Master Writs.\nWrit Vouchers may be redeemed through purchases from Rolis Hlaalu, the Mastercraft Mediator, who also accepts Master Writ deliveries at Writ turn in locations in each of the alliance capitals.\nMore difficult, rare, and expensive crafted items provide more Writ Vouchers on average than their more commonplace counterparts.\nCurrently, you can obtain the following items from Rolis Hlaalu in exchange for Writ Vouchers:\nStyle Items, individual Motif chapters, and the complete book for the Ebony Motif\nA variety of Legendary Furnishing plans\nThe recipe and unique component for the \u201cTarget Skeleton, Humanoid\" and \u201cTarget Skeleton, Robust Humanoid\"\nThe recipe and unique component for Aetherial Ambrosia\nCrafting station Furnishings for each tradeskill, and a dye station Furnishing\nAttunable crafting stations for Blacksmithing, Clothier, and Woodworking tradeskills, which can be used near crafted item set sites to transform them into Furnishing versions of those set stations\nHlaalu Furnisher's Document, a sealed envelope containing a random Furnishing plan of Purple quality\nPlease note that Master Writs only accept pristine, unused items. Bound items cannot be used to complete Master Writs.\nNew Motifs\nUpdate 13 brings four new Motifs for you to collect and craft!\nThe Silken Ring style can be found in the Cradle of Shadows dungeon, available in the Shadows of the Hist DLC game pack.\nThe chapters can be obtained from killing the final boss of the dungeon: rarely on Normal mode, more often on Veteran mode, and a guaranteed drop on Veteran Hard mode.\nThe Style Item, Distilled Slowsilver, can be obtained from killing bosses in the Cradle of Shadows dungeon: rarely on Normal mode, somewhat more often on Veteran mode, and guaranteed from the final boss on Veteran Hard mode.\nThe Mazzatun style can be found in the Ruins of Mazzatun dungeon, available in the Shadows of the Hist DLC game pack.\nThe chapters can be obtained from killing the final boss of the dungeon: rarely on Normal mode, more often on Veteran mode, and a guaranteed drop on Veteran Hard mode.\nThe Style Item, a Leviathan Scrimshaw, can be obtained from killing bosses in the Ruins of Mazzatun dungeon: rarely on Normal mode, somewhat more often on Veteran mode, and guaranteed from the final boss on Veteran Hard mode.\nThe Ra Gada style can now be found in Craglorn.\nThe chapters of the style are rarely available from completing Focus Points, and very rarely found by killing Delve and World Bosses, opening locked Treasure Chests, or following Treasure Maps.\nThe same holds true for the style item, Ancient Sandstone, which is more commonly found from the above-mentioned sources.\nThe Ebony style can now be obtained from Rolis Hlaalu, the Mastercraft Mediator.\nIndividual chapters of the style, or the whole book, can be purchased for Master Writ vouchers.\nThe Style Item, Night Pumice, can also be purchased from Rolis Hlaalu for Master Writ vouchers.\nImperial City Vendors\nThe vendors in Imperial City have had their wares updated!\nThe Tel Var Greater Lockbox Merchant is now known as the \"Tel Var Equipment Lockbox Merchant.\"\nThese boxes now contain armor, weapons, and jewelry for every Imperial City set in all traits except Impenetrable and Nirnhoned.\nTheir prices have also been reduced.\nThe Tel Var Lockbox Merchant is now known as the \"Tel Var Jewelry Lockbox Merchant.\"\nThey now sell Jewelry Boxes for each Imperial City item set; these boxes contain a gold-quality piece of random jewelry from that item set.\nThese jewelry pieces can possess the Healthy, Robust, or Arcane item trait depending on the item set.\nThe Tel Var Armorer and Greater Armorer are now known as the \"Tel Var First Armorer\" and \"Tel Var Second Armorer.\"\nThe First Armorer sells the item sets Black Rose, Meritorious Service, Phoenix, Powerful Assault, Reactive Armor, and Shield Breaker.\nThe Second Armorer sells the item sets Galerion's Revenge, Imperial Physique, Thews of the Harbinger, and Vicecanon of Venom.\nThey both sell armor for the item sets available in Imperial City in Impenetrable directly to you (with no intermediate container item).\nIn addition to the satchels of Alchemical reagents introduced in a previous update, the Tel Var General Merchant now sells the Superb Imperial Reward box, which has been reduced in price. This vendor now also sells Alkahest, as well.\nCyrodiil Vendors\nThe vendors found in the base camp of the alliances in Cyrodiil have changed significantly.\nSome vendors, finding that their wares simply aren't selling very well, have left for greener pastures. They might return in the future when they find new markets to serve.\nThere is now a Regional Equipment Vendor in the base camps of Cyrodiil. These vendors sell \"Zone Bags\" of all Alliances' home zones.\nEach Zone Bag offers a random item from a random item set, otherwise found in that zone. For instance, the Unknown Alik'r Desert Item container might contain an item from the Robes of the Withered Hand, Sword-Singer, or Order of Diagna item sets.\nThe items in the Zone Bags are typically Blue-quality, with a small chance of being Purple-quality.\nEquipment found in Zone Bags will scale to your level at the moment you open it.\nThere is now a War Researcher vendor in the base camps of Cyrodiil. These vendors have taken some of the work of the Siege Vendors, to ease their burdens.\nThe Akaviri Motif chapters, and the Style Items for Akaviri and Alliance styles, are now found in the War Researcher's store.\nAn Enchanter can now be found in the base camps of Cyrodiil. They sell runes in exchange for Alliance Points.\nThe Elite Equipment Vendor's wares have been renamed. They no longer bear the name of Hew's Bane.\nThe vendors found in the capturable towns have had their wares slightly modified.\nThe boxes now list which item sets are available inside them.\nThe prices of the containers have been reduced by 75%.\nBecause of their use elsewhere in Tamriel, we have removed some item sets from the capturable towns' wares and containers. They include:\nArmor of Truth\nBarkskin\nCrusader\nDurok's Bane\nNoble Duelist's Silks\nPrayer Shawl\nRobes of Onslaught\nSergeant's Mail\nTwin Sisters\nQuest Rewards from Towns in Cyrodiil\nThe five towns of Cyrodiil - Bruma, Cheydinhal, Chorrol, Cropsford, and Vlastrus - now offer better compensation for completing their citizen's quests!\nThe quests will now reward AP for completion and a Reward Container that represents the town's wares when captured.\nThese containers have a single item from one of the town's item sets.\nThe item inside may be Green, Blue, or rarely Purple-quality.\nAs Cheydinhal and Chorrol cannot be captured, Cheydinhal sources \"Attacker\" sets and Chorrol gives \"Defensive\" sets from the other three towns.\nThis means that every item set from the towns in Cyrodiil is available from the quest rewards of two different towns.\nDungeon Ready Check\nWe've updated the way the Dungeon Finder forms groups. When your dungeon group is ready, you will no longer immediately be put into a group. Instead, all 4 members of the group will have to verify that they are ready for the dungeon.\nOnce everyone says they are ready, the group will form and be sent to the dungeon.\nIf someone declines or times out, they will be removed from the queue, and the other three members will be placed at the front of the queue.\nThese changes were made to reduce the amount of AFK players entering dungeons, and also give you the option to decline a dungeon group prior to it being formed.\nChampion Point Increase\nThe Champion Point cap has been raised by 39 points (13 in each red/blue/green constellation) for a current total maximum of 600 Champion Points. The Champion Point experience curve has been automatically adjusted with this new cap so earlier Champion Points require less experience and can be earned faster.\nCyrodiil Campaign Changes\nThe Campaigns Chillrend and Skeleton Key will be closing on the Xbox North American megaserver. If you are currently assigned to these campaigns, you will receive a free re-assign, and rewards will be granted out as if the Campaign had ended naturally.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, DARK BROTHERHOOD DLC GAME PACK\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nChampion System\nThe Apprentice\nArcane Well: Fixed an issue where this Champion ability would interfere with some Sacrament Quest secondary objectives.\nMonsters\nChanter Collatinus, Enclave of the Hourglass\nReduced the strength of the guards preceding Chanter Collatinus.\nMinotaurs now correctly count as giants for loot and achievement credit.\nMonster Abilities\nBodyguard\nShard Shield now correctly returns damage to attackers.\nMinotaur\nClobber and Elemental Weapon can no longer be interrupted.\nThe damage from Elemental Pool can no longer be blocked.\nElemental Waves from a single Minotaur no longer strike the same target multiple times.\nFlying Leap now correctly displays an axe thrown to the target location.\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nGeneral\nFixed an issue where Nirnroot and Water Hyacinth would incorrectly appear as pools of water in the Gold Coast.\nQuests &amp; Zones\nKvatch Arena\nYou will no longer hear opening taunts from Order Champions and Knight-Commander Panthius if you are not in the vicinity of the Kvatch Arena.\nQuests\nA Lesson in Silence: Increased the range at which Sermonizer Fithia and her guard will aggro once the event has begun.\nDebt of War: Razum-dar no longer yells loud enough to be heard by everyone in his vicinity.\nWelcome Home: Fixed an issue where Mirabelle's left arm would pop out of place while using her fan. Ouch!\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, IMPERIAL CITY DLC GAME PACK\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nMonster Abilities\nFlesh Colossus\nMiasma Pool no longer causes animations to display incorrectly if the target of the ability is immediately killed.\nNecrotic Hoarvor\nThe damage from Necrotic Explosion can no longer be mitigated by blocking.\nThe damage over time from Vile Bite can no longer be mitigated by blocking.\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nGeneral\nWaxed Apothecary's Parcels can now be quickslotted, and will appear in the Consumables section of the inventory.\nThe Grievous Ward, awarded for completing Imperial City Prison, can now be dyed and re-enchanted.\nRemoved some errant jewelry traits from the Tel Var-purchased boxes in Imperial City. Now, the Jewelry pieces obtained from those boxes will only contain the trait that matches their armor weight:\nLight armor sets will have Arcane.\nMedium armor sets will have Robust.\nHeavy armor sets will have Healthy.\nImperial Physique, being available in all three armor weights, has all three jewelry traits.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, ORSINIUM DLC GAME PACK\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nMonster Abilities\nGreat Bear\nThe following abilities can no longer be interrupted:\nBite\nFerocity\nLunge\nSlam\nBite no longer causes the bear to stop moving.\nLunge can now be cast while silent.\nThe damage from Mitigating Slam has been made more intuitive.\nSlam no longer cancels prematurely if the target moves out of its cone.\nSlam can now be cast while silent, and now threatens a larger area.\nOgre Elder\nFreeze Wounds no longer fails to display an interrupt telegraph when its caster is also the target.\nFreeze Wounds now displays a beam to the healed target.\nOrcs\nOrcs in Rkindaleft no longer stab themselves with mysteriously ethereal weapons while idle.\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nGeneral\nFixed an issue where Nirnroot and Water Hyacinth would incorrectly appear as pools of water in Wrothgar.\nAdjusted the distribution of Maelstrom weapons obtained from the Maelstrom Arena via the Leaderboards and drops.\nPreviously, this was divided evenly by weapon category (Destruction Staff, Two Hand, etc). Now, it is based on the individual item type (Dagger, One Handed Sword, etc), and all damage weapons within the item type have an equal probability to drop.\nIn addition, when a Dual Wield weapon is awarded, you will receive two Dual Wield weapons.\nWe also slightly reduced the drop chance for Healing Staves, Bows, and One Hand and Shields.\nAchievements\nMaelstrom Arena Perfect Run: Updated the text for this achievement to more clearly represent its requirements. The updated text reads \"Complete Veteran Maelstrom Arena in a single attempt, without dying or leaving the arena.\"\nQuests &amp; Zones\nQuests\nInvitation to Orsinium: Fixed an issue if you followed the scent, you could hear multiple versions of Karina and Arusha's VO.\nNature's Bounty: Fixed an issue where grouped player characters could get double credit in specific scenarios.\nQuarry Conundrum: Fixed an issue where the light puzzle would get out of sync while in a group if one player pulled the lever prematurely.\nScholarly Savage: Fixed an issue where the quest pins on the map displayed different text than the actual quest objective while looking for torn pages.\nThe Anger of a King: Talviah will no longer be visible outside after you've entered the Vosh Rakh Council Chamber.\nTo Save a Chief: Bazrag will no longer repeat himself after you leave Fharun Prison.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, THIEVES GUILD DLC GAME PACK\nArt &amp; Animation\nAnimation\nKhajiit eyelids will no longer become distorted when using the Assassin personality.\nFigure\nThe Outlaw Ancestor Silk mask will no longer clip into Khajiit heads.\nThe Darkstride Medium Helm and Mighty Chudan Helm will no longer appear as black when viewed from a distance.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nGeneral\nUnlocking chests during a heist will no longer reveal you from stealth.\nMonster Abilities\nHaj Mota\nBite's damage over time effect can no longer be mitigated by blocking.\nBog Burst now cancels correctly when the Haj Mota leashes during a cast.\nMournful Aegis\nFixed an issue where blocking Binding Strain would cause animations to display incorrectly.\nShattered Harmony now animates correctly.\nSentinel\nFool Me Once can no longer be interrupted.\nStealth Archer\nPoisoned Arrow can no longer be interrupted.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nTrials\nMaw of Lorkhaj\nThe Colossal Sar-m'Athra are no longer vulnerable to crowd control abilities before combat begins.\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nGeneral\nFixed an issue where water skins, Nirnroot, and Water Hyacinth were erroneously appearing as pools of water in Hew's Bane, rendering them invisible and yet still strangely damp.\nItem Sets\nFixed an issue where rings from the Syvvara's Scales and Bahraha's Curse item sets would drop less often than intended, and necklaces from these sets would drop more often than intended.\nFixed an issue where Well-Fitted shields in Maw of Lorkhaj sets were Bind on Equip instead of Bind on Pickup as originally intended.\nQuests &amp; Zones\nQuests\nA Faded Flower: Fixed an issue where Nahrani would not respawn as a follower if your character died in the Weaver's Storeroom.\nA Secret Shame: Using the spirit catcher in a group will no longer increment the quest multiple times.\nForever Hold Your Peace: Fixed an issue in Hulajabad Palace where Cosh could cause the instance to stop functioning.\nPrison Break: Grouped player characters can now share advancement for unlocking the cell.\nSuspects and Sabotage: Stealing the ledger can now be shared among your group.\nThe Long Game:\nGrouped player characters who interact with pass phrase documents at the same time will no longer double-increment the discovery step.\nCompass pins will now work properly inside the Iron Wheel Headquarters.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, BASE GAME PATCH\nAlliance War\nGeneral\nIncreased the AP rewards for quests that direct you to capture resources and keeps.\nCompleting a quest to capture a resource will now grant 1000 AP.\nCompleting a quest to capture a keep will now grant 1500 AP.\nCompleting quests from towns will now grant 250 AP per completed quest, and will also now grant a green-level set item.\nCapturable towns in Cyrodiil now display the status of individual flags on the compass while in the areas of those towns.\nIncreased the base amount of AP for capturing resources to 1,500 AP.\nIncreased the base amount of AP for capturing a keep to 6,000 AP.\nIncreased the base amount of AP for capturing a town to 1,500 AP.\nIncreased the base amount of AP for capturing an Imperial City District to 1,500 AP.\nItemization\nFixed an issue that caused Warhammers of Truth to drop with a Magicka armor enchantment instead of the intended Magicka Absorb enchantment.\nThe containers that source this item are no longer sold, but this change applies to any new Warhammers of Truth that may come from containers previously purchased.\nPyn Virien, found in the town of Chorrol, is now a Weaponsmith and offers the standard selection of goods shared by similar merchants throughout Tamriel. In fairness to her, her cart is still broken, so the news of One Tamriel took a very long time to reach her ears.\nThe Faceless Staff, dropped by The Faceless in Cyrodiil, now has a proper gold value.\nArt &amp; Animation\nGeneral\nYou can now properly dye the Colovian Filigreed Hood and Colovian Fur Hood, obtained from the New Life Festival.\nThe claws of Khajiit and Argonian player characters will no longer be removed when wearing boots from the following armor sets:\nMedium Soul Shriven boots\nMedium Dark Brotherhood boots\nLight Skinchanger boots\nLight Malacath boots\nAnimation\nNPCs will now hold the broom properly while sweeping.\nThe correct mount animation will now play when you get onto the Banded Guar Charger mount.\nFixed an issue where Cyrodiil Menders would not finish their animation when using the ability Shattering Prison.\nFixed an issue where your thumbs would appear to be contorted when opening doors in first-person mode.\nFixed an issue where the face of Varon Davel (located in Deshaan) would shake uncontrollably during conversations.\nFixed an issue where the eyes of some Aldmeri female characters would painfully pop through their eyelids.\nThe proper crouching animation will now be used when you loot a chest or are in the process of lockpicking.\nIf you jump during an emote, the animation will now be much smoother.\nFixed an issue where your facial expressions could get stuck after using an emote. No more angry faces!\nWhen using the /eatsoup emote, you will now actually eat out of a bowl like a civilized citizen.\nBarrel and crate lids will no longer hover above their bases.\nFixed an issue where weapon swapping while on your mount would interrupt your mount's animations.\nYou will now consistently see the fast travel animation after you are dismounted from your mount.\nThe proper animations will now be displayed when you move after switching weapon types.\nFigure\nThe bushy-looking beard will no longer merge with other facial markings when equipped.\nFixed an issue where seams could be visible on the Celestial Bow.\nThe Molag Kena shoulder armor will no longer float or clip through your character.\nThe Nightflame shoulder armor will now have better fitment on smaller-sized player characters.\nThe Celestial Rawhide helmet will no longer contort during combat.\nRemoved a clipping dagger from Bolgrul from the Undaunted Delve Dailies.\nThe Chokethorn Helm will no longer appear as black when viewed from a distance.\nThe New Life Monk's Cap now displays all proper dye channels.\nKhajiit claws will now remain visible when equipping Yokudan medium bracers.\nToe claws on Khajiit and Argonian player characters will no longer clip through Dark Brotherhood medium armor sets.\nAudio\nGeneral\nFixed a number of edge cases where audio wasn't playing properly for certain monsters and player abilities.\nFixed a number of audio-related game crashes.\nPolished the audio for many of the abilities.\nAdded a number of optimizations to improve audio-related performance.\nPolished many locations where the sound and/or music didn't quite fit the space or, in some cases, was missing entirely.\nImproved the audio used by a number of monsters, critters and objects in the world, including turning down the volume of many pets and certain mounts.\nFixed a number mismatched or erroneous text/voice-over pairings throughout the game.\nReduced the amount of screaming your character does when falling.\nImproved and, in some cases, added new audio for a number of quests.\nFixed multiple doors that did not play any audio when using them.\nAdded new combat and boss music throughout the game.\nAdded battle music for Keeps in Cyrodiil.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nGeneral\nAdjusted the Area of Effect damage thresholds for all abilities. The new thresholds are as follows:\nTargets 1 \u2013 6: 100% damage taken with all secondary effects applied.\nTargets 7 \u2013 24: 75% damage taken with no secondary effects applied (formerly 50% damage taken).\nTargets 25 \u2013 60: 50% damage taken with no secondary effects applied (formerly 25% damage taken).\nDeveloper Comment: The goal of these changes is to decrease the effectiveness of players grouping into tight groups in order to spread out damage, while at the same time making sure that AoE abilities are not too powerful.\nReduced the amount of time required to exit combat with another player character to 6 seconds without performing any hostile actions from 30 seconds.\nDeveloper Comment: The goal of this change is to allow players to disengage from battles faster and spend more time on their mounts when moving between objectives. This is our first fix for the issue of being stuck in combat in Cyrodiil, and will be evaluating if any further changes need to be made.\nReduced the maximum amount of Ultimate that can be stored to 500 from 1000.\nThe elemental status effect Chilled now applies Minor Maim to enemies instead of snaring them.\nDeveloper Comment: Since many frost abilities already snared the target, the Chilled status effect was redundant. This change also helps focus frost more towards a defensive option.\nThe elemental status effect Concussed now applies Minor Vulnerability to enemies instead of Minor Maim.\nDeveloper Comment: We've added more personality to the different staff types to make them feel like different weapons. The focus of Fire staves is high single-target damage, Lighting staff is AoE damage, and Frost staff is defense.\nAttempting to Light Attack while you are mounted will now dismount you.\nIncreased the duration of the crowd control immunity buff granted after a crowd control expires on you to 7 seconds from 5 seconds. This will now match the duration of the crowd-control immunity buff granted by Break Free.\nWeapon swapping now automatically unsheathes your weapons before performing the swap.\nFixed an issue where the stun animation would occasionally not display on an enemy when you stunned them with a Sneak attack.\nFixed an issue where the stun from Sneak attacks was not granting the target crowd control immunity after the stun expired.\nFixed numerous ability tooltips for grammar, spelling, and formatting. Any significant tooltip revisions will be called out specifically below.\nFixed numerous issues with abilities displaying incorrect or placeholder icons in your Active Effects window, or with the bufftrackers of various player-made addons.\nFixed an issue where the Heavy Attack animation while using Dual Wield weapons could hitch; it will now appear to be much smoother.\nFixed an issue where casting an ability to quickly dismount was not displaying some or all of that ability's visual effects to other player characters.\nIncreased the Dual Wield Weapon and Spell Damage penalty by roughly 3%. Weapon and Spell Damage while Dual Wielding (without modifiers) is now equal to using a Two Handed weapon.\nFixed an issue where some weapon abilities (Blade Cloak, Volley, and Wall of Elements) could not proc Weapon Enchantments.\nFixed an issue where the friendly heal from some abilities (Rite of Passage, Blood Craze, etc.) could be dodged.\nFixed an issue where weapon swapping to change to an item set or ability set that that granted Max Health was causing unintended drops in resources.\nNote: We are working on fixing this for Magicka and Stamina as well.\nExperience boosting holiday abilities will now overwrite one another. This means you will only ever have one such ability active on you at a time.\nAll experience increasing abilities' durations will not continue to tick down while you are offline. If you log out with time remaining on a character, that time will remain when you log back in with that character.\nFixed an issue where you could use emotes to hide combat actions.\nFixed an issue where you were able to have two Mundus Stone boons at the same time without wearing the Twice-Born Star set.\nFixed an issue where you would occasionally heal for the incorrect amount when damaging a target with a damage shield with an ability such as Strife.\nBuffs &amp; Debuffs\nCreated a new debuff category, Minor Magickasteal. This is a debuff applied to enemies that restores a flat value of Magicka to the attacker every second (400 Magicka every second at CP160).\nDeveloper Comment: This change is aimed at getting players to pay more attention to their resource pools and use abilities in more strategic way. This is the first fix for high-level players having a lot of resources, and we'll continue to evaluate this issue.\nMajor Evasion: Reduced this buff category's dodge chance bonus to 15% dodge chance from 20% dodge chance.\nDeveloper Comment: We wanted to make the damage reduction provided by Major Evasion more in line with Major Resolve and Major Ward. Dodging is very powerful because it also allows you to avoid secondary effects such as stuns and snares.\nMajor Force: This buff category's Critical Damage bonus is now an additive bonus instead of a multiplicative one (consistent with all other Critical Damage bonuses), but its value has been reduced to a 15% Critical Damage bonus to compensate from 30%. Total Critical Damage bonus from this buff remains unchanged.\nDeveloper Comment: We wanted Major and Minor Force to work the same way, without changing the damage bonus these buffs provide. Before, Major Force would multiply your 50% critical modifier by 30% (50 * 1.3 = 1.65). Now, you just add the critical damage bonuses together (50 + 1.15=1.65). The total damage is the same, but now Major and Minor Force use the same formula.\nMinor Force: Reduced this buff category's Critical Damage bonus to 10% from 12%.\nMinor Lifesteal: This category is now a debuff applied to enemies instead of a buff applied to allies. It now restores a flat value of Health to the attacker every second (600 Health every second at CP160).\nDeveloper Comment: Changing the debuff to a flat value instead of a percentage means Lifesteal is now always useful, regardless of how attribute points are spent. This makes it more universally useful for all players.\nDragonknight\nArdent Flame\nBurning Embers (Searing Strike morph): Fixed an issue where Rank IV of this morph was not allowing multiple Dragonknights to apply the Damage over Time component to the same target.\nFiery Grip:\nIncreased the duration of the Major Expedition buff granted by this ability and its morphs to 6 seconds from 2 seconds.\nThis ability and its morphs can no longer be dodged.\nDeveloper Comments: To improve Fiery Grip's reliability, we changed it so the projectile (and subsequent pull/push) cannot be dodged. This ensures that enemies using Roll Dodge or Major Evasion do not cause your Fiery Grip cast to be wasted, and makes the Empowering Chains morph (which pushes you to the target) behave consistently with other charge abilities. Since Fiery Grip is an unusual projectile due to being undodgable and unreflectable, its tooltip has been updated for additional clarity.\nInferno: Fixed an issue where this ability and its morphs would display an incorrect Spell Critical Strike Chance percentage on your character UI after swapping weapons.\nLava Whip: Increased the damage from this ability and its morphs by 5%.\nStandard of Might (Dragonknight Standard morph): This morph now increases your damage done and decreases your damage taken by 12/13/14/15% while standing inside the standard, down from 17/18/19/20%.\nDeveloper Comment: We wanted Lava Whip to hit harder since it's a melee attack without increasing the overall PvE DPS of Dragonknights. To accomplish this, we reduced the bonuses from Standard of Might by 5% and increased Lava Whip by 5%. This gives Magicka Dragonknights a bit more pressure in PvP without increasing their PvE damage.\nDraconic Power\nCoagulating Blood (Dragon Blood morph):\nThis morph now heals for a flat value (scaling with Spell Damage and Max Magicka), with that heal being increased by up to 33% based on your missing health.\nThis morph no longer grants the Minor Vitality buff.\nDeveloper Comment: We wanted to give Dragonknights a more reliable version of Dragon Blood that scaled like other heal abilities in the game. However, it was still important to us that it retained some of the risk/reward of waiting to use it at lower health thresholds. Because there's a base heal value, it's more forgiving when used at higher health, but waiting makes it more efficient. To counterbalance this increased ease of use, we moved the Minor Vitality buff to Green Dragon Blood. This also ensures that Health-based Dragonknights also have a strong morph option as well.\nDragon Blood: This ability and its morphs can now Critically Strike.\nDeveloper Comment: The goal of this change was to bring Dragon Blood in line with other heal abilities in the game.\nDragon Leap:\nThe damage and knockback from this ability and its morphs can no longer be dodged.\nFixed an issue where this ability and its morphs were not granting the caster crowd control, snare, and immobilization immunity while they were mid-flight.\nThis ability and its morphs can now be cast while are you immobilized.\nDeveloper Comment: As part of a consistency pass to define abilities as dodgable or undodgable, Dragon Leap has been made undodgable. Area of Effect attacks should not be dodgable since they blanket an entire area with harmful effects, and should still damage enemies trying to Roll Dodge through it. Since this is an Ultimate ability, we want its activation to be more reliable compared to other charge or leap abilities. Because of this, Dragon Leap can now be used while you are rooted, and makes you immune to such effects mid-leap.\nFerocious Leap (Dragon Leap morph): This morph now deals Flame Damage instead of Physical Damage.\nGreen Dragon Blood (Dragon Blood morph): This morph now grants the Minor Vitality buff as well as Minor Endurance.\nHardened Armor (Spiked Armor morph): Increased the damage shield value granted by this morph to 15% of your Maximum Health from 10% of your Maximum Health.\nIron Skin: Reduced the amount of additional damage you can block from Rank I of this passive to 4% from 5%.\nNote that due to how percentages are calculated, the total damage blocked with this rank remains unchanged.\nDeveloper Comment: Since block values can only be whole numbers, a 5% bonus was increasing block's 50% damage reduction to 50 * 1.05 = 52.5. Then, it got rounded down to 52%. This change helps clarify the proper amount of bonus you get. Note that Rank II of the ability still gives a 10% increase which equates to 55% damage blocked (50 * 1.1 = 55).\nSpiked Armor: Fixed an issue where this ability and its morphs would deal their thorns damage when the attacker procced a Disease or Poison Weapon Enchantment on the Dragonknight.\nVolatile Armor (Spiked Armor morph): Increased the damage of the Damage over Time component of this morph by approximately 20%.\nEarthen Heart\nBattle Roar: Significantly revised this passive ability's tooltip to more accurately describe the values of Health, Magicka, and Stamina it restores based on the Ultimate's cost.\nNote that decimal values will be truncated from the tooltip, so values restored may be slightly higher than described.\nObsidian Shard (Stonefist morph): Fixed an issue where this morph would not fire the heal if the target blocked or absorbed the damage of the initial hit.\nStonefist: Increased the speed of the projectile fired by this ability and its morphs by 100%.\nDeveloper Comments: Since Stonefist is easy to avoid or anticipate with Roll Dodge and Block, we've increased the projectile speed to make it harder for enemies to counter.\nNightblade\nAssassination\nDeath Stroke: Increased the cost of this ability and its morphs to 70 Ultimate from 50 Ultimate.\nDeveloper Comments: With the Nightblade's high Ultimate generation, Death Stroke is available too frequently for how powerful it is. Increasing the cost keeps its current burst potential while making Nightblades think more tactically about when to use it.\nGrim Focus: The Assassin's Will proc from this ability and the Merciless Resolve morph now only scales with your Spell Damage and Maximum Magicka stats.\nImpale (Assassin's Blade morph): Increased the range of this morph to 28 meters at Rank IV from 18 meters.\nDeveloper Comments: Increasing the range on this morph to 28 meters matches the range of other Magicka Nightblade damage abilities such as Strife or Cripple, and makes this morph work cohesively with a ranged ability kit.\nManifestation of Terror (Aspect of Terror morph):\nThe traps summoned by this morph are no longer visible to enemy player characters.\nThe traps summoned by this morph can now fear two enemies instead of one.\nRelentless Focus (Grim Focus morph):\nThe Assassin's Scourge proc from this morph now only scales with your Weapon Damage and Maximum Stamina stats.\nThe initial cast of this morph now costs Stamina instead of Magicka.\nFixed an issue where the Assassin's Scourge proc from this morph was being mitigated off the target's Spell Resistance instead of their Physical Resistance.\nShadow\nAdjusted the order of the Active Abilities in this skill line. They now unlock in the following order:\nVeiled Strike\nShadow Cloak\nPath of Darkness\nAspect of Terror\nSummon Shade\nDeveloper Comment: The goal of this change was to make sure early skills in the trees are simpler and more damage focused.\nPath of Darkness: Increased the damage of this ability and the Refreshing Path morph by 25%.\nShadow Cloak: Fixed an issue where the invisibility from this ability and its morphs was being broken by certain abilities, such as Teleport Strike, Dark Flare, and Weapon Enchantments.\nSummon Shade: The shade summoned by this ability and its morphs now more closely match your racial appearance for Argonian and Khajiit player characters, and will now immediately aggro and attack your target if you cast this while you are out of combat.\nNote that the ability activation still requires a valid target.\nTwisting Path (Path of Darkness morph): Increased the damage of this morph by 32%.\nDeveloper Comments: The goal of this change was to ensure there was an interesting choice between morphs. You can choose to either have more damage, or add a heal component.\nSiphoning\nSoul Shred: Fixed an issue where the Soul Leech synergy from this ability and its morphs could occasionally heal based on a different source of damage than itself.\nStrife: Increased the cost of this ability and its morphs by approximately 38%.\nDeveloper Comment: We increased the cost of Strife because it was so much lower than other similar abilities, such as Lava Whip or Force Shock, while also providing a significant heal. Note that after the cost increase for Strife, it is still much lower than these abilities. This change, along with the changes to Elemental Drain and Siphon Spirit, are targeted at getting players to pay more attention to their resources.\nSorcerer\nDark Magic\nEncase: Reduced the cost of this ability and its morphs by approximately 6%.\nDaedric Summoning\nAdjusted the order of the Active Abilities in this skill line. They now unlock in the following order:\nSummon Unstable Familiar\nDaedric Curse\nSummon Winged Twilight\nConjured Ward\nBound Armor\nDeveloper Comment: We moved the class defining defensive ability up one slot so players who are leveling up can gain access to it earlier.\nIncreased the Physical and Spell Resistance of all Daedric Summoning pets by 100% (18200 resists at CP160, up from 9100).\nBound Armor: Fixed an issue where toggling this ability and its morphs off would dismount you.\nDaedric Curse: This ability and its morphs will now deal their Area of Effect damage even if the target dies.\nRebate: Fixed an issue where Rank II of this passive was restoring less Magicka than intended for player characters at Level 50.\nSummon Storm Atronach: Increased the damage dealt from the pet summoned by this ability and its morphs by approximately 25%.\nSummon Volatile Familiar (Summon Unstable Familiar morph):\nIncreased the duration of this pet's special ability to 8 seconds from 4 seconds, causing it to pulse for two extra ticks of damage.\nFixed an issue where the damage from this morph's special ability was not being increased by Daedric Prey.\nSummon Winged Twilight: Increased the health of the pet summoned by this ability and its morphs by 100% (15889 Health at CP160, up from 7945).\nVelocious Curse (Daedric Curse morph):\nRenamed this morph to Haunting Curse.\nThis morph no longer shortens the duration of the curse to 3.5 seconds from 6 seconds; instead, it causes the curse to explode a second time after an additional 8.5 seconds.\nDeveloper Comment: The goal of this change is to simply the Sorcerer rotation, allowing a Sorcerer to free up some global cooldowns in order to use other abilities while keeping the burst potential for PvP at the same time.\nStorm Calling\nHurricane (Lightning Form morph): This morph now deals 10% more damage each tick, down from 15% more damage each tick. The final tick deals 150% more damage as a result, down from 225%.\nDeveloper Comment: The Hurricane ability provides Major Resolve, Major Ward, Minor Expedition, and AoE damage in a large radius. This ability over-performs relative to other class defensive abilities like Spiked Armor. Stamina Sorcerer damage was also high, so adjusting the damage on this ability brings the Stamina Sorcerer more in line with other abilities.\nLightning Form: Fixed an issue where part of the visual effects for this ability and its morphs were not being displayed correctly when it was recast.\nTemplar\nAedric Spear\nBinding Javelin (Piercing Javelin morph):\nFixed an issue where Rank III of this morph had a 20 meter range instead of a 28 meter range.\nReduced the cost of this morph by approximately 20%.\nDeveloper Comments: As all Weapon skill lines have a 20% Stamina cost reduction passive, we also included this reduction with class Stamina morphs. Binding Javelin and Biting Jabs were missed when this initially happened. Fixing this bug and giving these abilities their correct costs helps Stamina Templar with some of the sustain issues they were having.\nBiting Jabs (Puncturing Strikes morph):\nReduced the cost of this morph by approximately 20%.\nThe damage from this morph can no longer be dodged.\nDeveloper Comments: Changed as part of our overall Area of Effect consistency pass as described earlier.\nBlazing Spear (Spear Shards morph):\nIncreased the duration of this morph to 8 seconds from 6 seconds, causing it to tick damage an additional 2 times; however, it no longer stuns the enemy when it first hits them.\nThe ticking damage from this morph now has the same radius as the initial damage.\nDeveloper Comments: We took the stun off of Blazing Spear and increased its damage over time duration to help differentiate it from Luminous Shard. We want Blazing Spear to be damage focused, and Luminous to be CC focused. Note: We're still working through a solution that makes Luminous feel unique from the other CC abilities, while maintaining the functionality of effectiveness on blocking targets.\nFocused Charge: Increased the speed of the animation played by this ability and its morphs.\nDeveloper Comments: Since there is already a waiting period on charge abilities as you move to close the gap, we have increased the speed of the \u201cleaping stab\" animation that happens once you finally reach your target. This should make Focused Charge feel more responsive and allow you to more fluidly transition into other abilities after completing the charge.\nPiercing Javelin: Increased the speed of the projectile fired by this ability and its morphs by 40%.\nRadial Sweep: The damage from this ability and its morphs can no longer be dodged.\nDeveloper Comments: Changed as part of our overall Area of Effect consistency pass as described earlier.\nSpear Shards: Decreased the time it takes for the spear from this ability and its morphs to land after being cast at the target location to 750 milliseconds from 1100 milliseconds.\nDawn's Wrath\nBacklash:\nThis ability and its morphs now deal moderate damage when they are initially applied to the enemy. This damage does not contribute to the copied damage delivered at the end of the ability's duration.\nIncreased the amount of copied damage by this ability and its morphs to 20% from 18%.\nFixed an issue where damage that was absorbed by a damage shield was not being copied.\nThe initial damage and final damage dealt by this ability and its morphs can no longer be blocked.\nThe final damage dealt by this ability and its morphs can no longer critically strike, and is no longer reduced from Battle Spirit (note that the initial damage and maximum damage limit are both still reduced by 50% from Battle Spirit).\nThe copied damage from this ability and its morphs is now increased by 50% against other player characters, reduced from 100%.\nDeveloper Comment: We want to see Backlash as a burst damage ability that you can use in solo PvE or PvP content. To accomplish this, we increased the amount of copied damage. This increase is higher in Cyrodiil to account for both Battle Spirit and the play styles of enemies; enemy players are much harder to hit with 5 seconds of unhindered attacks.\nMaking the damage unblockable ensures it behaves consistently when compared to Daedric Curse. Both those abilities are similar in functionality and how they thematically apply their damage. This also ensures that Backlash is not double penalized by block, since some of the damage it copies will likely be blocked or avoided by enemies seeking to minimize Backlash's final attack. Hitting the maximum damage limit against another player now requires a significant amount of uninhibited damage from the Templar, and enemies will have more counterplay in reducing Backlash's burst damage if they actively mitigate or avoid damage.\nChanging Backlash's final damage so it no longer critically strikes prevents the Templar from reaching the damage cap too easily with a high Critical Strike rating.\nEclipse:\nThis ability and the Total Dark morph can now be placed on an unlimited amount of targets.\nThis ability and its morphs will now deal their Area of Effect damage even if the target dies.\nPower of the Light (Backlash morph): Fixed an issue where this morph's damage was being mitigated on the target's Spell Resistance instead of their Physical Resistance.\nRadiant Destruction: Decreased the damage from this ability and its morphs by approximately 21%.\nDeveloper Comment: The damage of Radiant Destruction was so high that players were able to cast this on targets with high health values and still deal effective damage. This change makes it more important to use the ability at the correct time. In PvP, other players now have more time to react, and in PvE the rotation requires using multiple abilities for a longer period of time.\nRestoring Light\nHealing Ritual: This ability and its morphs no longer heal the casting Templar for an additional 30%.\nHonor the Dead (Rushed Ceremony morph): Fixed an issue where this morph's refund bonus was not occurring if you healed the target to above 75% Health.\nLingering Ritual (Healing Ritual morph):\nRenamed this morph to Hasty Prayer.\nThis morph no longer applies a small burst of healing after 8 seconds. Instead, it allows you to move and cast the ability at full speed.\nRadiant Aura (Restoring Aura morph): This morph now increases the radius of the Minor Magickasteal to 25/26/27/28 meters.\nRestoring Aura: Redesigned this ability and the Radiant Aura morph so they continue to grant the Minor Recovery buffs (Fortitude, Endurance, and Intellect) while slotted. Activating this ability also now applies Minor Magickalsteal to all enemies in a 12 meter radius around you.\nRitual of Rebirth (Healing Ritual morph): This morph no longer decreases the cast time of the ability by .2 seconds. Instead, it now fires an additional single-target heal after the cast is complete to one ally outside the ability's normal radius.\nDeveloper Comment: The change to Ritual of Rebirth and Lingering Ritual improves the mobility of Templar healers and meshes better with our high mobility gameplay.\nWeapon\nTwo Handed\nAdjusted the order of the Active Abilities in this skill line. They now unlock in the following order:\nUppercut\nCritical Charge\nCleave\nReverse Slash\nMomentum\nDeveloper Comment: This change is aimed at newer players. Our intention for this weapon line and the ones below is getting players into the habit of using their primary damage ability as soon as possible.\nOne Hand and Shield\nPower Bash: Fixed an issue where this ability and its morphs could not proc Weapon Enchantments or Poisons.\nShield Wall: Fixed an issue where this ability and its morphs were not blocking all the secondary effects from blockable monster attacks.\nDual Wield\nAdjusted the order of the Active Abilities in this skill line. They now unlock in the following order:\nFlurry\nTwin Slashes\nWhirlwind\nBlade Cloak\nHidden Blade\nLacerate: All animations and visual effects will now display properly when using this Ultimate.\nShrouded Daggers (Hidden Blade morph): Reduced the cost of this morph to match its base ability, Hidden Blade.\nBow\nAdjusted the order of the Active Abilities in this skill line. They now unlock in the following order:\nSnipe\nVolley\nMagnum Shot\nArrow Spray\nPoison Arrow\nHawk Eye:\nIncreased the amount of times this passive ability can stack to 5 times from 3 times. It continues to increase your damage with Bow abilities by 2/5% per stack.\nIncreased the duration of the buff granted by this passive to 5 seconds from 4 seconds.\nDeveloper Comments: Increasing Hawk Eye's duration makes it easier to maintain the buff stacks, therefore improving Bow DPS in PvE. The duration is still short enough to reward players using a pure Bow-focused playstyle, without buffing builds that only use Bow to throw down Volley and Poison Arrow.\nRapid Fire: The bow and arrow used for this ability will now point in the same direction.\nDestruction Staff\nAdjusted the order of the Active Abilities in this skill line. They now unlock in the following order:\nForce Shock\nWall of Elements\nDestructive Touch\nWeakness to Elements\nImpulse\nElemental Storm:\nFixed an issue where this ability and its morphs could occasionally cause your ground-target reticle to become stuck and prevent you from using other abilities.\nReduced the damage for this ability and its morphs by 5%.\nReduced the damage done by this ability and the Eye of the Storm morph by 10%. The damage from Elemental Rage remains unchanged.\nDeveloper Comments: The size of this ability coupled with the mobility of Eye of the Storm has made it extremely potent in PvP without allowing enough counterplay. Due to this, we've reduced the base damage but allow you to regain that damage by selecting the Elemental Rage morph. This is similar to previous changes we made to Force Shock and Uppercut \u2013 you'll now be choosing between extra damage or extra utility.\nAncient Knowledge: This passive ability no longer decreases the cast time of your Destruction Staff Heavy Attacks by 5/10%. Instead, it grants you a bonus as long as you have one Destruction Staff ability slotted. This bonus depends on your staff type:\nFlame Staves: Increases your single-target damage dealt by 4/8%.\nFrost Staves: Increases the amount of damage you Block by 10/20%, and reduces the cost of Block by 15/30%.\nLightning Staves: Increases your Area of Effect damage dealt by 4/8%.\nElemental Drain (Weakness to Elements morph): This morph no longer restores a flat value of Magicka whenever you deal Flame, Frost, or Shock Damage to the target. Instead, it applies Minor Magickasteal to them.\nElemental Ring (Impulse morph): This morph no longer adds a small Damage over Time component to the ability. Instead, it allows you to cast the ability at a ground-targeted location up to 28 meters away.\nForce Shock: This ability and its morphs can no longer be reflected. Beam-type attacks cannot be reflected, but are able to be blocked.\nTri Focus:\nThis passive ability now taunts the enemy after you use a fully-charged Frost Heavy Attack.\nThis passive ability now causes your block to drain Magicka (instead of Stamina) and stops your Magicka Recovery (instead of Stamina Recovery) while blocking when you have a Frost Destruction Staff equipped.\nDeveloper Comment: With these changes and the updates to Ancient Knowledge, we're giving Frost Staves the capability of being used by tanks. This opens up a lot of new possibilities and builds we're excited to see for both PvP and PvE content. We'll be heavily monitoring the effectiveness of Frost Staff tanking in both types of content to determine if further changes are needed.\nTo ensure Frost Staff tanking can be used as soon as you can enter dungeons at level 10, we've put a taunt on the heavy attack; this means you don't have to gain ranks with the Undaunted faction to start experiencing this playstyle. This does have the potential to cause issues with players who have Tri Focus and are doing DPS with a Frost Staff. We're aware of this potential issue and will make adjustments in the future as needed.\nRestoration Staff\nForce Siphon: This ability and its morphs no longer heal for a flat value of Health whenever you deal damage to the target. Instead, they apply Minor Lifesteal to a target.\nRegeneration: Fixed an issue where this ability and its morphs were not correctly prioritizing low-health targets that did not already have the Heal over Time applied.\nSiphon Spirit (Force Siphon morph): This morph no longer restores 1% of your Maximum Magicka when you deal damage to the target. Instead, it also applies Minor Magickasteal to the target.\nArmor\nHeavy Armor\nRapid Mending: This passive now increases the amount of resources your Heavy Attacks restore by 12/25% from 25/50%.\nDeveloper Comments: Part of the counterplay against a Heavy Armor enemy is to stop attacking them for a short period (to drop their Wrath stacks and not trigger their Constitution passive), but Rapid Mending made it so they could still restore a significant amount of resources, even if you were trying to avoid them. Reducing this should ensure Heavy Armor is more about constantly taking damage to maximize its strengths.\nWrath:\nThis passive now increases your Weapon and Spell Damage by 5/10 for each stack, down from 10/20, but it now stacks up to 20 times, up from 10 times.\nReduced the duration of this passive's bonus to 5 seconds from 6 seconds.\nDeveloper Comments: Shortening Wrath's duration and allowing it take longer to build up its stacks to its full potential should allow more counterplay against Heavy Armor enemies, and take them longer to ramp up their power when engaging in combat. This also helps promote a berserker-type playstyle with Heavy Armor where you get more powerful the longer you stay in combat.\nWorld\nSoul Magic\nSoul Strike: Removed 350 milliseconds of empty channeling time without another tick of damage occurring from this ability and its morphs. Total damage dealt with these abilities remains unchanged.\nVampire\nClouding Swarm (Bat Swarm morph): This morph no longer causes your character to pulse invisibility every second it is active. Instead, activating the swarm now allows you use the ability again to instantly teleport to an enemy up to 22 meters away and deal high damage. This teleport can be used as many times as possible within the swarm's duration.\nWerewolf\nPursuit: Fixed an issue where this passive ability was being removed when your character died.\nRousing Roar: Increased the duration of the Major Brutality buff provided by this morph to 20/21/22/23 seconds from 4/4.3/4.7/5 seconds.\nGuild\nFighters Guild\nCircle of Protection: Increased the duration of this ability and the Ring of Preservation morph to 20 seconds from 10 seconds.\nRearming Trap (Trap Beast morph): Decreased the damage done by each trap summoned from this morph by 30%.\nTurn Undead (Circle of Protection morph): Increased the duration of this morph to 24 seconds from 12 seconds.\nMages Guild\nBalance (Equilibrium morph): Increased the duration of the Major Resolve and Major Ward buffs granted by this morph to 20 seconds from 4 seconds.\nFire Rune: Increased the initial damage done by this ability and its morphs by approximately 11%.\nMagelight:\nActivating this ability while you have a Restoration Staff equipped will no longer break its animations.\nFixed an issue where the permanent Major Prophecy buff from this ability and its morphs was removing other temporary sources of Major Prophecy.\nScalding Rune (Fire Rune morph): Increased the damage of the Damage over Time component of this morph by an additional 33%.\nUndaunted\nBlood Altar: Due to the changes to Minor Lifesteal outlined below, this ability and its morphs now apply Minor Lifesteal to all enemies within the radius instead of allies within the radius.\nTrapping Webs: Fixed an issue where this ability and its morphs would Critically Strike based on your Spell Critical instead of your Weapon Critical.\nAlliance War\nEmperor\nMonarch: Fixed an issue where this passive ability was only increasing the healing received from your own heals instead of all heals.\nSupport\nRevealing Flare: Reduced the cost of this ability and its morphs by 50%.\nStalwart Guard (Guard morph): Fixed an issue where the permanent Minor Force buff from this morph was removing other, temporary sources of Minor Force.\nChampion System\nThe Atronach\nRiposte: Fixed an issue where this Champion ability was triggering 100% of the time when you blocked a melee attack instead of 15% of the time.\nThe Lady\nUnchained: This ability now reduces the cost of a single Stamina ability by 80% for 5 seconds instead of reducing the cost of all Stamina abilities used within 3 seconds by 80%.\nDark Anchors\nOzozzachar can no longer be targeted while landing, and now takes reduced damage until he has fully recovered from the landing sequence.\nXivkyn, Grievous Twilight, and Flesh Colossus now award experience when killed.\nMonsters\nMonsters that use potions will now display an interrupt telegraph earlier.\nFixed numerous issues where icons associated with monster abilities were displayed on your Character UI without a purpose.\nMonster Abilities\nBloodfiend\nYou'll now hear an audio effect when Flurry and Slash strike their targets.\nBone Colossus\nBone Colossus abilities now cast while silent.\nBone Colossus area effects now threaten the indicated area (previously there was a mismatch).\nBone Saw is no longer attempted when no targets are available.\nSkeletons summoned by Wake the Dead now scale with the difficulty of the summoner.\nBonecrafter\nBone Surge has been made more effective.\nBonelord\nBone Cage now correctly deals damage, and can be cast multiple times while in combat.\nBone Cage now vanishes with the first root it applies.\nBonelord abilities now cast while silent.\nMitigating Entropic Bolt has been made more intuitive.\nUndead creatures summoned by Summon Abomination now scale with the difficulty, faction, and location of the summoner. Bonelords are now vulnerable while a summon is active.\nDreadweaver\nDark Shade now scales with the difficulty, race, and location of the summoner. Dreadweavers are now vulnerable while a dark shade is active.\nDark Shades now apply Minor Maim with each hit and deals Magic damage.\nDreadweaver abilities now cast while silent.\nEviscerator\nDragonknight Standard now casts while silent and also has a cast time.\nDragonknight Standard now interfaces correctly with Major Defile (previously it would stack with other sources of Major Defile).\nFocused Charge has been replaced with Blink Strike.\nEviscerators no longer attempt to use Dragonknight Standard on player characters standing in a Dragonknight Standard.\nFear Mage\nReduced the cast time for Aspect of Terror.\nAspect of Terror now causes targets to flee if they are farther than 15 meters from the Fear Mage.\nFear Mage abilities now cast while silent.\nShadow Cloak now behaves like the player ability Shadow Cloak and will be used when a target is in proximity to the mage.\nFrost Imp\nAttacks made by Frost Imps no longer invisibly damage you.\nFrost Mage\nIce Barrier can no longer be interrupted.\nHarvester\nBlack Winter now casts while silent, and now strikes targets once every half second, up from once every second.\nFeast now waits a moment before traveling to the Harvester.\nMitigating Chasten has been made more intuitive.\nLamia\nHarmony no longer severely reduces incoming damage for the duration of the channel, instead doubling Spell and Physical Resist for the duration of the effect if it is not interrupted.\nHarmony now highlights those under its effects.\nHowling Strike now damages all targets in a cone.\nLamia Curare\nThe heal from Convalescence has been made more effective.\nConvalescence no longer targets monsters with over half health, and now prioritizes targets with low health.\nLamia Curare abilities now cast while silent.\nSpectres summoned by Summon Spectral Lamia now scale with the difficulty, faction, and location of the summoner. Lamia Curares are now vulnerable while a summon is active.\nStrike is now used on targets within melee range (instead of Shockwave).\nMage Guard\nShock Torrent now interfaces correctly with the player ability Shadow Cloak.\nNecromancer\nCreatures summoned by Summon the Dead now scale with the difficulty, faction, and location of the summoner. Necromancers are now vulnerable while a summon is active.\nEmpower Undead now increases the Physical and Spell Resistance of the target instead of reducing the damage received by the target.\nEmpower Undead now more reliably boosts a target's attributes (previously, it would occasionally make the creature less powerful).\nNecromancer abilities now cast while silent.\nNereid\nAvoiding the damage from Icy Geyser has been made more intuitive.\nFrost Bolt can no longer be interrupted, and also now casts while silent.\nHurricane no longer attempts to target objects outside its area of effect, and also now casts while silent.\nThe snare from Hurricane now displays the snare visual effects.\nInterrupting Hurricane now puts the ability on cooldown.\nIcy Geyser has the following changes made:\nThe ability can no longer be interrupted by circle-strafing the nereid.\nReduced the time Icy Geyser can be attempted to 8 seconds from every 20 seconds.\nThis ability no longer allows the caster to move while its cast is in progress.\nThis ability now casts while silent.\nThis ability now tracks the targeted player character briefly before choosing its location.\nMitigating the damage from Frost Bolt has been made more intuitive.\nPet Ranger\nCreatures summoned by Call Ally now scale with the difficulty, faction, and location of the summoner. Pet Rangers are now vulnerable while a summon is active.\nRoll Dodge now casts while silent.\nTrap Beast can now cast multiple times in a single combat, and now casts while silent.\nTrap Beast now has an arming time and accurately messages who it affected and for how long.\nShaman\nAura of Protection can now resummon after it is destroyed.\nMitigating Coiled Lash has been made more intuitive.\nSpider Daedra\nLightning Onslaught will now threaten you more predictably.\nLightning Storm now targets crowd controlled player characters. Previously, this was limited to player characters affected by Spiderling webs.\nSpider Daedra abilities now cast while silent.\nSpiderlings summoned by the ability Summon Spiderling now scale with the difficulty and location of the summoner.

It's much safer and easier this way.\nYou will now utilize stolen materials when crafting before consuming materials from the Craft Bag.\nAn ore node north of the Quendeluun Wayshrine in Auridon was previously buried too deep to be seen, but could still be mined. The ore node has now been moved to the surface, where it can be both seen and mined with greater ease.\nFixed an issue that caused Orzorga's Red Frothgar to appear twice in the Brew tab of Provisioning stations.\nRenamed all Motif Books to a new, more compact naming schema. This prevents motif names from being truncated on the item, and standardizes all of their nomenclature. No longer shall some books say \"Ch.,\" while others say \"Chapter.\"\nFor example, \u201cCrafting Motifs 15: Dwemer\" will now be \u201cCrafting Motif 15: Dwemer Style,\" and \u201cCrafting Motifs 15, Chapter 1: Dwemer Axes\" will now be \u201cCrafting Motif 15: Dwemer Axes.\"\nAlchemy\nFixed an issue that caused potions of Vitality or Defile to incorrectly compete with the Minor Protection buff.\nFixed an issue that caused crafted Ravage Health poisons to deal roughly twice as much damage as intended over their full duration.\nFixed an issue where the tooltip duration for potions would not change after acquiring the \"Medicinal Use\" passive.\nReduced the duration of Major Vitality from potions.

This made the Feet items rarer than intended.\nCollectibles\nUpdated the Acquire Hint for some Collectibles that could be obtained from various pre-orders, purchases of other products, or contests and giveaways.\nItemization\nSpirit Stones, used in the Tombs of Na-Totambu in Craglorn, now identify as \"Key\" type items in their tooltip.\nFixed an issue that allowed non-Destruction Staff weapons to occasionally drop with the Destruction Master set from the final encounter of Dragonstar Arena.\nBogdan's Flame, a uniquely-named Inferno Staff found in Elden Hollow II, is no longer part of the Light Speaker item set, which requires use of Restoration Staff abilities. It is instead now part of the Undaunted Bastion set.\nFixed an issue where Skoria's Charred Claymore would always drop at Purple quality, regardless of the dungeon's difficulty. It now only drops in Purple quality if you play City of Ash II on Veteran mode, and correctly drops in Blue quality on Normal mode.\nThe Prismatic weapons obtained by completing the Fighters Guild quest \"Will of the Council\" are now Bind on Equip instead of Bind on Pickup.\nFixed an issue where items in the Lord Warden item set had the incorrect default Enchantment. Heavy items now have Health, Medium items have Stamina, and Light items have Magicka, as with other Monster Mask item sets.\nFixed an issue where many item sets, including those found on vendors from capturing towns in Cyrodiil, were sourcing Rings and Necklaces at a 50/50 ratio. They are now sourcing Rings more often than Necklaces, as originally intended.\nFixed an issue where some items in the Shadow Dancer's Raiment item set did not drop with the correct default Enchantment. Weapons in this item set now drop with the Absorb Magicka enchantment.\nMonster Itemization\nThe uniquely-named items from World Bosses are now no longer marked as Unique. This means you can have more than one of these items in your inventory at a given time.\nAdjusted the flavor text of the Shadowsilk Headwrap of the Sun to match changes to the boss in Mephala's Nest.\nFixed an issue where the Lord of Iron and Woe, a boss in the Sancre Tor quest area, was not providing level-scaled loot when defeated by a player character below Level 50.\nItem Sets\nItem Set procs which deal damage or healing can no longer Critically Strike.\nFixed an issue with the various aura/ball sets (Ebony Armory, Hircine's Veneer, Worm's Raiment, and Sanctuary) where they were not applying their bonuses correctly if you weapon swapped while using weapons of those sets.\nFixed an issue where some item set procs that were meant to fire off of fully-charged Heavy Attacks (such as Sunderflame or Wise Mage) were firing on every tick of a Lightning or Restoration Staff Heavy Attack.\nArmor of the Trainee: Reduced the Max Magicka, Stamina, and Health granted by this item set to 1250 from 2500.\nDeveloper Comments: Armor of the Trainee was meant as an introductory set that required no advanced strategy to utilize. The attributes it was providing were too high as you could get the same amount of Stamina that Draugr Hulk's 5-piece provided, as well as significant Magicka and Health bonuses. This set will now provide less Stamina than the Draugr Hulk 5-piece, but more overall stats.\nBahraha's Curse: Fixed an issue where this item set's proc could not fire from Light or Heavy Attacks.\nBlack Rose:\nThis item set's 4-piece bonus now grants Maximum Magicka instead of Maximum Stamina.\nThis item set now increases the Magicka or Stamina restored by the Constitution passive by 35%, down from 40%.\nDeveloper Comments: Black Rose was too powerful with how much more resources it gave to the Constitution passive. Reducing this bonus slightly keeps the set viable, and balances it better against other Heavy Armor options.\nChokethorn: The strangler summoned by this item set now despawns when it dies.\nDeveloper Comments: This should make all summoned monsters consistent in how they despawn when they expire. We want summoned monsters to be removed immediately for better visual fidelity and game performance.\nDesert Rose: Increased this item set's proc chance to 15% from 10%, but also increased its cooldown to 4 seconds from 1 second.\nDeveloper Comments: Due to this item set having a low cooldown, the Magicka restored by its proc was very high in situations where you were taking lots of incoming hits every second. Increasing the cooldown but also increasing the proc chance maintains the current level of Magicka returns when you are taking one hit every second, but keeps it from being extremely overpowered when you were taking multiple hits every second. The Magicka returns of this set will still remain higher than any other item set in heavy combat situations.\nDraugr Heritage: Fixed an issue where this item set's proc could trigger before you fell below 35% Health.\nDreamer's Mantle: Fixed an issue where this item set's proc could trigger before you fell below 35% Health.\nElf Bane: Fixed an issue where this item set's bonus was not increasing the duration of many Flame Damage abilities including Magma Armor, Fire Storm, and Wall of Fire.\nEngine Guardian: The Dwemer Sphere summoned by this item set's proc now despawns when it expires.\nInfernal Guardian: Fixed an issue where this item set's proc would remove stealthed enemies from Sneak or invisibility. We also fixed an issue where this item set's proc was ignoring line of sight.\nHist Bark: Fixed an issue where the Major Evasion proc granted by this item set could become permanently applied in rare circumstances.\nKnight-Errant: This set, found in Blackheart Haven, no longer drops on weapons other than one-handed weapons and shields.\nKyne's Kiss: This bow-specific set will no longer appear for weapons other than bows.\nMaelstrom Destruction Staff Enchantment: Fixed an issue where this enchantment was not granting you a damage bonus for your Light Attacks.\nMaw of the Infernal: The Daedroth summoned by this item set now despawns when it dies.\nMeritorious Service: Fixed an issue where the proc from this item set was not displaying its visual effects.\nMorag Tong: Fixed an issue where this item set was proccing on some non-damage abilities.\nNoble's Conquest: This item set's proc now applies Minor Vulnerability to the target instead of a generic damage taken debuff, but the duration of Minor Vulnerability has been increased to 10 seconds from 5 seconds.\nScourge Harvester: This item set's proc now provides Major Vitality instead of a generic non-buff category healing received bonus.\nDeveloper Comments: Being able to stack the Scourge Harvester proc with other healing received bonuses was too powerful. With all those bonuses, enemies could quickly heal back to full health before you had time to back away and snap the tether. This can no longer stack with Major Vitality given by Potions.\nSelene: Fixed an issue where the proc from this item set could trigger twice.\nSentinel of Rkugamz: The Dwemer Spider summoned by this item set's proc can now be interrupted.\nTremorscale: Reduced the damage done by this item set's proc by approximately 10%.\nDeveloper Comments: This set was meant to be a more utility-focused set for tanks with its powerful snare, but it did too much damage in builds (particularly PvP ones) that would spam Taunt abilities to kill targets.\nVaren's Legacy: Fixed an issue where the proc from this item set was only applying to one enemy hit by your area of effect ability instead of all enemies.\nViper's Sting: Fixed an issue where this item set's proc could be triggered by Poison and Disease Damage Weapon Enchantments instead of just melee damage.\nQuests &amp; Zones\nGeneral\nMany books that were once inaccessible after their associated quests are now able to be found in the world. In addition, you can now read most books while in combat or in stealth.\nMany NPCs walking on plants and tables have been brought back to solid ground.\nAlik'r Desert\nRudabeh, the Innkeeper at Sisters of the Sands Inn, has learned some manners and will no longer leap onto the counter.\nFeathered Fiends: Fixed an issue if you spoke to the harpy and took the shortcut back to Kozanset, you would maroon your friends without a harpy to ride back.\nRise of the Dead: General Thoda will now remain standing while speaking with you during this quest.\nAuridon\nDogs can no longer teleport while chasing cats (much to the disappointment of the dogs).\nBlessings of the Eight: Igniting the fires will now be more reliable.\nThe Unveiling: Razum-dar will no longer try to walk through doors by mashing his face into it. Silly Khajiit, that's not how doors work.\nBangkorai\nDayarrus will no longer spawn in the floor.\nBetnikh\nInto the Hills: Renamed the \u201cBloodthorn Dagger\" quest reward to \u201cBloodthorn Dagger of the Trainee,\" as it is part of the Armor of the Trainee set.\nUnearthing the Past: Fixed an issue where quest hints would tell you to \"Retrieve Staff\" even though the event was automatic, making the hint moot. Now there is no hint.\nColdharbour\nBetween Blood and Bone: You can now use the door to the Coral Tower any time after entering it while still on the quest.\nHall of Judgment: Fixed an issue where you could unintentionally avoid aggro during the quest step to defend the Mages.\nLibrary of Dusk: You can no longer speak to Raynor Vanos while he is sleeping.\nSoul Shriven in Coldharbour: Lockpicks are now available in the quest reward for those that want to start their life of crime early.\nSpecial Blend: Nelhilda no longer attempts to stand on the table to make the purifying potion.\nThe Will of the Worm: Thallik's Gem will no longer interfere with jumping while using Gamepad Mode.\nCraglorn\nYou will now be able to zoom out from the Outlaw Refuge map in Belkarth.\nLittle Leaf no longer appears in certain areas after leaving.\nHall Steward Thais in Craglorn is now officially a \"Hall Steward\" and not just a \"Steward.\"\nElemental Army: Fixed an issue where some VO could not be heard.\nSkyreach Catacombs: The Fallen Kings event will no longer occasionally reset.\nThe Shattered and Lost: Defeating The Lost One will now consistently progress your quest.\nCyrodiil\nStacking the Odds: The spy associated with this quest will now spawn and advance the quest.\nPrisoners of War: Captured Rebels are now available for rescuing.\nDeshaan\nThe Wounds in the World: Fixed an issue where the Watcher would stop granting credit when killed.\nEidolon's Hollow: All groupmates will now be able to enter Eidolon's Hollow as long as someone is on the quest.\nEastmarch\nThe War Council: Lord Vurlop will now properly respawn as your follower if your character dies in Fort Amol to guards, gravity, or the sudden onset of extreme old age.\nFighters Guild\nHold the Line: Destroying Dark Anchors can now be shared amongst your group.\nPrismatic Core: Fixed an issue where there could be two portals going to the same location during this quest.\nGlenumbra\nChampion of the Guardians: A Dark Fissure will no longer appear on top of the ritual site.\nSignals of Dominion: Commander Ammur is no longer the source of the Dominion Messages, as they are now locked away securely inside a chest within his tent. As a result, he will no longer spawn as quickly.\nGrahtwood\nCarnival Conundrum: Fixed an issue where there was no map pin for the quest step to take the Akaviri Cultural Infiltration Document.\nThe Innkeeper's Daughter: Fixed an issue where being inside the building Meats, Mimics, and More would not properly direct you out of the door for quest goals.\nUntil Death: Fixed an issue where you could use the dog whistle in a certain spot in Rivenspire. That's way too far away to be useful.\nGreenshade\nSeeks-Better-Deals has gotten rid of her twin, permanently. Now, Seeks-Better-Deals will be available regardless of your quest state in the Shrouded Vale, unless you are in the spirit realm.\nMagister Marthine Augier is now officially a \"Magister\" and not a \"Guildmagister\"\u2014an archaic title that only existed for a brief time within the Mages Guild.\nHold the Line: This quest will no longer erroneously display Malabal Tor in the quest journal when referring to Greenshade.\nRight of Theft: Fixed an issue where compass pins were disappearing when you approached Shadow Rifts.\nStone Cold: Indanas no longer repeats the same thing if you run about Shadows Crawl.\nThe Fading Tree: Laniriel will no longer occasionally despawn at the end of this quest.\nMalabal Tor\nReap What is Sown: Fixed an issue where you would not receive a door pin over the arena gates when you are asked to leave.\nRestore the Silvenar: The door pin to Spinner Caerllin's location will no longer vanish upon entering the trunk of the tree where it is located.\nReaper's March\nBaan Dar's Bash: Five Finger Chicken Dinners can now be shared amongst your group.\nGentle Gardener: Soil Samples and Root Samples can now be shared amongst your group.\nQuestionable Contract: The acquisition of Hoarvor Chitin, Torchbug Thoraxes, and Heartwood can now be shared with group members.\nThe Golden Claw: Rid-Thar-ri'Datta will now properly respawn if he gets stuck for any reason.\nRivenspire\nDarkness Blooms in Rivenspire: Made a clarification in the quest journal that you will not receive credit for killing Fingaenion Forestmasher without eating the moonflowers first.\nThe Emerald Chalice: Lady Laurent will now respawn if you log out at the end of the quest.\nStonefalls\nReadjusted the pins for the Outlaw's Refuge entrance in Davon's Watch in relation to ground level.\nStormhaven\nRemoved a killable NPC that would instantly respawn.\nThe Rift\nEat, Drink and Be Merry: You will now remain in a sleeping position until you talk to Darva or abandon the quest.\nInflamed Pyres of the Rift: You must now have the pyres lit before defeating Jakalor to progress the quest.\nPulled Under: Inspecting the fish rack will now consistently function regardless if a zombie is present.\nStomping Sinmur:\nThalik Wormfather can no longer spawn three copies of himself during the fight with Sinmur.\nFixed an issue where you could not kill Sinmur while Thallik Wormfather was alive.\nUI\nGeneral\nCrafting Motifs now have their own section in the Lore Library, visible upon obtaining Eidetic Memory from Shalidor.\nMade several modifications to the Guild Trader UI:\nAdded options to search for furniture and furniture recipes.\nSearches will no longer clear when you go to a different guild trader.\nAdded a button for \u201cReset Search.\"\nAdded a Furniture section to your inventory.\nFixed an issue where Inventory and Gold amounts would appear twice in the vendor UI.\nYou will no longer hear a sound similar to coins fumbling around if you fail to enter an instance because it is full.\nAttempting to use the \"Get Me Unstuck\" option twice within an hour will once again display the correct amount of time remaining until you can next use it, instead of displaying 0 seconds.\nFixed an issue where the Join Queue button could get disabled when it should be enabled.\nThe Lore Library subcategory for the Order of the Hour motif is now named \u201cOrder Hour\" instead of \u201cHour Order.\"\nFixed an issue where the stack size reported for items sold in the Guild Store would be incorrect if it was too large.\nYou can now rotate your character in the Inventory and Collections screens.\nFixed an issue where item names in the Gem Extraction UI could occasionally turn blue.\nFixed a UI error that could occur when selecting an achievement at the same time as earning a different achievement.\nFixed an issue where the message for leaving a dueling area could continue to appear after the duel ended.\nAchievement progress now refreshes correctly when viewing them as they update.\nFixed an issue where item tooltips could incorrectly reflect the quantity of that item you actually have.\nFixed an issue where zone chat would not display correctly while on certain quest stages.\nFixed an issue that could occur when setting keybindings, where you would receive an error that a key was already bound to an action, without the error specifying which action.\nUpdated the maintenance times in the Customer Support window.\nNote: At this time, this change is only reflected in the English game client.

Battle leveling is a system that applies when you enter Cyrodiil. When you enter a &lt;a href=\"Campaigns%20%28Online%29\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil, regardless of whether that campaign is &lt;a href=\"Veteran\"&gt;Veteran&lt;/a&gt; or non-Veteran, you are always treated as level 50 at a minimum.\nIf you go to Cyrodiil at level 10, for example, you will be battle leveled to 50; your &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Online%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; will be battle leveled too, and heal as though they were level 50 potions. If you level up while in Cyrodill, you would technically be level 11, but still effectively level 50 through battle leveling. Your potions would still heal as though they were level 50 potions.\nIf you gain enough experience to make it to level 20 (hitting the next level bracket), you would still be battle leveled to 50. However, your potions would then be ten levels out of date and become slightly less effective as you move into the next level bracket. Rather than healing you as though they were level 50 potions, they would heal you at a reduced rate \u2013 still decent, but not as good as a level 20 potion.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS\nAlliance War\nAudio\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nCrown Store\nJustice System\nQuests &amp; Zones\nUI\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;\nGeneral\nAudio\nGeneral\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nGeneral\nCrown Store\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Justice%20System\"&gt;Justice System&lt;/a&gt;\nGeneral\nQuests &amp; Zones\n&lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;\nUI\nGeneral"}

It is not found on monsters.\nBoth the Aetheric Cipher and Aetherial Dust are unbound, meaning that they can be traded and sold from one player to another.

It \"felt good, really good,\" so she killed another, unspecified person, and it \"felt even better.\" At some point, she joined the Dark Brotherhood and later married another Brotherhood member, &lt;a href=\"Arnbjorn\"&gt;Arnbjorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nAstrid decrees her authoritarian leadership to be \"stronger\" than &lt;a href=\"The%20Five%20Tenets\"&gt;The Five Tenets&lt;/a&gt;.

Astrid realizes her mistake in thinking she was the sole authority of the Brotherhood by going against the Five Tenets, as \"they have guided the Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose them,\" and as well for leading to the deaths of most of the Brotherhood.

She brings them to an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Shack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;abandoned shack&lt;/a&gt; in the Hjaalmarch swampland and asks them to kill one of three hostages. Regardless of whom the Dragonborn kills, Astrid gives them directions to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, the password to get past &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Door\"&gt;The Black Door&lt;/a&gt; guarding the Sanctuary, and invites them to join her \"family.\"\nShould the Dragonborn choose to kill Astrid instead during this encounter, Commander Maro learns of the deed and tasks the Dragonborn with eradicating the remaining members of the Dark Brotherhood.\n&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Dragonborn has arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; just outside of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, and used the password to get past &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Door\"&gt;The Black Door&lt;/a&gt;, Astrid directs them to speak to &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt; for side contracts the Dark Brotherhood has received until she has an important one for him.\n&lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Never%20Comes\"&gt;Mourning Never Comes&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Dragonborn returns from completing one of Nazir's initial contracts, Astrid tells them to head to &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; to speak to &lt;a href=\"Muiri\"&gt;Muiri&lt;/a&gt; about a big job she has requested of the Dark Brotherhood. Once the Dragonborn returns from completing the job, Astrid asks them how it went before assigning them their next quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Whispers%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Whispers in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nAstrid asks the Dragonborn to spy on Cicero, as she suspects that he is plotting with another member of the sanctuary to destroy the Brotherhood. The Dragonborn obeys, hearing the Night Mother speak and becoming her &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;. Threatened by the Night Mother's choice, Astrid reclaims her authority by sending the Dragonborn on off-handed contracts until she investigates the contract the Night Mother told the Listener.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Silence%20Has%20Been%20Broken\"&gt;The Silence Has Been Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn returns from completing another of Nazir's contracts, Astrid decides that since the Night Mother has spoken and revealed a contact for a contract in &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt; at the Nordic Tombs of &lt;a href=\"Volunruud\"&gt;Volunruud&lt;/a&gt;, she sends the Dragonborn to check it out. Once there, Amaund gives the Dragonborn two items to deliver to Astrid. Once they are delivered, Astrid directs the Dragonborn to speak to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; for more info. Once the Dragonborn returns with a \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Credit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Letter of Credit&lt;/a&gt;\" from Delvin for Astrid, she prepares to carry out Amaund's request: The murder of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, with the first target being his cousin, currently living in Solitude, &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bound%20Until%20Death\"&gt;Bound Until Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a bid to carry out Amaund's hit on the Emperor of the Mede Dynasty, Astrid plans to assassinate the Emperor's cousin, &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt;, during her wedding to &lt;a href=\"Asgeir%20Snow-Shod\"&gt;Asgeir Snow-Shod&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude, which was part of an intended plan to try and broker peace between the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and create a ceasefire in the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, and assigns the Dragonborn to carry out the hit on Vittoria. After Vittoria is successfully murdered, if the Dragonborn's cover was blown, Astrid will dispatch &lt;a href=\"Veezara\"&gt;Veezara&lt;/a&gt; to aid the Dragonborn in escaping the angry crowd of wedding guests, &lt;a href=\"hold%20guard\"&gt;hold guard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20Agent%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus agents&lt;/a&gt; and retreat back to the Sanctuary.\n&lt;a href=\"Breaching%20Security\"&gt;Breaching Security&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Vittoria dead, and word of the Emperor on his way to Skyrim to oversee the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; personally now public knowledge, the next step to assassinating the Emperor was to convince his elite guard, the Penitus Oculatus, that there was no threat to the Emperor's life at the moment, causing them to let their guard down. To do that, the plan was to murder Commander Maro's son, &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Maro\"&gt;Gaius Maro&lt;/a&gt;, and plant an \"&lt;a href=\"Incriminating%20Letter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Incriminating Letter&lt;/a&gt;\" on him to make it look like an attempt on the Emperor's life by the Stormcloaks had already been foiled, and Gaius was a traitor, providing Ulfric and his men all the details for the hit in secret. This would distract Maro and thus reduce the chances of being caught performing the hit on the Emperor later.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cure%20for%20Madness\"&gt;The Cure for Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the return of the Night Mother, Astrid has become more uneasy in her trust of Cicero, feeling like his return of the Night Mother's body to the Dark Brotherhood is threatening her leadership. She dispatches the Dragonborn to deal with Cicero, but in the end, the Dragonborn can either kill or spare Cicero upon confronting him in the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and either lie or tell the truth of his death to Astrid to put her at ease.\n&lt;a href=\"Recipe%20for%20Disaster\"&gt;Recipe for Disaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Cicero dealt with and Maro distracted with his belief that his son was a Stormcloak spy, Astrid now assigns the Dragonborn to locate and kill &lt;a href=\"Balagog%20gro-Nolob\"&gt;Balagog gro-Nolob&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"The Gourmet,\" a well-known and famous Orc chef, using his fame as a disguise to get into Castle Dour to assassinate the Emperor during his visit by poisoning his meal, but also make certain to hide The Gourmet's body so that no one will suspect that the Dragonborn is impersonating him.\n&lt;a href=\"To%20Kill%20an%20Empire\"&gt;To Kill an Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith everything set to carry out the assassination of Emperor Titus Mede II when he is in Skyrim and staying at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, Astrid sends the Dragonborn to carry out the murder, disguised as the Gourmet. However, it turns out that Astrid, fearing that her leadership of the Dark Brotherhood was threatened by the Dragonborn being the new Listener for the Night Mother, betrays them and reports the assassination attempt to the Penitus Oculatus and Maro himself, in return for amnesty and protection of the Dark Brotherhood. As a result, the Dragonborn only succeeds with killing a decoy Emperor. Maro, however, reveals he had no intention of upholding his end of the agreement with Astrid and sends his men to attack the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; after they killed his son to ensure that Astrid and the Dark Brotherhood would not threaten the Emperor any further.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20Incarnate\"&gt;Death Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the attack on the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, many of the assassins of the Dark Brotherhood fell, including Astrid. When she is found, her body is charred and burned beyond recognition. She begs the Dragonborn to kill her by performing &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;The Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;, dubbing the Dragonborn her replacement as leader of the Brotherhood and admitting she was wrong for defying the Night Mother and the Dark Brotherhood's Five Tenets. She also explains that she negotiated with the head of the Penitus Oculatus, Commander Maro, into revealing the identity of the Dragonborn in exchange for political immunity. Maro went back on his word, attacking the sanctuary in revenge for his son. She asks to be killed with her &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt;, but she can be killed with any weapon. After Astrid's death, the Dragonborn and the remaining assassins, including &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Babette\"&gt;Babette&lt;/a&gt;, move to the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt; fled and can still be found if he was spared.\n&lt;a href=\"Destroy%20the%20Dark%20Brotherhood%21\"&gt;Destroy the Dark Brotherhood!&lt;/a&gt;.\nShould the Dragonborn choose to kill Astrid instead of one of the hostages, her death will need to be reported to a guard as soon as possible. Learning of Astrid's death, the Dragonborn will be directed to report to Commander Maro at the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20outpost\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus outpost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to notify him of Astrid's death. Learning of her death, Maro assigns the Dragonborn to head for their sanctuary in Falkreath to wipe the rest of the group out. Once done, Maro commends the Dragonborn for getting rid of the Dark Brotherhood and will report their success directly to Emperor Titus Mede II, thanking them for saving the Emperor from any threat the Dark Brotherhood may have posed to him.\nConversations.\nCicero: \"But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely... punishment?\"\nArnbjorn: \"\"Keep talking, little man, and we'll see who gets \"punished.\"\"\"\nFestus Krex: \"Oh, be quiet you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long journey. You can at least be civil. Mister Cicero, I for one am delighted you and the Night Mother have arrived. Your presence here signals a welcome return to tradition.\"\nCicero: \"Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor.\"\nAstrid: \"You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper. Understood... husband?\"\nArnbjorn: \"Hmph.\"\nCicero: \"Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!\"\nAstrid: \"But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law. Are we clear on that point?\"\nCicero: \"Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss.\"\nAstrid: \"By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been planning is over! Are you all right? I heard the commotion. Who was Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!\"\nCicero: \"I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to him/her! To the listener!\"\nAstrid: \"What? The Listener? What are you going on about? What is this lunacy?\"\nCicero: \"It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been broken! The Listener has been chosen!\"\nBabette: \"Just try to relax, Veezara. Let the elixir do its work. You'll feel better, shortly.\"\nVeezara: \"Achh... Thank you, dear. You are most kind. The jester's cut feels as bad as it looks, I'm afraid.\"\nAstrid: \"Damn it, this never should have happened! We knew better. We knew better, and still we let our guards down. Agh!\"\nFestus Krex: \"\"I'll admit, even I'm having a hard time disagreeing with you...\"\n[After the Dragonborn speaks to Astrid]\nFestus Krex: \"It's true, I'm afraid, Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this way and all that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder us all.\"\nNazir: \"\"Don't forget the ranting and raving. About the Night Mother, how she was the true leader of the Dark Brotherhood, and Astrid was just a \"pretender.\"\"\n[After the Dragonborn speaks to Astrid again]\nVeezara: \"Bested by a fool. Who's the fool now, hmm?\"\nBabette: \"Hush, Veezara. You were very brave. Astrid may well be dead if not for you.\"\nAstrid: \"She's right. I'll be forever in your debt, dearest brother. Now be quiet. Just... just rest.\""}

I now have what I need to return to Apocrypha and face Miraak.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe first step in the quest is to unlock the last two words of the Bend Will shout using absorbed &lt;a href=\"dragon%20soul\"&gt;dragon soul&lt;/a&gt;s. The second step is to read the \"\" in order to enter the Apocrypha realm to face Miraak.\nChapter I &amp; II.\nReading \"Waking Dreams\" (which can be taken back from Storn's body) will transport the Dragonborn to Apocrypha. Just south of the starting platform is a table with a few books including \"&lt;a href=\"Bone%2C%20Book%20I\"&gt;Bone, Book I&lt;/a&gt;\". Just northwest of the starting platform there is a table with a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;. To the northeast of the starting platform is a pod containing &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; loot and other books. Then look directly to the west and find another pod containing leveled loot. Straight ahead and up some steps is a large book that, when activated, transports the Dragonborn to Chapter II.\nUp the stairs are three &lt;a href=\"seeker\"&gt;seeker&lt;/a&gt;s. At the top of the third set of stairs, a ledge against the south wall leads west to a dead end and a pod with leveled loot and several books. Over a longer bridge, just before the last set of stairs in this chapter that lead up to the south southeast, a ledge against the west wall leads north to another pod with minor loot and several more books. Up the stairs to a higher platform, the book \" is on an altar. Taking that book causes a set of stairs on the north side of the room to extend. At the top of those stairs is a ledge overlooking a vast sea with tentacles waving. This ledge contains the book serving as the door to Chapter III.\nChapter III.\nThis section starts with a tunnel leading northeast. A closed gate that cannot be opened is on the right (southeast) side, through which can be seen a scrye. The tunnel splits to the left and right, each side being guarded by a seeker. The left side is a dead end. The right side leads to a set of stairs up to a room with a table against the northeast wall that holds some loot. A pod is adjacent to this, and another pod is at the foot of the stairs west of table; a pedestal with the book \" is nearby the table as well. Taking the book opens the gate back near the beginning of this chapter that was protecting the scrye. Returning to that room and activating the scrye will expand a tunnel ahead to the southeast.\nAt the end of the tunnel is a table with a soul gem, several &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt; and books. Turning right (west southwest), the path leads to a high overlook with numerous bridges leading to closed gates. To the left (south) is another scrye that can be activated, opening a gate to the right of the entrance of the room, in which is a vessel containing books and random loot. The central bridge leads to the far (south) side and a pod with random loot. To the right (west) of the pod is a pedestal with the book \"\". Taking the book causes a gate to open on the west side of the room, which is visible directly past the pedestal, but getting there requires walking around on the bridges. Going towards the newly opened gate and through the tunnels leads to a book that is the door to Chapter IV.\nChapter IV.\nThere is an immediate choice whether to go left (east) or right (west) down steps. To the right, from the first landing down, a bridge to the west leads to a pod with random loot and some books. Either way down leads to several seekers, and eventually to an area of the room with a table against the east wall with some books. The main path leads south from there through a tunnel. The tunnel curves to the left (east) until an intersection is reached near a stone table. One tunnel leads to the right (south), but walking down it causes the entire tunnel to retract. The other tunnel to the east leads to the same retraction. If the Dragonborn then goes back west and south to the original starting location, they can see that the tunnels have shifted to lead to a new area with more seekers.\nA set of stairs up to the southwest leads to a landing with a table (holding scrolls) and a pod (containing a small amount of gold and several more books). Up a second set of stairs to the north is a &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;Font of Magicka&lt;/a&gt; and a pedestal with the book \"\". Taking this book will cause the tunnel to shift again. Back down both sets of stairs, a new tunnel has opened to the right (south). The tunnel curves to the left (east) and leads to an intersection. On the right (south) is a dead end with tables to the left and right with many books. Back at the intersection, proceeding forward (east) into the apparent dead end will cause the tunnel to expand. There are two stone tables - the one on the left has scrolls and a soul gem, while the one on the right has seven books. The tunnel ahead leads to a &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Stamina\"&gt;Font of Stamina&lt;/a&gt;, where it turns left (north), then curves towards the left (west) and leads to another font of stamina. A short bridge leads northwest to a set of stairs where a seeker stands guard. Up the stairs is a table with a soul gem and five books. A bridge and steps lead right (east). There will also be a seeker around this area. The path continues up and clockwise until a scrye is reached. When activated, it shifts the tunnel so that going back down the steps and bridges counter-clockwise leads to another new area (which starts with a ramp up to the north).\nThis area is more open with a large pool in the middle, from which a &lt;a href=\"Lurker%20Vindicator\"&gt;lurker vindicator&lt;/a&gt; emerges. In the northwest corner of the room is a scrye that, when activated, opens a gate in the southwest corner. The tunnel behind the open gate leads north. There is a table at the end on the left side that contains several scrolls, soul gems, and a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt; for the spell &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Seeker\"&gt;Conjure Seeker&lt;/a&gt; (only if the Dragonborn has a &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; level of 40). Straight ahead is a vessel with leveled loot. Back south against the east wall is another scrye that opens a large gate to the north in the main room. Beyond that gate are stairs leading to a Font of &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; and a book that is the door to Chapter V.\nChapter V.\nThe tunnel leads northwest, then turns northeast. It leads to a large dome shaped area with several walkways, several pods with random loot around the edges, and a central glowing structure, all protected by a seeker. Also around the edges of the walkway that encircles the room are &lt;a href=\"%23Gallery\"&gt;pedestals&lt;/a&gt; where the books that have been collected need to be placed. Each pedestal has a clue as to which book needs to be placed there:\nOnce the final book is placed, the central structure opens, and now the book that leads to Chapter VI can be entered.\nChapter VI.\nThis book leads to the summit. Down a short set of steps, it is possible to go left (south) or right (north). Either path ends up in the same place, but going right leads past a table with the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Art%20of%20War%20Magic\"&gt;The Art of War Magic&lt;/a&gt;\" and a soul gem. A tunnel leads up to an open area. In the distance are two seekers studying a word wall. After defeating them and a &lt;a href=\"Lurker\"&gt;Lurker&lt;/a&gt; that appears out of a slime pool, reading the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; will teach a word of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; shout.\nIf all three words of the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout have not yet been unlocked, nothing will happen. If it is possible, unlocking them now the quest should continue. Otherwise reading the \"Black Book: Waking Dreams\" again to leave Apocrypha, completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gardener%20of%20Men\"&gt;The Gardener of Men&lt;/a&gt;,\" or absorbing more &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;s to have enough for the words should progress the quest.\nSuddenly, Miraak's dragon, &lt;a href=\"Sahrotaar\"&gt;Sahrotaar&lt;/a&gt;, will fly overhead and begin a powerful attack. The full power &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout will break his will. He will land and state, \"Hail, thuri. Your thu'um has the mastery. Climb aboard and I will carry you to Miraak.\"\nOnce the Dragonborn mounts him, he will take off and a message will appear to explain how to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Riding\"&gt;ride the dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Sahrotaar cannot be directly controlled in flight, rather guided in a general direction to attack enemies. He will fly over a platform with several seekers and lurkers, giving the Dragonborn a chance to practice attacking. Once they are all dead, he will proceed to the high tower with Miraak. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can command Sahrotaar to land and he will bring them to Miraak.\nThe First Dragonborn.\nDuring the flight to the tallest tower in Apocrypha, Sahrotaar will remark: \"Beware, Miraak is strong. He knew you would come here.\" Upon reaching the tower, Miraak will remark: \"Sahrotaar, are you so easily swayed? No. Not yet. We should greet our guest first.\"\nUpon landing and dismounting Sahrotaar, Miraak begins a short monologue while his other two dragon minions, &lt;a href=\"Relonikiv\"&gt;Relonikiv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kruziikrel\"&gt;Kruziikrel&lt;/a&gt;, sit perched upon the nearby arches:\n\"And so the First Dragonborn meets the Last Dragonborn at the summit of Apocrypha. No doubt just as Hermaeus Mora intended. He is a fickle master, you know. But now I will be free of him. My time in Apocrypha is over. You are here in your full power, and thus subject to my full power. You will die. And with the power of your soul, I will return to Solstheim and be master of my own fate again. Kruziikrel! Relonikiv! Now!\"\nThis can be a very hard battle. During it, Miraak will have to be defeated four times. The first three times he is brought down to low health, he will &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;become ethereal&lt;/a&gt;, teleport to the middle of the arena and use a shout to kill a dragon and absorb &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;its soul&lt;/a&gt;, restoring his health completely. This is scripted and unavoidable, even an attack that should kill Miraak in a single hit will not kill him.\nWhen all three dragons have been killed and Miraak reaches low health again, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; will intervene when Miraak tries to escape again by levitating Miraak in the air and impaling him with a tentacle, killing him. Mora then voices his fury at Miraak for thinking he could betray Mora within his own realm, where Mora knows everything. Miraak then burns up similarly to a dragon, leaving only his skeletal remains.\nHermaeus Mora: \"Did you think to escape me, Miraak? You can hide nothing from me here. No matter. I have found a new Dragonborn to serve me.\"\nMiraak: \"May he/she be rewarded for his/her service as I am!\"\nHermaeus Mora: \"Miraak harbored fantasies of rebellion against me. Learn from his example. Serve me faithfully, and you will continue to be richly rewarded.\"\nMiraak's death marks the end of the quest. Upon his death, five to ten &lt;a href=\"dragon%20souls\"&gt;dragon souls&lt;/a&gt; are gained from him, plus any he stole from dragons the Dragonborn killed. His skeletal remains can be looted for his &lt;a href=\"Miraak%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miraak%27s%20Robes\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miraak%27s%20Boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miraak%27s%20Gloves\"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miraak%27s%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miraak%27s%20Staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, each of the dragons he killed can be looted for &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon bones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon scales&lt;/a&gt; and gold.\nConclusion.\nA structure will then appear out of the central pool with the Black Book on a pedestal. Activating the book will cause several green orbs with one skill tree on each to appear. These orbs allow the Dragonborn's skill trees to be reset. Resetting a skill tree cost one dragon soul and frees up all perk points in that tree for redistribution to any skill tree. This can be done with any number of skill trees as long as the Dragonborn has remaining dragon souls either at this time or by later re-reading \"\" and returning to Apocrypha. Activating the book a second time will return the Dragonborn to Solstheim.\nAfter exiting the book and returning to the &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frea\"&gt;Frea&lt;/a&gt; will ask the Dragonborn whether Miraak is dead. She then asks whether her father's death was necessary. Finally, she will offer advice to the Dragonborn, warning them that &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt;'s path is not compatible with what the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt; intended when he created the Dragonborn. With the completion of the quest, the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Stone%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Tree Stone&lt;/a&gt; can be cleansed and its &lt;a href=\"Root%20of%20Power\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained."}

It is one of the two components of &lt;a href=\"Atakota\"&gt;Atakota&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the myths of the Adzi-Kostleel tribe, there was at first only Atak. Atak knew of nothing but itself, so it decided to be everything. It grew and tried to fill the nothing with itself, and as it grew and formed roots, those roots took names and wanted space to grown on their own. Through this, Atak now learned that there were things other than itself, that went a different way from it.\nAs Atak continued to grow, it encountered the serpent &lt;a href=\"Kota\"&gt;Kota&lt;/a&gt; out of the nothing. Kota had been growing just like Atak, and had become hungry due to growing a mouth. Atak put its roots through Kota's eyes, but Kota was strong and had grown fangs. Kota bit Atak, and through this interaction, they both learned things that the other had learned. Atak bit Kota back, and they continued their struggle for so long that they forgot they were fighting. Thus, they shed their skin and severed their roots and became Atakota. \nEventually, as the spirits tore at Atakota's skin and drank its blood, Atakota broke back into Atak and Kota, and the conflict between the two began anew, though they had now learned about death, so there was a lot of violence. From Atak's sap then came the stones, and Kota's blood made up the oceans. &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt; of Atakota awakened, and since it was bigger than Atak or Kota individually, it decided to eat them both."}

As with most others, the Argonian creation myth tells of the interplay between the Argonian interpretations of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; and the formation of various &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; within it.\nNature and identity.\nAccording to the Argonian creation myth, Atak and Kota coiled around each other until they became a single entity that named itself Atakota, and shed its skin. With Atakota not being in conflict, other spirits could form. After some of the spirits, the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, had no more room to grow, they tore at Atakota's skin and drank of its blood, separating Atak and Kota from each other. Atak and Kota were later devoured by Atakota's &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt;, which was the skin that it shed.\nThe oral traditions of the Adzi-Kostleel tribe of &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt; claim that each of Atakota's scales was a world which it devoured, a detail that shares similarities with &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s role as the World-Eater in &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic mythology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;'s role as the Worldskin, both of whom destroy the world to begin a new one in their respective pantheons.\nAtakota formed from the conflict of the Argonian equivalents of Anu and Padomay, and as such is in essence the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was home to a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; known as Atmorans around the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Atmora was originally settled by &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, as one of their kingdoms. During &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i rule over Atmora, the Atmorans took on worship of &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;. The continent would eventually be split into many pieces when &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; could not save Atmora from the armies of Men.\nClimate.\nExpeditions to Atmora in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; describe a place of permanent winter, with little life and no sign of human habitation. Reports describing the climate before the freezing vary. The \"&lt;a href=\"Songs%20of%20the%20Return\"&gt;Songs of the Return&lt;/a&gt;\" series of books makes several mentions of \"distant green summers\" and \"chilling green shores.\" \"&lt;a href=\"Fragmentae%20Abyssum%20Hermaeus%20Morus\"&gt;Fragmentae Abyssum Hermaeus Morus&lt;/a&gt;\" refers to forests and streams and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Onus%20of%20the%20Oghma\"&gt;The Onus of the Oghma&lt;/a&gt;\" mentions marshes in Atmora. Other reports assert it was never a temperate place, and as such the early settlers were hunters with no knowledge of agriculture.\nOrigins of Men.\nIt is thought that the first pre-literate humans came to Tamriel from the continent of Atmora in the late Merethic Era. It was not a single invasion, but a migration spanning over hundreds of years, giving birth to the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;. The first of the human colonizers was the Atmoran hero &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nMigration.\nPre-Return events.\nYsgramor gathered those who wished to leave Atmora due to the violent civil war. They sailed south and eventually the fleet landed at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt; at the northern tip of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Cape\"&gt;Broken Cape&lt;/a&gt;. It was here they built the legendary city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arrival in Tamriel, the Atmorans met and befriended the local &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;. The Atmorans called the land \"Mereth,\" in recognition of the vast number of Mer that lived there. The elves quickly took notice of the rate at which Man's population was growing, and soon realized that these Men were the first great threat to Elvish civilization on Tamriel.\nThe Snow Elves led raids throughout the settlements of Men that had come to Tamriel. Most of the Atmorans were hunted down and the city of Saarthal was burned to the ground. These events became known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;.\" Ysgramor and his two sons, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;, survived and fled back to Atmora.\nReturn.\nWhen Ysgramor and his sons returned to their homeland they discovered Atmora had developed into a peaceful land. They told stories of elven treachery and murders in Saarthal. This inspired men of Atmora to raise an army and avenge the fallen, claiming Mereth for themselves.\nYsgramor gathered an army known as the Five Hundred Companions and set sail from the southernmost city of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt; to invade Tamriel, this became known as the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt;. When they arrived, they retook Saarthal and waged a genocidal war against the Snow Elves and other Mer in Skyrim alike, and made possible the rise of Men, eventually establishing the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;. This series of events gained the name of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;\" and have since led to a strong hatred and prejudice between the races of Men and Mer.\nHigh King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; eventually relinquished all holdings in Atmora proclaiming the Nords and Atmorans were different people now, and that Skyrim was now an independent kingdom, while the Atmoran mercenaries in Skyrim thus returned to their homeland.\nFate.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was the last purported immigrant from Atmora, who was said to have left the continent in his youth during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. However, given that the last recorded wave of migration took place in &lt;a href=\"1E%2068\"&gt;1E 68&lt;/a&gt;, the accuracy of this is questionable.\nIt is unknown what exactly caused the climate to deteriorate so drastically. The Atmorans that did not manage to flee most likely succumbed to the ever-worsening climate many centuries ago.\nAccording to the \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2017\"&gt;36 Lessons of Vivec, Sermon 17&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Atmora but found only frozen bearded kings.\nFauna.\nAccording to Nord legend, bears originated from Atmora, leading some Nords to believe that the Psijic bear exemplars came from there. Snow bears are said to have been brought from Atmora by Ysgramor, who deemed them the only worthy avatars of the ancient Nord bear totem. The Atmoran Chub Loon is native to Atmora with a \"length of two warriors and a squawk that starts avalanches\". The Atmoran Bantam Guar is a cold-blooded reptile with icy blue eyes. "}

Although markedly colder than Tamriel, Atmora was still relatively temperate at the time, and so these Men settled there and became the first Atmorans, eventually founding a powerful culture and civilization.\nThe first expeditions made by the Atmorans to Tamriel occurred later into the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. The warrior and hero &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0would organize a great colonizing fleet to Skyrim in the middle of a civil war in Atmora. Ysgramor's fleet crossed the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0landed at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt; at the northern tip of Skyrim's &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Cape\"&gt;Broken Cape&lt;/a&gt;, and then moved inland.\u00a0There the Atmorans built the legendary city of Saarthal, the earliest known settlement founded by Men on Tamriel, and established a connection with the native &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;, and the two groups would live in relative peace.\nEventually, the Snow Elves assaulted Saarthal, and killed off the entire Atmoran populace living there, with the exception of Ysgramor and his sons, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;, and an Atmoran man who came to be known as &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor and his sons fled the city, and returned to Atmora soon after.\nThis event would ultimately be known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;. Several theories had been proposed to attempt to explain the Snow Elves' fateful attack on Saarthal. One theory was that they noticed the comparatively faster growth of the Atmoran population, and so the Snow Elves attacked them with the intent of bringing the new settlers' proliferation under control, as &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; had long been accustomed of dealing with Nede populations of Men. Another theory was that the Atmorans had discovered a mysterious artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; deep below the foundations of Saarthal, and so the Snow Elves attacked the Atmoran settlement to secure the object for themselves.\nThe Return.\nWhen Ysgramor and his sons returned to Atmora, they brought stories of Elven treachery and the slaughter of Saarthal's citizens to their kin. This moved the bravest men and fiercest women of Atmora to band together into a large companionship, with the aim of avenging their fallen and permanently claim Skyrim from the Mer.\nYsgramor took command of the elite group of warriors and hunters, who in time would become known as the legendary &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;, and the war band's fleet set sail from the Atmoran city of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt; to invade Tamriel on the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after the Five Hundred made landfall in Skyrim they overran and retook Saarthal, and in their wrathful onslaught began to pursue the scattering and fleeing Snow Elves relentlessly across the width and breadth of the land. This unprecedented conquest of Mer\u00a0lands by Men made the ascendancy of humans possible for the first time on the continent of Tamriel, and would eventually lead to the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0by Men. These momentous events, known to Tamrielic historians as \"The Return,\" became enshrined in legend in Nordic and later Imperial culture, and continues to profoundly shape the relationships between Men and Mer, even thousands of years later.\nThe settling of Skyrim and beyond.\nAs the crews of the Five Hundred Companions parted ways with Ysgramor\u00a0after reclaiming Sarthaal and established the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Captains\"&gt;Circle of Captains&lt;/a&gt;, they would venture out into the new land and gradually interbred with the Nedic\u00a0populations of Skyrim, whom they inadvertently liberated from the dominion of Mer through their campaigns of conquest against the Snow Elves. Through this, the Companions gave rise to the modern-day bloodline of the Nords.\u00a0Those settlers of Atmora who came after and ventured west into &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; intermingled with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; living there, becoming the progenitors of the Breton people.\u00a0Others who moved southward were captured and enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;, and interbred with the Nedic people of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during their captivity. Their offspring would eventually overthrow the Ayleids under leadership of the Nedic slave queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, and begin the bloodline that would lead to the modern-day Imperials.\nAs the crews of the Five Hundred roamed Skyrim during these years, many of them continued to raid Elvish settlements and stalk Mer stragglers up until the moment of Ysgramor's death, after which they laid down their weapons in a terrible grief and in homage to their legendary harbinger.\nThe frost fall and the end of the Atmoran civilization.\nBut as Ysgramor's migration went on, more dramatic and dire things started to happen back at Atmora. Due to a mysterious event known as \"the frost fall\", the continent's climate drastically changed, growing increasingly colder and colder, to the point where it became inhospitable and even downright hostile to the humans living there, motivating more and more Atmorans to head south over the Sea of Ghosts, trying to escape the smothering cold.\nThe last larger detachment of Atmoran refugees arrived in Tamriel in &lt;a href=\"1E%2068\"&gt;1E 68&lt;/a&gt;, where two ships from the north pulled into a harbor with more than half their crews dead. According to the legends about his early life, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was born in Atmora around &lt;a href=\"2E%20828\"&gt;2E 828&lt;/a&gt;, before spending his childhood and adolescence in Skyrim, making him the last known immigrant from the continent. Expeditions to Atmora in the Third Era has described the continent as nothing but a frozen wasteland cast in eternal winter, it is presumed by scholars that the Atmorans who remained there perished many centuries ago.\nReligion.\nThe Atmorans were known to venerate nine\u00a0animal avatars; the Fox, presumed to be &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, the Bear, presumed to be &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, the Hawk, presumed to be &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, the Wolf, presumed to be &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the Moth, presumed to be &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, the Whale, presumed to be &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;, the Owl, presumed to be &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt;, the Snake, presumed to be &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dragon, presumed to be &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. When they migrated to Skyrim, they brought this belief system with them and it became a part of the fledgling Nordic culture. For reasons lost to history, the Atmoran shamans venerating the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; grew far more influential in this new society than the shamans who represented the other animal avatars, and began to wield power equal to the kings.\u00a0Henceforth, these &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0ruled over the Atmoran and &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; populations at the behest of their Dragon\u00a0overlords, establishing the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; as Skyrim's dominant religion in the Merethic Era."}

The name is sometimes applied to man-made constructs that resemble atronachs, but are not Daedra; these creatures are more properly called golems.\nPhysiology.\nAll Daedric atronachs share a few characteristics that distinguish them from other Daedra. They are made up of what would normally be inanimate material, and they often appear to be humanoid in form. However, they can be conjured into other shapes. Atronachs generally move by walking or hovering.\nAtronachs are considered moderately intelligent, and are frequently used by powerful &lt;a href=\"conjurer\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s as guardians. All atronachs can use magic based on their base element, and are typically weak to opposing magic. Daedric atronachs are unique among the Daedra in that they claim no allegiance to any specific &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;. They are found nearly as often on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; as on any given &lt;a href=\"plane%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;plane of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. An exception to this is the storm atronach\u2014as one of the most powerful Daedra species, they are often recruited by the Daedric Princes to protect their realm.\nRealms of origin.\nAs Atronachs are Daedra, they originate from planes of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Oftentimes a certain type of Atronach can most commonly be found in a pocket realm matching their nature. For example, Flame Atronachs come from &lt;a href=\"Infernace\"&gt;Infernace&lt;/a&gt;, Storm Atronachs come from &lt;a href=\"Levinace\"&gt;Levinace&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cold-Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Cold-Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s come from &lt;a href=\"Takubar\"&gt;Takubar&lt;/a&gt;. Some Daedric Princes adopt atronachs into their realms, such as &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; keeping Cold-Flame Atronachs in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; keeping Flesh Atronachs in the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of atronach.\nThere are five types of atronach found on Nirn, corresponding to the elements of air, fire, ice, storms, and flesh. Note that the so-called \"earth atronach,\" also called an iron or steel atronach, is a creation of the mages around Illiac Bay, and thus technically a golem. For more details on each type of Daedra, see their respective articles as listed below:\nOccasionally, the Flesh Atronach is mistaken as being merely undead because of its morbid appearance. However, it is indeed an atronach (as well as being undead), as seen by the glowing enchantments and glyphs used to bind it together."}

Different &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; can be conjured with the forge by placing certain combinations of things inside the offering box, then pulling the lever.

The trip from &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; is treacherous this season, or I would have visited upon hearing the news. The Nords have a fine &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;college at Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, and I am sure you will excel. You may know that I, too, attended there. I was quite the conjuration adept in my own day. I am sending you my notes on something called the '&lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt;', a bit of a project of mine while at Winterhold.\nMention nothing to the faculty, but ask your fellow pupils about a place called the Midden. You will find the Forge there. I fear a number of my notes are missing, scattered and lost in my travels around &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps you may stumble across these in your own adventures.\nThe Atronach Forge offers few clues as to who built it, and even fewer as to how to unlock its full potential. Only through blind experimentation, and a few singed eyebrows, have I been able to understand its function.\nThe Forge is mostly a large dais, almost crude of make, but emblazoned with the traditional Daedric rune. An offering box is attached, as well as a prominent lever.\nThe Dais also features a large setting which seems set to receive some large, spherical object. I have had no luck determining what this missing object may be, however, or what effect it may have on the efficacy of the Forge.\nThe Forge is activated by placing certain items into the offering box, and then pulling the lever. The Forge consumes the items and conjures something upon the dais. The conjuration can be predicted reliably if the appropriate items are left in the box - but many combinations either have no effect or catastrophic reactions. Once I conjured a wild goat! Well, most of the goat, at least.\nExperimenting wildly with the Forge is dangerous. I've recorded such recipes as I have discovered on the following pages.\nThe simplest, yet perhaps most hazardous stable recipe is that for a summoned &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;. The conjured brutes will attack the first thing they see, however!

Seeing it fail, &lt;a href=\"Basil\"&gt;Basil&lt;/a&gt; and the Restless League opt to leave, until realising the soul entered into the Prince's sword, creating the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;Soul Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrus gives a rallying speech, and organises the attack against the Empire on Stros M'kai, tasking the Restless League with claiming the harbor and taking down the Imperial fleet, while he himself goes after Richton himself.\nArriving at the back of the castle, Cyrus uses the Soul Sword to gain acces to the courtyard. Here, several Imperial &lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Guardsmen&lt;/a&gt; patrol. Most doors are locked, but the door leading to the barracks, located next to a crane, are unlocked. Inside, more guards have to be fought. In the barracks, wanted posters and a schematic for the elevator can be found. Continuing down a hallway leading into the Palace, Cyrus comes across a room with three hallways. The first hallway continues down the path, whereas the other two lead to a blocked path. On one of the paths a &lt;a href=\"Health%20Potion\"&gt;Health Potion&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nAdvancing into the castle itself, Cyrus finds himself in the kitchens. There is an option to clear the audience chamber and the throne room of guards before progressing the objectives. Inside the kitchen, a wheel must be turned to remove a pot boiling above a fire. The fire can be extinguished using a bucket which can be found next to the cooking spit, and filling it with water from the barrel next to it. Climbing up, Cyrus can jump out through a fireplace, and thus access the ball room. Here more guards must be defeated. On the floor several potions can be found.\nIn order to continue, Cyrus must climb onto one of the railings and jump onto the chandeliers, leading to the balcony of Richton's room. Here two more guards are found, guarding a key. This key unlocks the doors leading back out, as well as the other doors in the complex, one of which leads to three inactive dwemer sphere, protecting a health potion, &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Ironskin\"&gt;Potion of Ironskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strength%20Potion\"&gt;Strength Potion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the key, Cyrus needs to make his way to the throne chamber and use the Dwemer elevator to go up. With the key, he can unlock the door leading outside, and pull a lever which calls down another elevator outside the courtyard, providing access to the Dwemer airship.\nBacktracking through the Palace, the gates in the courtyard can be opened with the same key obtained from Richton's chamber. Going up, Cyrus must fight Dram and jump onto the airship, where Richton must be defeated. Upon defeating Richton the final cutscene plays and the game is completed."}

He is beloved by the people of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; for his acts of heroism and gallantry, but in truth his life is a farce created by the Emperor. His sword was called &lt;a href=\"Flashing\"&gt;Flashing&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAttrebus Mede was born in &lt;a href=\"4E%2018\"&gt;4E 18&lt;/a&gt;. He was raised to believe he was a hero. Bards made songs about his triumphs, and how he managed to win battles against all odds without taking casualties. He could never lose more than three of his personal guard in one battle anywhere, including the Battle of Blinker Creek. He always sought to help the people of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, even if it did not directly involve the Empire. For example, he rescued an entire colony of young people from &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;. Every time he intended to take part in a dangerous quest, &lt;a href=\"Gulan\"&gt;Gulan&lt;/a&gt; would report it to the Emperor, and something would happen to stop it.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; was summoned to Tamriel in 4E 48. The flying city attacked and destroyed &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. One of the only survivors, &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg\"&gt;Anna\u00efg&lt;/a&gt;, sent her mechanical bird &lt;a href=\"Coo\"&gt;Coo&lt;/a&gt; to warn Prince Attrebus about the threat Tamriel was facing.\nAt that time, Attrebus have not been told yet he was not a mighty warrior. A woman named &lt;a href=\"Radhasa\"&gt;Radhasa&lt;/a&gt; requested him to serve in his personal bodyguard. After a duel where Attrebus easily won, he allowed her to join his ranks. Attrebus was captivated by her beauty, and they had intimate relations. After spending the night with Radhasa, &lt;a href=\"Gulan\"&gt;Gulan&lt;/a&gt;, his closest guard exposed his concern about Radhasa. His father would not approve his behavior, and he should not trust her so soon. Gulan also informed Attrebus about his father's plans to marry him soon.\nAttrebus was visited by Coo and talked to Anna\u00efg through him after returning to his bedroom. After Anna\u00efg explained him what had happened in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, Attrebus informed his father without a second. He intended to lead his men into the flying city and save Anna\u00efg, who was now working in Umbriel as a cook.\n&lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt; had already been informed by reports about Umbriel. However, the flying city was heading to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and he did not intend to spend resources in a threat that did not concern the Empire. He forbade Attrebus to embark on a quest to stop Umbriel. Attrebus did not give up, so he informed Gulan to gather all his men in his house in &lt;a href=\"Ione\"&gt;Ione&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttrebus, Gulan and Radhasa arrived at Ione together. Attrebus explained to his men what their task was. He gave a motivational speech, and they headed to Black Marsh. Attrebus learned the truth about the lie he was living to his cost. Attrebus' entire retinue was wiped out during an ambush. The last thing he saw was Radhasa's blade swinging toward his head. Radhasa knocked him out, she worked for a criminal band that had been hired to kill the prince. However, she intended to sell the prince to an eccentric &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; who collected people like him in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nRadhasa explained to him that all his men knew that he was not a hero. He had been risen to believe he was something else. Attrebus did not believe her at first, but he eventually got used to the idea. He tried to escape by recovering his sword and beating Radhasa. However, unlike their first encounter, Radhasa easily defeated him. Just then, &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; showed up and killed all the kidnapers. Attrebus thought he was sent by his father, but he told him he had saved him because they both wanted to find the flying city. They needed to beat Umbriel to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, a sword named &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; was the only artifact capable of stopping &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey headed to &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;. In their way to Elsweyr, they came across the &lt;a href=\"Lesspa%23F.E2.80.99aashe_clan\"&gt;F'aashe clan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lesspa\"&gt;Lesspa&lt;/a&gt;, their leader, offered them to escort them to Rimmen in exchange of buying them &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt; in the city. Khajiits were not allowed to buy it, and smuggling was sanctioned with death. They were forced to accept the deal. Once they arrived at Rimmen, they bought the Moon-Sugar. When they returned to the camp, they were followed by city guards. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Evernal\"&gt;Captain Evernal&lt;/a&gt; intended to arrest them, but Attrebus revealed his identity. Evernal recognized the prince, and he allowed them and the F'aashe clan go free. Lesspa and the rest of the Khajiits decided to further escort the prince to &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttrebus and Sul could not beat up Umbriel to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; by foot, so Sul bought some materials to open a portal to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; in Leyawiin. Attrebus visited his old friend &lt;a href=\"Florius%20Larsus\"&gt;Florius Larsus&lt;/a&gt;, who was the commander of the garrison of the city. Larsus was astonished to see him alive. Everybody thought he had been killed in the ambush. Attrebus sent couriers informing his biographers about what had happened and convinced Larsus to accompany him to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttrebus waited for Florius in an inn. &lt;a href=\"Riente\"&gt;Riente&lt;/a&gt;, one of Florius' men and other masked men attacked Attrebus. If it had not been for Lesspa, he probably would not have survived. At first he thougth that Florius was involved in the plot to kill him, but when he returned to his office he found him beheaded. Sul prepared the ritual to open the door to Oblivion, and they were teleported to &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hircine's Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were accompanied by Lesspa and the most veteran warriors of the F'aashe clan. Hircine and his beasts chased them while they tried to arrive at the portal that would teleport them to Vivec City. Seeing that Hircine was about to approach them, the Khajiiits sacrificed so that Attrebus and Sul could escape.\nAs Sul expected, when they entered the portal they ended up in Vivec City. They searched for Umbra, but it was not where it was supposed to be. Someone had already taken the sword. Attrebus realised that Umbriel was approaching them from the south. Zombies poured from the water. Sul and Attrebus tried to defend, but they ended up being captured.\nVuhon teleported them to Umbriel. He was surprised by Sul's determination. Vuhon revealed Attrebus that Sul was the responsible for breaking the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of Vivec City. Sul made a sign to Attrebus to keep Vuhon talking. Vuhon had told them that they were in Oblivion, so Sul managed to free from his chains. While Vuhon was distracted with Sul, Attrebus tried to stab Vuhon from behind, but Vuhon's gaze found him. Sul realised they could not win, so he teleported them to another Oblivion plane.\nAttrebus woke up in &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s realm. A mer named Silhansa had healed his wounds. Attrebus told her how he had ended up there. When he finished, Silhansa transformed into Malacath. Attrebus convinced him to teleport them to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, where Umbra was being kept. Malacath agreed to help them, after all, they could weaken Clavicus Vile. Before leaving, he told Attrebus that if he ever had use for him, he will know it.\nAttrebus talked to Anna\u00efg through Coo for the first time in a long time. He told her about the outcome of his travel to Vivec City. He also told her that Lord Umbriel was Vuhon, a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Anna\u00efg could use that information to poison him if she had the chance. Attrebus and Sul arrived at a village called &lt;a href=\"Sathil%20%28Village%29\"&gt;Sathil&lt;/a&gt;. They presented themselves to the lords of castle Sathil as naturalists writing a new edition for &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Lord Sathil could not receive them, but her daughter &lt;a href=\"Nirai\"&gt;Nirai&lt;/a&gt; offered them shelter and the resources required for their pretended investigation.\nAttrebus decided to investigate the castle at night on his own. As soon as he left his bedroom, he came across one of the maids, &lt;a href=\"Irinja\"&gt;Irinja&lt;/a&gt;. Irinja confessed him that she knew who he was. Attrebus tried to deny it at first, but she was sure. He had to tell her about their adventure, and how they had to find Umbra to save Tamriel. Irinja told Attrebus that she wanted to help, but she had to think first.\nThe following days they had to act as naturalists. &lt;a href=\"Fruth\"&gt;Fruth&lt;/a&gt; took them to &lt;a href=\"Ensleth%20Valley\"&gt;Ensleth Valley&lt;/a&gt;. They were wrapped in an ice storm. Irinja visited Attrebus at their return, they shared some whiskey and Irinja told Attrebus everything she knew about Umbra. &lt;a href=\"Elhul%20Sathil\"&gt;Elhul Sathil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hleryn%20Sathil\"&gt;Hleryn Sathil&lt;/a&gt;'s son recovered Umbra in Vivec city. As soon as he touched it he went mad. His guards managed to neutralize him. They took away the sword from him, but he eventually found it. He killed his mother, his two brothers and half of the guards before they could stop him. This time, they could not take the sword from him. Lord Sathil ordered to lock up his son deep in the stones. After talking, they kissed and had sex. Coo was open, and Anna\u00efg saw that Attrebus was sleeping with a woman.\nIrinja lead Attrebus and Sul where Elhul was being held captive. When they arrived at the door, she told them she would not go any further. Sul entered the darkness to retrieve Umbra while Attrebus kept the door. Nirai surprised Attrebus by closing the gate. She told him that Irinja had told her everything, in fact Nirai had sent her to them. Sul shouted, and Attrebus ran to help him. Elhul had wounded Sul, Attrebus draw &lt;a href=\"Flashing\"&gt;Flashing&lt;/a&gt; and fought against him. Sul managed to cast a spell that dissolved Elhul. They carefully picked up the sword without touching the blade. When they came back to the gate, Nirai told them she could not risk letting them go. Sul said that he could use Umbra to be summoned to Clavicus Vile's realm.\nThey were greeted by &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; in Vile's realm. Attrebus convinced the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; to send them back to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, so that they could stop Umbriel and return Vile the power that had been stolen from him. Vile demanded a pact, he wanted Sul's soul, but Attrebus denied his demand, he needed them as much as they needed him. Vile sent the to his shrine in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Sul hit his head and lost consciousness. Attrebus had to craft a stretcher to tow Sul. They arrived at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;, Attrebus took a boat and rowed to the Imperial City.\nWhen they arrived at the other shore, they were captured by undead. The zombies brought them to &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt;'s men. When Attrebus woke up, he was locked in Hierem's chambers. Hierem revealed he was in league with Vuhon. After the conversation, he teleported himself to Umbriel to finalize the preparations for the assault on the Imperial City. Attrebus realized that when Hierem came back, a rat that was near to Hierems position was in turn teleported to Umbriel. Hierem interrogated Attrebus to learn why Vuhon was so concerned about them. He could make Attrebus weep in ecstasy. If Attrebus answered, he rewarded him with that sensation. Attrebus had to resist not to answer, but he revealed that Vuhon was afraid of the sword. Attrebus fainted, and Sul ended up answering for him to save his life.\n&lt;a href=\"Colin\"&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arese\"&gt;Arese&lt;/a&gt; had discovered that Prince Attrebus was being held captive in Hierem's chambers, so they headed to save him. Colin opened the cells where Sul and the prince were captured. They designed a plan, Attrebus and Sul took Umbra and located near the sigil where Hierem teleported to Umbriel in order to teleport when he came back. Colin and Arese would wait for him to kill him.\nWhen Hierem finally came back, they were teleported just in front of Vuhon. Sul wielded Umbra, but he could not damage Vuhon. Attrebus managed to make a cut in Vuhon's artery, Anna\u00efg had synthesized a venom that killed the trees from Umbriel and weakened Vuhon. Vuhon wrapped around Attrebus' neck some cables. When Attrebus was about to faint, everything around him seemed to shatter and Sul and him started falling. They fell in the skraw caves, Attrebus called Anna\u00efg through Coo, who told them to wait for her there. Glim found them and brought them to Anna\u00efg's presence. Vuhon had discovered that Anna\u00efg was the responsible for poisoning him, so he went to her for the antidote. When Attrebus, Sul and Glim arrived, Vuhon was already there. Anna\u00efg revealed them that they could damage Vuhon because Umbra's soul was in the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;. Glim guided them to the sump and he dived to the bottom. Sul had fainted because of the pressure, so Attrebus picked Umbra and he stabbed it into the light. They fell into the room where the Ingenium was stored, Umbra had fallen from Attrebus hand. Vuhon tried to take the sword, but Attrebus was faster and he stabbed the Ingenium.\nVuhon shaked, and Umbra took possession of his body. After a short conversation with Sul, Vuhon turned back to normal. Attrebus was possessed by Vile, who stabbed Sul. Sul grabbed the hilt of Umbra and pulled himself up the blade, and with everything left in him he struck Attrebus in the jaw. Vile was expelled from Attrebus body, but a dying Sul and Umbra melt together into a dark smoke with a heart of lightning.\nAttrebus threatened Vuhon with killing him. However, Vuhon revealed that doing so would collapse Umbriel and destroy the Imperial City. Glim could remove Umbriel from Mundus while Vuhon was still alive, so he spared his life. Attrebus and Glim met Anna\u00efg and &lt;a href=\"Fhena\"&gt;Fhena&lt;/a&gt;. They had a sad farewell. Anna\u00efg and Attrebus drank a levitation potion Anna\u00efg had crafted, and they escaped from Umbriel. Glim guided Umbriel to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20the%20Hist\"&gt;Realm of the Hist&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut in the Imperial City, Titus received his son as a real hero. Attrebus refused to claim credit for the victory and give credit to &lt;a href=\"The%20Synod\"&gt;The Synod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;The College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;, who had cooperated in the crisis and could lead to their reconciliation and their political support to his father.\nAfter everything is over, Attrebus and Anna\u00efg talk in a forest about their feelings. Attrebus confesses that he loves her, and that he only needs a bit of patience before he can offer her his love. Anna\u00efg replies that she is not patient by nature, but she will be patient for him.\nPersonal guard.\nAttrebus had a personal guard composed of elite legionaries. It was an appealing position for the soldiers because the pay was good and they did not run into very difficult situations. It consisted of around fifty men. They had never lost more than three men in a battle until they were ambushed while they marched into Black Marsh, where they were all massacred. Attrebus was the only one to be kept alive as a hostage. Some of its members were:\nAffairs.\nAttrebus is known to have intimate or sentimental relationships with the following women:"}

Poor Mynisera. Everyone at court knows that her husband, the late King Lysandus, preferred the face and form of another woman of her, but she still attempts to hide all evidence of it. Her loyalty to Lysandus is almost as great as his foolish loyalty to the emperor. And those poor little children. How dreadful the butchery of the innocents. We know of the barbarism of the orcs, but surely they did not deserve that. Hardly surprising that Mynisera did not want it known that her father was responsible for such a grotesque enterprise. Well, I thank you, , for your valor and your discretion. Please accept this small token of my esteem, not as a payment but as a gift. May Oblivion bless thee.\"\n\"The letter from the Emperor? Actually this is rather embarrassing. The letter was stolen from me the same day I received it. I never did read it. I have been hoping that the letter would turn up, or the the Emperor would send another letter. If you find the letter, I would be most grateful if you would let me personally deliver it to Mynisera.\"\n\"You were completely correct to bring this to me. Otherwise it might have gotten out where it could do Lord Woodborne damage. Guards! Kill this !\""}

He was described as\u00a0young and charismatic. Bucco was a popular figure in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;; his good looks and practiced oratory catapulted him through the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; hierarchy with unprecedented speed. By the time he was twenty-five he was already wearing the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"General%27s%20Diamond\"&gt;General's Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Upon receiving his generalship he was offered legions in practically every corner of Cyrodiil. He chose the Fourth Legion\u00a0of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; as his command.\nWhen the invasion of\u00a0Black Marsh\u00a0began in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"1E%202811\"&gt;1E 2811&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Legion\u00a0was confident of victory. Imperial forces had won a great and decisive victory in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in several other clashes. These battles were one-sided affairs, with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0suffering significant casualties and Imperials hardly getting winded. By\u00a0&lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;\u00a01E 2811, the Lizard-Folk were in full retreat\u2014taking refuge in the shadowy depths of the region's interior. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; decided to press the advantage and mount a full-scale invasion before the Argonians could regroup.\nBy\u00a0&lt;a href=\"1E%202816\"&gt;1E 2816&lt;/a&gt;, General Bucco's\u00a0legion\u00a0had been depleted to a mere six cohorts\u2014none of which were at full fighting strength as the campaign pressed on. Endless raids, disease, and mysterious disappearances were compounding on each other, creating a culture of utter hopelessness and cynicism.\nSeeing that the cause would be lost without reinforcements, Bucco called for an additional legion to be deployed to\u00a0Black Marsh. Rather than shifting these fresh troops to the front to relieve his beleaguered force, he set them to work building the \"&lt;a href=\"Reman%20Way\"&gt;Reman Way&lt;/a&gt;\" (later known as the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Road\"&gt;Swamp Road&lt;/a&gt;). Almost no one knew where the road went or what purpose it would serve in future conflicts, but Bucco was convinced that a well-paved and well-defended road would aid the war effort and turn the tides of battle in the legion's favor.\u00a0The Reman Way fell under attack almost as soon as the work began. Waves of\u00a0Argonians\u00a0crashed upon the workers day in and day out. Troopers who should have been armed with shield and spear were forced to defend themselves with shovels and lengths of chain. Soldiers also routinely succumbed to exhaustion and swamp fever. The road made it only half-way to the front lines before construction was abandoned. The Swamp Road project would long be remembered after the Black Marsh campaign came to a bitter end as \"&lt;a href=\"Bucco%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Bucco's Folly&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBy &lt;a href=\"1E%202820\"&gt;1E 2820&lt;/a&gt;, General Bucco's Legion was utterly decimated. What few troops remained were completely unable to defend themselves. After a near mutiny almost saw Bucco ousted from his own command, he finally ordered his remaining soldiers to retreat and exit the Marsh's interior. His prevailing assumption was that if the legion left the swamp, the Argonians would not follow.\nAfter a withering ten-day withdrawal, what was left of the legion rallied at the foot of an ancient Argonian pyramid known as \"&lt;a href=\"Xi-tsei\"&gt;Xi-tsei&lt;/a&gt;.\" The force consisted of barely three-hundred-and-fifty swords by that point. Bucco hoped that after a brief respite in the shadow of the pyramid, his remaining forces could fall back to the relative safety of\u00a0Cyrodiil. This wish went unfulfilled. On the night of the 14th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1E%202820\"&gt;1E 2820&lt;/a&gt;, what remained of Bucco's proud Fourth Legion was annihilated."}

Each regional bank has separate bank accounts, meaning that the gold stored in the region of one bank cannot be withdrawn in the region of another bank.\n&lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Credit%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Letter of Credit&lt;/a&gt;.\nLetters of credit share a similar function to regular gold.

Letters of credit are best used for the transport of large quantities of gold.\nLoans.\nBanks can also be used to take out loans for up to 1,1 million &lt;a href=\"Gold%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;. Only one loan can be active from a single bank at any time. Loans must be repaid within a year, and demand a 10% interest rate. At its greatest value, this would mean that at the end of the year, the Agent must repay a bank 1,21 million gold.\nHouses.\nHouses within a region can also be purchased via a bank, with a large difference in values. The cheapest houses cost 300,000 gold, and only one house can be owned at any given time. Houses can also be sold back to the bank at a reduced price.\nShips.\nBanks located near the sea also offer the option to buy ships, costing 100,000 or 200,000 gold. Owned ships can be used to cut down on both the cost and the duration of transport via the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; itself."}

However, Pircalmo's experience with magic was often limited by his constant errors and problems dealing with magic. Before trying to cast his spell, Pircalmo wished for it to work well. Unknown to Pircalmo, his wish was granted to him by the Daedric Prince Clavicus Vile, who had an ancient and forgotten shrine in a cave close by. Pircalmo's spell worked in that it transported a large group of dangerous &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s from Oblivion to burn down the woods. Having seemingly failed the contract, Pircalmo's wife was taken by the local Bosmer to be murdered and devoured. Fortunately, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; found the shrine, which Barbas had been bound to due to Pircalmo's wish. The Vestige then destroyed the shrine, freeing Barbas and banishing the atronachs back to Oblivion before Pircalmo's wife could be hurt.\nThe same year, Barbas appeared as &lt;a href=\"Creeper%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt; when an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; merchant by the name of &lt;a href=\"Zagrugh\"&gt;Zagrugh&lt;/a&gt; summoned a scamp to be his personal assistant. Zagrugh ran a general goods store beneath the city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; ancestral tomb which had been taken over by criminals. Zagrugh had hoped that a summoned being from Oblivion would be more trustworthy and loyal than his previous employees, who had all stolen items from his store. Strangely, Zagrugh's corpse was later found, and his assistant Creeper took over the store.\nMeeting with Cyrus.\nWhen the hero &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; travelled to Clavicus Vile's realm in 2E 864 in search of his sister &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;'s soul, Barbas took a liking to Cyrus and transformed his face into multiple creatures, and also imitated Cyrus' face. Vile noted that Barbas likes being a dog as well as other different things.\nThird Era.\nTime in Morrowind.\nIn 3E 427, Barbas took on the appearance of a Scamp called Creeper to live and trade goods with a group of Orsimer in &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; in the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 3E 433, during the Oblivion Crisis, Clavicus Vile tasked the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; with obtaining the sword of &lt;a href=\"Umbra%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;. Barbas foresaw the chaos and destruction that the sword would bring to &lt;a href=\"The%20Fields%20of%20Regret\"&gt;The Fields of Regret&lt;/a&gt;, Clavicus Vile's Realm of Oblivion, and left his master's side to manifest himself as a statue of a dog. Through the statue, Barbas talked with the hero in an attempt to make it so the hero would not want to bring the sword to Vile. This attempt proved futile, as the sword was given back to the Prince.\nFourth Era.\nThe Umbriel Crisis.\nThe being known as &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; later took much of Clavicus Vile's power and created the floating city &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Vile's realm of Oblivion greatly damaged. When &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Ezhmaar Sul&lt;/a&gt; and the prince of the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus Mede&lt;/a&gt; travelled to The Fields of Regret to make a deal with the Prince, Barbas helped in negotiations between Vile, Sul and Attrebus.\nMeeting with the Last Dragonborn.\nIn 4E 201, Clavicus Vile had forsaken Barbas due to an argument they had, and due to a pure annoyance of his servant. Barbas, in the form of a dog, was left wandering the forest of southern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. This weakened Vile's power, such that he could only manifest in &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; in close proximity to one of his shrines. The inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; noticed a stray dog, and so when the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; was tasked by Falkreath's blacksmith to find the animal, the latter revealed that he was Barbas after being found by the Dragonborn. The speech-capable creature asked the Dragonborn to help him intervene in his quarrel with Vile and end it. The two traveled to the Prince's shrine in &lt;a href=\"Haemar%27s%20Shame\"&gt;Haemar's Shame&lt;/a&gt;, and Clavicus Vile had the Last Dragonborn obtain an artifact of Vile's known as the &lt;a href=\"Rueful%20Axe\"&gt;Rueful Axe&lt;/a&gt;. After obtaining the axe, Vile then said that the Dragonborn could keep the axe if they would kill Barbas in his mortal form, banishing him back to Oblivion for a few centuries and allowing Clavicus Vile to use the full extent of his power; or to continue with the original pact, forcing Vile to take both the axe and Barbas back with him.\nReferences.\n "}

She had many skills including thievery, spellcasting, speechcraft, and negotiation. Barenziah experienced many important events throughout her life, and had a number of notable descendants.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBarenziah was born in &lt;a href=\"2E%20893\"&gt;2E 893&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of the Lord and Lady of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, and was a member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;House Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt;. She grew up in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, banished after &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; conquered &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. She joined the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and was taught the skills of thievery by a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Therris\"&gt;Therris&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, a general in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, who was said to have the friendship and the ear of Tiber Septim himself, captured her. Barenziah was then sent to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to spend some time as part of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s household as the Queen of Morrowind.\nTiber Septim was fascinated with Barenziah's beauty. After Symmachus left to return to Morrowind, she had an affair with the Emperor, and became pregnant. Hearing of her pregnancy, Tiber Septim was furious. Avoiding any scandal, he ordered the pregnancy to be aborted, and then sent Barenziah to Morrowind. Once there, she married Symmachus. From their marriage, &lt;a href=\"Helseth\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt; were born.\nImperial Simulacrum.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20376\"&gt;3E 376&lt;/a&gt; Barenziah was seduced by a bard (and thief) known as &lt;a href=\"Nightingale\"&gt;Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Nightingale just wanted to retrieve the powerful artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, which was hidden in Old Mournhold, the ruins beneath Mournhold. Due to Nightingale's manipulation, Barenziah opened the way to Old Mournhold, allowing Nightingale to snatch the Staff of Chaos and disappear.\n&lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt; sent a message to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; for help, but he was directed to seek aid from &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;. Symmachus was reluctant to turn to the battlemage because he suspected that Tharn was behind the theft of the Staff of Chaos.\nIt should be noted that during her time with the Nightingale, Barenziah may have become pregnant with a daughter. According to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Nightingales%20Vol.%202\"&gt;The Nightingales Vol. 2&lt;/a&gt;\", Barenziah left the infant with a midwife to conceal her affair and possibly to avoid scandal. There is no information on the childhood of the girl, who \"called herself\" Dralsi. As an adult, she finally found her father, the elusive Nightingale, in Skyrim. Dralsi settled there and became a talented thief. She married and had a daughter of her own, &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath of Symmachus.\nIt was then reported that &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; had died and that the Emperor had suddenly raised taxes. The citizens of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; revolted, and &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt; did his best to suppress the rebellion. He sent Barenziah and their two children to the Imperial City to beg the Emperor for help.\nAccording to the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Real%20Barenziah%2C%20Book%20V\"&gt;The Real Barenziah, Book V&lt;/a&gt;\", not long after Barenziah left, Symmachus was killed when the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; deserted and joined the rebellion.\nBringing Down Tharn.\nBarenziah met with &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, but she knew that this was not the real emperor. It was a magically disguised &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. She gained nothing from the audience and was then shocked by the news that Symmachus had been betrayed and murdered by the Royal Guard. Barenziah had no time to mourn. She needed all her strength and wit to face Jagar Tharn.\nBarenziah knew that Tharn had split the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; into eight parts and hidden them in several obscure places. She used Tharn's diary to figure out where he'd hidden the pieces of the staff. After the last location was discovered, she and her children escaped the Imperial City with King &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Afraid of public scandal, Tharn did nothing to prevent their escape. Barenziah later married King Eadwyre, becoming the queen of Wayrest. Eadwyre adopted her children &lt;a href=\"Helseth\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;.\nQueen of Wayrest.\nDuring her time in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; her biography was still banned. King &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; was gathering information on all &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;'s royal families and managed to get a copy of the &lt;a href=\"Biography%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Gortwog was not the only one looking for secrets. The necromancer, the &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;, was also interested in the book. One of his minions stole the book.\nAfraid of creating a major issue in the Wayrest Court, Barenziah asked &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;'s agent to retrieve the biography. For the agent's help, she offered him information on the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The scandalous book was finally Barenziah's again, and the agent got the information for the Emperor.\nBack to Morrowind.\nSeveral years after the Second &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; Effect, King &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt; passed away, leaving the throne of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; to be fought over by his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt; and his adopted son, &lt;a href=\"King%20Helseth\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt;. Elysana gained the crown and banished Helseth and Barenziah from Wayrest. They returned to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Barenziah's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, had already married the King of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; and was no longer living in Wayrest.\nSometime after the arrival of Barenziah and Helseth in Mournhold, Helseth's grand-uncle &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;King Llethan&lt;/a&gt;, died. Helseth then took over the reign, and became the new King of Morrowind. Although there has never been any official inquiry or proof, many citizens who were loyal to the old king claim Helseth poisoned Llethan.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine was attacked by a Dark Brotherhood assassin. The Nerevarine tracked the assassin to Mournhold and ultimately, King Helseth. The king was threatened by the power and influence of Morrowind's new hero. After a bit of manipulation, Helseth managed to get the Nerevarine on his side to face yet another threat, the mad goddess, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this time that Barenziah met the hero of Red Mountain, offering wise council and guidance to the Nerevarine.\nIt is not known how, when or if she died, but mentions of her alive (as well as those of Helseth) cease after the catastrophic events following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Dunmer-Argonian war&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace\"&gt;her Palace&lt;/a&gt; had remained completely unoccupied for some time by &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;."}

Barilzar is well-renowned for having knowledge in Clockwork Magic and for being the former-apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. Barilzar has studied various subjects such as Portal Magic and even the prolonging of life.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarilzar's origin &amp; the Clockwork Apostles.\nIn his youth, Barilzar had worked as an apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. Barilzar worked with other people as the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostles\"&gt;Clockwork Apostles&lt;/a&gt;. Barilzar's experience in the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; had left an impact on him for quite some time, taking appreciation to all the bits and pieces that make up the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the area. Barilzar's past before becoming an Apostle is unknown, but it can be assumed that he had lived in the Brass Fortress for his entire life. He would constantly have nightmares where he would appear miniscule and weaker, but he persisted in his role as an Apostle. At one point, Sotha Sil had called upon Barilzar to test the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Analyses%20of%20the%20Exalted%20Enigmas\"&gt;Nine Analyses of the Exalted Enigmas&lt;/a&gt;, which were designed to test the limits of Sotha Sil's divine power. Barilzar was not able to comprehend what they were doing but was still in awe of Sotha Sil's presence. As time went on, Sotha Sil created various inventions that inspired Barilzar. Barilzar eventually experienced everything the Clockwork City had to offer and yearned for more. He began to study the ability to prolong life, which would then prompt him to take up his own experiments. After an incident with a couple of &lt;a href=\"Factotum\"&gt;Factotum&lt;/a&gt;s, Barilzar decided to leave the Clockwork Apostles and explore beyond the Clockwork City, to the larger world of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Barilzar would be one of the very few people to leave the Radius and explore Tamriel.\nBarilzar's Time in Vvardenfell &amp; the Vivec Situation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Barilzar was a retired apprentice of Sotha Sil, one of the Tribunal. He left his home at the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; to continue his own research, once being a part of the Clockwork Apostles. The fact he was able to leave the Clockwork City is a feat all on its own. Only powerful people such as &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt; were able to move to and fro from the realms of Sotha Sil. Barilzar took refuge on the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; tower of &lt;a href=\"Odirniran\"&gt;Odirniran&lt;/a&gt;, located along &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;. From there he remained isolated, tinkering away with the knowledge he had gained from his time as a Clockwork Apostle. Barilzar was not a well-organized person, constantly losing track of things, prompting him to hire assistants and apprentices, to help him in his studies. Barilzar's name had begun to spread all across Vvardenfell. When &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s divine power had started to fade away. &lt;a href=\"Archcanon%20Tarvus\"&gt;Archcanon Tarvus&lt;/a&gt; had sent an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Outlander&lt;/a&gt; to Odirniran, to garner help from Barilzar, whose rituals had radiated power similar to Vivec's energy.\nBarilzar's Tonal Inverter &amp; Conoon Chodala.\nThe Ashkhan of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe\"&gt;Urshilaku Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conoon%20Chodala\"&gt;Conoon Chodala&lt;/a&gt; had come into possession of &lt;a href=\"Sunna%27rah\"&gt;Sunna'rah&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful staff that drained the divine powers of Vivec. The Outlander was sent to Barilzar by order of Tarvus, to find a way to counteract the staff. Barilzar needed to create a &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Inverter\"&gt;Tonal Inverter&lt;/a&gt;, and so he sent three of his assistants, one of which was &lt;a href=\"Volrina%20Quarra\"&gt;Volrina Quarra&lt;/a&gt;, to ruins on each corner of Vvardenfell. However, all of the assistants either failed or were killed in their missions. Eventually, the Outlander was able to collect each component and Barilzar created the Tonal Inverter. With the Inverter, the Outlander and &lt;a href=\"Seryn\"&gt;Seryn&lt;/a&gt;, the sister of Chodala, confronted the Ashkhan at the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kaushtarari\"&gt;Kaushtarari&lt;/a&gt;. He intended to commune with &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, though it would be revealed later that he was under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, who made the Ashkhan believe that he was the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the two warriors used the Tonal Inverter and killed Conoon Chodala.\nJourney to the Clockwork City &amp; Barbas the Hound.\nWith Sunna'rah, Archcanon Tarvus had siphoned the divine energy of Sotha Sil and revealed himself as &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;, the Hound of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. With the siphoned energy, Barbas heads for the Clockwork City, into the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt; where the celestiosphere of the Clockwork City was located. Both the Outlander and Barilzar delved into &lt;a href=\"Seht%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Seht's Vault&lt;/a&gt;, a dungeon in the Clockwork City, to encounter Barbas. The pair had to face several fabricants to reach the Inner Sanctum. In the end, Barilzar and the Outlander battled Barbas and defeated him. The Outlander had encountered a shrine of Clavicus Vile somewhere else in Tamriel, hinting at future events. Barilzar, along with other friends of the Outlander had appeared before &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, where they were honored for their achievements. Barilzar was given a bag of magical gemstones with teleportation properties. Barilzar was also given an extra step of mastering teleportation magic, eventually creating &lt;a href=\"Barilzar%27s%20Mazed%20Band\"&gt;Barilzar's Mazed Band&lt;/a&gt;, a ring that wields the power to transport between time and space, even into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The Mazed Band eventually proved to be his demise.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarilzar and the Curse of the Mazed Band.\nWith Barilzar's death, he was taken to an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Crypt\"&gt;Abandoned Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, located somewhere within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mournhold\"&gt;Old Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, underneath the modern-day city-state of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. It was here, Barilzar had become a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, wasting away with the Abandoned Crypt, with the sole purpose of protecting the Mazed Band. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior who was revealed to be the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; was given the order of retrieving Barilzar's Mazed Band, by order of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; herself. But when the Nerevarine arrived into the Abandoned Crypt, Barilzar had attacked them, cursing their name and protecting the Mazed Band. Unfortunately, Barilzar was defeated by the Nerevarine, and the Mazed Band was secured by Almalexia, who would later be killed as foretold in the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. The Mazed Band had fallen into obscurity, eventually ending up in &lt;a href=\"Forelhost\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt;, in southeastern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. So ended Barilzar's legacy.\nLegacy.\nBarilzar was a very extraordinary person, with vast amounts of talent, enough to become recognized by Sotha Sil and the Tribunal. Barilzar's accomplishments had exceeded himself, being one of the very few people to move between the Clockwork City and Tamriel, as well as, pioneering teleportation magic. The Mazed Band, though it may be dangerous, proved to be the only vital source of entering the Clockwork City. The Mazed Band was able to move between Nirn and Oblivion, which is something minimal people were able to do, or at least without such bravado (i.e., the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;). Not only that, but the Tonal Inverter was another noteworthy invention, able to drain the divine energy from the Tribunal. It is unknown whether it can be used onto other deities. He would not have been able to create it without being the apprentice of Sotha Sil."}

The place continues to fill me with awe and wonder, perhaps to an even greater degree than when I first set foot inside the tiny, domed complex. At first, I couldn't shake the crushing fear that accompanied my initial entry into the city. I was terrified of the shrinking process and the thought of being turned into a miniscule version of myself gave me nightmares for days before the transition was set to take place. And when it occurred, I'm slightly embarrassed to admit, the sensation of shrinking didn't exactly agree with me. I suppose I shouldn't have had such a big breakfast right before, but the scrib jelly on wickwheat toast smelled so good!\nSo many things to get used to, working in the Clockwork City! First off, everything is made of metal, though sometimes the forms and shapes can deceive the eye into thinking an object is composed of an entirely different substance. Second, we utilize sequence plaques instead of paper for inscribing notes and maintaining records. Very much in keeping with the aesthetics of the place. Third, the jargon developing within this small, closed community would be almost impossible to understand if I hadn't been here when it started to take root. Allusions and metaphors concerning clockwork mechanics fill our conversations and punctuate our statements. It even slips into our humor, such as it is. Sometimes it even feels like we're trying to upstage one another with who can construct the most perfect turn-of-gear phrase, but who could ever imagine that Clockwork Apostles would compete with one another? Well, except for that Albacron. He's a netch's arse.\nLord Seht requested my assistance in an unusual series of experiments today. He calls them his Nine Analyses of the Exalted Enigmas. I'm still trying to align my gears with his godly contemplations, but the experiments seem designed to test the limits of Sotha Sil's divine power. He outlined the entire series as he imagines them, but we only conducted the first of the experiments today. It was fascinating, even if I couldn't comprehend more than half of what I witnessed. Perhaps additional understanding will dawn as we conduct the remaining eight experiments. And I hope something explodes. I love explosions!\nLord Seht develops the most interesting and practical tools. When he required a tool to drain away minute bits of his own divine energy to store and study, he crafted one to his exact specifications. When he desired an instrument to measure the precise distance between different \"locations\" in Oblivion, he crafted that, too. What about a device for recording and analyzing our surroundings? He calls that his \"perception tabulator.\" I hope to one day be able to invent and craft devices that are half as useful as the contraptions he throws together when he's bored or even working on something else. He's the ultimate multitasker!\nThe longer I spend in the Clockwork City, the more I come to appreciate it as a wonder and a miracle! From its brass tunnels to its glass domes, its metal plating to its giant gears, I can barely begin to understand all of its potential\u2014and I'm one of the apostles helping to expand and fine tune the construction! Other than the tasteless paste the city provides as the only source of nutrition, the place is nearly perfect. It makes me sad to realize that I'd need a hundred lifetimes to study and understand even a third of what was required to design and construct this marvelous invention. I wonder, could I extend my life in order to continue the work I've dedicated myself to? Something to research at some future date.\nNovice Kellu attempted to add a sense of humor to the factotum personality sequencing. It went as well as can be expected. Of the three factotums she attempted to enhance with her whimsical algorithms, one exploded, one ran into the Radius and hasn't been seen since, and the third stands in the corner and mutters to itself. The words are low and hard to understand, but I'm sure I heard the poor mechanical repeating \"knock, knock\" over and over again.\nMaybe it's time to take my leave and find my own place in the larger world."}

After consideration of such rumors, and after much research and expedition into the Root Systems to see the Gnarl in their natural habitat firsthand, this author will elucidate the ecology and culture of the Gnarl, the nature of the Root System, and their symbiotic relationship.\nThe Root System:Commonly believed to be a series of natural caverns and rock formations with roots and foliage growing within, the Root System tunnels are, in fact, part of a giant living organism. Not only are these tunnels a living organic root-like entity, but each of the so-called \"root dungeons\" represents a smaller piece of a larger whole. The roots of all the trees (indeed of most the plant life on the Isles) all connect directly to the large Root System.\nThe various twisting and turning tunnels have been created slowly over past millennia. Indeed, the growth and motion of the roots is imperceptible, though definitely recordable. The very fastest-growing tunnels increase at a rate of a few feet every month, and the slowest a few inches every few decades.\nAmber:Amber is a colorful resin formed from hardened sap. Much like skin bleeds and scabs over to protect a wound, the Root System tunnels \"bleed\" a sap that congeals and hardens into Amber deposits. Even still, the walls of the roots are very resilient; swinging a sword at the wall is not enough to puncture it. The large fissures that cause the appearance of Amber are the result of the massive pressures and frictional forces encountered by the giant roots as they push through tons of rock and dirt.\nThe Gnarl:The current and best theory describes the Gnarl as the caretakers and stewards of the Root System. The creatures tend to the general maintenance and cleaning of the tunnels, clearing away excess Amber. This behavior has been observed directly, but observation time was limited due to the aggressive nature of the Gnarl. However, the abundance of Amber found on the corpses of the creatures further supports this view.\nThere has been some conjecture, though at present very little evidence to support the claim, that as Gnarl grow, they eventually become too large to maneuver the tunnels, and eventually fuse with the walls, becoming themselves part of the Root System. As to the recent claims of giant Gnarl, it should be noted that no creditable sources exist to corroborate. However, even were these reports to be true, the rarity of such sightings would suggest that only a very few Gnarl ever grow large enough to ascend to this root-state.\nLittle is known about the natural life span of the Gnarl or their social behavior, since observational expeditions into the Root System are difficult at best. We do know with certainty that they are very territorial. The Gnarl are so protective of their tunnels that they will respond aggressively to anyone who comes within sight, which makes studying their social systems nigh impossible. This behavior has, however, provided us with an abundance of corpses to study at our leisure.\nWhen we analyze the corpses of dead Gnarl, we can see clearly that these creatures are made entirely of plant material. They are covered in bark and leaves, and over time they decompose similarly to other plant detritus. All attempts to \"plant\" Gnarl or parts thereof into the ground have been proven simple folly. To date, we don't actually know how the Gnarl reproduce.\nUpon examination, we have found nothing that looks like a brain as found in other sentient creatures. This does lend credence to the symbiotic caretaker theory, suggesting a kind of hive mentality -- though there have been no substantiated sightings of any such \"queen-Gnarl\" who might be controlling the drones. The other available explanation is that it is magic that animates these creatures, though this author finds resolving difficult questions in this manner to be counter-productive to the development of a rational theory.\nConclusion:The complex Root is a living organism that grows little by little each month, tunneling beneath the land. Virtually all the plant life on the Isles is connected to this Root System. Severe trauma to the system walls results in the formation of Amber deposits as part of its natural defense mechanism. The Root System has a symbiotic relationship with the Gnarl, who act as its protectors and caretakers, and who may be phyletically and physiologically connected to the Root System itself. In short, we have a living system, with its own dedicated staff of protector-caretakers, growing and developing largely unnoticed beneath our very feet.\n[Here the editors wish to acknowledge that the author was found dead near the entrance to one of the \"root dungeons.\" We again wish to remind the reader that the opinions expressed by this author are his own. While we do not dismiss the rational method employed by the author in his studies, we certainly do not deny that magic is explanation enough for Our &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Sheogorath\"&gt;Lord Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;'s many wondrous Blessings. We did, however, carefully consider omitting this clearly treasonous second half. We have decided to include it for journalistic integrity and at the request of his generous widow.]\nAfterword:And now, I will venture towards that theoretical discussion which draws near heresy (which I daresay will one day be the end of me), but which I must put forward, for good or ill.\nThe common belief is that our Lord Sheogorath has blessed our land with two temperaments, &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;. However, after much study and reasoning, I believe that it is the very realm itself that imposes upon us these two spheres of polar extremes!\nI have devised a clever experiment, whereby I seek to prove this theory. If you take a flower from a common plant, cut it and place its stem in water with dye in it, you will notice that the petals will slowly take on the color of the dye. Clearly, the veins of the plant transport the color to the leaves.\nNow, when we look at the Dementia side of the land, colors are muted and dark, and in the Mania side bright and colorful. I believe the Root System, and the Gnarl that serve it, are draining the color from the land of Dementia and giving it to the land of Mania!\nFor what purpose, it isn't clear, but my experiment shows how color is transported through plant veins, and what bigger system of plant veins is there than the giant Root System tunnel network? Is it not then obvious that this System is the conduit of the forces of Mania and Dementia?\nAnd do we not eat the plants and the fruit of the trees that connect to the Root System and the beasts that feed on them, and drink the waters that fall from their leaves? Do we not breathe the air that carries their spores and seeds? Do we not throw our own waste onto the ground to be absorbed into the soil? Thus, are we not intimately connected to the giant Root System under our feet? Surely, we are one with it!\nClearly, the Root System is feeding those of us in the Mania brilliant color, giving us our mood swings, filling our hearts with passions and sensations, and giving us powerful urges by stealing these things from our fellows in Dementia, leaving them dark, desperate, angry, violent, and disturbed!\nSheogorath is not the source of our \"gifts.\" It is the land itself that has unbalanced us so!\nThe Gnarl are the servants and lifeblood of this parasitic process.\nIf we were to kill all the Gnarl, the balance would be restored!\nMania would be less bright, true, but so would Dementia be less dark.\nWe and our world would become whole again!\nLet go of your belief in the collective fantasy of Sheogorath!\nLet go of your belief in your own special \"gifts!\"\nWe must destroy the Gnarl and the Root System!\nWe must destroy those who shackle us to belief in some haughty and aloof ruler, who toys with our emotions and well-being!\nTo arms, brothers and sisters!\nTo arms!"}

To chase a rumor? We need those troops to protect Shornhelm!\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"Only some of them, Baron. My father would have done the same. Captain Janeve will discover the truth and report back.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Countess, Baron, please. We must remain focused. As long as Montclair controls the upper city, the whole region remains at risk.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"How can we trust you, Count Ravenwatch? Your friendship with Montclair is well known. What did you offer those captains to betray us?\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"I care for the Count even less than you, Baron, but he hasn't done anything to warrant such accusations\u2014yet.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"We must end this debate and take action! Make an example of the two traitors and retake the upper city! How can the two of you not see that?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"I do not disagree, Baron, but we need to proceed with caution. There is more to this situation than meets the eye. I know I make you both nervous. Perhaps we should continue this after our blood has cooled.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"Mind your tempers, gentlemen. We have a visitor. Come forward, friend, and state your business.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Bah! You both try my patience. I can almost understand what drove Montclair to abandon our triumvirate.\"\nHostages:\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"This Reezal-Jul seized nobles! Such brazen acts must not be tolerated, Baron!\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Indeed. It is time to act, Countess. No more talk. No more debate.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"How can we walk in the Light if we leave innocent townsfolk to languish ... wait, are you agreeing with me?\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Don't look so shocked, Eselde. It was bound to happen eventually. Our friend will go to the Mews to free the hostages and stop the reinforcements while we assault the upper city. A two-pronged approach.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"Well, all right then. Baron, if you would. Give the command and rally the Shornhelm Guard.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"It will be my pleasure! It's time to show those Montclair cowards what it means to betray the people of Rivenspire!.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"One moment, friend. I may know something about the Fevered Mews.\"\nGwendis: \"Tell us you found something, hero. We could use some good news.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"I'm not interested in news. Just tell me you found a way to get us into those tunnels.\"\nSkordo the Knife: \"Lleraya has been here all along? And your son didn't do a damn thing about it?\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"According to Ellic's journal, yes. He seems to have been infested with the woman. Didn't even get alarmed when she started turning people into bloodfiends.\"\nSkordo the knife: \"More bloodfiends? I hate this. Just give me something to hit already! But it doesn't sound like your son betrayed Northpoint, Baron.\"\nGwendis: \"\"It's the Remnant. It put Ellic under her spell. I'm surprised he was even able to write in his journal.

Dozens fell to these monsters because you couldn't ignore a pretty face!\"\nLord Ellic Dorell: \"I never meant for anyone to get hurt. I'm not even sure what happened. Lleraya said she wanted to help and I ... I'm sorry.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Apologies won't bring our people back. It won't return honor to our family name. Guards! Take Ellic away. You are dead to me, Ellic. Dead to me.\"\nLord Ellic Dorell: \"I'm sorry I disappointed you, Father. It won't happen again.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"The large door, straight ahead. Clearly, that's the main entrance. That's the wau we should proceed.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"This door is closer. It could provide a shorter path. Perhaps fewer bloodfiends to contend with.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"I'd rather cut through the enemies I can see than walk blindly into something I can't. The ruins might be full of traps!\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"My dear Baron, you have an annoying habit of never listening to a word I say. You'll do as you please. As usual.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"This is where it happened. Where Leila died and Montclair ... changed.\"\nGwendis: \"Where are Montclair's forces? I thought for sure we'd have to fight a horde of bloodfiends to make it through this place.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Montclair is a strategist. He's waiting for us to make a mistake that he can take advantage of. I fear tat mistake is about to be made.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Soldiers, spread out! Secure the chamber!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"You should have heeded my warning, Baron. This is no place for you.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"You would deny our moment of glory, Count?

How does it feel?\"\n[After the battle]\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"My wife ... my daughter ... you've taken everything I ever loved, Verandis!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"Wylon, I'm sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen.\"\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"My daughter loved you, Verandis. She loved you!\"\nGwendis: \"\"The Remnant ... the power. It drove Lleraya insane!

We can find a way to free you from this power.\"\nBaron Wylon Montclair: \"To what end, my old friend? My wife is dead. My daughter, killed by your own hand. What do I have, if not this power? I think I'd prefer to let you experience my pain. My suffering. To let you see what it's like to lose everything you hold dear!\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"No, Montclair!

Please!\"\nDarien Gautier: \"All right, everyone. Let's gather up our injured and get out of here.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"Darien's right. There's nothing left for us here.
