The large floating satellite is located above the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, suspended only by the power of the god-king &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, and later by the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;. The Ministry of Truth holds prisoners that are dangerous to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBaar Dau was a large moonlet sent to destroy &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; by the Daedric Prince, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. When Vivec saw Baar Dau falling from the sky, he merely lifted his hand and it froze above the city. Instead of destroying the meteor, Vivec decided to keep it above his city so that if the people of Vivec ever stopped loving him, the meteor would descend on them and destroy them all.\nWhen Vivec disappeared during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; around the very end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Ministry became unstable. Two &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;, made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; to create a device known as the Ingenium, which would keep it afloat. The device used souls as power to keep the Ministry suspended in air. At first, only the captured souls of outlaws and prisoners were used, but eventually innocent people were as well. Sometime between &lt;a href=\"4E%204\"&gt;4E 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, when Sul's lover &lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt; was sacrificed by Vuhon, he attempted to save her from the Ingenium. This caused the device to be destroyed and subsequently nothing kept the Ministry afloat, resulting in it violently crashing into the city of Vivec and completely destroying it, creating an area known as Scathing Bay. The vibrations from the crash caused &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to erupt, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;. Most of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; was and covered with ash or burning in flames, forcing its few surviving residents to flee off of the island. This event is said to be the final contributor in officially ending the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;'s worship in Morrowind.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehra%20Milo%20and%20the%20Lost%20Prophecies\"&gt;Mehra Milo and the Lost Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Caius%20Cosades%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caius Cosades&lt;/a&gt; was recalled to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. He wants to find the lost prophecies and deliver them to &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt;. His parting orders are to go to the Hall of Wisdom and Justice, where &lt;a href=\"Mehra%20Milo\"&gt;Mehra Milo&lt;/a&gt; will explain how to get the lost prophecies. He says she is being watched, and if something has gone wrong, she will leave a message under the code word \"amaya.\""}

Always a target of suspicion and fear because of their size and strength, they were redefined by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; as \"monsters\" during the early and middle &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and classed alongside creatures such as &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s. They were driven into the hills and forests, and their previous culture was lost. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, Minotaurs are said to roam the backwoods and hills of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are also known as \"Men of Tor\" or \"Men of Taur,\" a possible etymological root of the word. Most of their culture and history is lost to the ages. They have a good sense of smell (able to track a Man by scent alone), are very physically strong and possess a slight &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Magic\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvidence suggests that the decline of their culture was caused by proto-&lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial troops&lt;/a&gt;. They have several weapons and clothing of their own, live tribally, and some of their members can utilize magic. The scholar &lt;a href=\"Nonus%20Caprenius\"&gt;Nonus Caprenius&lt;/a&gt; defends a peculiar and not widely accepted theory. He describes ancient documents that link the Slave-Queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; to the demigod &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, who is often depicted as a Minotaur. According to Caprenius, their relationship gave origin to the \"Man-Bull\" &lt;a href=\"Belharza\"&gt;Belharza&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelharza is recognized as the firstborn of Alessia and Morihaus, as well as her heir as &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Caprenius' argument speaks of a bloodline link between the Alessian dynasty and the present-day Minotaurs, as the race began to appear in the years during and after the Empress' reign. He asserts that the early Minotaurs were very intelligent and cultured, in their own way, and that they were fiercely loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, among Empress Alessia's most devoted defenders. It is said that much of the possible evidence for Nonus Caprenius' theory was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, as the Order's persecution of non-Human cultures was not restricted to &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;. From field observations during the Second Era, Minotaur are seen congregating at or near ancient sites of significance to the Empire, which is pointed as \"instinctual memory of a time when they were fierce defenders of the fledgling Empire.\" By the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Minotaurs are said to not be particularly intelligent, and are described as \"cruel Man-eaters.\""}

Ambassador Linyedil confirms that the new date will ensure that the silks from &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt; will now arrive in time to give all the attendees ample time to commission new attire.\nThough not attending, a letter from Councilor Vandacia indicates he has elected to remain in &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; where he believes he can be more effective in helping manage the iron crisis in the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew affairs:\nChief Concilor Lividicus notes for the record that this month's balance sheet indicates that discretionary spending by the Empress-Regent and her advisors has increased seven-fold over the annual expenditures from Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen&lt;/a&gt;'s reign. The Chief Councilor makes a motion that General Nipia send an armed escort and forcibly ensure that Advisor Tharn attends the next council meeting. General Nipia strongly advises against such a course of action. The matter is held to a vote and the motion is denied.\nAfter the vote, Councilor Abor says she's feeling ill, possibly from ingesting spoiled mudcrab in this morning's brunch at the Temple of the Divines. Councilor Abor excuses herself from the meeting.\nAmbassador Jadier Plourde again petitions the council to order the Seventh Legion to withdraw from Bangkorai immediately. Councilor Jirich makes a motion for the matter to be raised with the Legionary's Council. The matter is held to a vote and affirmed. Chief Councilor Lovidicus asks General Nipia to raise the matter the next time the Legionary's Council convenes. The general says it's not scheduled to convene again until First Seed of next year, but he promises to raise the matter at that time.\nGeneral Nipia informs the council that rumors continue to circulate about a conspiracy of traitors within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s. He requests that the council provide funds for his lieutenants to conduct a thorough internal investigation. No councilor volunteers to make a motion.\nGeneral Nipia wants to speak about the matter in greater detail, but his statement is interrupted by a series of significant groundquakes. Captain Norbanus of the Imperial City Guard enters the council chamber to report that a \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt;\" has descended just outside the city and that several &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; have been spotted in the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20District\"&gt;Nobles District&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to this report, Councilor Faleria makes a motion that the council meeting be adjourned so the situation can be assessed. The motion is held to a vote and affirmed, but Chief Councilor Lovidicus vetoes the motion.\nChief Councilor Lovidicus says the council meeting cannot be adjourned until a vote has been held on High Magistrate Muspidus's request to add Metheglin Perfume to the water supply in the sewers to help alleviate the city-wide stench believed to have been caused by the extra week of feasting during &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt; this year. Councilor Itinia makes a motion to add the perfume. The motion is held to a vote and affirmed.\nCouncilor Faleria again makes a motion to adjourn the meeting. The motion is held to a vote and affirmed. This meeting of the Elder Council is adjourned."}

Dhavin mutters something about bears that could be construed as a call to order.\nA Spontaneous Presentation.\nThe clean-shaven Ulrorn Blackbeard requests the floor. As silence (or ongoing chatter) is taken for agreement in Cyrodilic law, the floor is granted. Ulrorn apologizes for his behavior at the previous meeting, pleading an excess of drink and some childhood training in the Art of Conjuration.\nThree Motions from the Chair.\nDhavin moves that Ulrorn is kind of a jerk. The motion is seconded. A vote is taken without debate. The motion passes unanimously, 10-1.\nDhavin further moves that, due to the series of events that prematurely ended last month's meeting, Ulrorn should buy the first round. This motion also passes unanimously, 10-1.\nFinally, Dhavin moves that after the untimely fire at the Broken Arrow Tavern and Grill, we shall henceforth be known as the Lusty &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; Historical Society after our quaint new location. The motion passes 6-5.\nPresentation: Arielle Woodhouse on the Dragon Break.\nThe lively and entertaining Arielle Woodhouse proposes several theories about how the existence of so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;s\" could be determined once and for all (as if any serious scholar still believed in such a ridiculous notion). Her arguments depend on whether &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; controls time for \"everything\" or if the various &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; (and \"perhaps certain related natural processes, like the oceans and falling dust and things like that\") could still act when Akatosh is broken or sleeping or having a smoke or whatever it is he does or does not do during these alleged \"breaks.\"\nFor instance, Arielle suggests that if tapestries and paintings from the later part of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; showed the constellations differently, this could be taken as evidence that time continued in some sense, at least for the et'Ada in the heavens.\nArielle presents flaky evidence for this notion consisting of sketches of various paintings and tapestries of constellations (or that coincidentally have some stars in the background). These sketches are densely covered with lines, dates, overlays of modern constellations, etc.\nI gently remind Arielle that few paintings (not to mention tapestries!) survived from the First Era, certainly far fewer than the number of defaced sketches she brought, so the whole point is moot. Unfortunately, Arielle continues to believe the paintings are genuine, even though she admits that some of them are mere copies of earlier works.\nJo'Hamiir suggests that Arielle look at the works of some obscure and irrelevant &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; who hid some kind of secret message in tapestries. The significance of these hidden messages is lost to the LAHS as the &lt;a href=\"betmer\"&gt;betmer&lt;/a&gt; rambles (for longer than it takes me to go through two mugs!) about fanciful relationships between the &lt;a href=\"Birthsign\"&gt;constellations&lt;/a&gt; and the moons and &lt;a href=\"The%20Towers\"&gt;towers&lt;/a&gt; of all kinds.\nYour humble scribe moves that Jo'Hamiir has been taking the sugar again. Most unfairly, the motion is not seconded.\nArielle moves that Jo'Hamiir prepare a presentation on this topic. Dhavin seconds the motion, and, most unfortunately, it passes. (I, for one, have heard just about as much as I can take of what passes for \"scholarship\" among the beast races.)\nJo'Hamiir makes an appeal based on a busy work schedule, but, alas, his appeal falls on blunt ears.\nJulius draws upon his archeological experience at &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;Dwemer ruins&lt;/a&gt;. He points out that &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; Orreries often contain metal plates with constellations engraved upon them. These plates, he assures the LAHS, show the stars in roughly the same location they are in today. Since the Dwemer left 600 years before the first so-called \"Dragon Break,\" this strongly suggests that the stars do not move, and that Arielle is completely and utterly wrong. Again. Arielle does not have an adequate response to these objections, and, desperate to save her crazy theory, she suggests that the Dwemer were somehow engraving the stars of the future rather than those of the present day.\nVarinturco suggests that the painters were merely ignorant of astronomy or perhaps idealized the constellations for artistic effect. Arielle claims this is unlikely because of various \"consistencies among the inconsistencies\" (!) in the tapestries and she returns to pointing at the sketches and talking about Akatosh-knows-what because I stopped listening at this point in favor of few rounds of cards with Gondyr. Your humble scribe remains undefeated, and Gondyr falls further in debt.\nArielle's passionate, truthful, and exciting presentation with immediate implications for our daily lives is too intense for many present, especially once the food arrives. The end of her presentation is met with loud snores of approval and favorable chewing sounds.\nGondyr moves that Arielle should have a few more drinks.\nDhavin moves that Gondyr has ulterior motives. Ulrorn seconds the motion with a humorous gesture.\nBefore Dhavin's motion can be voted on, Arielle moves her (still full) mug at Ulrorn's head. Her motion easily passes without a vote, revealing the quality workmanship of the tavern walls. After having passed, the motion is redundantly seconded by an empty mug and two chicken bones.\nA serving girl takes the floor and moves that the LAHS \"quiet down.\" She withdraws the motion after receiving a sum of twenty &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Septims&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Presenter Absent.\nThoroth surprised no one in failing to show up again. Therefore, whatever drunken ramblings he will try to pass off as a presentation will have to wait for another night.\nThe Debate.\nThe evening's debate was on whether a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;'s protonymic changes or remains constant.\nGondyr argues that the protonymic is an \"essential\" part of a Daedra and that changing the protonymic would change the Daedra. Since the Daedric \"Princes\" have been unchanged (with the possible exception of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, of course) for many years, this suggests (to Gondyr's fevered imagination) that the protonymic is \"as unchanging and eternal as the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Admantium Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nUlrorn shows unexpected insight when he says, \"Its name may change, but if you banish a &lt;a href=\"Scamp\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;, it's still a Scamp.\" After some slurred explanations, he is apparently asserting that the changes necessary to alter a Daedra's protonymic are smaller than the changes necessary to alter a Daedra's nature. Or, in other words, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; would still be the morning and evening star, even if her protonymic changed. &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; would still govern insights, even with another protonymic. Etc. Gondyr tries to argue against Ulrorn (which is surely not a difficult task), but he is distracted by a passing serving girl and loses the floor.\nShahavra tells a fanciful tale about an unfortunate Dagi who lazily summoned the same daedroth twice and painfully learned that the protonymic only works once. This would favor the idea that the protonymic does change, if the Khajiit were not all liars.\nDhavin points out that various Daedra have had their protonymics discovered in the past. He argues that since no Daedra \"Princes\" are currently enslaved, this suggests that the protonymic is, as he puts it, a \"one trick pony.\"\nUlrorn moves that Dhavin spends too much time with horses. Ulrorn withdraws this motion under threat of Dhavin's long memory and fertile imagination.\nJulius idly asks if &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; have protonymics. Varinturco boldly asserts that of course Aedra have protonymics (and, in fact, the fool argues that all living things do!), but that the protonymics of Aedra, &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; cannot be \"spelled, pronounced, or ennumerated\" in the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. Not only would it be ineffective, it would be literally unknowable. Varinturco claims to be quoting a book by some crazy &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; who lives in a giant clock, as if that gives his argument any additional weight. Varinturco rambles on about a \"neonymic\" (?) that is some kind of second protonymic, but he is, fortunately, interrupted.\nGondyr moves that Varinturco has had too much to drink. The motion is seconded by your humble scribe, but, alas, no vote is taken.\nArielle wonders if the act of banishment (due to the alleged dissolution of spirit) changes the nature of a Daedra enough to change their protonymic.\nQuiet, beautiful Orphala (if only she were not an Orethi!) tells a poignant, if all too brief, story about a Daedra she met in &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt; who feared banishment because he feared losing his love for another Daedra. Apparently, he believed that if he were banished, he would no longer be in love, for in the process of re-forming himself, he might forget his love or lose it. Orphala was not sure of the precise meaning of his words, but this suggests that the process is traumatic enough to change a Daedra's protonymic, if not their basic nature.\nIn light of this story, Gondyr and Dhavin enthusiastically agree with Arielle's theory. Even I, your humble scribe, cannot recall a counterexample for this idea, though I doubt anything regarding the Daedra it is so simple.\nDhavin moves that the LAHS vote on the idea that banishment itself changes the protonymic. The motion passes unanimously, in spite of Varinturco's repeated attempts to take the floor and discuss his \"neonymic\" notion.\nYour humble scribe moves that this unprecedented agreement is a cause for celebration. This motion also passes unanimously.\nDrinking ensues.\nJust to spoil the rare consensus, Artonia recalls a story about the mysterious disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt; several years ago. She heard a rumor from one of her aunts who was a &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; at the time (see what passes for scholarship these days?) that Mehrunes Dagon invaded the Battlespire(!), and he could resist his protonymic because he changed it or added some kind of surname (Varinturco begins shouting about that neonymic nonsense here again, but he is rightfully ignored). To prevent Mehrunes Dagon from reaching the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Battlemages broke the moorings, thus the \"disappearance\" (if the \"Battlespire\" was ever more than legend, anyway). This is no less plausible than any other story I've heard over the years, but how anyone could know the truth of it when there were no survivors (or public evidence of any kind) is beyond my understanding. In conclusion, Artonia asks whether forward-thinking Daedra could change their protonymic or add some kind of surname to protect themselves from mortals who have learned their true, invocational name.\nVarinturco finally gets his chance to take the floor, adding his febrile imaginings to Artonia's rumor. He claims to have met a survivor of the Battlespire (a man named, apparently, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Man%20Chimere\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;--and if that does not discredit this fanciful tale, I don't know what will). This \"Chimer\" (who is not a mer!) claims that Mehrunes Dagon did, indeed, attack the Battlespire (after cursing him to live forever or some such nonsense), and that he did, indeed, add a surname (or \"neonymic\" as Varinturco insists we call it) to his protonymic for additional protection. Varinturco goes on and on about the alleged trials of this \"Chimer\" and some &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;nameless hero&lt;/a&gt; (we've all heard that one before!), but there's no point recording it for posterity when the fool is obviously making it all up.\nVarinturco ends his rambling by moving that the LAHS summon Mehrunes Dagon, politely ask him his protonymic (and neonymic), banish him, summon him again, and \"see if it works.\" This practical and entirely harmless motion fails due to laughter preventing a quorum.\nMotion to Adjourn.\nDhavin moves to adjourn on the grounds that Varinturco's motion would not have been humorous if the hour was not far too late. The motion is seconded and passes.\nGondyr makes one final, desperate move towards Arielle, but the motion trips and falls 0-1 due to Ulrorn's foot.\nSun's Dusk, 3E 432.\nThe Roll Call.\nDhavin (chair)Vandril Indoril (your humble scribe)Thoroth (presenter)Shahavra (present)Gondyr Armentine (present)Artonia Melus (present)Varinturco (present)Arielle Woodhouse (present)Julius Cadiusus (present)Orphala Orethi (present)\nApproval of Minutes.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were approved after some trivial objections about \"personal comments\" and \"failing to record my presentation accurately.\" Your humble scribe has been told to \"shape up.\" Since no one else wants the job, it is an empty threat.\nThe Pledge and Call to Order.\nThoroth, whose drinking apparently started well before the meeting, leads the LAHS in the pledge. In deference to future generations, I shall not record his creative and non-traditional version.\nContinuing the general tone of scribe-bashing, Dhavin calls the meeting to order with the old joke about the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunalist&lt;/a&gt;, and the innkeep's daughter.\nOne Motion from the Chair.\nDhavin moves that the pledge, having reached its penultimate expression in Thoroth's drunken stutter this evening, no longer be required to open each meeting. The motion is seconded and passes 7-3.\nPresentation: Thoroth on Trees (and alot of Jagga).\nAs best as your humble scribe can tell, Thoroth's presentation is about trees. It is more of a religious service than a scholarly presentation. Thoroth arrived quite drunk, and continued to drink that horrible rot throughout his presentation. Although the presentation is amusing in its own way, it contains nothing of scholarly value, unless you're interested in the wide variety of trees that grow in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. And how they smell. And what kinds of bugs and birds live in each one. And how lovely they are, oh my, yes. And a thrilling heartbeat-by-heartbeat description of how they grow.\nI shall begin work on a presentation regarding the eleven varieties of ash in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Debate.\nAs fate decreed that the entire evening be wasted on frivolity, this evening's debate is on... how the city of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28City%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; got its name.\nGondyr recalls a story from his childhood (such scholarship!) that the first settlers to arrive in Daggerfall knew that the nation to the south was called \"&lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;\" after that old tale about &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt; being flung by some &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Dwemer chieftain&lt;/a&gt; or one of the Daedra or the first &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Anumidium&lt;/a&gt;, etc. These alleged settlers then thought (for whatever reason) that Daggerfall was even further from the alleged thrower and asked themselves, \"What could be thrown further than a hammer?\" A dagger, of course! So Volenfell becomes Hammerfell becomes Daggerfall. Clever. Since the half-breed witch-men couldn't find the right side of their horse, much less their southern neighbors, your scribe finds this story unlikely.\nShahavra the Ignorant Beast wonders if the name Hammerfell was in common use when Daggerfall was founded.\nYour humble scribe points out that so-called \"Volenfell\" is a bad translation of an &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;is name, and pre-dates the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, much less the &lt;a href=\"Yokudans\"&gt;Yokudans&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; half-breeds, and fanciful stories about hammers flying across the sky like dying gods.\nVarinturco moves that my grasp of Aldmeris is faulty and insists that I reveal my etymology (for the record, Vool Ineffel Direnn). I move that Varinturco is a no-talent hanger-on who would love to get a bit of real knowledge without paying the price. Varinturco suggests that my knowledge comes from \"a source in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\" and that is what it is worth. I strongly suggest that Varinturco forgets his manners, and should recall to whom he speaks, and the hands that lie behind. Dhavin moves that we both keep silent, and, most unfairly, this motion passes 8-2. I shall be silent, but I shall no forget.\nWhen the conversation returns to the dull debate, Dhavin wastes our time with a story from HIS childhood (!) about an early &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; chieftain who settled in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and marked the borders of his lands by how far he could throw a dagger.\nArielle the Modern Mechanist asks how far a dagger can be thrown, and whether this could actually encompass a kingdom or even a small city.\nDhavin admits that a dagger can't actually be thrown very far, but suggests that the city's name \"could have come from a dagger-throwing event of some kind.\" Or perhaps the chieftain was a &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;master of the thu'um&lt;/a&gt; (some kind of singing, I gather), and could throw daggers with his voice(!). While this notion is rightfully mocked, Dhavin claims that Ulrorn the Absent knows someone who has studied this &lt;a href=\"thu%27um\"&gt;thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, and that he will invite her to speak at the next meeting. Lovely.\nArtonia wonders if the name could be from a natural feature, such as a series of deadly (dagger) rapids or a waterfall that resembled a dagger in some way. There is only one problem with this theory... None of the LAHS have actually been to Daggerfall, and no one remembers hearing or reading anything about any falls or rapids nearby.\nMotion to Adjourn.\nSeveral rounds of debate ensue, but no actual facts are presented, and Dhavin finally moves to adjourn. An entire evening wasted.\nEvening Star, 3E 432.\nThe Roll Call.\nDhavin (chair)Arielle Woodhouse (scribe)Svontilda Loud-Laugh (presenter)Julius Cadiusus (present)Varinturco (present)Ulrorn Blackbeard (present)Gondyr Armentine (present)Jo'Hamiir (present)Shahavra (present)Orphala Orethi (present)Artonia Melus (present)Thoroth (present)Quiritonwe (present)Speaks-with-feathers (present)\nApproval of Minutes.\nThe minutes of the previous meeting were not approved for their harsh and uncollegial criticisms of fellow LAHS members.\nDuring an unusually fierce debate over the minutes, a poor choice of words from Vandril led Gondyr to believe that Vandril has been using marked cards in some sort of game between the two of them. Vandril more or less admitted to this and suggested that Gondyr lacked the wit to notice and therefore deserved to lose. This led to a quite undignified exchange of blows, after which Vandril left (swearing revenge and assassins and conjurations and all kinds of terrible things), and I tended to Gondyr's minor wounds.\nSince the LAHS required a new scribe, nominations were taken, followed by a vote. Gondyr nominated me, and as there were no other nominations or objections, I, Arielle Woodhouse, am the new scribe of the LAHS. I shall endeavor to be more faithful to the proceedings than my predecessor. I daresay the minutes may be less beer stained and in a more legible hand as well.\nThe Pledge and Call to Order.\nAs we have guests this evening (welcome Svontilda and Speaks-with-feathers!), the LAHS shall begin with our noble pledge:\nWe, the members of the Lusty Argonian Historical Society, an official chapter of the Tamriel Historical Society, do hereby pledge to study the past, to respect our ancestors, to seek the truth, to speak clearly, to listen patiently, to debate politely, and to drink and be merry.\nAfter recent events, I think we can all use a gentle reminder about why we are here.\nPresentation: Svontilda Loud-Laugh on the Thu'um\nUlrorn introduced a friend of his by the name of Svontilda who has made a study of the thu'um. Svontilda is a boisterous Nord and quite a character. She had no trouble holding the full attention of the LAHS, especially after promising not just a discussion of the thu'um, but an actual demonstration!\nThe general sense of Svontilda's speech is that a \"thu'um\" is a concentrated shout that can break things, move objects, and (at least in legend) sharpen blades, slay foes at a distance, and various seemingly magical deeds. The practice of the thu'um is called \"&lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;The Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;,\" and those who use it are called \"&lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;.\" Svontilda believes the Way of the Voice originally came from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, and that at least some of the legends about it are accurate, though much of the knowledge of the thu'um is now lost. True to her word, Svontilda breaks mugs from across the room, flips the pages of a book without touching it, makes Gondry's drawn sword ring as if struck, and knocks over a chair. Svontilda insists that she has only a basic understanding of the thu'um, and that a true master, even though much knowledge has been lost, can do much more.\nAfter the impressive demonstration, most of the questions naturally involve how to perform a thu'um, but Svontilda says that (ironically) the Way of the Voice cannot be described in words. Learning to make a thu'um requires extensive training and practice, and there is no simple \"trick\" to it.\nJo'Hamiir seems particularly intrigued by the demonstration and asks if anyone can learn the thu'um or if it is something only Nords (and Atmorans, if any survive) can do. Svontilda does not know, as she's never seen anyone other than a Nord trained in the thu'um. She speculates that anyone could learn to do it, and while it would be unusual for a Tongue to take an apprentice who is not a Nord, she does not know of any traditions that would prevent it.\nDhavin speculates that the thu'um may not be entirely natural. He lists several well-known accounts linking magic with music or song, and he suggests that when one learns the thu'um, one is actually learning a specialized kind of magic. Svontilda seems upset at this notion, and insists that the thu'um is entirely non-magical. However, when pressed, she cannot think of any reason why magic could not explain it. Dhavin asks if anyone born under the &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt; has learned the thu'um (which might suggest a non-magical nature), but Svontilda does not know the answer (she was born under the Thief, and her father, who taught her the thu'um was born under the Tower).\nVarinturco has some rather harsh criticisms of Svontilda's demonstration and even accuses her of trickery (of so-called \"stage\" magic, the kind of tricks sometimes used in lower class theaters that cannot afford Mages Guild fees). He claims that the demonstrated effects of the thu'um could have been done with magic or trickery, especially if she had an accomplice in the LAHS (for instance, someone else pushed the chair over or cast a telekenesis spell while everyone was looking at her). Svontilda offers to demonstrate again under whatever restrictions Varinturco deems necessary, but the Altmer claims that nothing will be necessary, as he already knows it is trickery.\nDhavin and I apologize to Svontilda for the Altmer's unfortunate attitude, and she is gracious enough to accept. Unfortunately, as no one has any further questions, Svontilda's presentation ends with these (surely baseless!) accusations.\nThe Debate.\nThe LAHS did not have a scheduled debate this evening, so the debate was mostly over what to debate. There was no final decision, though I did have several very interesting private conversations with LAHS members about the history of Tamriel. Perhaps some of them can be persuaded to turn their specialties into presentations for the edification of their fellow scholars. As these conversations were not officially part of the meeting, they were not recorded.\nMotion to Adjorn.\nThere was no official close to the meeting this evening, though the meeting was probably over long before Gondyr and I carried Dhavin and Ulrorn home in a borrowed wheelbarrow. A motion to restrict the quantity of drink may be needed."}

He came into possession of a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt; which in turn led him to servitude under Hermaeus Mora, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Knowledge and Fate, who taught him a means to &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;great power&lt;/a&gt;: a dragon shout capable of bending dragons to his will.\nWith this forbidden knowledge in his possession, Miraak turned on his dragon masters, using it, and his power as Dragonborn, to devour their souls to become ever more powerful. During the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient Nord heroes &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt; had pleaded for Miraak to use his power as Dragonborn to assist them in defeating &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. However, Miraak refused to do so and instead attempted his own rebellion against the dragons. Because of his betrayal, the dragons razed his &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; on Solstheim.\nHis rebellion was unsuccessful and he was defeated by another Dragon Priest named &lt;a href=\"Vahlok\"&gt;Vahlok&lt;/a&gt; who was then made his jailor, restraining him to Solstheim. Other accounts mention that just as Vahlok was about to kill Miraak, Hermaeus Mora saved him by transporting him to the realm of &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons then appointed Vahlok as ruler of the island, but not before he was compelled to swear an oath of vigilance to watch for Miraak's return, earning him the title \"The Jailor.\" Meanwhile, Miraak stayed in the realm of Apocrypha until he could amass enough power and influence to return to Solstheim, which he was able to do in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Miraak, under the appellation of the First Servant, convinced a &lt;a href=\"Cipher%20of%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Cipher of the Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cipher%20Sabinius\"&gt;Sabinius&lt;/a&gt;, to perform small favors such as retrieving books no one would miss in exchange for gold and help with his own ambitions. This continued until Sabinius was convinced to sabotage the scriptorium of &lt;a href=\"Quires%20Wind\"&gt;Quires Wind&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting both mortals and Daedra within using corrupted scrolls. The corruption was soon ended by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; after they collected both the corrrupted and blank scrolls and found Sabinius dead.\nPersonality.\nMiraak can be seen as a very arrogant and rash individual, believing that his Dragonborn heritage sets him above his former dragon masters. Upon meeting the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, he can claim that, compared to him, they have only killed a \"few dragons\" and do not yet know the true power of a Dragonborn such as himself (unless the main questline has been completed, in which case Miraak will grudgingly state admiration for the Dragonborn). He also believes himself above the servitude of Hermaeus Mora. Miraak is also a being that desires power, willing in the past to bind himself in servitude to Hermaeus Mora in order to gain forbidden knowledge and power.\nDespite, or perhaps due to, his arrogance, Miraak is shown to be a very powerful individual, as he was not only able to defy the Dragons he served, but he was also able to devour many of them before his defeat as a total of twenty-one different Dragon skeletons can be found both around and within his temple.\nMiraak proves to be fiercely independent and seems to be motivated solely by his lust for power. This can be seen not only through his initial betrayal of the Dragons at the height of their power, but also through his resistance to the effects of Apocrypha as it is said that all those who venture there become prisoners of their own thirst for knowledge and are unable to leave, whereas Miraak appeared unaffected.\nDuring his final battle with the Dragonborn, he claims that Hakon and the other ancient Nord heroes wished to use him to slay Alduin, but he chose not to for his own reasons. However, should Alduin have already been defeated upon meeting him, he will claim that he could have killed the World-Eater himself, a further sign of his arrogant nature.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;The Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;,\" two &lt;a href=\"Cultist\"&gt;Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s will call out and ask the Dragonborn if they are truly Dragonborn. After the conversation they will attack. After they are killed, a &lt;a href=\"Cultists%27%20Orders\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; with orders to kill the \"False\" Dragonborn in order to please Miraak will be found on one of their bodies. The quest will then be directed to the island of Solstheim.\nOnce on the island, asking around &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; will cause someone to suggest the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;Temple of Miraak&lt;/a&gt; be investigated. There it will be learned that Miraak has begun taking over the people of Solstheim using the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker%20Stones\"&gt;All-Maker Stones&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;The Temple of Miraak&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiraak himself is met for the first time at the end of this quest. Upon finding the \"\" in the depths of the temple, the Dragonborn will be transported to &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of Hermaeus Mora. Immediately, Miraak will &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonborn to their knees and claim that they do not know the true power of a Dragonborn. He then says that they can await his return like the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; before ordering his &lt;a href=\"seeker\"&gt;seeker&lt;/a&gt;s to transport the Dragonborn back to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and riding off on a &lt;a href=\"Sahrotaar\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, should the Dragonborn kill a dragon when he already possessed a dragon soul, either on Solstheim or in Skyrim, Miraak will briefly appear, taunt the Dragonborn, absorb the dragon's soul himself, and then disappear.\n&lt;a href=\"At%20the%20Summit%20of%20Apocrypha\"&gt;At the Summit of Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiraak appears one last time at the end of this quest to kill the Dragonborn and devour their soul so that he may return to Solstheim. Miraak begins with a short monologue as his dragon minions, &lt;a href=\"Relonikiv\"&gt;Relonikiv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kruziikrel\"&gt;Kruziikrel&lt;/a&gt;, sit perched upon the nearby arches.\nDuring the battle, the dragons circle the summit. Each time Miraak is near death, he will call down one of the dragons, devouring its soul to replenish his health. Once all three dragons have been devoured, he can finally be defeated.\nUpon his defeat, Hermaeus Mora appears, impaling him with a tentacle, and expresses his disappointment. Then Miraak disintegrates, leaving just a skeleton. Hermaeus Mora then transfers his status to the Last Dragonborn. The Dragonborn then absorbs Miraak's soul, which yields between five and ten dragon souls, plus any that Miraak may have stolen. Due to the soul absorption, he will only remain as a dead &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and thus the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is never able to see Miraak's face without unequipping the mask via &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiraak's Mantra.\nThis mantra is repeated by people found working on Miraak's shrines surrounding the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker%20Stones\"&gt;All-Maker Stones&lt;/a&gt;. They will each say one line when spoken to. In addition, if an All-Maker stone is activated, Miraak's disembodied voice will repeat a slightly altered variant of the mantra.\n\"What by day was stolen\"\n\"And when the world shall listen\"\n\"And when the world shall see\"\n\"And when the world remembers\"\n\"That world shall cease to be.\"\"\nCombat.\nMiraak has proven to be an exceptionally powerful individual. Naturally, as a Dragonborn, he is able to utilize several dragon shouts in battle. The shouts that he is shown to have knowledge of are as follows:\nMiraak's shouts seem to lack time limits. However, their usage rate is not as frequent as that of &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;. \nLike most Dragon Priests throughout Skyrim and Solstheim, Miraak is a very capable mage, able to cast powerful &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lightning bolts&lt;/a&gt;, generate wards, and use healing spells. He will also make use of his own &lt;a href=\"Miraak%27s%20Staff\"&gt;personal staff&lt;/a&gt; that allows him to summon fields of writhing tentacles that can cause severe poison damage. He also possesses his own &lt;a href=\"Miraak%27s%20Sword\"&gt;personal sword&lt;/a&gt;, which allows him to drain his victim's stamina in the form of a giant tendril. \nDuring his battle with the Last Dragonborn, whenever his health reaches a critical level, Miraak will use the Shouts Become Ethereal and Whirlwind Sprint to become immune to damage and flee back to the center of the arena. There, he will call down one of the dragons under his control and use a unique four-word shout to instantly kill it, absorbing their soul and restoring his health. The shout, \"..., ziil los dii du!\" roughly translates into \"..., your soul is mine to devour!\" He will also sometimes begin the battle by using the Dragon Aspect shout, greatly enhancing his abilities, and will frequently use Fire Breath, Frost Breath, and Cyclone to attack the Dragonborn in addition to his weapons and magical abilities.\nMiraak also has a few unique abilities that the Dragonborn does not have access to. He is able to use Bend Will to control several dragons at once and is able to command them from afar. Whenever the Last Dragonborn slays a dragon after meeting Miraak, there is a chance he will appear and absorb the dragon's soul for his own. This usually happens when the Last Dragonborn possesses one or more dragon souls, indicating his power to absorb dragon souls is slightly stronger. This also shows that Miraak, even when not at full power, possessed the ability to temporarily travel between Tamriel and Apocrypha, though in a somewhat incorporeal state. In this state he is also immune to all sources of damage.\nMiraak has the following:\nEquipment.\nThe following are items equipped by Miraak. They can be looted from his skeletal corpse following the battle."}

This means 100% Spell Absorption will negate all damage from any incoming spells and will also restore the Magicka equal to the base cost of casting a spell. Because of this, it is very useful in fights with mages, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, and also complements a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton's&lt;/a&gt; racial abilities very well. However, as always with Spell Absorption, there is the chance that any &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;summons&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonborn conjures may not work properly. This is due to summoning counting as casting a spell on oneself, and thus absorbing the magic. Naturally, the higher the percentage, the more chance the summoning will fail (100% completely eliminating the possibility of a successful summon).\nDespite the fact that the tentacle explosion blast will not kill powerful enemies outright, it still staggers them (especially with the &lt;a href=\"Force%20Without%20Effort\"&gt;Force Without Effort&lt;/a&gt; effect taught by &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;) and gives the Dragonborn the opportunity to back away from powerful melee opponents.\nThe robes are only worth wearing if the gloves and boots of the set are also worn, because of the added effects (the mask is not needed to increase absorption, and can be replaced by a better, upgradeable &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest Mask&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt;). The set is not suitable for pure mages because of there being no boosts to Magicka regeneration (this can be countered by wearing enchanted amulets and rings). The robes and associated armor pieces will be the most beneficial for &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Spellsword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spellsword&lt;/a&gt; types. The reason for this is because, even though the armor pieces have low armor rating values, they still provide some protection, and the explosion increases damage output in melee, while the Spell Absorption will prove to be useful when coupled with the aforementioned Atronach Stone.\nThe robes, as well as the mask, gloves and boots, cannot be improved at a workbench."}

They must be strong, competent, and capable of unraveling the many mysteries inherent in the expansive swamps and impenetrable rainforests. Take, for example, the mystery of the &lt;a href=\"miregaunt\"&gt;miregaunt&lt;/a&gt;. A resolute and steady head is required when facing an ambulatory piece of the marsh.\nMiregaunts aren't so rare that a visitor to &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt; will never see one, but they're also not so prevalent as to be a constant threat to expeditions\u2014though they do tend to congregate in and around places we like to explore. These large, walking parts of the swamp appear vaguely humanoid in shape, but without a discernible head. Consisting mainly of plant substance, they sometimes incorporate other materials into their shape, including mud, stone, vines, and even pieces of ancient architecture.\nAs for the biology of these strange creatures, the society remains at a loss. They have some small resemblance to certain aspects of &lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lurchers&lt;/a&gt; and similar creatures found in other parts of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but in all other respects they appear totally unique creatures. Local legends associate the miregaunts with &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; trees, but I must admit that the explanation was very hard to follow. Some tribes believe that the Hist trees call forth a portion of the swamp to accomplish a specific task, either guarding an area, defending a place, or taking vengeance on someone or something that hurt or hampered the Hist in some way. Others seem to indicate that a miregaunt is an unintended by-product of some unknown Hist activity, called forth by accident and set loose with no specific purpose in mind. Frankly, the contradictions I've uncovered are quite maddening!\nWhat I can say with some degree of certainty is that every miregaunt has a large cavity in its mid-section. Sometimes an encountered miregaunt's cavity is empty. Other times a random piece of stone or other detritus fills the empty space. In rare cases, something valuable rests within the miregaunt, such as a precious stone, an ancient relic, or even a living creature. The local &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; believe that these valuable objects have been taken into the miregaunt to purposely protect or imprison them. Fanciful, I know, but that's what some of the tribes believe.\nWhatever the truth, if an expedition encounters a miregaunt, please follow the recommendation of the society. Run."}

The goblins aren't allied with the undead, so many skirmishes will be seen, with the undead winning most of the time. This has its benefits. If one doesn't feel like killing all of the enemies oneself, let the factions fight and weaken each other while staying hidden. Once either the undead or the goblins have been killed or weakened greatly, only the winning side will have to be fought, which makes it a lot easier to travel through the ruins.\nThere is minimal resistance stopping access to the stone itself. Upon entry, directly in front of the Hero, there is a hidden door, in which, originally, only the option of turning left and continuing down the stairs is given. Check this on the map. Due to this, a few blocks here and there must be activated to open up the doors and gates to get to the stone.\nTo activate the blocks and proceed further into the ruins the following must be done:\nFollow the tunnels until reaching point A on the map. At this point jump off the bridge and find the door, point B, to the right. One may want to do this after killing the few creatures and collecting some Welkynd stones.\nOnce done, follow the tunnel and head up some stairs. There may be a creature in the following room. On the floor there should appear to be a square block, apparently raised from the ground, which is point C on the map. Standing on that will lower the iron gate that should have been came across earlier.\nFrom there, it is easy to travel to point D on the map, which is across the bridge that was jumped off. The door, point D, will lead to Sel Vanua.\nSel Vanua.\nThe player will start off closer to points B and C. In this room, there will be a few creatures. After killing them it is suggested that the Varla stone is obtained. Then, following the map above, proceed to point A. Follow the tunnel, and then the path across the bridge. Proceeding to the other side of the room, there is a door which must be entered.\nMorimath.\nThe Great Welkynd Stone can be found at Point A on map one. Once one grabs the Great Welkynd Stone, a &lt;a href=\"lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; named the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Miscarcand\"&gt;King of Miscarcand&lt;/a&gt; will attack them from behind. He holds the key to open the nearby Hard level locked door, so one can either kill him or run away (utilizing lockpicks). Alternatively, the player can exit the way he or she previously came. It is a good idea to kill him though, as his staff is highly effective in dealing with &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;.\nFleeing.\nIf one decides to run and pick the lock, the King of Miscarcand may pursue them all over Cyrodiil, preventing them from waiting, fast-travelling, or sleeping. One of the solutions is to enter a city, or head to Imperial City where guards can be patrolling outside. Hopefully they'll kill the King.\nAnother solution is to get arrested. When they are released from prison, the King will be waiting outside with two zombies. Kill them (the guards will help them) and take the staff the King leaves on his corpse."}

There is also no further description for them besides the one line that appears on the log. However, when complete, they appear as separate quests under the \"completed\" heading.\nNote that in many cases, Miscellaneous Quests are &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Quests\"&gt;Radiant Quests&lt;/a&gt;, where the specific item or location are randomly assigned. A major example of these are the jobs given by &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;Vex&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; as part of gaining city influence.\nThe following is a list of many of the non-radiant quests, grouped by the locations in which they may be found."}

Because of the recent events, &lt;a href=\"Hieronymus%20Lex\"&gt;Hieronymus Lex&lt;/a&gt; has pulled guards from all over the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Waterfront\"&gt;Waterfront&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to root out members of the guild including the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"S%27Krivva\"&gt;S'Krivva&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; and she will tell the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; that Hieronymus Lex has pulled guards from all over the Imperial City to the Waterfront in an attempt to root out members of the guild including the Gray Fox. The &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves' Guild&lt;/a&gt; must stop him at all costs or the guild may be finished for good. She will then tell them to meet with &lt;a href=\"Methredhel\"&gt;Methredhel&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial City.\nTravel to another area of the Imperial City other than the Waterfront and talk to the beggars. After a \"donation\" (or with a high &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt; and maxed &lt;a href=\"persuasion\"&gt;persuasion&lt;/a&gt; minigame), they will say that Methredhel is hiding out in the &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeggar: She is hiding in Dynari Amnis' house over in the Talos Plaza district. She's one of the few that escaped when Lex invaded the Waterfront.\nTravel there and go to &lt;a href=\"Dynari%20Amnis\"&gt;Dynari Amnis&lt;/a&gt;'s house and talk to Methredhel. Methredhel says she has a plan. The guild will stage a series of high-profile thefts in different areas of the city. Due to the lack of guards, the thefts should prove easy. That will give Lex a bad reputation and force him to return all the guards to their original stations. The Hero's job is to swipe Hrormir's Icestaff from the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Quarters&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; and leave a note in the bedside table beside him. She adds one final piece of information; the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; sleeps between 1:00 AM and 7:00 AM. If not a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the hero will be trespassing on every level after the entryway. Additionally, if the hero is caught stealing, they will be kicked out of the Mages Guild, unless the hero is the Arch-Mage. If the hero is the Arch-Mage, they can simply use the teleportals to go up to their bedroom, take staff and place the note. The notification text for this is slightly different, using first person possessive pronouns to refer to the room and the nightstand, as well as a reason to put the note in their own nightstand.\nHead to the Arcane University during the designated time slot and enter the Arch-Mage's lobby. Take the first portal to the left, then on the second floor take the one on the right. &lt;a href=\"Hrormir%27s%20Icestaff\"&gt;Hrormir's Icestaff&lt;/a&gt; is on the chest of drawers right in front so go over and take it. Now they need to leave the note in the nightstand beside the bed, no key is needed as the note will slide into the nightstand without unlocking it.\nIf this does not work they'll have to pickpocket the key from the Arch-Mage. Be careful doing this if they are also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; because if they get caught they'll get kicked out. Likewise, if the Hero have already become Arch-mage, they may simply walk into the Arch-mage quarters and take it.\nSave beforehand if you leave the note before taking the staff. See &lt;a href=\"%23Trivia\"&gt;Bug explanation below&lt;/a&gt;.\nHead back to Methredhel and tell her of the success stealing the staff. She is pleased that all the thefts were successful and will then ask the Hero to spy on Lex until something noteworthy happens.\nHead back to the Waterfront and once they are within earshot of Lex, a &lt;a href=\"dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; will come up to him and deliver a message. Lex reads the note, then begins to lead the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; out of the Waterfront, leaving &lt;a href=\"Note%20from%20Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;the note&lt;/a&gt; behind. Look at it and one will see that it is from &lt;a href=\"Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;Raminus Polus&lt;/a&gt;, one of the heads from the University. He is angry that a thief stole something from right under the Arch-Mage's nose, but even more so that Lex took away the very guards that could have stopped it from happening. Pick the note up and return it to Methredhel.\nMethredhel is glad that the plan was a success, but does not want the Mage's Guild to become enemies with the Thieve's Guild. She orders the Hero to return the staff and as the Hero can't just stroll into the Arcane University with the staff in hand, as that would get them arrested or possibly killed, she wants them to place the staff in a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; belonging to a former University researcher by the name of &lt;a href=\"Ontus%20Vanin\"&gt;Ontus Vanin&lt;/a&gt;. As a former member of the Mage's Guild and their unwitting accomplice, he will return the staff without putting the Hero in danger.\nOntus' house is conveniently located right here in the Talos Plaza District. Wait for him to leave the house in the afternoon and break in. Go to the second floor and open the chest and the staff will automatically be inside. Then return to S'Krivva for the reward.\nS'Krivva knows that Lex has left the Waterfront and gives the Hero a gold reward and a promotion. They now have access to &lt;a href=\"Luciana%20Galena\"&gt;Luciana Galena&lt;/a&gt; in Bravil as a fence."}

He then suggests to ask the colonists if they know anything about the \"supply ship\". They will report that they saw a ship North West of the mine.\nThe shipwreck.\nFollowing the coast, towards the north-west, the Nerevarine soon reaches a &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Ship\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;. There, many &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Draugrs&lt;/a&gt; will attack the hero. Once they have been dispatched, the Hero may, optionally, &lt;a href=\"Levitate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;levitate&lt;/a&gt; to the supply ship's deck, enter to recover the six &lt;a href=\"Miner%27s%20Pick\"&gt;Miner's Pick&lt;/a&gt;s that can be found on board.\nApronia Alfena.\nA very vocal survivor, &lt;a href=\"Apronia%20Alfena\"&gt;Apronia Alfena&lt;/a&gt;, will make herself noticed, once the Nerevarine has reached the ship. She will ask the Hero to help her return safely to the nearest settlement. If questioned further about the wreck, she will talk about the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; captain, that didn't seem to handle the situation very well. The Nerevarine may then escort her back to Raven Rock. Once in the colony, Alfena will thank the Nerevarine. She will remain at the colony.\nBack at Raven Rock.\nThe Hero may now speak to Falco, and if they have recovered the Miner's Picks, they may sell them for 500 each. He will go on to blame the loss of the supply ship on Carnius's greed, as he got a lower priced deal with the Wood Elf captain. He then asks the Nerevarine to report back to Carnius, at the fort. Once Carnius is spoken to, the quest is completed.\nReward.\nThe minimum reward for this quest is 300 .\nAdditionally, Falco will, from now on, buy all &lt;a href=\"Miner%27s%20Pick\"&gt;Miner's Pick&lt;/a&gt;s, for 500 each."}

She asked me to visit her home to speak privately about the matter.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter approaching the market of Whiterun for the second time during the day, the Dragonborn will encounter an argument between Fralia Gray-Mane at her market stall, &lt;a href=\"Olfrid%20Battle-Born\"&gt;Olfrid Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Idolaf%20Battle-Born\"&gt;Idolaf Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt;.\nOlfrid: \"Foolish old woman! You know nothing! Nothing of our struggles, our suffering!\"\nFralia: \"Nothing? And what of my son, hmm? What of Thorald? Is he nothing? So don't talk to me about suffering!\"\nIdolaf: \"Your son chose his side, and he chose poorly. And now he's gone. Such is the way of war. The sooner you accept his loss, the better.\"\nFralia: \"I will never accept his death! My son still lives. I feel it in my heart. So tell me, Battle-Borns, where is he? Where are you holding my Thorald?\"\nOlfrid: \"\"[to son] Do you believe this old hag? [to Fralia] \"Holding him\"? Why, I've got him in my cellar. He's my prisoner. Face it, cow! Your stupid son is dead! He died a Stormcloak traitor. And you...you best keep your mouth shut before you suffer the same.\"\"\nIdolaf: \"Come on, father. There's nothing more to be said here.\"\nThe quest can be started in two ways. The first is by speaking to Fralia directly following the argument. She will tell the Dragonborn that her son is missing, but alive, regardless of what anybody says, and that she would like to discuss it in private at her home.\n\"All I can think about is my son, my Thorald\u2026 they say that he was killed, but I know better. I know my son is alive! Those Battle-Born... they're in with the Imperials. They know it too, and yet they lie to my very face!\"\nThe Dragonborn can also speak to Olfrid and Idolaf about the argument with Fralia in the market. When asked \"What was that argument about?\", Olfrid will say:\n\"Just one more thing the Gray-Manes want to blame on others. It's not my fault they turned their backs on the Empire, or their mule of a son raised arms against it. And yet they want to heap the fault on my family's good name? Bah.\"\nIn response, Idolaf will say:\n\"More bad blood between the houses. Fralia is convinced our family is somehow at fault for the loss of her son. There's no reasoning with these people anymore.\"\nOnce inside &lt;a href=\"House%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;House Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avulstein%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Avulstein Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; will confront the Dragonborn with his weapon drawn. Fralia will tell him to put his weapon down and that the Dragonborn is a friend here to help. Avulstein will provide more information about the situation after the Dragonborn insists that they are here to help and will say that he needs evidence that confirms that Thorald is still alive. The Dragonborn can also enter House Gray-Mane and speak to Avulstein directly without first talking to Fralia to start the quest which will cause him to interact with the Dragonborn differently at first, accusing them of working for the Battle-Borns.\n\"Who are you? What are you doing here? Are you working for the Battle-Borns? Speak now before I put you in the ground!\"\nThe Dragonborn can also speak to Fralia for more information about the Battle-Borns and Thorald.\nWhy do you think the Battle-Borns are involved? \"The Battle-Borns. The Emperor's biggest boot-lickers here in Whiterun. Their connections to the Empire and the Legion are well-known. When Thorald didn't return home, there was no question in my mind. They knew Thorald supported the Stormcloaks, knew he was going to aid them in battle. Made sure he didn't come back. Locked him up someplace to get back at my family. I'm sure of it.\"\nFind the evidence.\nThere are a few ways to go about getting evidence from the &lt;a href=\"Battle-Born\"&gt;Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt;s. There are essentially three ways to do this, each of which leverages a &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Class%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternatively, the player can also become a friend to the Battle-Borns through one of these methods.\nHaving befriended Clan Battle-Born, one can freely enter the study (requires picking an Adept lock) and take the missive.\nIn any case, return to the Gray-Manes' home with the missive. If the door is locked, wait until &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund&lt;/a&gt; returns home at 9pm. Once you're inside, speak with Avulstein, who will want to round up some men (Geirlund and Vidrald) to go rescue his brother; you can agree to meet him there or tell him to stay put and let you handle it yourself. After making your decision, it's on to Northwatch Keep.\nRescue Thorald.\nWith the Imperial missive recovered from the Battle-Borns, the Dragonborn should return to Avulstein to report back the evidence that Thorald is alive and being held prisoner by the Thalmor. With the knowledge of Thorald's location, the Dragonborn can choose to relay it to Avulstein and join him and two of his friends, &lt;a href=\"Geirlund\"&gt;Geirlund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vidrald\"&gt;Vidrald&lt;/a&gt;, in attacking the fort, or simply go alone.\nI have proof that Thorald lives. \"I knew it! Let me see, please! The Thalmor? By the Nine, it's worse than I thought. So... Northwatch Keep. Then we know where to hit them.\"\nOnce at Northwatch Keep, the Dragonborn may speak to Avulstein who, in response to saying \"What do we do now?\" will say \"We kill every Thalmor between us and Thorald, and we bring him out alive. Let's go.\" The Dragonborn can also talk to the guard at the front of the entrance if not with Avulstein and his men. It is impossible, however, to convince the guard to release Thorald.\nI'm here for Thorald Gray-Mane. \"Are you joking? Even if we did have a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial legion. Now I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came.\"\nAlthough it was originally intended for the Dragonborn to be able to get written permission from &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; to have Thorald released, he will only deny your request, even if the Civil War has been completed.\nI need a prisoner released from Northwatch Keep. \"The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking? I'm sorry, that's just not possible. It would cause far too many problems.\"\nThe Dragonborn can elect to make a direct assault, use stealth, or pacify the fort with magic:\nProceed through the Keep to the prison area. Thorald Gray-Mane is chained to the wall in the back of the room. Kill the Northwatch Interrogator to free him. He will grab a nearby weapon to protect himself before following the Dragonborn. If Avulstein is with the Dragonborn, he will exchange words with his brother about how they are breaking him out of the Thalmor's imprisonment.\nWe're here to rescue you. \"I never thought I'd see another friendly face again. We need to get to safety as soon as possible. Let's move.\"\nAfter exiting, Thorald will thank the Dragonborn for saving him. He will then explain that it is not safe for him or Avulstein to return to Whiterun, as the Thalmor will be after them now. He states that they will join the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; to blend in, and gives the Dragonborn a message to pass on to Thorald and Avulstein's mother: \"Suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds.\" He then parts ways.\nYou should be safe now. \"I cannot thank you enough for rescuing me from this place. I suspect I'd never again see the light of day otherwise. But why would you risk your life for me, a stranger?\"\nReturn to Fralia.\nOnce the Dragonborn approaches Fralia with the news of her son's survival, she will ask for proof. Give her Thorald's message. She will give thanks for bringing her the peace of knowing that her son is alive and safe, and not locked up in a prison cell. She then rewards the Dragonborn with a &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; enchanted &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel weapon&lt;/a&gt;, originally intended for Thorald, and the quest is complete.\nIf Fralia's husband, &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund&lt;/a&gt;, has died anytime before the conclusion of this quest, Fralia will say that she does not have much to offer, due to the passing of Eorlund, and will be able to give 200 instead of the weapon.\nThorald is safe. \"Is he? You've saved him?! I must see him at once!\""}

The village of Longhaven needs someone who can uncover what might be behind it.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching the &lt;a href=\"Shademist%20Moors\"&gt;Shademist Moors&lt;/a&gt;, you will encounter a man named &lt;a href=\"Heluin\"&gt;Heluin&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you not to head into the moors, as people have been disappearing there. When their bodies are found again, they are drained of blood. When you inquire about the cause, he will direct you to Breduin, a man who has decided to stay in the moors. \nBreduin's home can be found in the northeast of the moors. He will tell you what has been going on; the mists around the area have changed to a sickly colour of late, and people have been walking into them as if bewitched. He also tells you that a Dunmer adventurer has recently entered the Moors, seemingly with a purpose and armed for battle. Your task now is to find this Dunmer.\nHead for the center of the Moors, just south of the map icon. You will find a Dunmer named Mel Adrys there; speak with him and he will tell you that all this is the work of vampires. He is a vampire hunter, and he has determined that there is a lair nearby. When you offer to help, he will tell you to head to the vampire lair on the hill to the east. On this hill, you will also find the body of a man named &lt;a href=\"Ancalmo\"&gt;Ancalmo&lt;/a&gt;, which will give you the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Ambition\"&gt;Deadly Ambition&lt;/a&gt;.\" That quest takes place in the same area as this one, so it can be efficient to do both simultaneously. \nHead inside and speak with Mel Adrys there. He has just overpowered a vampire, ad was about to deal the killing blow. When you ask him to let you speak to the vampire for imformation, he will comply. Speak with Gadinas and he will tell you that their clan were not always dangerous. They used to feed on Hoarvors that had drank blood, and they never harmed people. All of this changed though when a mysterious traveler brought them a magic skull, and promised that they would not have to hide anymore. The skull's power seeps into the mists here; it allows the vampires to make endless thralls. \nAt this point, you can either convince Mel to spare Gadinas or allow him to slay him. Either way, head on deeper into the cave and search out the vampires' leaders. You will find Athraedal in the next room; once she is dead, head on toward the eastern room to take out Faenir Blood-Letter. Finally, head for the southern room and you will find Lathriel the Pale. Kill her, then head to the north of the cave to destroy the Skull of Vargarion that Gadinas told you about. You will have to head through the eastern room to reach the upper path. Once you have destroyed the skull, head outside and back to the town where you met Breduin and talk to him. This will finish the quest."}

Combined with the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the Vestige, Angof will surely fall. But he has added a toxic mist which protects the approach to Cath Bedraud, it rises from his vines and sickens anyone who breathes it in. The wizard Benele believes the Vestige might be immune to its effects.\nThe Vestige is wearing the Midnight talisman which should protect them, and Sir Lanis says they have to chance it. They are out of options. A squad of Dragons succumbed to the mist before they could retreat, and then the idiot Darien led a few of the Camlorn soldiers on an ill-conceived mission and they were overcome as well.\nThe Vestige agrees to help save the soldiers if they aren't affected. Sir Lanis hopes the soldiers are still alive, that fool from &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, what was he thinking! Charging right into the mist after them! And &lt;a href=\"Giblets\"&gt;Giblets&lt;/a&gt;, he has no idea why the dog is here. When the king mentioned the Vestige name, the dog perked up and stuck with them all the way from Daggerfall!\nHead over to the graveyard and find the missing soldiers. Outside are &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn cultists&lt;/a&gt;, try to avoid them or fight them on the way. Darien and the soldiers are just inside the gates of the graveyard.\nDarien is happy to reunite with them and says he knew they would like to make Angof's life miserable. The mists are poisonous and he wonders why the Vestige isn't affected. They tell him it might have something to do with the talisman. Darien isn't affected either by the mist and he doesn't know why. It doesn't seem to affect the necromancers either. Those amulets must protect them, kill a few and give them to the knights. Better grab a few extra too, just in case.\nSneak around the graveyard to surprise the necromancers and defeat several. Grab the amulets from them, not all have amulets so killing a few more might be needed to defeat. Return to the knights and Darien when all are collected.\nGabrielle has turned up, go over and talk to her. She has heard about the amulets and is glad to get her hands on them. She'll give them to the knights so Darien can lead them to safety. If there are any more she might be able to clear the mist. Hand over the extra amulets to her. She is going to merge them and cast an amplification spell, then she can increase the size of the protection ward. This is best at a central point and if the spell lasts long enough, the troops will be able to get in. She needs to be protected during the ritual though. Angof will notice what she is doing and he will send someone to stop, and if she gets interrupted while she is casting, the spell will fail.\nMeet her at the center of the graveyard and tell her when ready so she can begin the ritual. Overlook the ritual and stop any creatures coming too close. The mist will clear if the ritual is a success, then follow her into the crypts and talk to her.\nThat takes care of the mist, but who knows for how long. Let's not waste this opportunity. The time to strike at Angof has arrived and the next bit is critical."}

He asks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to save his wife &lt;a href=\"Fjola\"&gt;Fjola&lt;/a&gt;, as he fears the bandits have captured her.

Quaranir wants to speak with the Dragonborn privately, and magically veils their conversation from Savos and Ancano.\nTime is fleeting, so he is quick to impart that the Order has had little success in contacting the Dragonborn previously and that this is probably because of the Eye of Magnus. According to Quaranir, the longer the Eye remains in the College, the more dangerous the situation becomes. They expect dire consequences if the Eye is not banished, but the future is obscure, and the Psijic Order is unsure of how the Dragonborn must act. Seeking out the &lt;a href=\"Augur%20of%20Dunlain\"&gt;Augur of Dunlain&lt;/a&gt; is the next logical step. Moments later, there is a flash of light, and time resumes as normal. Quaranir is questioned by Ancano, but feigns ignorance to his questions and departs from the College.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraversing &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dragonborn searches for the fabled &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, which is needed to control the Eye of Magnus. &lt;a href=\"Morokei%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morokei&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;, holds the staff and must be battled to obtain it. The battle is difficult and recommended for levels 20 and above.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;The Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefeated, Ancano releases his hold on the Eye of Magnus. Quaranir, &lt;a href=\"Gelebros\"&gt;Gelebros&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tandil\"&gt;Tandil&lt;/a&gt; appear to transport the Eye out of the College, possibly to &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, for safe keeping. Quaranir states that the player is now the new Arch-Mage, and then he and the other members of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; disappear after this.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Good%20Intentions\"&gt;Good Intentions&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;The Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"We knew you would succeed. Your victory here justifies our belief in you. You have proven yourself more than worthy to guide the College of Winterhold.\"\nConversations.\nYou're up to something!\nSavos: \"I'm sorry, were you about to say something?\"\nAncano: \"Well, what is the meaning of this?\"\nQuaranir: \"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.\"\nAncano: \"Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here he/she is. Now what is it that you want?\"\nQuaranir: \"There's been a misunderstanding. Clearly I should not be here. I shall simply take my leave.\"\nAncano: \"[angry] What? What trickery is this? You're not going anywhere until I find out what you're up to.\"\nQuaranir: \"I'm not 'up to' anything. I apologize if I have offended you in any way.\"\nAncano: \"[seething] We shall see about this...\""}

After she hired an &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt; to help improve efficiency, strange things began to occur. Fog rolled out of the quarry and screams were heard. Then... nothing\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhile visiting the &lt;a href=\"Tumnosh%20Clanhold\"&gt;Tumnosh Clanhold&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige may overhear that the local &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; have been having difficulties operating their nearby mine, Graystone Quarry, due to a mysterious fog. Speaking to Forge-Wife Kharza will reveal the following:\n\"Have you happened to see an Elf around here? Tall, spindly, talks way too much for his own good?\"\nThe Vestige now has to go investigate the quarry and find out if the Orcs inside are alright. Entering through the nearby ladder and following the path will eventually lead to &lt;a href=\"Ghorn\"&gt;Ghorn&lt;/a&gt;, a wounded quarry worker. He will explain that after breaking into a cavity, a strange fog filled the area. The Elf Neramo insisted on exploring it, taking several of the quarry workers with him. Soon after, Chief Ramash and his hunt-wife decided to investigate and were subsequently attacked by creatures in the fog. The Chief managed to escape, but his hunt-wife is still trapped in the cavern, looking for her daughter. Entering the cavern will reveal that the hostile creatures are Dwarven animunculi, seemingly awakened after the ruckus the quarry workers made, the \"strange fog\" being steam. Battling through groups of hostile Dwarven machinery will eventually lead the Vestige to Hunt-Wife Bolgar, lying wounded next to a stairwell. Startled, she will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"I thought you were one of those damn machines! You're just lucky I've got the reflexes of a snow bear or your guts would be decorating the floor. Now, care to explain what you're doing down here?\"\nTell me about your daughter. \"Shabon? She's a brave young woman. Took an immediate interest in the High Elf and his fancy ways. The Elf didn't seem to mind. In fact, I think he liked having someone strong and beautiful at his side. You find one and you'll find the other.\"\nThe Vestige now has to perform the tedious task of clearing the Dwarven ruin of animunculi, fighting their way to Shabon. She will be located near a underground lake, hiding from the machinery. Shabon will explain that the caverns actually served as a separate quarry. The Dwemer started mining underground, eventually trying to work their way up. Informing about the Elf will lead Shabon to explain to the Vestige that he went to investigate the \"central structure\". Shabon wanted to help him, but knew her limitations as she wasn't fit to deal with hostile machines. Following the path ways and defeating several more of the hostile animunculi will eventually lead the Vestige to Neramo, the infamous High Elf the Orcs have been referring to. Speaking to him will reveal the following:\n\"Amazing! You were actually able to navigate the Dwemer defenses? You must either be exceptionally strong or exceedingly lucky. Either way, I can make use of that.\"\nThe Vestige has to find the control center, which is located deep within the ruins. Following the pathways and fighting through hordes of Dwarven machinery will eventually lead them there, and they willl be greeted by Neramo and a giant Dwemer puzzle called the \"Orb of Illumination\". Neramo explains that this device is the key to controlling the Dwemer defenses, and in order to do so, they will have to solve a puzzle by manipulating the resonators and rotating the rings. In order to solve the puzzle, the Vestige will have to:\nThis will solve the puzzle, and allow Neramo to control the mechanisms making it safe to work the quarry once more. The Vestige is now free to leave the ruins, with Neramo staying behind as he wants to try repaying the Orcs for his indiscretion by making some adjustments to the Dwemer machinery, allowing them to become quarry workers. Once the Vestige is outside, they will be greeted by Forge-Wife Kharza, who is furious the Neramo. Even after explaining the situation to her, she will not be calmed down and insists on destroying both Neramo and the machinery he returned with. \nThe Vestige now has the option to either persuade Kharza to accept the constructs as a blood price, using them to mine the quarry until the Orcs regain their strenght or letting Neramo take them to Orsinium, never to return again. Either way, the quest will be completed and the Vestige will receive their reward."}

But I have heard rumblings, particularly from their shamans. They are unpredictable, and I suggest we use them sparingly and only for short periods of service."}

She is also known as the \"Unforeseen Queen,\" having mysteriously disappeared from Summerset as a child, only to return 17 years later so she could inherit the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Alinor\"&gt;Throne of Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after her coronation, Ayrenn formed the First Aldmeri Dominion, an &lt;a href=\"alliance\"&gt;alliance&lt;/a&gt; between the Summerset Isles, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; which faced opposition from both the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and even\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;her own people in Summerset&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nEarly life.\nAyrenn was born the eldest child of King &lt;a href=\"Hidellith\"&gt;Hidellith&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; and Kinlady &lt;a href=\"Tuinden\"&gt;Tuinden&lt;/a&gt;, on the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20555\"&gt;2E 555&lt;/a&gt;. Her conception and naming was ordained by the &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20Praxis\"&gt;Scrolls of Praxis&lt;/a&gt;. All of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Artaeum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; are said to have celebrated her auspicious birth for fifty-five days. It was foretold that Princess Ayrenn would reflect the restless and turbulent times in which she was born, and would one day bring innovations to the rule of the Summerset Isles. From an early age, the nimble and quick-witted princess would often adopt unorthodox approaches to schoolwork, and sometimes went missing for several days, only to return with unusual knowledge and mastery of skills. She trained in blades beside her father, rode horses along Summerset's golden beaches, and memorized the history and sonnets of her people.\nAyrenn would later disappear from the Summerset Isles at the age of eight, somewhere between the Alinor palace and the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;2E 563&lt;/a&gt;. The entire royal family of Alinor had gathered at the Crystal Tower to celebrate Ayrenn's matriculation to the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs%27%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Sapiarchs' Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;, where she was to study &lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Regal%20Praxis\"&gt;Altmeri Regal Praxis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ceremoniarchy\"&gt;Ceremoniarchy&lt;/a&gt; for a requisite 3,555 days. This time of intensive study had been required by all Summerset rulers in the past, and Ayrenn was to step into that period with arms wide. The &lt;a href=\"Sapiarch\"&gt;Sapiarch&lt;/a&gt;s reported that the night of her disappearance was filled with signs and portents. The constellation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Lady\"&gt;the Lady&lt;/a&gt; seemed to ride the constellation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Steed\"&gt;the Steed&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Orrery\"&gt;Great Orrery&lt;/a&gt; spun backward, and a young eaglet was found atop the statue of &lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Explorer\"&gt;Topal the Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Justiciar\"&gt;Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;s began their long search for the princess, Ayrenn was already on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. It is here where she began a new life with the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The members of that clan trained Ayrenn in the art of war, turning her simple noble swordplay to lithe and seasoned blade-dancing. Her beachside rides became forced marches on horseback, and her singing of sonnets gave way to the study of the arcane arts. Ayrenn's younger brother, Prince &lt;a href=\"Naemon\"&gt;Naemon&lt;/a&gt;, would later be named heir to the throne of Alinor.\nCoronation.\nFollowing the death of King Hidellith in &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, Ayrenn made an unexpected return to the Summerset Isles, travelling by swan ship from &lt;a href=\"Port%20Velyn\"&gt;Port Velyn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. After arriving in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, she announced that she was prepared, as the eldest heir, to assume the Throne of Alinor, and the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"High%20Justiciar\"&gt;High Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0affirmed that this was her right. She was crowned Queen Ayrenn on the 7th of &lt;a href=\"Calendar%23Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt; in the same year. It is said that the Sapiarchs endorsed all of the innovations Ayrenn brought to the rule of the Summerset Isles.\nAldmeri Dominion.\nDuring her extensive travels around &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; before returning to Summerset, Ayrenn suffered personally at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, sparking in her a hatred of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldmeri Dominion was the brainchild of Queen Ayrenn after having assumed the throne, and she saw it as the Altmer's duty to retake the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, which the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; originally built,\u00a0and to eradicate the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; threat menacing &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Her new Dominion aided the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran&lt;/a&gt; King &lt;a href=\"Aeradan\"&gt;Aeradan&lt;/a&gt; in\u00a0repelling the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cabal\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; invasion of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and also helped restore order to &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; from the chaos that\u00a0followed the devastating &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;.\nA group of High Elven supremacists, racists, and isolationists called the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; formed in response to Ayrenn's return. Seeking an end to the Dominion, they believed that the Queen had been corrupted by her alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, which \"elevated their races\" to be equals with the Altmer. Their goals included forcing Ayrenn to step down as Queen so they may appoint &lt;a href=\"Estre\"&gt;their own regent&lt;/a&gt;, and for everyone not of High Elven descent to leave the Summerset Isles. The Heritance made multiple assassination attempts on Ayrenn during her tour of Auridon, including an attempt at the port of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt; which was halted by &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;a certain hero&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nQueen Ayrenn believes that she is the ruler the Altmer need, due to her lifetime of experience as an adventurer and warrior. She has little honor for Altmeri culture and heritage, and considers the royal ceremonies to be \"condescending nonsense,\" only performing them so that she may gain the trust of her people. While Ayrenn is said to possess a genuine humility and kindness rarely seen among her people, she is also a decisive leader with a stubborn streak. She can be reckless in combat, and states that the only way to have faith in oneself is to \"look fear in the face, and conquer it.\" She also dislikes being reminded of her royalty, and thinks that most are too \"blinded\" by her crown to ask her questions about herself.\nAyrenn takes great pride in the Aldmeri Dominion, believing it to be the strongest alliance on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. She founded the Dominion after recognizing that the Altmer were too few in number to \"solve the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; facing Tamriel\"; a plan that to the other races means a return to &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; dominance. Despite stating that she would sooner place an Altmer infant on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; than any &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, Ayrenn contradicts that idea by claiming to oppose racism and High Elven supremacy when asked about the Veiled Heritance.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Hostile%20Situation\"&gt;A Hostile Situation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige is tasked with preventing an attempt on the Queen's life.\n&lt;a href=\"To%20Tanzelwil\"&gt;To Tanzelwil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Queen will ask the Vestige to come to &lt;a href=\"Tanzelwil\"&gt;Tanzelwil&lt;/a&gt; in case anything goes awry with the ceremonies there.\n&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Name%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;In the Name of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ancestors at Tanzelwil have risen up and are trying to kill the Queen and her entourage.

In front of the manor's entrance is a portcullis, blocking further passage. Quen will climb over the wall onto the other side, and after you open the portcullis and she turns the switch, the gate will open. Once the &lt;a href=\"Fulstrom%20Manor%20House\"&gt;Manor&lt;/a&gt; is entered via a backdoor entrance and the puzzle lock is completed, the &lt;a href=\"Giovessen%20Skull\"&gt;Giovessen Skull&lt;/a&gt; will be on a table in &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Fulstrom\"&gt;Thane Fulstrom&lt;/a&gt;'s vault.

Return the Giovessen Skull and surrender, or face the consequences.\"\nQuen \"\"No idea what he means. I'll... I'll follow &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;your&lt;/a&gt; lead.\"\"\nThe events following will vary depending on the course of action you take. If you place the Giovessen Skull back on its display, the Iron Wheel will knock you unconscious and imprison both you and Quen in a jail cell. After you regain consciousness, Quen will say \"Wake up, partner. We need to get out of here.\" If you choose to attack the Iron Wheel, Quen will say \"Hold them off! I'll find another way out!\"\nWhatever the path taken, &lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt; will appear in the catacombs. If you are imprisoned, he will free you and Quen. He will then have the following conversation with Quen:\nQuenneth: \"Who are you?\"\nWalks-Softly: \"\"You don't know me yet, but I'm a friend. Quen, isn't it? Put on this uniform and head outside. The Iron Wheel won't detain a &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20Guard\"&gt;Windhelm Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nQuen: \"There's no way I'm leaving here without my partner.\"\nWalks: \"\"I only had one uniform.

I... all right, I'll meet you both by the exit. Good luck, partner.\"\nWalks: \"She'll be fine. Looks like we take the dangerous way around.\"\nQuen will then leave while you and Walks take the alternate exit. Back on the surface, Walks and Quen will be on a boat.\nAfter arriving in Abah's Landing, Walks-Softly will be speaking to Quen:\n&lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"When you're up to it, we'll head to the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Den%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Den&lt;/a&gt;.

Why do you ask?\"\nWalks: \"Nothing, you just... remind me of someone I once knew.\"\nQuen: \"I remind you of someone who owned a pet?\"\nWalks: \"It's the way you speak, not the words you say. No matter, you are a very different person.\"\nWalks-Softly: \"You don't seem to mind living here. I thought you hated water.\"\nQuen: \"No, I hate travelling by ship. I take no issue with water.\"\nWalks: \"Good! Then grab a mop and scrub algae off all the planks you can find.\"\nQuen: \"You... fine. But it's just going to grow back.\"\nWalks: \"Oh, the algae never loses. It's all about the struggle.\"\nZeira: \"You've really proven yourself.

It doesn't matter what Velsa says, she's just \u2026 placid.\"\nVelsa: \"It won't last. It can't last, can it?\"\nVelsa: \"Which means there are less of them around to guard their pay.\"\nWalks-Softly: \"Velsa, think. If we empty their coffers completely, they can't buy passage by ship.

They've hired help to clear the forest. This help appears to have suffered some difficulties.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn Willowgrove, you will find a Bosmer named &lt;a href=\"Firiliril\"&gt;Firiliril&lt;/a&gt; standing by a broken cart. She will tell you that the town is looking to expand their honey business and has hired help to clear some of the forest, but there is a problem. She will direct you to Treethane Ranneth for more information. \nThe treethane is in a house a bit to the south. Speak with her and she will tell you that if the mage &lt;a href=\"Pircalmo\"&gt;Pircalmo&lt;/a&gt; does not complete his contract soon and clear the trees, he will be forced to eat his wife. The wife in question, &lt;a href=\"Alanya%20Softpetals\"&gt;Alanya Softpetals&lt;/a&gt;, has been taken hostage to ensure Pircalmo fulfills his end of the bargain. Ranneth does not wish for this to happen and will ask you to investigate the reasons behind the delay. Speaking with Alanya will get you no useful information, so you should head to Pircalmo's tent to the south and read his notes. There are several notes on the table, but the important one is \"&lt;a href=\"On%20Pircalmo%27s%20Emergency%20Reversal\"&gt;On Pircalmo's Emergency Reversal&lt;/a&gt;\". It describes a spell to figure out what went wrong in case something bad happens. After reading it, Pircalmo will show up and ask what you are doing in his tent; speak with him and he will tell you something has gone horribly wrong. He will ask you to look for the ingredients to the spell you found while he tries to mitigate the problem. \nYou will need a piece of Heartwood, five Torchbug Thoraxes and some Hoarvor Chitin. You can ask Treethane Ranneth where to get these things; torchbugs can be found aplenty in the village, most houses will have some useless heartwood lying around and you can get the Hoarvor Chitin from &lt;a href=\"Sarolion-Sells-All\"&gt;Sarolion-Sells-All&lt;/a&gt; in the west of town. Once you have everything, head back to Pircalmo; he will be on the hill south of town. On your way there, you may notice the forest is full of atronachs. Pircalmo will tell you that he just wanted to use a simple magical force to clear the trees, but something went wrong and summoned the atronachs. He will take the ingredients off of you and attempt to perform the ritual to find out what went wrong and undo the damage, but something will go wrong as he tries that. Talk to him afterward and he will tell you that in order to send the atronachs back, he will need a core from each atronach type. \nHead into the forest for some atronach hunting. You will probably have to kill multiple of each type of atronach before one of them will drop a core. Collect one core of each atronach type, then head back to Pircalmo. You will see a confrontation between him and Treethane Ranneth; she considers the contract broken because of the Daedra in the forest. Talk to Pircalmo and he will tell you that something likely corrupted his spell here; he normally fails at everything, so summoning dozens of atronachs is well beyond his capabilities. He will give you his staff of finding to locate the source of the corruption while he goes back to the village to try and save his wife. \nThe source can be found to the southwest, in &lt;a href=\"Willowgrove%20Cavern\"&gt;Willowgrove Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Using the wand will summon a light that will guide you to the cavern. Head in and fight your way through the Daedra to the shrine at the end of the cave, where you will find a talking dog called &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with him and he will tell you that he is the companion to the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. The atronachs appeared because as Pircalmo was summoning his magical force, he uttered a wish for something to go well for once in his life, which activated something in the shrine. Barbas will tell you that in order to undo the spell and get rid of the atronachs, you need to smash the altar beside him. This will also allow him to return to his master. \nSmash the altar, then return to Willowgrove. You will find that Ranneth is about to kill Alanya; speak with Ranneth and tell her what happened in the woods, and she will agree to free Alanya. She locked Pircalmo in her home until mealtime; she will meet you there. Head to Ranneth's home and free Pircalmo, and then follow him down the ramp to witness Ranneth apologising to Pircalmo and Alanya and offering Pircalmo a permanent job as the town's mage. Speak with Ranneth afterward to finish the quest. "}

He will tell you that he is worried about Hildegard, as she has not returned after going to pray for Tanek's recovery. He will ask you to come with him to the Chapel of Dibella in Anvil to investigate. \nHead to the chapel in Anvil. You will not find Hildegard here, but if you ask around to see if anyone has seen her, you will discover that someone named &lt;a href=\"Chanter%20Nemus\"&gt;Chanter Nemus&lt;/a&gt; had an intimate conversation with her, after which she ran out of the chapel in tears. Talk to Kor about this and he will tell you Hildegard feels a lot of guilt for the things she has done in her wolf form, and that it is not hard to turn this guilt into self-loathing. He suspects this is what happened, and that she has fled back to where it all began. to Skyrim. \nKor will check the docks to see if she has sought passage on any ship while you go speak to the caravan master, located just outside the north gate. &lt;a href=\"Bilami%20the%20Caravaneer\"&gt;Bilami the Caravaneer&lt;/a&gt; will refuse to tell you anything, but after you are done talking, Kor will come rushing to you. He will say that an organization called the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Dawn\"&gt;Order of the Silver Dawn&lt;/a&gt; is after Hildegard; Bilami will trust him with her location as she mentioned him several times as Bilami helped her. \nBilami will agree to take you and Kor to the Jerall Mountains to find Hildegard; you can talk to Kor before you leave to discover that the Silver Dawn are werewolf hunters. After this, talk to Bilami and she will take you to the Jeralls. Upon arriving, it is time to track down Hildegard; to do so, crouch and follow the glowing plants. These plants may be hard to spot among the other vegetation, so pay attention. You will find several clues along te way that Hildegard has been here. The Silver Dawn will also have a presence here, so be prepared to fight them. You will eventually come across their camp; kill most of them, and the lone survivor will tell you that they tracked Hildegard to the south. \nHead south to find Hildegard. She is in her wolf form, but Kor will be able to calm her down and make her turn human again. She will tell you that the chanter told her to return to her old life in the wilderness after she confessed to him about her true nature and her membership of the dark brotherhood. She will initially disbelieve that the chanter sent the Silver Dawn after her, but will eventually see the truth in that. Return to Anvil by talking to Bilami, then talk to Kor once you are back. He will take Hildegard home safely. Talk to Hildegard hereafter and offer to kill Chanter Nemus to even the score. \nNemus will be in his office in the chapel, down the stairs. Once he lies dead, return to the sanctuary and tell Astara what happened to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Special%20Request\"&gt;A Special Request&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Some of these have other requirements, however, such as most all &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric Shrine&lt;/a&gt; quests, which require the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to be a specific level. It may also be wise to start a quest, but not finish it if a quest item that may be lost or changed upon completion of the quest is useful.\nThis page lists all quests in \"Oblivion\".

If going for the maximum number of quests accepted, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Dark%20Exile\"&gt;A Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;\" is the only one quest which cannot be started, since doing so means permanent expulsion from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, rendering the remainder of the guild quest line inaccessible, and \"Eternal Exile\" is impossible to start once the Hero is named &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener of the Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. If going for the maximum number of quests completed, however, there are four quests which can be started but cannot be completed. Two of these quests are \"&lt;a href=\"Whispers%20of%20Death\"&gt;Whispers of Death&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Arena&lt;/a&gt;,\" which are the final quests in the quest lines for the Dark Brotherhood and &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Imperial City Arena&lt;/a&gt; quest lines, respectively. These quests have no completed state as they are infinitely repeatable for a gold reward. The third of these four quests is \"&lt;a href=\"Cast%20out%20of%20the%20Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Cast out of the Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;,\" which also has no completed state, and the Hero can repeatedly use this quest's journal entry instructions to gain re-entry into the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. The last of these quests is \"Cast out of the Fighters Guild,\" which only reaches its completed state once the Hero is expelled for the third time permanently, rendering the remainder of the guild quest line inaccessible.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;The Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are a total of 18 quests in the main quest line.\n&lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 21 quests in the Fighters Guild quest line. These quests have been divided into sections which must be done in order, though quests within each \"Jobs\" section can be done in any order.\n&lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are a total of 22 Mages Guild quests. Mages Guild Recommendation quests may be done in any order. The Chorrol Recommendation is divided into Fingers of the Mountain and Fingers of the Mountain, Part II, the first of which is the only one necessary to receive the recommendation.\n&lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 14 Thieves Guild quests. It is possible to join the Thieves Guild without ever starting Finding the Thieves Guild. This method must be avoided if seeking 100% completion of quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a grand total of 34 quests for the Dark Brotherhood. \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Dark%20Exile\"&gt;A Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;,\" \"&lt;a href=\"Another%20Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Another Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;,\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Renegade%20Shadowscale\"&gt;The Renegade Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;\" must be completed prior to completion of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Purification\"&gt;The Purification&lt;/a&gt;.\" The Dark Brotherhood has a uniquely designed quest line wherein there is a \"transition\" quest between quests, where the only goal is to accept the next quest from your Brotherhood member. These quests will be listed in parentheses beside the quest they follow.\n&lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly 2 quests are meant to exist for the Arena faction. \"&lt;a href=\"Origin%20of%20the%20Gray%20Prince\"&gt;Origin of the Gray Prince&lt;/a&gt;\" is an optional quest, but it may be rendered inaccessible by progression through \"&lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 15 Daedric Quests, which have the unique aspect of minimum level requirements, as well as other offerings to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric Shrines&lt;/a&gt; to begin the quests; these requirements are listed in their entirety. This list is sorted alphabetically, not in order of progression. It is impossible to complete all Daedric Quests in alphabetical order due Hermaeus Mora requiring all of the other Daedric Quests be done first, however, barring that exception, they can be done alphabetically once the Hero has reached level 20 and has gathered the various components. Unlike Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood quests, completing Daedric quests do not increase &lt;a href=\"infamy\"&gt;infamy&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Master%20Training%20Quests\"&gt;Master Training Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a Master Training quest for each of the 21 skills in \"Oblivion\".\nMiscellaneous.\nThe remainder of the quests are made up of 55 city, settlement, and inn-based quests.

All quests are optional, meaning that the Vestige could spend their entire time exploring and &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Leveling%20%28Online%29\"&gt;level up&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring quest lines entirely. is awarded to the Vestige according to their level and the difficulty of the quest. A more technical explanation can be found . While quests award a base amount of experience and , many quests have a multiplier based on their difficulty.\nTypes of quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Main quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt; is available to the Vestige from level 1 and revolves around the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and the Vestige's journey to end the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; incursion and reclaim their lost &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;. Further progression in the main quests requires the Vestige to achieve a prerequisite level. Each main quest awards an extra skill point, with the exception of \"&lt;a href=\"Cadwell%27s%20Silver\"&gt;Cadwell's Silver&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Cadwell%27s%20Gold\"&gt;Cadwell's Gold&lt;/a&gt;\" which serve as guides for zones beyond those belonging to the Vestige's &lt;a href=\"alliance\"&gt;alliance&lt;/a&gt;. All main quests also provide unique side quests items as rewards.\n&lt;a href=\"Zone%20quest\"&gt;Zone quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEach zone has a main story line that can be completed alone or in groups. The stories for many zones are interconnected, usually depending on which alliance they belong to. Other zones, however, have separate stories, particularly zones associated with a chapter or DLC. Note that not all quests for each zone story need to be completed in strict chronological order, as many can be started earlier. Similarly, a previous zone's story does not need to be completed in order to start the next zone. However, certain quests will not become available until their prerequisite quest has been completed.\nAlliance zones.\nMany zones are associated with a particular alliance. The narratives of these zones are connected with an overarching story for each alliance, though each will carry a different theme and subplot. These zones are not restricted to the Vestige's alliance. As such, the Vestige may, for example, freely complete quests within a &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; zone despite being affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther zones.\nThe zone quests for Cyrodiil and Craglorn are designed to be able to be completed by the Vestige without any assistance from others, despite the zones themselves being designed for groups. The zone story for Coldharbour is not available until the Vestige has completed the prerequisite quests \"&lt;a href=\"Messages%20Across%20Tamriel\"&gt;Messages Across Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Weight%20of%20Three%20Crowns\"&gt;The Weight of Three Crowns&lt;/a&gt;\" by first completing all of the zone stories for their alliance or \"&lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Five%20Companions\"&gt;Council of the Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\" Other zones include:\nChapter and DLC zones.\nZones added from a chapter or DLC feature quest lines separate from that of other zones. Some zones, such as &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Southern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, however, feature interconnected stories and some may reference events that occurred in other zone's quest lines if they had been completed. The appropriate chapter or DLC is required to be purchased or made available with &lt;a href=\"ESO%20Plus\"&gt;ESO Plus&lt;/a&gt; in order to access the zone for each story. Progress in a zone's story is not possible without access to its corresponding chapter or DLC. Chapter and DLC zones, in order of release, include:\n&lt;a href=\"Pointer%20quest\"&gt;Pointer quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPointer quests are short zone quests that are designed to direct the Vestige towards the beginning or next stage of the zone's series of quests. They are most common in Alliance zones where each zone is separated into three regions that have related but distinct chains of zone quests. They are optional, not being necessary to complete the zone's questline, and are very short, often only having the Vestige move from one location to another to report to a character. As such, they provide very little gold and experience and never provide items as a reward.\n&lt;a href=\"Epilogue%20quest\"&gt;Epilogue quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEpilogues are a series of quests that conclude a year-long story of quests across multiple zones. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Season of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; epilogue is the conclusion for the zone quests of both Northern Elsweyr and Southern Elsweyr. The zone quests of both associated zones need to be completed in order to begin the first epilogue quest. Epilogue quests will typically be set in the latter zone; that is, the zone that was made available later than the other.\n&lt;a href=\"Side%20Quests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Side quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nSide quests are featured in all zones and consist of self-contained narratives and story lines. Although some may feature narrative elements from other quests, they act separately and can be completed independently regardless of progress in other quest lines. Side quests include quests that are specific to certain dungeons such as &lt;a href=\"delves\"&gt;delves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"public%20dungeons\"&gt;public dungeons&lt;/a&gt;. Public dungeons in alliance zones have two side quests within.\n&lt;a href=\"Group%20quest\"&gt;Group quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGroup quests are similar to side quests in that they are self-contained and often unrelated to other quests. Unlike regular side quests, however, and as the name implies, group quests are intended to be completed by two or more characters working together. While the difficulty of the content is tailored to groups, it is often possible to complete group quests alone at mid to high levels, especially with a &lt;a href=\"Companions%20%28Online%29\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; present.\n&lt;a href=\"Group%20dungeon%20quest\"&gt;Group dungeon quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGroup dungeon quests are story quests for individual dungeons designed for groups of four people. Each dungeon's quest is not repeatable and completion of it marks the dungeon as being complete for all characters on the same account, but this does not prevent other characters from starting the quest. &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pledges\"&gt;Pledges&lt;/a&gt; are a type of repeatable group dungeon quest provided at &lt;a href=\"Undaunted%20Enclaves\"&gt;Undaunted Enclaves&lt;/a&gt;; there are three different quests for a different dungeon each that can be completed by defeating the dungeon's primary bosses.\n&lt;a href=\"Trial%20quest\"&gt;Trial quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTrials are large dungeons intended to be completed by a large group of 12 people working together and coordinating to defeat powerful bosses and groups of enemies with complex mechanics. Trial quests are repeatable, but unlike other repeatable quests, can only be completed once per week instead of once per day. Trial quests also include minor pointer quests that are designed to provide directions to the trial and introduce the quest's story.\n&lt;a href=\"Faction%20quest\"&gt;Faction quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Vestige may join any faction at any time to complete their quest lines. Membership in factions is not mutually exclusive, allowing the Vestige to join and complete all of their quest lines. For some quests, the Vestige must reach a prerequisite skill level in the appropriate faction's skill line to begin the next main quest. Daily quests require the Vestige to reach a certain main quest before they can be accepted.\n&lt;a href=\"Companion%20quest\"&gt;Companion quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCompanion quests are quests made available after enough rapport has been earned with a particular companion. Companions have three to four quests that are offered sequentially as soon as the minimum amount of rapport has been reached for each one. Each consecutive quest for a companion requires more rapport with them. Rapport is earned with a companion by performing actions that they like; some actions offer more rapport than others, and some actions reduce rapport. The final quest for a companion will allow them to be a &lt;a href=\"houseguest\"&gt;houseguest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Prologue%20quest\"&gt;Prologue quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPrologues are quests designed to introduce the narrative of an upcoming chapter or DLC. It is not necessary to own the associated chapter or DLC to complete the prologue, but further quests do require ownership by purchase or with an ESO Plus subscription. Prologue quests are introduced prior to launch of its associated chapter and DLC.\n&lt;a href=\"Crafting%20quest\"&gt;Crafting quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuests are offered to provide experience in leveling crafting skills. There are two categories of crafted items: equipment (&lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Online%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;) and consumables (&lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Online%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Online%29\"&gt;beverages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Online%29\"&gt;potions and poisons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;glyphs&lt;/a&gt;). Prior to completing regular and master crafting writs, the Vestige must complete a certification quest for each crafting skill that serves as an introduction to crafting various types of items.

Various actions, such as talking to people, reading books, etc., can initiate quests, allowing for rewards to be gained by completing them. Rewards may include gold, &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, increases of &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill levels&lt;/a&gt;. Successfully completing a quest for a person makes them friendly to the Dragonborn, opening opportunities in many cases to recruit &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; or make &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; proposals.\nThe \"main quest\" denotes tasks the Dragonborn is compelled to complete as part of the game's main story. Other quests can be performed for a guild or &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, while others are considered &lt;a href=\"Side%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;side quests&lt;/a&gt;, which skirt on the periphery of the game's plotlines. Not all the quests are visible in the &lt;a href=\"Journal\"&gt;Journal&lt;/a&gt;; some of them, such as selling crops or chopping wood, are hidden.\nAs with most of titles, there are &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; for each of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, excluding &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;. Unique to \"Skyrim\" are &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Quests\"&gt;Radiant Quests&lt;/a&gt;, quests which are initiated as part of the radiant story artificial intelligence system. These quests can be repeated an infinite number of times, allowing for never-ending gameplay. These quests can be useful for leveling up faster and/or getting gold or loot.\nTwo separate questlines were added to the game with the official &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;plug-ins&lt;/a&gt;, and . For coverage of these quests, see &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Quests (Dawnguard)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Quests (Dragonborn)&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterface.\nThe interface listing all quests can be activated through the &lt;a href=\"Map%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; menu or by accessing the Journal directly. The PC versions of the game allow the journal (pressing \"J\") to be accessed directly, while consoles open the journal, game settings, etc. through the same button. Quests are listed by faction and relevance to the main quest first, and alphabetically second. Thus, &lt;a href=\"%23Main%20quest\"&gt;quests in the main quest&lt;/a&gt; appear first, but &lt;a href=\"%23Thieves%20Guild%20quests\"&gt;quests involving the Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; appear later. &lt;a href=\"%23Miscellaneous%20quests\"&gt;Miscellaneous quests&lt;/a&gt; are grouped together on a separate menu, accessible from the very bottom of the list of quests.\nMost quests can be completed in any order, upon activation. However, quests markers will not appear on the world map, on the compass, or in-game unless they are marked as active in the interface. Simply selecting the affirmation button activates the quests, once it has been highlighted in the list. Completed lists are listed at the bottom of the quest menu, below a divider. The names are greyed out, and the bullets next to the objectives are filled, indicating successful completion, or marked with a red cross, indicating failure. Some quests are mutually exclusive (e.g., the Dragonborn cannot join the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks at the same time), so failure is not uncommon. In the menu, quests that are partially completed also have their objectives greyed out or ticked off. Optional tasks within the quest are labeled as such in the list as well.\nMain quest.\nThe main quest of involves the investigation and resolution of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, as foretold by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. Two factions must be joined in order to progress the main quest, &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;\" is completely optional and can be completed after the main quest. \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;\" operates under special conditions; completing it halts the &lt;a href=\"%23Civil%20War%20quests\"&gt;Civil War questline&lt;/a&gt;, while completing the Civil War questline causes this quest not to appear, since it is no longer necessary.\nFaction quests.\nQuests performed for the various &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;factions&lt;/a&gt; are not considered part of the main questline. Choices made during faction quests are non-&lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;ical, &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;-wise. Each faction contains several &lt;a href=\"radiant%20quests\"&gt;radiant quests&lt;/a&gt; which can be completed an innumerable amount of times.\nDaedric quests.\nTo earn &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Walker\"&gt;Oblivion Walker&lt;/a&gt; 15 &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric artifacts&lt;/a&gt; must be collected. These can be collected during the above quests, although some outcomes of the quest do not yield artifacts. This is based solely on choices made during quests.\nDungeon quests.\nThe following 24 quests relate to specific &lt;a href=\"dungeons\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Map%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt;. Quests listed with \"*\" appear as Miscellaneous Quests in the Quest Journal, and are named according to the Official Skyrim Game Guide.\nMiscellaneous quests.\nSorted by place of acquisition: &lt;a href=\"hold\"&gt;hold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, or place. Some are actual &lt;a href=\"Side%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;side quests&lt;/a&gt; and have their own quest lines which count towards the \"&lt;a href=\"Sideways\"&gt;Sideways&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;. Others are miscellaneous objectives and count toward the \"&lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20People\"&gt;Hero of the People&lt;/a&gt;\" trophy and achievement.\nBounty quests.\nThese can be given by innkeepers when asked about work or &lt;a href=\"rumors\"&gt;rumors&lt;/a&gt;. Any of the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s can give these when asked for work. The \"&lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Bounty Note&lt;/a&gt;\" identifies the type and location of the bounty."}

Whiterun is well-known throughout the Empire for being the trading capital of Skyrim, due to its convenient location, surrounding the Hold capitals of Skyrim. The Jarl's seat of power is the Crystal Throne, found in &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, a castle at the peak of the city.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nWhiterun is located in the central tundra of Skyrim, along the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; that flows from &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The area around Whiterun is very open, stretching far to the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Hills\"&gt;Sundered Hills&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. The area is very versatile, filled with all sorts of game, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Deer\"&gt;Deer&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;s. Farms and other settlements riddle the area such as the township of &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt; and the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Greymoor\"&gt;Greymoor&lt;/a&gt;, although they are more prevalent around the Whiterun outskirts. The roads of Whiterun connect to most of the hold capitals, &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; is mostly a straight path north of Whiterun, and south-southwest leads directly to &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. The hill known as &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt; was the foundation of Whiterun's construction, the city grew around the landmark. Throughout the area, there are several Whiterun defense towers, safeguarding the roads around Whiterun. The &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt; is in between Whiterun and Greymoor. The northern road has the &lt;a href=\"Whitewatch%20Tower\"&gt;Whitewatch Tower&lt;/a&gt; in between Whiterun and Heljarchen Creek.\nWhiterun is a well-fortified city with watchtowers all along the border. The western gate is the only entrance to Whiterun, which is heavily fortified, with a drawbridge connecting the city. The city is divided into three districts. The Plains District is the lower level of Whiterun; it is where the common-folk reside and trade amongst each other. &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular inn in the city, it is located on the eastern end of the Plains District, adjacent to the market square in the center of the Plains District. The Wind District is the second level of Whiterun, and it is the home of the nobility in Whiterun, as well as, other notable groups. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kynareth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; is located in the center of the Winds District, parallel to the &lt;a href=\"Gildergreen\"&gt;Gildergreen&lt;/a&gt; Tree, an ancient tree that grew from the &lt;a href=\"Eldergleam%20Tree\"&gt;Eldergleam Tree&lt;/a&gt; of Eastmarch. The eastern side is the home of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; and the Skyforge. The Companions stronghold was the first building in Whiterun. Finally, there is the Cloud District, which is the home of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, which was where the trap was built by &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; to trap the great dragon Numinex.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nJeek of the River &amp; the city of Whiterun.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; purged the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; and inhabited the province of Skyrim. Many of the Companions had spread out throughout Skyrim, moving westward into the modern-day &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. One of the many Atmoran pioneers was &lt;a href=\"Jeek%20of%20the%20River\"&gt;Jeek of the River&lt;/a&gt;, who sailed from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; on the mighty ship named the &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr%20%28Ship%29\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; with his crew. The crew of the Jorrvaskr embarked onto Skyrim from the northeast and defeated the Elves in their path. One of the members, &lt;a href=\"Jonder%20the%20Tiny\"&gt;Jonder the Tiny&lt;/a&gt;, went ahead and witnessed the great plains of modern-day Whiterun Hold, a vast open grassland with no end in sight. He looked over and saw and rocky hill with a large bird monument and a searing fire under its wings. This monument would be named the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;. And so, the Jorrvaskr crew began constructing their stronghold Jorrvaskr, and as time went on, they built a new city, circling on the running of the White River. Thus, the city of Whiterun was born.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOlaf One-Eye; the Tale of Numinex.\nDuring the First Era, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Borgas\"&gt;High King Borgas&lt;/a&gt; was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, ending the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, a new High King was needed to rule over the province of Skyrim. Tension would rise, starting the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s of Skyrim would fight each other for the position of High King. Around the same time, the great &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt; was terrorizing Skyrim while the Jarls were warring against each other, no one would defeat the Dragon. At this time, the Jarl of Whiterun was &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to take the initiative to fight against Numinex atop his lair in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Anthor\"&gt;Mount Anthor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20atop%20Mount%20Anthor\"&gt;Battle atop Mount Anthor&lt;/a&gt; was fierce, but in the end, Olaf One-Eye had won and trapped Numinex into his new castle called &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this feat, the Jarls had settled down and named Olaf One-Eye, the new High King of Skyrim. So another conflict would not start, the Jarls created the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, where a &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; would be convened to determine the next High King after a dynasty.\nOlaf the Liar &amp; Svaknir's Vendetta.\nOlaf One-Eye was considered a hero throughout the whole province, but many people felt that there was something else to the story, something wrong. Many people accused Olaf of fabricating a tale about an epic battle so that he could gain the praise and become the High King of Skyrim. One person that accused the King of this was &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt;, alumni of the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Svaknir had claimed a different tale. Knowing that his time was ending, Numinex flew all across Skyrim, burning villages before leaving to Mount Anthor where he would rest in peace. By the time Olaf One-Eye and his men arrived onto Mount Anthor, Numinex was weak and near-death. Olaf's men captured Numinex and took them to Dragonsreach, imprisoning him. Those men that helped Olaf had become wealthy leaders during Olaf's reign. In the end, Olaf One-Eye was buried in &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Men%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Dead Men's Respite&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned Svaknir there, leaving him to die.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Western Skyrim.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt;, who was a close ally of Versidue Shaie and was unfortunately assassinated around the same time in &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;. Eyes were looking towards &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt;, Logrolf's daughter, assuming she would become the next High Queen leading Skyrim into the future. Controversy would soon arise from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Jarl Svartr&lt;/a&gt; would claim that Freydis was illegitimate for the throne and that a &lt;a href=\"moot\"&gt;moot&lt;/a&gt; was required to determine the new leader. The Moot had spoken, and the leaders of Skyrim voted for Svartr to become the High King. However, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt;, the one that has chosen the High King for generations since &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; had chosen Freydis to become the High Queen. The province became divided, the Nords of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; followed Freydis while the Nords of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; followed Svartr. Skyrim had split into two separate kingdoms which would later affect the province for the next few years. The city of Whiterun, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; region, would join the Western Skyrim Kingdom.\nBarenziah the Young; Adventures of Youth.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest over &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, the royal daughter of the King of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; was taken by &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, a Dark Elven General of the invading force. The young child was named &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, and she was taken to the outskirts of Whiterun, to the township of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor&lt;/a&gt; where she would be supervised by &lt;a href=\"Count%20Sven%20Advensen\"&gt;Count Sven Advensen&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran of the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Barenziah grew up as a proper noble but had yearned adventure outside; she would occasionally escape Castle Darkmoor to wander off from time to time. During her stay, she befriended a donkey-brained stable boy named &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt; out of pity, for he was a bumbling oaf. Straw told Barenziah about a conspiracy against her, saying that she would be sold as a concubine to the King of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;, so the two hatched a plan to escape Darkmoor to the nearby city-state of Whiterun. To flee the Castle, Barenziah dressed as a boy and took up a job as a Caravan Guard with Straw, the two then headed to the city of Whiterun, arriving at dawn.\nDuring their stay in Whiterun, the two teenagers lived out in the poor district of Whiterun, staying in a shanty inn in the area. Her disguise was effective, despite her dark skin and vibrant red eyes, she blended into the crowd, but she still had to hide since most Dark Elves are not found in Whiterun. With the gold that they took from Darkmoor, the two lived in the inn, enjoying decent meals, celebrating their escape, and having vigorous sex until they fell asleep. Time eventually came when the two had to leave Whiterun and move eastward to the province of Morrowind. The two hooked jobs as Caravan Guards for a group heading to the city of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, which is near the border of Morrowind. The two left for Riften where Barenziah would reunite with Symmachus and eventually become the Queen of Mournhold. Straw would later die a horrible death.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhiterun during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Whiterun in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Whiterun was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Asgis\"&gt;King Asgis&lt;/a&gt;.\nJsashe the Witch-Queen; the Deceiving Tyrant.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the city-state of Whiterun was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Jsashe\"&gt;Jsashe&lt;/a&gt;, the Witch-Queen and the Priestess of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Her rise to the throne of Whiterun is mysterious, recently, the group known as &lt;a href=\"Horme\"&gt;Horme&lt;/a&gt; and several natural attacks have plagued the Kingdom of Whiterun and other settlements including &lt;a href=\"Hrothgar\"&gt;Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. A vast majority of the citizens had blamed Jsashe but had unexpectedly exalted her to the seat of power in Dragonsreach. She would earn the moniker of the Witch-Queen. Jsashe had a massive amount of control in the land, though her magic did not bring prosperity into her domain. Jsashe would continue to rule over the city of Whiterun into the fourth era. Luckily, the Nordic Kingdoms in the North were doing way better in the long run.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Last Dragonborn of Prophecy; the Dragon Crisis.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Whiterun was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Jarl Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt;. Balgruuf was a well-spoken man who put his people first then the problems occurring throughout the province. During the conflict, Whiterun was nominally aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the conflict, but Balgruuf was focused on protecting his people from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time, the township of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; was razed by the World-Eater &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, and a survivor traveled to Whiterun, to warn the Jarl about the recent dragon attack. Giving a convincing story, Jarl Balgruuf sent a militia to the township of &lt;a href=\"Riverwood\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; to protect them from other threats and sent the survivor to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt; for the Whiterun court-wizard, &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, the lost Dragon known as &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt; had attacked the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt; in between Whiterun and Greymoor. The survivor and a group of Whiterun Guards traveled to the outpost and fought the dragon. The survivor had ultimately killed Mirmulnir, and the dragon's soul had enveloped the warrior. This event would reveal the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; of prophecy.\nThe Plan to trap Odahviing; the Dragonslayer.\nThe Dragon Crisis had taken its toll on the residents of Skyrim, and so an end to this conflict need to come to fruition. After learning &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dragonborn had battled Alduin at the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, temporarily defeating the World-Eater. After the battle, Alduin escaped to the ancient temple of &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; rooted in the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Through the wisdom of their teachers, the Last Dragonborn learned a shout that summoned an ally of Alduin named &lt;a href=\"Odahviing\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt;, the plan was to summon Odahviing and to interrogate him on Alduin's whereabouts. With the help of the Jarl of Whiterun, the Last Dragonborn was able to snare Odahviing inside of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, the prison of the Great Dragon Numinex of ye old. In the end, Odahviing took the Last Dragonborn to Skuldafn, where they would eventually traverse &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; and defeated Alduin, once and for all."}

In Whiterun, &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; live in the 'traditional' manner: their lives are simple, harsh, and rooted in ancient ideas. Even the city's fortifications\u2014wooden and stone palisade walls and the sheer defensive advantage offered by its position on a large bluff that raises the city above the surrounding tundra\u2014are archaic by contemporary standards.\nDue to its central location, Whiterun serves as the commercial heart of Skyrim.\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nWhiterun is located on the eastern end of its &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt;, in the tundra plains that fill the center of Skyrim. It was founded by &lt;a href=\"Jeek%20of%20the%20River\"&gt;Jeek of the River&lt;/a&gt;, who was the captain of &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr%20%28Ship%29\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;. Upon discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, he and his men constructed the great mead hall of &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, which at the time was the sole structure on the bluff. Now, Whiterun is a large city, albeit one that retains the feel of a smaller Nord village. The central location and easy access make it one of the most successful cities in trade.\nFirst Era.\nWhen approaching Whiterun, the towering fortress of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; dominates the view. Its history can be traced back to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;King Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; subdued the great &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt; in a legendary duel of &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Anthor\"&gt;Mount Anthor&lt;/a&gt; and brought him back to the fledgling town as a captive. It was then that the magnificent keep was rebuilt and renamed to serve as a cage for Numinex, whose head still adorns the Great Hall.\n&lt;a href=\"Gjalund\"&gt;Gjalund&lt;/a&gt; was the Jarl of Whiterun sometime in the First Era. As Jarl, his holdings included Whiterun, &lt;a href=\"Granite%20Hill\"&gt;Granite Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20H%27roldan\"&gt;Old H'roldan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Volunruud\"&gt;Volunruud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;.\nSociology.\nWhiterun was once considered Skyrim's equivalent of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but in recent times has suffered from many problems. The Civil War, excessively harsh winters, harassment by &lt;a href=\"Horme\"&gt;Horme&lt;/a&gt; bandits, and the attacks of &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost trolls&lt;/a&gt; have diminished the once-proud city.\nIt's a strategic city for both the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; because of its central location, however &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; remains neutral in the conflict.\nThe city is home to two important dynastic families, the &lt;a href=\"Gray-Mane\"&gt;Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Battle-Born\"&gt;Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt;s. Once on good terms with one another, they are currently bitter enemies, as a result of their differing views on the civil war conflict, as well as the economic disparity between both clans, since the Battle-Borns are wealthy and the Gray-Manes are modest. Upon entering the city, the Dragonborn is able to choose a &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;side&lt;/a&gt;, either Battle-Born or Gray-Mane, although this is not necessary to interact with the city's shops and temple.\nWhiterun is home to &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt;, a faction similar to the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Their headquarters are in Jorrvaskr, a legendary mead hall that was built next to the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient forge that is said to be older than both men and Elves. The city of Whiterun itself was built around Jorrvaskr, which attracts warriors from all across Tamriel.\nAllegiance.\nInitially, Jarl Balgruuf decides not to join either side in the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War%20Quests\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, making Whiterun neutral. He does claim to owe a favor to &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, to whom he seems indebted, but also suggests that he owes a favor to &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; as well. He notes that he believes he and Whiterun have obligations to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and owes it his loyalty, but also says he must honor the Nords desiring independence as well. Eventually, he and Whiterun will side with the Empire upon reaching that point in the Civil War quest line. However, even before this, there are several indicators that suggest Whiterun leans more towards the Empire:\nCity layout.\nWhiterun is composed of three distinct districts:\nThe Plains District.\nThis is the first district any visitor to Whiterun enters, named as such because it is the lowest of the three and therefore closest to the plains outside the city. It contains all the major &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Marketplace\"&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breezehome\"&gt;Breezehome&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wind District.\nThe Wind District is where most of Whiterun's residential buildings (including the mead hall &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gildergreen\"&gt;Gildergreen&lt;/a&gt;) are located and was named because of the strong mountain winds that gust through the area.\nThe Cloud District.\nThe Cloud District is the smallest of Whiterun\u2019s three districts. Its name is derived from the fact that it is located atop the bluff Whiterun was built on and is therefore closer to the clouds than any other. It is dominated by the imposing form of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nPurchasable property.\n&lt;a href=\"Breezehome\"&gt;Breezehome&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in Whiterun, costs 5000 and can be bought from the &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; grants permission, in gratitude for retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. The seller is either &lt;a href=\"Proventus%20Avenicci\"&gt;Proventus Avenicci&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, depending on who remains Jarl after the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. Earning approval requires the &lt;a href=\"Becoming%20Thane\"&gt;performance of certain tasks around the city&lt;/a&gt;. You can also buy the decorations for your home from the Steward, such as a laboratory and storage space."}

It is named for the capital city of the hold, &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. The landscape is mostly boreal plains with vast, sparse tundra and flowing rivers; however its most striking landmark is the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, the highest peak in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.

Though High Hrothgar is located within Whiterun Hold, the Greybeards seem to have no political ties to Whiterun, instead remaining apolitical.\nThis hold is also known for having a large number of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt; camps. The &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; divides the region. Sparse plains extend from west of the river to the township of &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt; near the western border, which is situated on ideal farmland. Much of the area near the southern border and east of the river is mountainous. Whiterun appears to have stable security, but some residents, such as &lt;a href=\"Sinmir\"&gt;Sinmir&lt;/a&gt;, complain that Whiterun's security is the worst in the province, calling it shameful (perhaps referring to the lack of guards in one of the hold's villages, &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;, early in the game). \nLocations.\nThe following are locations that appear in the map in Whiterun Hold:"}

I believe this assertion is either the result of a lack of proper academic rigor, or, just as likely, an attempt to manufacture controversy to appeal to the masses.\nIn my own meticulous research, I have certainly found some similarities between the Spinners and the Wardens. Like the Wood Elf priests, these guardians appear to have a close connection with the god &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, the deity of song and forest.\nHowever, in my opinion, this is where the similarities end, and just as I did with the famous coven in my seminal work \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Glenmoril%20Wyrd\"&gt;The Glenmoril Wyrd&lt;/a&gt;,\" I shall take it upon myself to dispel the many myths and misunderstandings associated with these warriors.\nFirst and foremost, the Spinners are not militant or violent, preferring to allow others to fight for them and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and to instead take on an advisory, scholarly, or priestly role within Bosmer society. By comparison, Wardens appear to be more than willing to shed blood to protect the wilds, and there are many reports of them attacking individuals, gangs, and even entire outposts that have done some harm to Y'ffre's realm.\nThere also appear to be stark differences in the Warden's powers from those of the Spinners. While the Bosmer priests reportedly draw stories from their past, present, and future to entrance their audience, Wardens seem to draw upon their natural environment to change and shape reality itself. In layman's terms, something I think my colleague &lt;a href=\"Phrastus%20of%20Elinhir\"&gt;Phrastus&lt;/a&gt; may appreciate, the Spinners appear to employ a kind of &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;ary magic, whereas the Warden's abilities are more akin to what might traditionally be called &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Spinners are a unique priestly order that is central to Bosmer culture, my studies have found no singular body or organization that represents the Wardens, and indeed they appear to mostly travel alone or in pairs, beholden to nobody. If they are members of any groups, it is the local &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guilds&lt;/a&gt;, or even, in one poorly documented case, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiven their association with Y'ffre, are the Wardens predominantly Wood Elves? It does not seem so. While Spinners are exclusively made up of Bosmer, Wardens of all races\u2014&lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;\u2014that can be found protecting &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s wilds. Indeed, I have met Wardens who hailed from the northernmost peaks of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and from the southern forests of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. I have even met a fellow native of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd what of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;? Do the Wardens adhere to the ancient Wood Elf tradition? With the exception, of course, of those who are both Warden and Wood Elf, this does not appear to be the case either. In my experience, most Wardens are, in fact, more than willing to make full use of nature's bounty in order to survive, including partaking of both its plant and animal life.\nFinally, the Spinners are found almost exclusively within the confines of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and they rarely venture far beyond the protection of its ancient forests. Wardens, however, appear all over Tamriel, with the most recent reports placing some on the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese are my early findings on the Wardens of Tamriel. They are a unique and mysterious group, similar to the Spinners, but also distinctly different. It is clear to me that greater academic inquiry is required, and I am sure upon further investigation, the rest of Phrastus of Elinhir's outrageous claims will be proven false (as they so often are.)"}

There are five targets\u2014four unarmed civilians and one armed one, &lt;a href=\"Neville\"&gt;Neville&lt;/a&gt;, all locked in the house. While it is possible to just enter the house and kill them all, this will forfeit the bonus unless it is done stealthily.

Talking to all the targets will reveal various ways to get them on their own in different parts of the house, where they can be dispatched safely.\nFor example, &lt;a href=\"Dovesi%20Dran\"&gt;Dovesi Dran&lt;/a&gt; can be tricked into going upstairs alone to wait for &lt;a href=\"Primo%20Antonius\"&gt;Primo Antonius&lt;/a&gt;; Neville can be convinced to take a nap; and &lt;a href=\"Matilde%20Petit\"&gt;Matilde Petit&lt;/a&gt; can be told to search the basement. Also, when there are only two guests left, talk to one of them and they may attempt to kill the other.\nAlternatively, it is not required to speak to anyone after the initial entry conversation. Simply sneak around and wait for each person to be alone and kill them. This actually gets easier as each person is killed.\nGuests.\nWhen all the guests have been killed, return to &lt;a href=\"Ocheeva\"&gt;Ocheeva&lt;/a&gt; to get the reward and possible bonus."}

Ashtad will tell you that he only targets bandits and is therefore not a bad person, and will ask you to get the keys to his shackles from Wildur's tent. At the tent, you will run into Sarveeyah. Apparently, she was the one who tipped off the others about Ashtad being a fraud. She will help you and Ashtad get away if you promise to take her with you; she can take the keys if you distract Wildur and his goons by challenging him to a duel. \nHead through the tunnel where you found the dowry gold and speak with &lt;a href=\"%22Slicer%22%20of%20the%20Ungodly\"&gt;\"Slicer\" of the Ungodly&lt;/a&gt;.

Blood is our birthright, and the sinews of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; knit around our bones. But we were not made to sit still. We were not made to settle and till the land, but to move, to pillage, and to plunder. Our strength is to destroy. We reap the glory of war from what we destroy. That is the only crop we need!\nBut many years ago, Torug, first among the Orcs in strength and rage, came to our people with a vision. We will build a great city, said he, and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt; will look to us with fear and respect.\nFear us they did, but know that an Orc is never respected, no matter how great a city he builds.\nThey built the city into the rock, a shiny gem. Orsinium. And it was a great city, but Orcs were not made to live in cities. Its walls, designed to defend, only trapped us. Its threefold gates sealed us in. The city was a cairn to Torug's ambition\u2014to the dreams of the Orcs, and in time the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; peoples &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;came to destroy it&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe did not flee because we feared war. We fled to meet the enemy and we cut a swathe through their armies and then through their lands. All their holdings in &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; trembled as we marched, and the earth shook with the sound of our footfalls.\nO Glory! O Joy! To be Orcs again! Free and on the move!\nIt was not to last. The enemy mustered their forces in number far exceeding our own and pressed us back to the edge of the mountain, to the plain of unending ice.

If the Nerevarine talks to her, she will refuse to give them the deed, stating that her husband was murdered by a legionnaire in the Mine and she wants the Nerevarine to find out what happened. At this point the Nerevarine may either steal the deed from her, or investigate her claims.\nMurder Investigation.\nThe Gnisis Eggmine can be found on the hill on the east side of Gnisis.

{"id": "10929", "revid": "5064773", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10929", "title": "Wild Hunt", "text": "The Wild Hunt is a ritual performed by the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, part of the oath known as the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and thus associated to &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, the main god of the &lt;a href=\"Bosmeri%20pantheon\"&gt;Bosmeri pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. A historical example of the Hunt was the one that killed &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt; (thus setting the events of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; in motion) for the \"iniquities\" of his &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian faith&lt;/a&gt; whilst he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to urge a joint war against the Bosmer. This event was also the last confirmed wearing of the &lt;a href=\"Jagged%20Crown\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBosmeri &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt; holds that after the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;mortal plane&lt;/a&gt;, everything was in chaos, with the first mortals \"turning into plants and animals and back again\". Then Y'ffre established the laws of nature, becoming the first of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Earth Bones&lt;/a&gt; and giving mortals a semblance of safety in the new world, as they could now understand it. For this event Y'ffre is sometimes referred to as \"the Storyteller\", and it is believed that the Wild Hunt can be performed due to some of the Bosmer still holding knowledge of the \"&lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;chaos times&lt;/a&gt;\". Although the Bosmer are said to be able to resort to animal shapes if needed, their \"most dreaded transformation\" is the Wild Hunt. Described as \"a flood of horrific beasts, tentacled toads, insects of armor and spine, gelatinous serpents, vaporous beings with the face of gods, blind in fury,\" or \"a pack of shifting forest-demons and animal-gods, thousands strong, which sweeps through the countryside killing everything in its path.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; writer &lt;a href=\"Waughin%20Jarth\"&gt;Waughin Jarth&lt;/a&gt; describes the Hunt in great detail in his novel \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Dance%20in%20Fire\"&gt;A Dance in Fire&lt;/a&gt;\", through the eyes of his fictitious (although allegedly based on a real person) character &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt;. In the novel, it is stated that, pouring forth from a great hollow tree, the Hunt \"tore the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i in front of the temple to pieces\", consuming the village of &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Vindisi\"&gt;Vindisi&lt;/a&gt; within seconds. When sealed within the location by fleeing Khajiiti, the apparitions of the Great Hunt then turned on one another as there was no enemy to be reached anymore, ensuing in what Jarth describes as a \"cannibalistic orgy\". It is said that the Bosmer do not like to talk about the Hunt nor feel any pride in having such a power, and that although the ritual is used for achieving justice, the Bosmer Gomini says that \"every monster in the world that has ever been comes from a previous Hunt. Those Bosmer that go Wild, they do not return\". The voracity of the Hunt in such that the beasts are said to devour other creatures to the bone in the span of a few moments. It is said that when the Wood Elves invoke the Wild Hunt, creatures forget their Y'ffre-taught shapes and shift into unnatural forms, such as those that occupy a space between flora and fauna."}

He is often very selective of whom he appears to, which is the main cause of people doubting his existence.\nDomain.\nThe Wilderking's domain is known as the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking%20Court\"&gt;Wilderking Court&lt;/a&gt; and controls the southeastern part of Greenshade. His physical manifestation lives at the throne of the wilderking located above the city of &lt;a href=\"Greenheart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Wilderking or queen is always &lt;a href=\"Mantling\"&gt;mantled&lt;/a&gt; by a mortal. The mortal can be of any race, but is most commonly an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;. The mortal must be born with a powerful control over nature, and will be brought to the Wilderking's Court by the order of fate. Once mantled, the previous mortal dies and the newly mantled mortal loses all memories of their life.\nIt is unknown exactly when the Wilderking appeared in Valenwood, but they were known to have been active there since at least the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; having mantled many people. Some time prior to &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the Wilderking made a deal with the Bosmer village of the Shrouded Vale where they would be sent to an Aetherial paradise in exchange for someone to be used as caretaker for &lt;a href=\"The%20Fading%20Tree\"&gt;The Fading Tree&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring , the Wilderking currently mantles an Altmer male named Ostion. The &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; is working on friendly negotiations with the Wilderking. As the storyline progresses, it is revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; was working on a plot to kill the Wilderking and that one of their members, &lt;a href=\"Aranias\"&gt;Aranias&lt;/a&gt;, was destined to be the new vessel of the Wilderking. Aranias then realizes her position from the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; and is mantled, becoming the new Wilderqueen.\nPowers and abilities.\nThe Wilderking has almost complete divine power over nature and as such controls the balance between nature and its creatures. This can be seen by his control over &lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lurchers&lt;/a&gt; at his court which are used to guard him.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Audience%20with%20the%20Wilderking\"&gt;Audience with the Wilderking&lt;/a&gt;.\nExpose the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; plot to assassinate the Wilderking.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Spinner%27s%20Tale\"&gt;The Spinner's Tale&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind a Spinner in the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking%20Court\"&gt;Wilderking Court&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Wilderking\"&gt;Throne of the Wilderking&lt;/a&gt;.\nHelp defend the Wilderking from Heritance assassins."}

Lord Akatosh, grant us your light!\"\"\n\u2014A popular prayer to Akatosh the Dragon God\nIf there is a single Divine who holds dominion over the Gold Coast, it has to be Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time. From the grand Cathedral of Akatosh in Kvatch and radiating outward, the word of Akatosh and his servants spreads the light and the truth of the Dragon God in all directions.\nReputed to be the first and greatest of the Eight &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; and the first of the gods to form in the Beginning Place, Akatosh watches over the land and its people with a singular ferocity, never shirking in his role as the God-defender of the Empire\u2014even while the Empire lies broken and shattered. As the Primate of Kvatch likes to say at every opportunity, \"The Dragon God sees beyond the concerns of the day and contemplates the entire expanse of time. The current situation is merely a minor disturbance in the flow of events, and Akatosh has everything well in hand.\"\nAkatosh promotes three key qualities in his sphere: endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy. Perhaps that's why the Empire was so quick to embrace the Dragon God and his tenets. In the words of the Primate of Kvatch, here are the ways in which Akatosh embodies the three key qualities.\nBeyond these basic tenets, the Primate of Kvatch and his priests preach the five commands of Akatosh to faithful and faithless alike.\nThe Primate of Kvatch often declares, \"As Akatosh wills it, so shall it be.\" For the Dragon God of Time embodies yesterday, today, and tomorrow, and he embraces the rules that keep the world ordered and precise. By honoring Akatosh with devotion and worship, his followers endeavor to do the same."}

The words of our Sermons, laid before us by the ever-faithful Deldrise Morvayn, Fourth Tourbillon. The will of our god Lord &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt;, the Mainspring Ever-Wound, the Divine Metronome. The driving forces of inspiration, of innovation, of discovery in all forms, magical, technological, spiritual. But we often forget, in our pursuit to unravel the mysterious of our world, that we are also subjects of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\nI have found throughout my long tenure that many of my pupils have a hard time grasping the threefold nature of our belief within the Tribunal. Still, despite the repetition of these questions, I never rebuff this curiosity. Rather, I try to encourage it, for there is an abundance of contradictions within our piety towards Lady &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and Lord &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. After all, the worship of these deities seem to almost challenge the beliefs we hold so true within our order.\nWhy are we told to worship these often puzzling deities alongside our sound and steady Clockwork God? Why must we follow not one god, but three?\nYet even this seemingly simple fact is but a misconception, for in this sequence we have found truth. ALMSIVI is but one entity, not the fractured creation that many perceive it as. It only appears fractured in the forms our gods have taken, but rather than separate deities they are all one portion of a welded whole. Regulated in their irregularities. Lady Almalexia and Lord Vivec, who are only consistent in their inconsistency, still create the order of our truths. They are the tock within our Lord Seht's tick, the wheel that forever goes forward but only to circle itself.\nThey are the truths of our chaotic present, the irregular oscillations that we must weld together. Within them we find the aspects of our humanity, the soul which merges with the machine, ambition which merges with beneficence. The act of faith itself seems contradictory to the importance we hold on evidential certainty. But not one among us is completely machine, cold and logical without the emotions which bind us together. No, we are welded beings, as varied and complex as our three gods. Fractured parts which have come together to create our individuality.\nHow does one devote themselves to such aspects? To these traits of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; which are not logic and order, our guiding principles? The Sermons tell us to understand their limitations. To pay heed, but know the boundaries of their scale. Know that these are the principals needed for our current world, Nirn-Prior, and shall be but an addition to the whole which is Nirn-Ensuing.\nHold tight their words, their laws and limits. Know that they are the echoes of a fractured selves, welded whole. Know that the Sublime Piston gives and takes in equal measures, sundering the Named pursuits of lesser mer. We must tear apart that which will be welded whole once more. Beliefs, structures, laws, one day outdated and unneeded.\nAnd so we pay our respects to these aspects of our deities. Without faith towards ALMSIVI we ourselves become sundered from the truth. Speak the names of Lady Almalexia and Lord Vivec with respect, with piety. Listen to their words and heed their laws when necessary. They are the broken cogs that reflect ourselves, to be as venerated as the truths that we honor."}

{"id": "17650", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17650", "title": "Wraith (Oblivion)", "text": "A Wraith is essentially a more powerful &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. Most of their features are hidden by a large, tattered black cloak, showing only their face and hands. The skin of a Wraith is a pale, dirty green, and their face is usually contorted in a terrifying scream. Since no feet emerge from the bottom of the cloak and they move by hovering, it can be safe to assume that their body structure is the same as a Ghost - a head, a torso, and two arms.\nGloom Wraiths also seem to have a tiara-like structure of spikes upon their forehead like a crown with a beard, and Faded Wraiths are less visible and ghost-like than an ordinary Wraith. Unlike Ghosts, Wraiths appear to be fully or at least slightly solid, as they are able to wield weapons. Similarly to &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Trolls&lt;/a&gt;, Wraiths have a distinct, ear-piercing screech.\nWraiths cast a powerful spell called Silence of the Grave, which causes &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silence&lt;/a&gt;. They can carry weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Elven swords&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Glass swords&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeveled wraiths.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; attains higher levels, Wraiths completely replace Ghosts as the game adapts its difficulty to character level. Thus, Wraiths are mainly encountered in &lt;a href=\"dungeons\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; basements.\nVulnerabilities.\nLike their Ghost cousins, Wraiths are immune to most normal attacks, but are vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Enchanted weapons&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, if the Hero's &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt; skill is high enough (Journeyman), Wraiths can be damaged by bare fists.\nConjuration magic.\nWraiths can be summoned as an advanced &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, as either a Faded Wraith or a &lt;a href=\"Gloom%20Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gloom Wraith&lt;/a&gt;. Gloom Wraiths have the highest &lt;a href=\"health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; of any &lt;a href=\"summon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; available, making them extremely useful for &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; with low defense.\nA summon faded Wraith spell requires a Conjuration skill level of at least 75 (Expert). The \"Summon Faded Wraith\" spell can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;Raminus Polus&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Athragar\"&gt;Athragar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Chorrol Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nA summon Gloom Wraith spell requires a Conjuration skill level of 100 (Master). The \"Summon Gloom Wraith\" spell can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Borissean\"&gt;Borissean&lt;/a&gt; at the Arcane University.\nThe ability to summon a Faded Wraith is needed for &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20Training\"&gt;Conjuration Training&lt;/a&gt;.

It is one of the best armor pieces of the game.\nBackground.\nBeneath &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Dwemer miners discovered a great magical stone. By diverse methods, Lord &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, High Priest and Magecrafter of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, determined that this magical stone was the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; of the god &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, cast here in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; as punishment for his mischief in creating the mortal world. Determined to use its divine powers to create a new god for the exclusive benefit of the Dwemer, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; forged three great enchanted artifacts, which are called Kagrenac's Tools. Wraithguard is an enchanted gauntlet to protect its wearer from destruction when tapping the heart's power. &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted hammer to strike the heart and produce the exact volume and quality of power desired. &lt;a href=\"Keening%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted blade that is used to flay and focus the power that rises from the heart.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; wrested &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; and the Heart of Lorkhan from &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; and used them to give themselves divine powers. Unbeknownst to them, Voryn Dagoth did not die from their conflict but had secretly connected himself to the Heart long ago, turning into &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and becoming a divine being himself. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, Wraithguard was not lost during a pilgrimage to Red Mountain but kept safe in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. After being obtained by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, it was used to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchantment.\nEnchantment ID: \"wraithguard_en\"\nAll &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Effects%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;magic effects&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Constant%20Effect\"&gt;constant&lt;/a&gt; on self:\nAcquisition.\n&lt;a href=\"Hortator%20and%20Nerevarine\"&gt;Hortator and Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nWraithguard can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; as a gift, where he activates it for you and tells you the location of the Keening and Sunder.\n&lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn%20and%20Wraithguard\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn and Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Vivec is defeated, instead of Wraithguard, the &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Dwemer%20Artifact\"&gt;Unique Dwemer Artifact&lt;/a&gt; can be found on his corpse, it needs to be activated by &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt;, who requires &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Kagrenac's Journal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Planbook\"&gt;Planbook&lt;/a&gt; to do so.

After recovering the two pieces, &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; used the Wrathstone to find and unlock the Halls of Colossus, believing it to house a weapon that could end the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, inadvertently releasing the dragons within.\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary Khajiit hero Khunzar-ri and his Kra'Jun \u2013 his company of heroes \u2013 fought against the dragon Kaalgrontiid across Elsweyr. Khunzar-ri battled against Kaalgrontiid and his fellow dragons for forty-one days and nights, together with &lt;a href=\"Nurarion%20the%20Perfect\"&gt;Nurarion the Perfect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flinthild%20Demon-Hunter\"&gt;Flinthild Demon-Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Sharp-Tongue\"&gt;Anequina Sharp-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt;. Because they were not able to defeat the dragons, they instead tricked them by siphoning their power in &lt;a href=\"Jode%27s%20Core\"&gt;Jode's Core&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them weakened before trapping them within the Halls of Colossus, with only the Wrathstone able to unseal the doors.\nFirst Era.\nUnder unknown circumstances at an unknown time, the Wrathstone was believed to be possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; architect &lt;a href=\"Mhuvnak\"&gt;Mhuvnak&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim. Following numerous attacks against the city over the years by &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, other Dwemer clans, and Ayleids, Mhuvnak was speculated to have fled the city to nearby &lt;a href=\"Kagrenzel\"&gt;Kagrenzel&lt;/a&gt; with the Wrathstone before constructing the Vault of Mhuvnak \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Frostvault\"&gt;Frostvault&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 on the other side of the &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20River\"&gt;Darkwater River&lt;/a&gt;. The location of the Vault was lost in the intervening time between the fall and reclamation of Mzulft. The Dwemer used an &lt;a href=\"Oculory\"&gt;Oculory&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to find the forgotten Frostvault, but there was no indication that they ever succeeded. It is unknown how exactly the Wrathstone became split into two parts following this time.\nBy the end of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt;, the failing Ayleid kingdoms began a desperate search for the Wrathstone which they believed could turn the tide of their war against &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;. A unit was sent to Mzulft, as it was believed that they had the Wrathstone, but it was, in fact, the nearby Dwemer city of Kagrenzel that possessed it inside the Frostvault at this time. &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, patron deity of Garlas Malatar, told her followers that the empire of the Ayleids would fall, but that the city would be entrusted with one half of the Wrathstone to guard eternally. Despite the sacking of the city, Men never entered the inner reaches of Garlas Malatar before it fell to internal struggles due to its extreme isolationism, and the Wrathstone segment remained untouched within.\nSecond Era.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Tjurhane%20Fyrre\"&gt;Tjurhane Fyrre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20227\"&gt;2E 227&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; discovered writings of interest in the deceased scholar's works relating to Garlas Malatar. The Imperials constructed &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Mistwatch\"&gt;Fort Mistwatch&lt;/a&gt; on the site of the Ayleid city in an attempt to cover up the subsequent excavation and looting. The expedition was abandoned when the entire cohort of Imperials were forcibly \"&lt;a href=\"purified\"&gt;purified&lt;/a&gt;,\" converting them into guardians that would eternally protect the Wrathstone segment, leaving no one left who knew of the entrance to the city.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, both pieces of the Wrathstone in Garlas Malatar and Frostvault were recovered by &lt;a href=\"Tharayya\"&gt;Tharayya&lt;/a&gt; under the employ of Abnur Tharn. Intending to use the Wrathstone to retrieve what he believed to be a weapon that could end the Alliance War, Tharn discerned the location of the Halls of Colossus with the information on the Wrathstone and the stories of &lt;a href=\"Moon-Singers\"&gt;Moon-Singers&lt;/a&gt; recalling the legends of Khunzar-ri.

It consists of the northeastern mountains of the province and makes up half of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; alongside the region of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. Wrothgar has been the traditional home of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; dating back to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and has remained that way since.\nDescription.\nGeography.\n&lt;a href=\"Western%20Wrothgar\"&gt;Western Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area of Western Wrothgar is a boreal forest where the first Orcish Kingdom was established. Western Wrothgar is the closest to the Bretony heartlands of &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; and as a result, the region reflects that environment and the gradual snow climate of Wrothgar. Several landmarks exist in the region, such as &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Honor's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, the burial grounds of Gaiden Shinji and Baloth Bloodtusk. The westernmost valley of Wrothgar contains &lt;a href=\"Paragon%27s%20Remembrance\"&gt;Paragon's Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;, which is named after &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Oaths. The extensive ruins of &lt;a href=\"First%20Orsinium\"&gt;First Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; are nestled deep within the northwestern mountains.\n&lt;a href=\"Central%20Wrothgar\"&gt;Central Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tundra grasslands of Central Wrothgar are the home of a number of Orsimer tribes. The &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Clan\"&gt;Morkul Clan&lt;/a&gt; are smithies by heart, pioneering the Orcish weaponry and armor seen to this day. The &lt;a href=\"Tumnosh%20Clan\"&gt;Tumnosh Clan&lt;/a&gt; are miners by heart; the &lt;a href=\"Graystone%20Quarry\"&gt;Graystone Quarry&lt;/a&gt; along the Wrothgarian border is where the Kingdoms of Orsinium have gained their stones, to build their fortress and strongholds. Graystone Quarry is the most successful mine, but there have been several other mineshafts located in Central Wrothgar such as the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Mine\"&gt;Argent Mine&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Stronghold\"&gt;Morkul Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; has a fairly active port that is located in between &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt;, two prominent harbors in the Sea of Ghosts.\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Wrothgar\"&gt;Eastern Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nEastern Wrothgar is the largest region in the mountain range, housing a variety of Orcish architecture and Breton strongholds. It is the home to a wide variety of fauna and the &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20Clan\"&gt;Shatul Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Orsimer, a nomadic tribe of Orcs that have a specialty in agriculture and farming. The Second Kingdom of Orsinium was located on the western edge of the region while the twin Breton kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Farrun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt; were situated on the northern coast near the border. The &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; are located to the east. &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Sorrow&lt;/a&gt; is one of the largest mountains in the Greater Reach, overlooking the entire region.\n&lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20Area\"&gt;Orsinium Area&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Orsinium Area is a region claimed by the Orsimer of the Wrothgarian Mountains, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt;. Nestled in between the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Kingdom of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and the Wrothgarian Mountains, the area was originally claimed by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bowyn\"&gt;Lord Bowyn&lt;/a&gt;, but Gortwog earned the region in a duel and established the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Orsinium\"&gt;Third Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; in the center. Minor settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Midpath%20Hill\"&gt;Midpath Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ripwold\"&gt;Ripwold&lt;/a&gt; also occupy the area, even though the Orcs primarily inhabit the region. The religious temples and knightly orders of the Iliac Bay have no presence in the Orsinium Area. The Third Kingdom of Orsinium expanded their borders with the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, encompassing Wrothgaria and the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nFauna.\nEchateres.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Echatere\"&gt;Echatere&lt;/a&gt; is the most commonly used animal throughout the Wrothgarian Mountains. The Breton Kingdoms of High Rock have utilized horses and cows in their agricultural pursuits, but the denizens of Wrothgar have used the Echatere for multiple purposes, making them more versatile than the farm animals seen throughout Cyrodiil or High Rock. The Echatere is a truly unique creature; their limbs are not actual feet or hooves, but instead resemble spider legs made of the same material as their horns. Their fur and overall body resemble a bison or an ox, yet their head resembles an elk with their horns twice the proportions of a common Elk. The &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20Clan\"&gt;Shatul Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Orsimer have utilized the creature and are known for taming the creatures.\nHarpies.\n&lt;a href=\"Harpies\"&gt;Harpies&lt;/a&gt; are a common sight in the hills of the Iliac Bay, from faraway &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; to the distant lands of &lt;a href=\"Tigonus\"&gt;Tigonus&lt;/a&gt;. Harpies can appear in flocks throughout the land and can be relentless when an intruder enters their nest. Harpies resemble petite women with the features of a bird, including talons and red feathers. Creatures with such features hold some sort of relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; of the Greater Reach. The &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Clan\"&gt;Winterborn Clan&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have been known to train Harpies and work with &lt;a href=\"Hagraven\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt;s. When the Winterborn had control of Frostbreak Fortress, the Harpies had built nests on the highest towers of the stronghold. Some Harpies have lived in some ruins like the great caverns of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Orsinium\"&gt;Old Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; and the icy caverns in &lt;a href=\"Coldperch%20Cavern\"&gt;Coldperch Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. The Harpy has their own little caste system with the leader being called the Harpy Matriarch. These type of Harpies are larger and have black feathers, separating them from the rest.\nSpiders.\nThe common &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; is found throughout the continent of Tamriel, from the perilous chasms of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; to the rugged hills of &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, and Wrothgar is no exception. Spiders are found mainly in the Central Wrothgar plains but can be found all over the mountain range, residing &lt;a href=\"Old%20Orsinium\"&gt;Old Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"Zthenganaz\"&gt;Zthenganaz&lt;/a&gt;. Large spiders come in winter white or jet black, depending on the area. When necessary, spiders may feast on the corpse of another spider or anything that is dead and rotting. The &lt;a href=\"Riekr\"&gt;Riekr&lt;/a&gt;s of Wrothgar have used Spiders as battle pets, just like other types of Goblin-kin. Their webs are thick and can ensnare even the largest creatures like the Echatere or even the toughest of Orcs.\nGiants and mammoths.\nThe northern lands of Tamriel have been the home of the &lt;a href=\"giants\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; for many years, living as far as the Western Reach to the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. Giants are a nomadic tribal-folk with both human and Elven traits. The &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; has been a versatile creature for the giants, who craft special mammoth cheeses from their milk and take their hide, fashioning it into the clothing they sport. The typical giant camp is a large firepit larger than any person. Giants have also used the bones of the Mammoth as weapons, fashioning them into clubs and spears. Giants are one of the few creatures of the wilderness to have their own language, &lt;a href=\"Giantish\"&gt;Giantish&lt;/a&gt;. Wrothgarian Giants are unique as compared to the rest of the giants found throughout &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. They have bluish skin and utilize both the Mammoth and the Echatere. They have an affinity for Reach Frost magic.\nChub Loons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chub%20Loon\"&gt;Chub Loon&lt;/a&gt; is a flightless, stubby bird found throughout the shores of Eastern Wrothgar, near the city of Fharun. Every morning, the Chub Loons can be observed honking vigorously on the cost of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Records of the Chub Loon had not appeared until sometime before &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;. The first record on Chub Loons noted that they disrupted the &lt;a href=\"horker\"&gt;horker&lt;/a&gt; habitat in the area and dug into their food supply. However, Chub Loons are simple-minded and do not realize a threat when there is one, making them easy prey. Not only do they make good meals, but their skin can be made into a hat.\nFlora.\nWrothgar is a diverse geographical region; the Central grasslands are very different than the areas bordering them. Beginning with Western Wrothgar, the region is a lightly-forested subarctic environment bordering the forests of &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; and the hills of &lt;a href=\"North%20Kambria\"&gt;North Kambria&lt;/a&gt;. The locals have used the tall pine trees and the wide hemlock trees that inhabit the area for their homes and equipment. Sedge Grass and Echatere Moss grow in the area, both of which are used in Orcish Cuisine. Central Wrothgar lacks the abundant flora found elsewhere in Wrothgar. The dry grasslands make the area less useful for agriculture, so the Orsimer in the area mine the earth, as seen in the &lt;a href=\"Tumnosh%20Clanhold\"&gt;Tumnosh Clanhold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Graystone%20Quarry\"&gt;Graystone Quarry&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, underneath the area is lush greenery seen throughout the Western Reach underground. The cold air is likely the reason why the surface grass is drier than the grass underneath. Eastern Wrothgar is the most abundant in flora, as well as taking up most of the whole region in land area. The Shatul Clan of Orsimer are known for their agricultural skills and have taken refuge in Eastern Wrothgar. Various vegetables grow here, including wrathberries and glacial tomatoes.\nGovernment.\nThe Orsimer's origins are tied to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Sworn Oaths and the Bloody Curse, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. And so, their way of life revolves around Malacath's ideas and sphere of influence, the Sworn Oath. The Orcish Strongholds of Tamriel follow the &lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Malacath\"&gt;Code of Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, a set of rules that the Orsimer have followed for many years. The Code is straightforward; it prohibits theft, murder, and needless assault. Most Orcish strongholds do not have a prison, except for the city of &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt;, which has one of the most infamous ones in the province of High Rock. Instead of imprisonment, those who violate the Code of Malacath have to pay the \"blood price,\" which requires that the offender bleed enough for the victim to be satisfied. However, the offender can also pay out of it.\nThe Code has the chief be at the top of the social hierarchy, operating out of a special longhouse. The women of the stronghold are made into wives for the chieftain, each serving a different purpose, such as the Shield-Wife or the Hearth-Wife. The only women exempt from this are the wise women, who are given the position of a shaman and perform spiritual healing. Severe situations are solved with violent fights, but those who do not get along with the chief are banished, forced to live in the cities of the outside world. When the time comes, a new Orcish warrior could challenge the chieftain and become the next leader of the clan. But at the end of the battle, one of them will die amidst the conflict.\nReligion.\nThe Orsimer are among the most religious people in Tamriel. Each of the Orcish clans has a rich and vibrant culture, but often disagree on even the most basic concepts. The Orcs believe in an afterlife called the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Forge\"&gt;Ashen Forge&lt;/a&gt;, comparable to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; for the Nordic peoples; Orsimer who prove themselves to Malacath may be graced with immortality and an abundance of food in the Ashen Forge. The forge is the central stronghold in Malacath's Plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;Ashpit&lt;/a&gt;. Every Orc is a chieftain, every chieftain has thousands of wives, and each wife has thousands of slaves. The Ashen Forge fills the endless space of the Ashpit, with Malacath's smithy, iron towers, and steel bastions present as well.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Kingdom of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; has been the center of Orcish civilization across eras. Two of the most well-known iterations of Orsinium are the Second Orsinium and Nova Orsinium, created by &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The first form of controversy in each of their cities was the established religion of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. The Elven deity of Trinimac was said to be the original form of Malacath before he was devoured by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. In Orcish society, there are two forms of religion, the Cult of Malacath, and the Cult of Trinimac. To outsiders, the religious worship of Malacath in Orcish society appears barbaric and unruly. The Orsimer see themselves as a betrayed people, and are taught to stand strong, yet alone. However, while the Cult of Trinimac still personifies the warrior-heart, many of its ideals are based in civility and unity instead. The Second Orsinium had established the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ire\"&gt;Temple of Ire&lt;/a&gt; as a place of worship for Trinimac. The forced religion of Trinimac was one of the main focal points of Kurog's demise.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTorug gro-Igron's ambition; dreams of an Orsinium.\nIn the First Era, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; traditionally lived in tribes scattered across the Greater Reach and the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, under their own sovereignties that ignore the strifes of other chiefdoms. The Orsimer constantly had to deal with incursions from their neighbors by the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Torug%20gro-Igron\"&gt;Torug gro-Igron&lt;/a&gt; of Wrothgaria once had a dream of a united kingdom of Orsimer, under his reign. As time went on, Torug gro-Igron created the city of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, on the border of Wrothgar and &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;. Orcs from all over Tamriel traveled to the Wrothgarian Mountains to witness this marvel of Orcish technology and to coexist with the tribes of the neighboring regions.\nThere is a severe lack of records indicating the state of Orsinium. Many people believed that the First Orsinium followed a list of savage rules and used violence to establish their dominance across the Bjoulsae River, which was somewhat true. Orcish historians claimed that Orsinium was a utopia, both peaceful and progressive. With combined clans pitching into the city, such as the master smithies of &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Clan\"&gt;Morkul Clan&lt;/a&gt; and the agriculture experts of &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20Clan\"&gt;Shatul Clan&lt;/a&gt;, it is fair to assume that Orsinium was one of the fastest-growing kingdoms. The Orcs of Orsinium have led raids throughout the Bjoulsae River called the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Raids\"&gt;Bjoulsae Raids&lt;/a&gt;, which was the collaboration of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Bagrakh\"&gt;Clan Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Igron\"&gt;Clan Igron&lt;/a&gt;. These raids had attacked several Breton settlements, such as the fishing village of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, prompting political figures to take action.\nThe Siege of Orsinium; Joile's conquest over Wrothgar.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Joile\"&gt;King Joile&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; during the Bjoulsae Raids and the rising power of Orsinium. Joile felt that this Kingdom of Orcs needed to be dealt with, and sought the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;, Joile sent a letter to Gaiden Shinji proposing a joint attack on Orsinium along with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, where the Order was based. It was during this time that the city of Orsinium had fallen under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Golkarr\"&gt;Golkarr&lt;/a&gt;. Golkarr rallied his forces as the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; began in &lt;a href=\"1E%20950\"&gt;1E 950&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict transcended the Kingdom of Orsinium, attacking neighboring strongholds such as &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fharun%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Fharun Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict lasted for thirty years, and it took ten for the invading force to break down the walls of Orsinium. In need of help, Golkarr fled to the Grudgement Hall in &lt;a href=\"Scarp%20Keep\"&gt;Scarp Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where he prayed for &lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt;. It was there that Gaiden Shinji and King Joile killed Golkarr, ending the Siege of Orsinium.\nKing Joile had planned to betray the Redguards as a part of his grand scheme of conquest. In the aftermath of the Siege, the armies of Sentinel were weak and retreated into the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, bypassing &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Joile's Army cornered the Redguard army at the pass, planning to destroy them before reaching Sentinel. Under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Makela%20Leki\"&gt;Makela Leki&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguards fought back against Joile's forces, defeating both the army and Joile himself. Sentinel was saved by the &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt; warrior Makela Leki.\nThe duel of iron might; Gaiden Shinji &amp; Baloth Bloodtusk.\nThe Siege of Orsinium was one of the largest conflicts in Tamriel. Many warriors from the faraway Kingdom of Daggerfall to the depths of the Western Reach fought in the conflict, either with the Orsimer of Wrothgar or the invaders of the Iliac Bay. Two such warriors who participated were &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Order of Diagna, and &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Sons\"&gt;Savage Sons&lt;/a&gt;, one of the strongest warrior groups in Wrothgar. Shinji and his group worked alongside &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom had acknowledged each other's talent in combat. Baloth Bloodtusk was one of the most respected warriors of Wrothgar and remained neutral in the Siege of Orsinium. However, the Savage Sons were manipulated by fake orders from King Golkarr to participate in the battle.\nOn the outskirts of Orsinium, the two factions fought one another, struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy. Gaiden Shinji and Baloth Bloodtusk dueled to the death, as their allies watched in awe. Lord Trystan knew of the sacred pact that dueling had held for years, as well as the Orcish Berserks of the Savage Sons. Joile had also hired &lt;a href=\"Mercedene\"&gt;Mercedene&lt;/a&gt;, the Beast of the Reach, to aid him in his conquest. Mercedene manipulated Bloodtusk into partaking in the conflict so that she could eliminate the two threats to her master's conquest. In the middle of the battle, Mercedene ordered her men to fire upon the combatants, killing them both. This act of treason caused the conflict to continue, leaving Trystan furious towards Mercedene. She was stopped by a Knight of the Dragon, and the two warriors were laid to rest on the same spot that they had faced each other. The art that had raised them to such godly heights was lost, their technique vanished.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanser's gambit &amp; the Orcish intervention.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;2E 563&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; was formed between the kingdoms of High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; was in pursuit of a bride to rule alongside him in the coming years. One of Emeric's original choices was &lt;a href=\"Rayelle\"&gt;Rayelle&lt;/a&gt;, the Princess of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser Branquette&lt;/a&gt;, who was the leader of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;. Ranser Branquette had claimed the throne of Rivenspire after several interactions with &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;House Montclair&lt;/a&gt; and his brother, &lt;a href=\"Phylgeon%20Montclair\"&gt;Phylgeon Montclair&lt;/a&gt;. Emeric rejected Rayelle in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Sentinel and Hammerfell. This was done to further solidify the alliance with their neighboring province. This enraged Ranser, prompting him to distance himself from the High King, failing to attend Emeric's marriage later that year. With the Great Houses of Rivenspire, Ranser amassed an army from &lt;a href=\"Oldgate\"&gt;Oldgate&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to destroy the Daggerfall Covenant and Emeric.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; began on &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, when Ranser's forces besieged the city of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20566%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; eventually ended in the Covenant's favor and the war advanced into Rivenspire. The last line of defense for Ranser's Army was at &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;, located east of Shornhelm. Ranser's forces managed to hold their own against the Covenant, so special procedures were necessary to defeat them. Emeric commissioned the help of the Orsimer of Wrothgar, who were under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;. He offered Kurog a haven in the Wrothgarian Mountains, allowing his people to live freely within the Covenant, in exchange for his help in Ranser's War. Bagrakh rallied his forces and engaged in combat against Ranser's troops in Markwasten Moor. Ranser was desperate, calling upon the undead to fight against these forces. He was surprised when the Orsimer attacked, and many of his men wanted this conflict to end but were hesitant to express their misgivings. &lt;a href=\"General%20Dathieu\"&gt;General Dathieu&lt;/a&gt; took the initiative and slew Ranser in battle, ending the conflict. Kurog and the Orsimer of Wrothgar had officially joined the Daggerfall Covenant.\nInvitation to Orsinium; Kurog's ambition.\nThe second incarnation of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; was constructed sometime after the Ranser Civil War, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;King Kurog gro-Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Kurog, along with Torug gro-Igron, had dreams of stronger Orsimer Kingdom, one that would rival the likes of High Rock or Skyrim. Kurog gro-Orsinium saw this through Orsinium, but his mighty fortress had yet to be completed. Under the guidance of his mother, &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt;, Kurog called upon the warriors of Tamriel to establish his rules throughout Wrothgar and the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Kurog felt that the old traditions of the Orcs were no longer a viable option in this day and age. Kurog established the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ire\"&gt;Temple of Ire&lt;/a&gt;, which worships the deity &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Oaths. The Orcish clans of Wrothgar had worshipped Malacath throughout the eras; one of Kurog's closest friends, &lt;a href=\"Bazrag%20gro-Fharun\"&gt;Bazrag gro-Fharun&lt;/a&gt;, was devout to Malacath, and opposed the actions of the King. All of the other Orcish clans felt similarly, so Kurog sought out a way to earn their trust.\nBreaking the Winterborn's Hold; Siege of Frostbreak Fortress.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Clan\"&gt;Winterborn Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; were one of the rising threats of the Kingdom of Orsinium for quite some time. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Urfon%20Ice-Heart\"&gt;Urfon Ice-Heart&lt;/a&gt;, was notorious across the land for having an affinity for Ice Magic. Many of the Reachmen had invaded the caravans around Orsinium, leading to several conflicts. All of it would come to an end with the Siege of &lt;a href=\"Frostbreak%20Fortress\"&gt;Frostbreak Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, the main stronghold of the Winterborn. The Winterborn utilized &lt;a href=\"Briar%20Heart\"&gt;Briar Heart&lt;/a&gt;s to enhance their warriors' combat abilities. The Orsinium offense therefore needed to kill off the Briarheart source. To do this, King Kurog and an entourage of warriors entered the fortress, delving into the Reachmen stronghold. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, two warriors called to enter Wrothgar, played an integral role in the conflict, burning down the &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; aerie in Frostbreak and poisoned the Briarheart Trees with the help of &lt;a href=\"Alinon%20the%20Alchemist\"&gt;Alinon the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;. With the main source of the Briars defeated, the Vestige and King Kurog advanced into Ice-Heart's Lair, confronting the evil warlock. Ultimately, the two warriors defeated Urfon Ice-Heart, ending the siege on Frostbreak and the Winterborn's prominence in Wrothgar. Kurog took Ice-Heart's Blade and presented it to the Chieftains of Wrothgar.\nDevoters of Malacath; raid of the Temple of Ire.\nWith the establishment of the Second Orsinium, the Orcish worship of Trinimac was enforced as the primary religion in the kingdom. This action was one of the many things that Orcish clans were opposed to, since they had worshipped Malacath for centuries. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ire\"&gt;Temple of Ire&lt;/a&gt; was created as the place of worship for Trinimac, despite the opposition. Forge-Mother Alga instated &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Solgra\"&gt;High Priestess Solgra&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of the Temple. It was no secret that Bazrag gro-Fharun was a heavy devotee of Malacath, so he was the topic of controversy when a rogue group of Malacath worshippers invaded the temple.\nA group of Malacath devotees had hijacked the Temple of Ire, holding the priest and priestess hostage until an ultimatum was given in the name of Malacath. King Kurog gro-Orsinium tasked the Vestige with subduing the Malacath devotees and securing the Temple of Ire. Because the front doors were closely guarded, the Vestige sneaked into the upper, hidden entrance, where they defeated several Malacath rogues and saved a Priest of Trinimac. The leaders of this group, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Fanatic%20Shurkol\"&gt;Grand Fanatic Shurkol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mazogug%20the%20Bold\"&gt;Mazogug the Bold&lt;/a&gt;, were holding the priest in the Temple Rectory. The Vestige was able to defeat both Orcs swiftly and secured the Temple of Ire for Orsinium. When news of this spread across Wrothgar, blame was put upon Chief Bazrag, implying that he had planned the sabotage of the Temple. After this conflict, Kurog sought to bring the Chieftains of Wrothgar (minus Bazrag) to the Scarp Keep, where a &lt;a href=\"moot\"&gt;moot&lt;/a&gt; would be held.\nTrouble at Fharun; rescue mission for Bazrag.\nKing Kurog sent the Vestige to the clan holdings of Wrothgaria, ranging from the &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Stronghold\"&gt;Morkul Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20Range\"&gt;Shatul Range&lt;/a&gt;, aiding each clan in an endeavor to bring them to Orsinium for the moot. All of the clans were gathered except for Chief Bazrag of the &lt;a href=\"Fharun%20Clan\"&gt;Fharun Clan&lt;/a&gt;. According to Kurog, because of Bazrag's supposed involvement in the incident of Ire, he was not invited, but a larger scheme was at play. High Priestess Solgra received an urgent plea from a shield-wife of the Fharun Clan; the Fharun Stronghold had been captured by a radical group of Trinimac worshippers called the &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt;. With this news, Solgra sent the Vestige and &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt; on a secret mission to Fharun. Through secretive means, both agents were able to infiltrate Fharun Stronghold and locate Chief Bazrag gro-Fharun deep within Fharun Prison. With Bazrag secured, &lt;a href=\"Ulsha\"&gt;Shield-Wife Ulsha&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the story and that Bazrag was kidnapped when the Temple was ransacked.\nPlot against the Malacath Devout; Paragon's Remembrance.\nThe mission to rescue Bazrag was meant to be kept a secret from Kurog's court since, at this point, Bazrag was considered an enemy of the state. However, when news about the rescue mission had reached Kurog, his wrath did not extend upon the Vestige. King Kurog informed the Vestige that Eveli Sharp-Arrow was now an enemy and that he was looking for her within the Kingdom of Orsinium. Worried about their friend, the Vestige sought for a way to warn Eveli and Solgra. They were given a message from Eveli which the Vestige encrypted, meeting with the group in a hidden room of &lt;a href=\"the%20Greedy%20Gut\"&gt;the Greedy Gut&lt;/a&gt;. To learn of the Vosh Rakh's plot, they needed to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Paragon%27s%20Remembrance\"&gt;Paragon's Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;, located on the western edge of Wrothgar. The Vestige, Eveli Sharp-Arrow, and several scouts entered the ruined fortress and learned of the Vosh Rakh's plan. The radical Trinimac Cult had planned to attack the Clan Chieftains at the Moot in &lt;a href=\"Scarp%20Keep\"&gt;Scarp Keep&lt;/a&gt;. With this news, the group rendezvoused at the Greedy Gut Inn, coming up with a plan to foil the Vosh Rakh.\nKurog's gambit; Duel atop of Scarp Keep.\nThe Vosh Rakh had conceived a great plan against the Malacath devotees. Posing as a radical Malacath cult, they invaded the Temple of Ire. Around the same time, Bazrag arrived onto Fharun Stronghold when the Vosh Rakh had raided it, capturing him in the process. The plan was to blame Bazrag and followers of Malacath, to further Trinimac's dominance over the countryside. Later, in Orsinium, Kurog discovered Bazrag's location and captured them as prisoners. The Vestige traveled to Scarp Keep to give Kurog the intel from Paragon's Remembrance but was first pulled aside by Forge-Mother Alga. In the Keep, she revealed to the warrior that she was the one who ordered the Vosh Rakh to defile the temple and to put the blame on Bazrag, to further the control of Kurog gro-Orsinium.\nThe Vestige managed to escape the wrath of Alga and rescued both Bazrag and Eveli. The entrance to the moot meeting was blocked and guarded by &lt;a href=\"Shield-Wife%20Razbela\"&gt;Shield-Wife Razbela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield-Wife%20Oshgana\"&gt;Shield-Wife Oshgana&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, the Vosh Rakh marched into the Temple of Ire and attempted to capture High Priestess Solgra, who escaped onto the outer roof. The Vestige tried to save her, but a cowardly archer ultimately killed her. With Solgra's death, the Vestige, Eveli, and Bazrag attempted to enter the Moot meeting through a hidden tunnel in the Temple. After traversing the secret tunnel, the three had arrived at the meeting, where Kurog and Alga were trying to kill the Chieftains of Wrothgaria. Amidst of the meeting, the three intervened and battled both Kurog and Alga. During the conflict, Forge-Mother Alga was killed by the Vestige, prompting Kurog to use powerful fire magic to attack the Vestige. In the end, Kurog was defeated and was given a proper Orcish funeral on the cliffs near Scarp Keep. Thus ended the reign of King Kurog gro-Orsinium.\nLong live King Kurog; reign of Bazrag gro-Fharun.\nAfter the battle, the clan chieftains of Wrothgar gathered and felt that Bazrag gro-Fharun should become the next King of Orsinium. Bazrag was reluctant, but accepted it anyway to set his people on the right path. With Kurog's death, relations between Orsinium and the Daggerfall Covenant had fallen to the wayside, but Bazrag was willing to re-negotiate with High King Emeric and his people. From then on, the Second Orsinium would thrive among the people of the Daggerfall Covenant, aiding their pursuits for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. The Covenant fought throughout the Cyrodilic Heartlands and was present in several conflicts, including the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Chalman%20Keep\"&gt;Battle of Chalman Keep&lt;/a&gt; and greater battles such as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Campaign%20%28Alliance%20War%29\"&gt;Imperial City Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second Kingdom of Orsinium was well-established throughout the Second Era and served the Daggerfall Covenant to the end. As time went on, the Alliance War came to an end, and the alliances soon began to dwindle. The Daggerfall Covenant dissolved sometime later, certainly before &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest of Tamriel, which started in &lt;a href=\"2E%20852\"&gt;2E 852&lt;/a&gt;. In that time span and beyond, the city of Orsinium was besieged through unknown circumstances. Fharun Stronghold had also changed drastically, becoming the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Farrun\"&gt;Kingdom of Farrun&lt;/a&gt;, which was built on the foundation of the original Fharun settlement. East of Fharun was a small jetty called the &lt;a href=\"Jehanna%20Docks\"&gt;Jehanna Docks&lt;/a&gt;, which would eventually become the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt;, another Breton city that grew into a significant kingdom among the province of High Rock.\nThe Breton expansion into Wrothgar &amp; the Western Reach.\nSometime during the Second Era, the Bretons of High Rock expanded into the Wrothgarian Mountains, establishing settlements throughout the countryside. The Kingdoms of Farrun and Jehanna were created out of this expansion. Many of the common-folk of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; moved into the Wrothgarian Mountains, becoming herders and farmers, creating townships such as &lt;a href=\"Burgshire\"&gt;Burgshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oxworth%20Hamlet\"&gt;Oxworth Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;, many of the Nordic and Breton peoples rightfully feared the rising power of Tiber Septim and became allies of &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;King Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; and his growing army. The new &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; advanced onto High Rock, establishing a provisional government in the Western Reach, overlooking Wrothgar and Bangkorai.\nThe Provisional Governor of the Western Reach was &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Alorius\"&gt;Titus Alorius&lt;/a&gt;, a man of &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; descent. The vast region was lawless and unruly, and travelers tended to avoid The Reach region due to the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; and other bandits. The Western Reach became separate from High Rock due to its unruliness and the lack of a strong government, except for &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, which remains on the edge of the Reach, next to the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. The Breton inhabitants of Wrothgar were able to separate themselves from their noble counterparts and adopted very traditional methods of living (i.e. making use of medicinal herbs rather than modern methods). Breton warlocks and medicine men had become indistinguishable from the Orcish shamans and wizards. The specifics of Wrothgar's history during this time is largely unknown. The Breton herders of Wrothgar were not as fortunate as their cousins in Greater Bretony; whenever their youth were accepted into a priesthood, it was considered a time for celebration. On the 6th of &lt;a href=\"Hearthfire\"&gt;Hearthfire&lt;/a&gt;, the Bretons of the Wrothgarian Mountains celebrate &lt;a href=\"Khurat\"&gt;Khurat&lt;/a&gt;, which is a celebration whenever their greatest scholars are acccepted into the Priesthoods of High Rock. Everyone would visit a church for a blessing or a prayer.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuel of honor; Gortwog &amp; Nova Orsinium.\nThe region where the former Orsiniums were originally located was a point of interest for the nobles of Wayrest and other figures in the eastern Iliac. The area is a pocket realm in the Wrothgarian Mountains, bordering the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;County of Menevia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Kingdom of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bowyn\"&gt;Lord Bowyn&lt;/a&gt; of Wayrest had a valid claim to the region and almost gained possession of it, but for the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt;, the chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Minat%20Clan\"&gt;Minat Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Both Bowyn and Gortwog had an equally strong claim to the region, so a duel commenced to determine the ruler. Bowyn, being the first claimant, chose the location, which was the courtyard of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Berylth\"&gt;Lord Berylth&lt;/a&gt;. Gortwog, being the second claimant, chose the equipment, which was traditional Orcish-style weapons and armor. At the end of the duel, Gortwog defeated Bowyn and claimed ownership of the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20Area\"&gt;Orsinium Area&lt;/a&gt;, where he would establish the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Orsinium\"&gt;Third Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; of Wrothgar, with him leading the helm.\nWith the help of the Orsimer, Gortwog gro-Nagorm created the Third Orsinium on the northern edge of the Orsinium Area. Gortwog proved to be a valiant warrior as well as a shrewd diplomat, establishing himself as a superpower in the Iliac Bay. Like his predecessor Kurog gro-Bagrakh, Gortwog had founded a religious temple dedicated to Trinimac, much to the dismay of the Orcish worshippers of Malacath. Tension grew within Orsinium; many were aware of the conflict back in the Second Era and felt that this would come back to bite him. Gortwog gro-Nagorm at one point came into possession of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, which gave those of royal blood the power to use &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, the Brass-God of the Dwarves that Tiber Seprim had used in his conquest over Tamriel. With the Totem and Numidium, Gortwog's Kingdom of Orsinium was recognized as an official Imperial province under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;.\nJourney to Aetherius; mission for the Mantella.\nThe Brass-God Numidium required a power source or would become useless. The &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; was the source of power during Tiber Septim's time, but it was lost to history, supposedly deep in the volcanic wastes of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The only other option was the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, a large, green &lt;a href=\"soul%20gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; that housed the soul of &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; of yore. The Mantella's location had been left largely unknown until the &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Mantellan Crux&lt;/a&gt; was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, the Dowager Queen of Daggerfall. An &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; acquired the Totem and was given a vision by Nulfaga to rendezvous with her deep within the Wrothgarian Mountains in &lt;a href=\"Shedungent\"&gt;Shedungent&lt;/a&gt;. Nulfaga had transported the Agent into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, where they retrieved the Mantella. However, a magical anomaly occurred, warping the west.\nUpon retrieving the Mantella, a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; had occurred over the Iliac Bay and the rest of Tamriel, which resulted in different temporal outcomes but allowed for all of them to remain possibilities simultaneously. The four major kingdoms of Daggerfall, Sentinel, Wayrest, and Orsinium, expanded their territories, absorbing the minor nations of the Iliac. King Gortwog had expanded his territory, encompassing the Wrothgarian Mountains, the Dragontail Mountains, and portions of the southern Iliac Bay, ideally the Bjoulsae estuary in Hammerfell. Orsinium was still considered an Imperial territory, but was recognized as the County of Orsinium in the Iliac Bay. Regions like &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt; were greatly affected by the Orcs of Orsinium, who were combating the Bretons of both Daggerfall and Wayrest for that territory.\nThe Miracle of Peace; the Warp in the West.\nThe expansion of the Iliac kingdoms did not come without any issues; the kingdoms, at the height of their fame and glory, had warred against one another, each struggling in vain for supremacy. Orsinium expanded across the mountain ranges of the Iliac Bay, taking nations along the way, including the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Mournoth\"&gt;Fiefdom of Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;. The Third Orsinium warred against the regions between Daggerfall and Wrothgar. Orsinium battled in a three-way clash against the Kingdom of Daggerfall and the Kingdom of Wayrest around the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20the%20Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Barony of the Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt;, starting a forest fire which spread from the &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Duchy of Daenia&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Ykalon\"&gt;Fiefdom of Ykalon&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; shifted the tides of war in the Iliac Bay. The series of conflicts occurring throughout the Bay ended within a single day. The forty-four unique nations of the Iliac evolved into the four kingdoms of the Iliac.\nKing Gortwog had continued to rule over the Imperial territory of Orsinium for quite some time, establishing himself as the King of Orcs among the Iliac Bay and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. This event would not be the case with &lt;a href=\"King%20Eadwyre\"&gt;King Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, who died from old age. Eadwyre's biological daughter, &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne instead of her half-brother, &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, who returned to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. Elysana's rule was different than Eadwyre's; she was more ruthless and was feared all across the Western Empire. Elysana and her consort had ruled over the Kingdom of Wayrest and allied with King Gortwog of Orsinium to further establish her dominance. This left many wondering what her next move would be, now that she had such influence over High Rock and Northern Hammerfell. The city of Orsinium would continue to rule over the Wrothgarian Mountains into the Fourth Era.\nConquest over the west; War of the Bend'r-Mahk.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; were imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and was able to reign in Uriel's place for a decade. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; which he split it into nine pieces and scattered across Tamriel; the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Civil unrest had spread throughout Tamriel, with the provinces having warred against each other, one such conflict being the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;. The region of Wrothgar was at this point undefined, and many settlements dotted the landscape or at least the general area. The cities of Farrun and Jehanna were situated on the northernmost part of the province. Smaller townships included &lt;a href=\"Dunlain%20Falls\"&gt;Dunlain Falls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Spring\"&gt;Cloud Spring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of Bend'r-Mahk ravaged the Western Reach and the area west of the Skyrim border. The invaders from Skyrim took the eastern-half of &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;The Crowns&lt;/a&gt; of the region remained in control of Dragonstar West. The conflict ravaged the Wrothgarian Mountains and &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. The Breton resistance against the Nords is located in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt;, on the northeastern basin of Wrothgar. Although the conflict around this area was somewhat feeble, it was more prevalent along the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, the war was not a serious threat to High Rock, as the major kingdoms of the province were warring with each other. The War of Bend'r-Mahk was more severe in the province of Hammerfell, where the Kingdom of Dragonstar was disputed and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; became the center of the Redguard resistance. The conflict started sometime before &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, and continued even after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;. The War of Bend'r-Mahk continued into the Fourth Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Third Siege of Orsinium; migration into Skyrim.\nWhat happened to Nova Orsinium during the Fourth Era is largely unknown, but it is known that the grand city of Orsinium was besieged by the Bretons and Redguards of the Iliac Bay. The Sack of Orsinium's defending armies consisted of the Orcish militia, the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Fifteenth%20Legion\"&gt;Fifteenth Legion&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Nova Orsinium was besieged, and many Orcish citizens migrated to the easterly province of Skyrim. Before this exchange, one of the only establish Orcish settlements in Skyrim was the legendary stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Cradlecrush\"&gt;Cradlecrush&lt;/a&gt;, which was destroyed a long time ago. Another was the Grand Chieftain of &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%20gro-Yazgu\"&gt;Yashnag gro-Yazgu&lt;/a&gt;, which was razed by &lt;a href=\"Hakkvild%20Yashnag-Slayer\"&gt;Hakkvild Yashnag-Slayer&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. When the Orsimer moved into Skyrim, they created several strongholds, including &lt;a href=\"Dushnikh%20Yal\"&gt;Dushnikh Yal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Largashbur\"&gt;Largashbur&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;. The Orcs were still considered citizens of the Empire, but continued to live isolated lives from the city-folk of Skyrim.\nThe Sack of Orsinium would have taken place sometime in the early Fourth Era. At that point, Gortwog gro-Nagorm would have been an alive as the leader of Orsinium, assuming he was not assassinated or killed. Exactly who was responsible for the sacking of Orsinium is unclear, but the only person with a substantial amount of control in Hammerfell was &lt;a href=\"King%20Lhotun\"&gt;King Lhotun&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel, who would have recently fought a conflict with the &lt;a href=\"True%20Crowns\"&gt;True Crowns&lt;/a&gt; of Elinhir. Regardless, the Third Orsinium was sacked, and a new one was reconstructed, but this time it was relocated in the province of Hammerfell, likely in the region of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;, which already has an Orcish presence in the area."}

Prior to &lt;a href=\"Update%2012\"&gt;Update 12&lt;/a&gt; (One Tamriel), Wrothgar was designed to be available to all character levels, with players being level-scaled to the zone.\nBackground.\nWrothgar is under the control of King &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;Kurog gro-Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; are rebuilding and reoccupying the city of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. South of the city is a patchwork of strongholds and wilderness. Eastern Wrothgar is a mountainous, icy region home to &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horkers&lt;/a&gt; and other creatures. This is where Orsinium is located. Central Wrothgar is a rocky tundra, with a very large waterfall spilling down into the lowlands. Western Wrothgar is a forested temperate region.\nThe followers of the Code of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; are distrustful of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;Kurog gro-Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; allies as their ancestors, the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed Orsinium many times throughout history. Simultaneously, King Kurog is sympathetic to a sect of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; worshippers who wish to do away with the Code of Malacath.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Wrothgar and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nWrothgar features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. It is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Wrothgar. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSeventeen Skyshards can be found in Auridon totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with two left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nFive books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Wrothgar and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

You will take up the guise of a local gang of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwatch%20Bandits\"&gt;Nightwatch bandits&lt;/a&gt;. It's our understanding that the Orc tolerates their presence as additional swords against the Reach, so there should be no trouble about you from &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, we have deemed it unwise to attempt to move any ore out of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Large shipments are likely to draw the Orc's attention. Instead, you will construct a forge and smithy nearby and put the silver you extract to immediate use. A coat of grey lacquer should be sufficient to disguise any weapons you make, and weapons move easily enough in and out of the Orc's lands.\nTake care about interlopers, however. Remember that the Orcs are not far removed from the beasts we fight, and in many ways deficient of both reason and virtue. It is more likely than not that they will disapprove of our purpose, just as their &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;self-styled king&lt;/a&gt; has, and with the increased aid the Orc has called for, the risk of interference also increases."}

He is the subject of several &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic myths and legends, and has become known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Underking\"&gt;The Underking&lt;/a&gt; or The Ash King.\nWulfharth was proficient at using the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, and his voice was so powerful that he could not verbally take the oath of allegiance required of him by the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt;. He is said to have died and been resurrected multiple times throughout Tamrielic history.\nMortal history.\nWulfharth was born in &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; in the First Era. He was chosen ruler of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; in 1E 500 by the Pact of Chieftains after the death of High King &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt; who was killed in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligious reform.\nWulfharth's first act was to continue the work of his predecessor in restoring the old Nordic faith, outlawing the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt; and reinstating the traditional Nordic Pantheon. This was followed by persecution of the Alessian priests, many of whom were burnt at the stake.\nMilitary deeds against the Orcs and Elves.\nIn addition to his involvement at the Battle of Glenumbra Moors, Wulfharth is recorded as having fought repeatedly against the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, \"shouted their Chieftain into Hell\", and then fighting against them and \"the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;\", who turned the Nords into children. Wulfharth pleaded with &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; to come to their aid, and Shor fought Alduin and Wulfharth learned the thu'um of How to Shake the Dragon Just So. However, he shook too many years out of himself, and died.\nDuring his reign, he was also said to have driven the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; from Skyrim.\nResurrections.\nWar of the First Council.\n With the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;fighting among themselves&lt;/a&gt; in the First Era, the Nords either saw an opportunity to regain their old dominions and invaded, or were invited to participate in the war by &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. The Tongues who led this war summoned Shor, who summoned Wulfharth to lead the Nords. Some sources claim that Wulfharth was involved in the Battle of Red Mountain and slew &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Dwemer, before &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; blasted Wulfharth to pieces. Other sources imply Dumac was killed by the Chimer warlord &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. The Khajiit claim that &lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt; summoned them to Red Mountain as well, and that Wulfharth shouted at the moons until they moved and turned the Khajiit into Senche, and rode &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Zira\"&gt;Dro'Zira&lt;/a&gt; during his final assault on Red Mountain.\nYet another tale claims that the Nords and Wulfharth were at Red Mountain to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Shor&lt;/a&gt;. This version of events say that Wulfharth made peace with the orcs, causing a large portion of his army to desert. In the climactic battle, Wulfharth had obtained the Heart but needed time to acclimate to its power. During this time, he and Voryn Dagoth faced Nerevar and his two companions, &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt; and Dumac Dwarfking. Wulfharth blinded Alandro Sul with a shout and slew Dumac, but was weakened by a blow from Dumac's warhammer, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;. Nerevar took the opportunity to finish Wulfharth off and slay him with a surprise side attack with &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;. Other sources claim he survived the Battle however, and was just displaced, being carried back to Skyrim. The same book claims that the Battle gave Wulfharth a lasting enmity against the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Akaviri invasion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; invaded Skyrim in the 2E 572, Wulfharth was summoned again to aid the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, either by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this time that Wulfharth began to be called the Underking, and disassociated with the Nords in some way. Following the invasion, Wulfharth disappears again.\nWars of Tiber Septim.\nThree hundred years later, Wulfharth is woken by the \"rumbling of the Greybeards\" and a chosen one prophesied to restore the empire of Tamriel. Wulfharth goes to the Greybeards and gets shouted to pieces, before heading to find the chosen one, &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that Wulfharth became the \"stormcrown\" of Talos, after a storm allegedly spoke to Hjalti in his tent before the battle and followed him above his head during the taking of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hrol%27dan\"&gt;Old Hrol'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, Wulfharth, now called the Underking, assisted Hjalti in the governance of the expanding empire, pressing him to conquer &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, the latter to further his hatred of the Tribunal. When he refused do so, Wulfharth left Tiber Septim's cause.\nThe Mantella.\nAfter Tiber Septim was gifted the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; by the Tribunal, he asked Wulfharth back, saying he was right all along. Wulfharth returned and was trapped by Tiber Septim. His soul was ripped out and possibly merged with that of &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt; and trapped within the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, or possibly trapped within his body, in order to power the Numidium. The now-functional Numidium allowed Tiber to complete his conquest of Tamriel.\nThe Underking.\nDespite no longer having his full soul, Wulfharth, now always called the Underking and conflated with Zurin Arctus, destroyed the Numidium after finding out what it was used for. He also cursed the tomb of the Reman emperors at &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, which was then sealed by the Grandmaster of the Blades.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, the Underking regained the part of his soul that was trapped in the Mantella, allowing him to die in peace.\nPlaque.\nA plaque in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, located outside the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;, is dedicated to Wulfharth. Wulfharth's plaque reads:\nWULFHARTH\nOF &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;ATMORA&lt;/a&gt;\n\"REIGNED &lt;a href=\"1E%20480\"&gt;1E 480&lt;/a&gt; \u2015 533\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Tongue\"&gt;Shor's Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, Dragon of the\"\n\"North and noble champion who\"\n\"defeated the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; and cleaned\"\n\"Skyrim of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian heresy&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

You want to live the life of a criminal, always one step ahead of everyone and pockets brimming with gold drakes. Maybe it appeals to you to try and earn a living by robbing some wealthy merchants or extorting your local shopkeepers? Let me give you a bit of advice-don't bother. For every skilled thief I've met in my day, I've seen a twenty who thought that they had what it took but ended up rotting in jail.\nBut if you're anything like me, you don't listen to advice. You do whatever you want and never let anyone else tell you otherwise. To &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; with the risks-all that matters is the coin. Sound familiar? If it does, then this book might just teach you the difference between acting like a petty thief and a master criminal.\nI know what you're thinking. Who's this Wulfmare? Who does he think he is telling me how to be a better thief! What makes him an expert! Simple. Maybe you heard about that heist in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt;'s sacred diamond ring went missing? Or perhaps the tale of an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; gone missing from the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; reached your ears. That's right... it was yours truly. I've done just about every kind of job you can imagine and I've got the drakes put away to prove it. How else could an ex-thief find the resources to publish his own book?\nNow that I have your attention, let's start with two of the most fundamental skills you'll need to sharpen if you want to make it as a cutpurse: picking locks and picking pockets. And before you roll your eyes and throw this book aside in disgust, I can promise you that the easiest way you're going to get caught is by ignoring the basics-but if you can master these activities you'll find yourself swimming in coin.\nPicking pockets is one of the easiest skills to learn, but you'd be surprised how often I've seen novice thieves muck it up. The lesson here is twofold. First, know your surroundings, and second, know your approach. Where and when you decide to go &lt;a href=\"The%20Fishing%20Job\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; is just as important as who you chose as your mark. Follow them a while, there's never a need to rush. Wait until they're somewhere isolated and out of earshot of any guards- but most importantly always know when to let the mark go. Getting pinched simply isn't worth the risk. There'll always be plenty of other marks who'll come along with their pockets full.\nAs far as the approach goes, don't drop into your crouch until you are completely out of the mark's view-directly behind and preferably close to them. Don't spend too long deciding what you'll lift either. A good thief should be able to hit a mark and make off with something valuable in less than five seconds. Last of all, plying this trade at night will greatly reduce your chances of getting caught. If you have no other choice and you have to do it in the daylight, just make sure you aren't out in the open.\n&lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; is an art form that takes years to master. The important thing to remember is that no two are alike, each one behaving completely differently. As long as you keep your wits about you, and your patience, you'll find them easier to defeat than you'd initially expect.\nGood picks are always essential. Make sure you have plenty of them tucked away in your pockets. Always take your time and keep a light touch on the picks. When the tumblers begin to fall into place, you should feel the pick tremble ever-so-slightly-this means you're near the sweet spot. Slow down at that point and only move the picks with the finest touch. If you blindly poke at the lock like an old man, all you're going to end up with is a bunch of broken picks and equally broken pride. As a last resort, if the lock is completely confounding you, there's always the option of smashing it. Just keep in mind that this is rarely successful and could potentially make a great deal of noise.\nBy using my techniques, I'm not merely suggesting you'll be a successful thief, I'm giving you a solid guarantee. All it takes is a little bit of patience and a great deal of practice then maybe, just maybe, you'll become as successful as Wulfmare.\nIn my next volume, we'll move onto another important tool in your arsenal-sneaking. I'll prove to you that the shadows can be just as potent of a weapon as your blade if you know how to bend them to your will."}

Every town I come across seems to have another legend about him, and every Nord I've met swears up and down that they're all true. Their fascination with these exaggerated heroes is charming, in a way, and I've found it an entertaining diversion to set some of the tales to paper, as I've never seen them preserved elsewhere.\nWuunding and the Mountain\nMighty Wuunding desired to pass into the high mountains, for he had heard rumors of a powerful &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; lord he wished to fight. The slopes were steep and the snow was thick, and he found it harder and harder to plow his way through. At last, he had enough of digging and struggling. He shouted at the mountain as loud as he could, asking it to shed its snow, but the mountain was stubborn and would not listen.\nFrustrated, he cleared the snow from a rock and used Tumult to strike it with all his might. The mountain rumbled with pain, and all the snow rushed past him into the valley so that he could pass. The mountains remember that pain to this day, so you must be careful when shouting at them. Not all can stand against an avalanche.\nThe Melting of the March\nIn the old days, a great frozen &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; made its home in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, slaughtering Nords and conjuring an unending blizzard. Like any good Nord, Wuunding hated Daedra, and he sought to free the land and return it to its people. When he tried to venture into the heart of the storm, he found that his body began to freeze, and he was forced to turn back.\nAs he wandered the edge of the storm, he prayed to &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; for help. Before long, he came upon a shack where an old woman lived. She invited him in, and upon hearing his tale, she produced a small flask. \"This will help you reach the Daedra,\" she said, \"but do not drink too much at once.\" The mead, the sweetest he ever tasted, burned in his belly, and he set off right away, immune to the magical blizzard.\nWhen he found the Daedra at last, they battled all across the land. The magical cold was like nothing he'd faced before, and he felt his strength failing. Without regard to the woman's warning, he downed the whole flask. He burned with a fire so powerful that Tumult roared with flames. The Daedra melted more and more with each strike, leaving steaming pools behind. In the end, nothing was left of the Daedra but the stinking puddles, and Wuunding and Tumult were consumed by the flames. The pools remain even now, a reminder of Wuunding's heroism."}

If accused of crimes during \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;,\" he will be moved to the jail of the Windhelm Barracks, known as the Bloodworks. After being exonerated, he will return to his normal duties.\nBackground.\nIn addition to being a member of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, Wuunferth the Unliving is aware of the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20Amulet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Necromancer's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, apparently knowing it \"well.\" He has never kept a journal, even for study, a fact which supports his innocence. Wuunferth has been investigating \"the Butcher's\" murders for some time before the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, to which he has noted a pattern to the killings, although without the Dragonborn's help, he is unable to know exactly what this means. &lt;a href=\"Calixto%20Corrium\"&gt;Calixto Corrium&lt;/a&gt; claims that he dabbles in &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Viola%20Giordano\"&gt;Viola Giordano&lt;/a&gt; will note that rumors have circled around him for years. Wuunferth will later rebuke this, saying that he in \"good standing\" at the College, and that they have banned Necromancy for centuries.\nPersonality.\nAs a court mage, Wuunferth expresses heavy interest in magic, unlike the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; in Windhelm, and, unlike someone more physically-inclined, Wuunferth believes that magic is the \"true power\" of the world and that brains are better than brawn. Viola Giordano regards him as a \"dangerous man,\" supporting his title as \"the unliving.\" He appears somewhat arrogant in this regard, claiming that everything said about him is \"probably true\" and that most of his research would confuse the Dragonborn. He also acts spiteful when he is turned against, proclaiming that the city has \"lost their brains\" and that it \"isn't over\" to &lt;a href=\"Jorleif\"&gt;Jorleif&lt;/a&gt; when arrested. Despite this hostility, though, Wuunferth is loyal to Windhelm and Ulfric Stormcloak. He is willing to do favors to Ulfric without hesitation, and is actively investigating the murder spree of the Butcher while the city guard are preoccupied with the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;. He puts aside his previous grievances with the Dragonborn to do this, showing that his spite does not blind him to his duties, and that he is willing to move on in order to save the people of Windhelm.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Hired%20Muscle\"&gt;Hired Muscle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible that Wuunferth is the target of a radiant quest for the Companions. &lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt; asks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to intimidate a citizen of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. It is the Dragonborn's duty to track down the person of interest and \"rough them up\" by initiating a bare-knuckle fight with them until they yield; killing the target while on the job will result in failure, although since Wuunferth is essential, this is impossible without &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;. Returning to Farkas completes the quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn initial investigation leads the Dragonborn to believe that Wuunferth the Unliving is the Butcher responsible for the killings on advice from both Viola Giordano and Calixto Corrium. He can be reported to Jorleif as such, to which he will then be imprisoned; the quest will end, with the Butcher seemingly caught. After this, though, murders continue, proving that he was innocent after all, and that he was in fact framed by Calixto. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can accuse him of Necromancy directly, to which the truth will come out that he was in fact investigating the murders himself. Regardless, he will tell that the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Amulet\"&gt;Strange Amulet&lt;/a&gt; was in fact the Necromancer's Amulet, and that there appears to be a ritual at play. He will then instruct the Dragonborn to survey the Stone Quarter, where he predicts a new murder will take place.\nDialogue.\nI've heard you dabble in necromancy. \"I beg your pardon? Necromancy? I am a member of the College of Winterhold, in good standing! They haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years!\"\nIf Wuunferth was imprisoned first:\nThe killer has struck again. \"Oh, isn't that a shame. And here I am in the Bloodworks. Looks like you aren't such a sharp investigator after all.\"\nConversations.\nWuunferth: \"What is the meaning of this?\"\nJorleif: \"You're under , for the Murder of Susanne of Candlehearth Hall. And Friga Shatter-Shield. And all the rest. We're wise to your scheming, you coward.\"\nWuunferth: \"Has the whole city lost their brains? I've been scrying and auguring to find the murderer myself.\"\nJorleif: \"Make your excuses from the Bloodworks, wizard. Get him out of my sight.\"\nWindhelm Guard: \"Yes, sir! I'm sorry, sir. But you'll have to come with me.\"\nWuunferth: \"This isn't over, Jorleif!\""}

Yngol heated the tears with lightning and then cooled them in the ocean, and the result was a great axe forged from Ysgramor's own wrath and sorrow. Yngol gifted the axe to his father, who named it \"Wuuthrad,\" meaning \"Storm's Tears\" in the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; tongue.\nYsgramor wielded Wuuthrad during his conquest of Skyrim, using it against both his Elven foes and against the &lt;a href=\"Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;. He held a legendary battle with the giant &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt; who had sent many of his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. During this battle, Ysgramor used Wuuthrad to destroy the giant's club, and then lodged the axe into the giant's skull.\nIn 2E 582, &lt;a href=\"Thallik%20Wormfather\"&gt;Thallik Wormfather&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; shattered Wuuthrad and used its power to fuse himself with the spirit of Sinmur. The Worm Cult tried going after the shards, as they could still be used to hurt Sinmur. Shards of Wuuthrad turned up in places like &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Prospect\"&gt;Lost Prospect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forelhost\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt;, which may or may not have been collected and used to defeat Sinmur one final time.\nBy 4e 201, Wuuthrad was still shattered into fragments, several of which are displayed in &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt;' mead hall of &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0until they were stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; during the Companions' questline."}
